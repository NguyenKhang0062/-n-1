2.0,8 January 2024,"This movie was bad. And I like low budget movies shark movies. The most irritating thing to me is that there would be scenes of people talking about what they're going to do and why for an unnecessarily long time to the point where you just stop listening. And there were a number of times they did this. Eric Roberts' character made me laugh. His facial expressions had me howling sometimes. The military characters were not believable. I expected the effects to be bad, but when it gets added on top of all the other issues I couldn't look past it. I laughed watching this movie, but I also almost turned it off many times because those long conversations were making me actually mad and impatient."
1.0,26 August 2023,"It's a full blown B-movie allright. Dont think for a second that the only ""star"" (Eric Roberts) is gonna save the day, because his star has faded long ago and he simply looks ridiculous trying to act like a tough military something.

I really meant it when I wrote that these are the kind of movies that they should pay ME for, and pay YOU for, just to go see it.

In my wildest dreams I cannot phantom anyone wanting to pay for this.

The only 2 good things I can say about this picture is that it has got a great title and a great looking poster. And I mean that.

But all the special effects are used up in the first minutes (which dont look impressive) and from then on it's just a parade of terrible B-movie actors in a story that is VOID of ANY quality or thrill.

To be avoided!"
3.0,27 August 2023,"Watch and enjoy the trailer, and save your precious time for something fun or enjoyable.

The Meg2 was awesome! Great cast, exciting suspenseful story and beautiful special effects. Nice actions and good pace... It's the Megaladon movie you're looking for.

This is one of those movies you wished you skipped. Even the people playing in it would probably not recommend it.

You can stop reading now.... but I have to fill the 600 words to save you, from watching this abomination.

Some alternatives are ""the Meg"",""jaws"",""47 meters down"" even ""toxic shark"" is beter, ""underwater"" was cool but no sharks in that one.

Enjoy your time!"

1.0,26 August 2023,"Eric Roberts looking all cloned up like he's about to have a heart attack or something. He should respectfully retire like Bruce Willis.

Man this movie is sh**""t; failing at trying to replicate meg 2. Its storyline is baseless, CGI effect is trash, the cast comprises nursery/intern amateurs and more annoyingly the whole team looks under-prepared for this movie. Almost like a volunteered probono act sorry to say.

In my opinion, you should watch SpongeBob SquarePants instead of this (My 2cents). Trust me, use those cents for something much more useful. Or play Need for Speed No limit 2015. Don't laugh, I mean this sh..."
1.0,29 December 2023,"This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The writing is atrocious, the acting is ridiculous, and the special effects look like they were done for a high school first year project. It's like the entire movie crew did zero research on any subject matter, military and shark behavior. The actors were obviously stumbling over their lines like they had no idea what they were talking about. I love all shark movies even the B type movies from the SyFy channel, but this was worse than anything I've ever seen. Bad acting is usually laughable, but that becomes part of the charm. This bad acting was like a bunch of drunk friends decided to make a movie they knew nothing about."
5.0,28 August 2023,"The thing that annoyed me the most was calling the Sailors who were wearing Naval uniforms, Marines. I served in the Marine Corps and although we are part of the same fight, that doesn't bode well with Marines or Sailors alike. I wasn't expecting much from the special effects or cinematography; and I'm not saying this is a megalodon't watch, but just understand what you're getting yourself into.

While watching this film I felt that the actors were having separate conversations while talking to one another and not feeding from what the other actor was saying. The pacing seemed a bit off with the dialogue, as though the editing wasn't tight.

As for the cinematography, obviously there were signs of being a lower budge film with the special effects, but it was better than I expected. I've watched films where it looks like they used a VHS recorder from the 90s, but this film was nowhere near that.

I watched the other Megalodon films prior to this new installment, so definitely felt I should give it a go and it's by far not the worst movie I've ever seen... being that I was able to watch it all the way through."
1.0,8 January 2024,"This movie is so bad it's laughable. The acting is atrocious. The effects are bad. But the worst part is the stupidity of whoever wrote the script or maybe it's the continuity or costuming? The military (I use that term loosely), are wearing navy camo and their tag says US Navy....but they repeatedly refer to themselves as Marines. These are NOT the same branches of the military at all and the terms are not interchangeable. Even if nothing else was bad in this movie that would be a big negative to me. Unfortunately everything is bad in this movie. Save yourself! Don't watch this movie........."

1.0,27 December 2023,"This and 'The Rising' are about the worst films I've seen, even 50s B movies were better. Writers of absolute rubbish like this have no idea on how to give each 'actor/actress' character, they all sound the same, shouting, over-dramatic dialogue, broken, clipped sentences. When a couple of women got together in praise of each other, it descended into a mutual admiration society. Drippy! Where is a bucket to catch all the syrup running out of the TV? The CGI was hopeless and there is a total lack of research into how the navy operates. How come we have a young-ish woman in charge of a battleship? PC forever! And ship names - US battleships (obviously IOWA class) were named after states; USS KING ? And who came up with that ridiculous name FRAGASSO? How much longer are US movie makers going to inflict such crimes against entertainment on us?"
9.0,13 July 2024,"Having survived the original attacks, the crew of the Naval vessel fighting the Megalodon shark discovers a research facility also under attack by more of the massive creatures and have even managed to capture one forcing them to work together to stop the sharks from spreading across the world.

Overall, this was a rather fun and enjoyable genre effort. Among the better features of this one is the exciting setup that provides a worthy type of over-the-top scenario that comes off rather well. With the exploits of the previous encounter used as a backdrop to showcase the failing ship's health and status brought to the forefront immediately, this one starts pretty well and gives a decent enough setup for the release of the other sharks. Dealing with the underwater exploration of the potential energy source and unexpectedly freeing it once they realize that the area was home to a series of sharks that get freed into the open ocean where they continually engage in a series of missions to get in contact with the creatures to prevent others from succumbing to their power. That is a fine excuse for the type of technology and series of prototype equipment that are put in place for the scenario to play out as everything about this is the type of over-the-top genre effort that makes for a fun time. As well, that also means the film has a slew of exciting and hilariously cheesy attacks getting the creatures out on the water and interacting with others. The recaps of the original and attempts to show the new creature attacking the damaged ship offer up the chance to see the sharks' immense size and ferocity with these sequences. Also helpful in that regard is the outright goofy scenes showing the creatures out in the world at large as they're shown taking down ocean liners, surfers, and ordinary citizens on the beach which center around the typically silly concepts and execution of the sharks at that size interacting with regular people. The finale, featuring a slew of impressive tactics trying to finally knock off the last sharks with some solid strategic points alongside the high-end technological advances trying to finish everything, offer up quite a bit to like here which gives the film a lot to like about it. There are a few slight factors here that hold this one down. One of the main drawbacks to the film is the seemingly obnoxious ability to continually try to dismiss the activity or presence of the shark despite being a straightforward sequel to the original. The idea of the shark being present in the situation following the creature attacking and destroying the ship earlier in the day during the original film shouldn't make the idea of there being more creatures seem all that difficult to believe yet this one has way too many instances of the sighting being dismissed by others for the implausibility of it happening. It makes the film feel far too cheesy for its own good by having something that monumental and important being written off simply for the heroes to be constantly proven right and even more so considering the events in the film's own universe. As well with the constant cheesiness of the effects and CGI being presented, these efforts are what end up being its main flaws.

Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Language and Violence."
3.0,20 February 2024,"Talk is cheap; so we get lots and lots of talk.

I'm a big fan of over-the-top sci-fi movies with ridiculous plots, bad acting and entertaining special effects. The mismatched military branch being represented, the rusted, mothballed, tourist ship that is clearly docked somewhere just adds to the entertainment factor.

The problem is they used to actually try to make a good movie and just didn't have the budget to pull it off. They couldn't reshoot scenes until they looked good so we got an early take. Now, they don't care, they know enough of us will watch whatever they produce, hoping for a low budget gem; so they pump them out as fast as they can.

These are the ugly Christmas sweaters of the movie world. Ugly Christmas sweaters were fun when they were inadvertently ugly and given as actual gifts that the giver thought was nice. When they are manufactured to be ugly it takes away a lot of the fun. These movies are manufactured to be bad and that also takes away a lot of the fun.

One key thing the companies behind these realized is few things are cheaper to shoot than people sitting in a dimly lit room talking about what is going on. So, we now get most of the movie taking place in what is supposed to be some sort of control room. With just 2 or 3 main characters and talking, lots and lots of talking.

I had some hope for this one early on with the sharks eating entire boats in one bite, only seeing 3 people on the entire ship and what even appeared to be people running through a brewery shown as people escaping a laboratory. But after so much talking, I literally fell asleep."
2.0,31 December 2023,"The opening is from Asylum, 25 years. When they started out, their movies were some of the worst, and with this movie, they have returned to their roots. Even the CGI is terrible, and today even a good high school film class can produce passable CGI. There is no reason to go into the plot as one soon doesn't care. And the less said about the actors, the better. If one thinks of a really bad movie and compares it to this, that bad movie starts to look pretty good. I am giving it two stars, because I know what I have given one star to, and giving it the same would be a disservice to those films. But those films were real amateur, low budget films where there was not a pretense of a budget. I streamed it, didn't have to pay extra, but I feel I am deserved a refund."
2.0,8 February 2024,"Asylum flicks were always cheap, but oftentimes fun nonetheless. This one, unfortunately, was quite annoying. Trying to exceed previous Megalodon movies, The Frenzy doesn't show one or two, but five of those beasts. Can't say it's 5 times as scary, though, when CGI never makes them more than cartoon characters. Eric Roberts stars as a captain commanding 2 ""marines"". He always shouts like a whole crew stand before him, but the next shot will mercilessly reveal the same 2 guys. They didn't have money for 5 extras in uniforms, so I presume Mr Roberts was as embarrassed as the audience. The same surely goes for the ""scientists"" pretending to read instruments while staring at an empty wall. Nope, this flick definitely crossed the borderline between cheap and ridiculous. In several scenes, characters just invite sharks to kill them and thus take them out of this movie. Although these, uh, 'heroic' death scenes make you cringe, one can't blame them."
1.0,15 January 2024,"You know you're in trouble when the movie starts with a narrator explaining to you what the movie is about. And even after the explanation, you still don't know what's going on. We learned that a US Navy vessel, piloted by Eric Roberts was viciously attacked, and there was a loss of crewmembers and the captain and big chunks getting out of the side of the ship, so why didn't they start the action when that happened instead of catching us up with a recap of the first part of the movie that was apparently never made? Did they forget to make that part of the movie and when they realizes their mistake they were already out of money? This movie is screaming out for little robot guys to sit in the shadows, making comments, which is probably the only way that you'll be able to get through to the end. I was determined to do so, but it became so stupid that it was actually a bit boring. Poor Eric Roberts. I kept thinking of how good he was in the Pope of Greenwich Village, and Hal everything I've seen him in in the last 10 years has sucked. If you want to watch a really crappy movie, there are much better crappy movies out there to watch."
1.0,26 February 2024,"Anyone who's ever seen an Asylum film knows that they are always very cheap and bad. This one was just stupid. And all you could do was just laugh through the entire thing. I feel very bad for Eric Roberts. He's a good actor, but why the hell did he choose this dumb a$$ film to star in? The sharks and their CGI were completely out of sync with the rest of what was going on in the frame. It made me laugh so hard, how there was this massive battleship, and only three soldiers. Where was everyone else? The fact that they kept screaming the chant for the Marines while they were in navy uniforms from the neighborhood thrift store beats the hell out of me. I think Asylum should've gone out of business when it first started so I have no idea how it made to 25th anniversary, but it still makes very crappy films. The fact that everyone was filmed from the waist up at pretty much all times was ridiculous. I don't even think they had a script. It was all improv and bad improv. The actors weren't actors; I don't know where they found these folks, but they should get better jobs or other jobs. Anyways, typical of the production company, but even worse than usual; avoid!"
1.0,3 October 2024,"Okay, are the ship's company marines soldiers or sailors? Where are the Marine's ""cover""? Rate/ratings if Navy? Did anyone at least call the Navy for at least a tip? Of the entire cast and crew did any of them see a Navy movie or television series (McHale's Navy) with one sailor or ship? Gilligan's Island with the Skipper? The Love boat? Any of them visit a military surplus store? Was this really shown at a theater or did it go directly to late night VHF and superimposed on my cable TV as a sick joke for me and my kids? Has anyone checked to see if this breaks any civil rights or could crimes against humanity?"
1.0,22 June 2024,"The acting is horrendous these are just some of the worst actors around the props are so low budget brown paper plastic explosives. I mean come on they couldn't afford some grey clay.

Back to the actors. If they didn't act the movie might deserve more than one star. There isn't even a reason to watch this movie you actually root for the sharks to eat people. I have yet to see an asylum movie that isn't beyond cheesy.

All in all if you're looking for a horribly rated movie just because you like to watch a train wreck happen live this is the movie for you. I wish I could say something good about it. But it is just not possible."
2.0,17 June 2024,"The movie sets sail with a cast led by the seasoned Eric Roberts, whose performance as a naval leader is, unfortunately, one of the film's few bright spots. Because, despite his earnest efforts, Roberts' portrayal lacks authenticity, leaving much to be desired. Curiously, he bears an uncanny resemblance to his grandmother, which adds an unintended layer of distraction to his character.

The casting choices for the female leads present another conundrum. Although they aim to play characters twenty to thirty years younger than their actual ages, their amateurish performances break the illusion entirely. Their attempts to portray youthful vigor fall flat, making it difficult to engage with their characters on any meaningful level.

The most glaring issue, however, is the film's CGI. It seems as though the special effects were handled by a teenager with limited experience. The shark attack scenes, meant to be thrilling and suspenseful, are laughably bad. The graphics are outdated, the movements unnatural, and the overall execution is disastrously off the mark. It's almost as if the CGI team was aiming for a retro vibe but missed the target by several decades.

Despite these numerous flaws, there is a faint glimmer of effort detectable throughout the film. The filmmakers appeared to have some semblance of a vision, even if it didn't translate well on screen. For that reason alone, I generously award the film two stars. The attempt to create a compelling movie is evident, but unfortunately, the execution leaves the audience adrift in a sea of disappointment.

In conclusion, it is a misadventure that fails to deliver on its promises. With lackluster performances, abysmal CGI, and a script that doesn't quite hit the mark, it is a film that might be enjoyed for its unintentional humor rather than its intended thrills. Proceed with caution, and perhaps bring a life preserver of low expectations."

1.0,29 December 2023,"I couldn't even watch even half of the movie! From a so-called commander, who could barely walk, to an important scientist (I guess that's what she is), who had more plastic done on her face than a Barbie Doll! As I said, I could not even watch to the half-way point. That's how bad it is. Then I went to reviews and saw that I hated it for a good reason... everyone else did as well. I'm glad I'm on my computer, so I don't have to sit and watch it on the big screen, and I could just click off. Maybe a four-year-old boy might enjoy it. As for adults, it's a big joke and waste of time and an insult to intelligence."
