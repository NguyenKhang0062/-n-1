1.0,22 June 2024,"There's something to be said about a truly disastrous film, a film forever indelible in your memory because it's so uniquely bad, it can only be deemed an achievement. The sort of film where everyone involved was definitely trying to do something; it's just not entirely clear what. Agent Recon is that film.

How do you mess up this badly when you have Chuck Norris? Chuck Norris deserved better than this. Not sure where they found that lead, but he is a complete buffoon. This film is an insult to Chuck Norris and deeply upsetting to his fans.

There is nothing good to be said about this film, except that Agent Recon is a good example of bad filmmaking."
1.0,24 June 2024,"Agent 1 was so bad I laughed. Agent 2 had me cringing. Agent 3 had me whimpering in a fetal position.

With Agent Recon, Derek Ting continues his hot streak of destroying his own franchise, his own career, and the careers of others with a laughably bad vanity project that is a strong awards contender for Worst Movie of 2024.

I feel bad for Chuck Norris and Marc Singer for getting put into such a horrible mess.

Watching this was pure torture. Even the CIA would not force prisoners to watch this. The writing, acting, and directing are uncomfortably embarrassing. The try-hard, goofy protagonist has no star power and his action scenes were total cringe. Each movie just makes him a bigger laughingstock.

Not worth watching, even if it's free."
1.0,22 June 2024,"When you write. Direct, and bill yourself above Chuck Norris, you know you're making a horrible movie that's soul purpose is to stroke your own ego.

I only watched this because I saw Chuck Norris and Marc Singer were in it, but there was no saving this disaster.

Chuck Norris and Marc Singer deserve better. I honestly feel sorry for both Chuck Norris and Marc Singer that they're in such a bad place that they now have to act in movies like this.

If you want to be an actor so badly that you have t write, direct, and star in your own movie, please do not get famous actors to be in your film. It hurts them and made you look bad as well."
1.0,22 June 2024,"I was honestly looking forward to seeing this movie mainly because of the one and only Chuck Norris. I was trying to decide if I should rent the film or watch for free on a pirated website. Of course chose the pirated. Sat back as the film started. 12 minutes go by and honestly I had no idea what the hell was going on. No sense of direction and the lead actor Derek Ting (who is also the director and writer) was just godawful and annoy. The antagonist was laughable. The random kills were hilarious. The editing was choppy. Chuck Norris was in the film for about 10 minutes and didn't do anything till the end which was honestly the good thing about this mess. Wish I tuned out after the 12 minutes went by. Dear Derek Ting, please never make another movie."

1.0,26 June 2024,"I had such high hopes!

Amazing actor Marc Singer together with legend Chuck Norris!

It should be a success!

Marc Singer did a fantastic job in the TV-series ""V"" as Mike Donovan back in the 80s, and Chuck Norris was one of the 80s greatest in everything from Delta Force.to Walker Texas Ranger!

In fact they have both done so many great things in so many productions since then, that this should be a walk in the park!

But, no. No, no, no!

The acting is just so bad! And I am not writing this as a movie critics opinion, I am just comparing to their previous roles!

And of course it is all due to the directing!

I love these actors and I feel so sorry for them having to team up with director (writer, actor) Derek Ting in this movie! Or should we say student film? The credits show only ten (10) people and one (1) voice-over. Also, the writing, lighting, cgi and music score all seem to be done to confuse and worsen the movie!

This movie is so bad that is...bad!

If for some reason you still want to see this, make sure you have very, very low expectations and you might somewhat enjoy it!"
1.0,27 June 2024,"I usually don't review films on here, but I had to voice my disgust. The acting is absolutely horrible. Chuck Norris is literally sitting still and talking like he is reading straight off a script for most of the movie. Then toward the end he stands in the middle of the open shooting a minigun he is holding, which is magically shooting endless bullets despite not having any ammo belt feeding it. Then he starts punching and kicking the bad guys just like any cranky 80-something year old man would. Almost the entire movie takes place in one compound out in the middle of nowhere. It is like some school kid wrote this script and directed this movie for a school assignment. I don't think the SyFy channel will even ever show this, which would say something."
1.0,29 June 2024,"I truly can't imagine why Chuck would even allow himself to be seen in this. The level of acting is below that of earthworms.

One of the worst films I've ever seen. Storyline is complete garbage. Fighting was so predictable and unexciting. It puts the term science fiction to shame by the lack of imagination and attention to detail. There's no unpredictable outcome that keeps you in suspense.

I fell asleep several times through this and will use it again if I have trouble falling asleep some nights.

I can't even think of other ways to describe how bad this was. What a complete waste of time it was to watch!

Don't watch this!"
2.0,29 June 2024,"Sometimes I like to watch movies that have a score of 3 or lower out of 10, just to see how terrible it is. How bad can it really be? I never believe a score can be that low and each and every time I go yeah that movie deserves it. I've seen a few movies like this now, and a lot of them have one thing in common that helps them all seem to be churned out by the same terrible movie factory. No it's not the bad acting , choppy editing, repetitive scores, even more bad acting and nonsensical writing. No, what they have in common is the protagonist, writer, producer and director are all the same person, instead of doing one thing well, or at the very least adequately, they do multiple jobs terribly. This may seem mean, but I don't think there is anyone else to blame, he took all the jobs. With only a handful of reviews it is possible that Derek Ting will read this, but really it doesn't matter because it won't discourage him from doing what he does. The idea that he can go around and tell people he's an actor, director, writer and producer irks me a little but what can you do? Irks me a little but what can you do.

2/10 because at least the camera was in focus and the audio was clear."
7.0,1 July 2024,"It's your heart out 60-year-old Plus martial artists who are still making films and we all wonder why - you know who! Here's Chuck Norris at 84 still looking good and it's amazing isn't it? Although not in the starring role and obviously not""his"" movie it's so great to see him after a few years and the movie itself is entertaining. Decent fights, decent scenery, decent story - what more do you really want? Good guys win over bad guys - gun fights, military stuff; earning really it's a decent mediocre action film. I don't know why it's not even a three - people need to quit beating up hard working actors and writers and give people a break and be more tolerant of other people's talents! A fairly fresh story, some fresh faces, I just don't know what's wrong with this movie I mean these are the same people that will sit happily through so-called celebrity reality and be thoroughly entertained and just a perfectly good action film like this. It just doesn't make sense to me. Give it a chance! And see this wonderful 84 year old man who has given so much to the entertainment business in what could be his last performance."
1.0,30 June 2024,"My son and I watched this because we are big Chuck Norris fans. We should have trusted the other reviews. Not only did the plot make almost no sense, it seemed to forgets on plot most of the time. You learn at the start that bad guys can only be killed with shots to the liver (so not a spoiler IMHO) yet most shots seem to be to the shoulder. Camera work really enjoyed lots of close ups over and over. They are in the desert, no it's forest mountains, I mean a cave, what? It just made no sense. Acting was average but hard to tell since lack of a plot tended to distract. Green screen was glaringly obvious, especially at the end."
1.0,21 August 2024,"I don't write a lot of reviews but figured I'd warn people about this movie so they don't make the same mistake I did and watch it. Thought this movie would be decent with chuck Norris in it. Turned out to be one of the worst movies I've ever watched. Acting looks like acting, fight scenes are cheesy and fake. The plot is terrible. I can't think of one good thing to say about the movie. Also, chuck Norris is in it for like 10mins and even those scenes are cheesy and terrible. If you are desperate for something to watch, I'd suggest watching anything but this. I need 35 more characters for my review."
1.0,26 August 2024,"There are bad movies, and then there's Agent Retcon 2024 - a cinematic calamity so catastrophic, it might actually be a secret weapon to destroy the art of filmmaking altogether. This movie fails so spectacularly in every conceivable way that it's almost an achievement. Almost.

Let's start with the acting, if we can call it that. The cast appears to be either lost or sedated - perhaps a bit of both. The lead, whose name I won't bother to remember, has all the charisma of a wet sock.. Every line of dialogue sounds like it was delivered during a high school play rehearsal - flat, emotionless, and laden with the kind of awkward pauses that would make a mime uncomfortable. And speaking of dialogue, let's talk about the script. Oh, the script!

The writers of this film must be lauded for their effort to cram every possible spy cliché into a single script. You want cardboard-cutout villains? You got them. Need a convoluted plot that even a conspiracy theorist would deem ""a bit much""? Look no further. The dialogue is an assault on the senses, filled with lines that are so excruciatingly bad, I found myself involuntarily cringing.

Then there are the special effects. Now, I'm not saying I expected Inception-level visuals, but come on! The CGI here looks like it was rendered on a Nintendo 64, with explosions that resemble something out of a 1990s arcade game. The action scenes - if you can call flailing about with no sense of spatial awareness ""action""-are choreographed with the finesse of a toddler throwing a tantrum in a ball pit. At one point, I wasn't sure if I was watching a high-stakes chase scene or an interpretive dance performance meant to symbolize confusion and regret.

Cinematography? Oh, you mean the shaky-cam galore that seems to have been shot by someone who had three too many espressos? I imagine the director told the cameraman, ""Pretend you're on a roller coaster... while having a seizure."" Scenes that were supposed to evoke suspense instead evoke seasickness.

And now, we must address the narrative. Or rather, the lack thereof. The plot is a disjointed mess, a tangled web of half-baked ideas and abandoned storylines. It's as if the writers spun a wheel of misfortune to decide the plot points: amnesia subplot? Check. Double agent twist? Why not.

Even the music-; if you can call this cacophony of random noises ""music"" seems like it was composed by someone who'd never seen the film and instead just sent in their worst nightmares translated into sound. Each scene is either accompanied by dead silence or bizarre, out-of-place tunes that do nothing but add to the general sense of bewilderment.

I'd talk about the film's themes if there were any. Is there a message about loyalty, ethics, or the perils of espionage? Perhaps. But by the time the credits rolled, I was far too exhausted to care. My brain cells were too busy staging a revolt after the psychological trauma they had just endured.

In conclusion, Agent Retcon 2024 is not just a movie; it's an experience - a horrible, mind-numbing, soul-sucking experience that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. If you're looking for a film that fails in every conceivable department - acting, effects, cinematography, script, narrative, coherence, basic logic - then look no further. But if you value your time, your sanity, and your will to live, I suggest you steer clear. This is not a movie; it's a cry for help."
2.0,23 June 2024,"This had potential to be a good movie. That changed when they cast Chuck Norris in this production. I remember his TV series from when I was a kid. Unfortunately his acting still hasn't improved. Despite his part being more of a cameo rather than a major character, he still manages to nuke what could have been a really great flick. I really like nearly all of the main characters. That was the only reason I rented this waste of film. When Chuck is permanently retired from film, it will be a day worthy of celebration. I suppose that until then, I'll just have to make sure I avoid any thing associated with him."
7.0,25 June 2024,"Yeah, it's not a multi-million dollar production, it's a small budget, very engaging action film. I found it thoroughly entertaining. And it's unique... in that it's not another ho hum, cookie cutter, big budget green screen hot mess.

From the beginning, I found the characters to be pretty cool and I wanted to see where the story was going. The drone footage is cinematic and the special effects are kind of crazy good, considering the provenance.

I've got to say too, it's not too long, so it's not going to be a huge time commitment.

Support an indie production today... they'll be making Avatar tomorrow."
7.0,7 July 2024,"It's a low-budget, action-packed film that's super engaging and entertaining. What sets it apart is that it's not just another generic, big-budget, green screen spectacle.

Right from the start, the characters grabbed my attention, and I was curious to see where the story would lead. The drone footage looks fantastic, and the special effects are impressively good for an indie production.

Plus, it's short and sweet, so it won't take up too much of your time.

Support indie films-they could be the ones making blockbusters tomorrow.

About the film featuring Chuck Norris, it's better than some reviews suggest. Seeing Chuck back on screen is a treat, and you've got to give him props for still being in action at his age. The movie's problems are more about the writing and production than Norris himself. I'd rate it 7 out of 10, mostly because of Chuck and the solid action scenes. The story was a bit cheesy, and it wasn't the classic Chuck Norris fare like ""Top Dog"" or ""Invasion USA."" Overall, it felt a bit weak and lacked the punch of his older movies."

10.0,25 June 2024,"Matt the face of the airsoft industry is killer as a person can't wait to see him continue these! Can't wait for more action packed stuff from Norris and several others to team up again! We needed more action movies and this is great! Everyone is upset over Norris being cast but a great dude! As an actor myself all the cast would be great to work with and a great time on set to be had!

All and all going to be a fun watch for anyone, don't just base you not watching on reviews they are just upset over who has been cast, hope this finds you all well and continue to watch even lower budget movies!"
