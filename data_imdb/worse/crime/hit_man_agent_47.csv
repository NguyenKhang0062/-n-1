7.0,28 October 2015,"Despite good casting, very good performances, more than a correct direction, camera work, sfx, editing and music, this movie is not excellent. It has no soul, as previous version (with Timothy Olyphant, 2007) did. Comparison is inevitable. This is only an action movie: a good bunch of action scenes and essentially a mindless fun. However, no character development or an explanation who, why, where, when and so on. Previous version had it all and if someone planned sequels (or a franchise), they should have done it eight years ago. Then it would make sense. Don't get me wrong here. This movie is not a bad one and the cast gave it all to make it entertaining. But for me that is just not enough, considering the template (video game) and possibilities to develop a good idea into a more complex and challenging story. This movie returns all to the level of the video game (maybe even below that). I think that these characters deserve more. So do we. Recommended for ""set-brains-to-off"" fun on a weekend afternoon."

7.0,31 July 2020,"Hitman: Agent 47 is a pretty decent thriller/action movie. It was probably not as cool as I expected after watching the trailer, but I still enjoyed it.

The story of course has wholes, inconsistencies and illogical moments, but if you just want to see some action and let it flow, then you will enjoy it as well. The main characters deliver and my rather small complaint would that neither of them are actual martial artists and as there are a lot of hand-to-hand combat, sometimes it was not as smooth as it was supposed to be, but still very watchable.

Recommended for action movie nights."
6.0,1 March 2020,"There seems to have been a great opportunity here to do something very Bourne-esque with the premise, but alas, it's just another average Hollywood action movie where everything is very silly, totally unbelievable and lacking depth. Still, if you just want to watch something with some action, then this is as good of a time-killer as anything else, maybe even more so if you're a fan of the video games that it's based on, although I suppose that would depend on just how faithful they've been to the source material. There's been better and there's been worse."
6.0,23 March 2024,"Greetings from the other side. I just finished watching this movie again, and it all came rushing back. ..

First, this is a good action movie, and it would have done better if it removed the bogus ""Hitman"" tag. Obviously, it was put there to get butts in the chair, and that may have worked a little. However, when people show up expecting something, and you give them something else, it pisses them off, and the reviews will suffer because of it.

There is an agent 47, and it is suppose to be a hitman movie, but it's really not. The first Hitman movie with Timothy Olyphant did it justice, and if you haven't seen that movie, I highly suggest you do. Agent 47 doesn't act properly in this movie. There is no sneaking or setting cool traps, etc. It's wide open action here, and Swartzenegger could have played the role.

Anyway, it's still a good action movie and worth viewing, just be aware that this is not your typical Hitman movie, that all."
4.0,23 August 2015,"One thing that bugs me more than any other about this film is the choice of the lead actor. He looks more like poor man's Orlando Bloom, and less like Agent 47 from the video game. IMHO he doesn't look convincing enough to play this role. He looks too skinny to be an engineered human being, bred for one purpose, to be a killing machine (just shaving some actors head doesn't make him an Agent 47). Wouldn't all those years of physical training be visible on his physique? Maybe I'm wrong, and he was bred for stamina rather than strength. The action scenes are very well done with some genuine WOW moments, but the story feels too generic, and plagued with the same problems like the first attempt on turning this video game into a movie (they just had to have a woman as his sidekick again!!!). If you expect a good action flick, you will be satisfied, but if you are a video game fan, this just won't do it for you, as it didn't do it for me."
6.0,26 October 2015,
4.0,11 December 2015,"It felt like the team that made the Resident Evil films- another failed attempt to turn a game into a movie - has worked on this as well. It is an Apple-style, gun kata, Matrix derived, James Bond cloning, CGI filled, Resident Evil sequel.

I wanted to watch it because I like Rupert Friend in Homeland. He did not disappoint, but neither did he blow my mind. It is clear that he needs better direction than the one time director Aleksander Bach could provide. Zachary Quinto does a decent job as well, considering the script. Hannah Ware is... cute and has a British accent. That's about it.

I could waste time telling you about the story, but it is rather silly and obvious. Even the twists, you see them coming from miles away. I think one thing only explains the film better than any review: Jürgen Prochnow gets less screen time than Angelababy in this movie. Yeah, I had to google her, too."
6.0,14 October 2019,"This is not a bad action movie, but it is not a hitman movie. Its not about a sneaky hitman. And rupert does not get the part right... This is not living up to the first hitman movie that was awesome"

8.0,18 January 2016,"This is a great, big, steaming pile of tripe on your plate, so make of it what you will. If you like it, I won't hold it against you. Personally, I thought it was insultingly stupid at times, at least when it wasn't completely screwing the original character over. When they started harpooning cars, I just threw my hands up and said: ""I give up!"" Please, no more of this. It. Was. Awful.

Mr. Friend, Mr. Kretschmann or Mr. Hinds aren't to blame. They delivered their parts with their usual professionalism. Mr. Quinto was okay too.

If you want to see a decent movie about Agent 47, watch ""Hitman"", starring Timothy Olyphant. That movie is much better and much 'closer to home', so to speak.

47 is an assassin, not a superhero, or even a hero, for that matter.

Just an assassin."
6.0,16 February 2016,"A straight forward Action Movie

I don't understand the low rating.. Honestly..

A postmodern bulk action movie, with a rather cold (cool) edge. With a lot of stock actors (redshirts), tons of bullets, car chases and a straightforward story.. Would make a great TV Show. Good entertainment with agreeable acting. Rupert Friend is a believable fighting machine.. All in all a straightforward, no frill action with no higher aspiration..

I did enjoy this compact gem..

Therefor I give it a solid 8/10."
1.0,23 August 2015,"When it comes to movies based on popular videogames, a majority of them intend to fail and get the fanboys of the game source to rave and rant on what's wrong with it and question why it was made. In this scenario, Hit-man: Agent 47 does stand somewhere near there, but it does improve on its 2nd attempt to bring the 'silent assassin' on screen in the best way possible.

The film follows an assassin known only as Agent 47 (played by a great and bald Rupert Friend) who seems to team up with a woman named Hanna (Hannah Ware) to help her find her father and uncover the mysteries of her ancestry. Together, they aim to take down the leader of Syndicate International, a terrorist group who is aiming to discover and create more deadly hit-man that process Hannah's unique ability and are more deadly than the assassin himself.

What makes Agent 47 so redeemable is the fact that it tries to improve on its plot and following the game source material than what the 2007 adaptation did (not to mention that the casting of Timothy Olyphant is mixed for me), it may not have done its 100% faithfulness to be label how game-to-movies are made but it's better than what most people say. The plot itself stays simple and is a no brainer to follow what's happening, but I did feel that the movie itself ran smoothly and kept pace in strong hold but the 96 minute running time is still considered short for my tastes (hopefully in future there will be an extended cut of the film that could help bring the film longer).

The casting range here may or may not seem recognisable but the cast do put on their best performance roles, Rupert Friend (from TV's Homeland) suits better as Agent 47 than what Olyphant's take did. Agent 47 is pretty much an emotionless, ruthless and yet cunning like in the game and Friend sticks close to that with good results. Ware makes a good impression as the female lead, playing a character that is searching for not only her past but embracing the future ahead as she learns more about her 'unique' side. Zachary Quninto plays a decent role as well though other reviewers say that his role was wasted, I won't give away too much but he does give his best on-screen role that's not a waste.

Pros: + Better plot than the previous film + Great performances from Friend, Ware and Quinto + Fun and well-set action pieces that are structured much well better than the first film

Cons: - Short running time, I would have loved to seen the film go longer and see itself expand into something unique- CGI may be clearly noticeable in some of the action set pieces

OVERALL: Hit-man: Agent 47 is a better but not yet best game to movie adaptation to surface in years, Arming itself with a great choice of casting, direction, plot and action, the film is a worthy watch on a lazy afternoon and it's a 'leave the brain at the door' so you can't take it to be full-on serious."
7.0,12 November 2015,"I'm very much a fan of the Hit-man games and was (again) shocked by the sheer ignorance in this film. Obvious mistakes and plot holes were apparent from the first minute; things like reloading guns only when it looks cool, guards with their backs to the elevator, contradictions in speech. Lack of a credibility of the entire storyline can be forgiven, since it's still a dystopian video game and don't we all love a dame in distress. The disrespect director Bach shows in ignoring the very nature of the games (stealth) and treating the audience as idiots is culpable. Most of the shots seem to have been made just to look good. CGI was not too good but unlike the rest of the film, functional."
7.0,8 January 2016,"Hit-man is about a bio-engineered hit-man who... what? Look. There are problems with the film's storyline. In the beginning, it bears too much resemblance to a video game where there is literally a tutorial mission (sorry, I mean ""scene"").

Then the film commits what I view as the cardinal sin of having supposedly intelligent bad guys do stupid things, although they do try to justify it with ""duh arrogance"".

However, the action in this movie is fantastic, and ultimately that is the context this movie should be viewed in. Within the context of bioengineered killers, I am absolutely delighted with the precise (though obviously choreographed) shooting where superhuman shooters dispatch of their enemies cleanly, never missing their shot - which is what I EXPECT to happen if you're telling me some guy is a highly trained magical cyborg unicorn enhanced murderer.

Given that the film is based on a video game, the action happening is consistent with the rules of the universe - no bullet feels unaccounted for by the film-makers.

Where the film really falls short is its discussion of ethics. Bioengineering killers for profit is wrong, obviously, because both greed and murder are wrong. However, while the film manages to depict engineered superhuman abilities as being sometimes worthwhile to have, the dialogue never once considers the possibility that enhancing ordinary people may not be such a bad idea.

Oh yeah, also, ******* Audi product placements. Still overall if you like it when a supposedly perfect killer actually performs perfectly, this is the film to see."
1.0,30 August 2015,"I entered the cinema with low expectations. The movie started off slow, and the middle of the movie was a bit confusing for me, but as long you manage to keep on to the story, you will enjoy it. This is indeed a good reboot, and it really has no sense to give this movie a rating of 5.9, while some movies who definitively don't deserve it's ratings get rated much higher than this. There are some clichés about technology, type of ""Press to hack"" stuff, but it's not the only one, is it? The ending won't be understandable for some people if they don't know something about the series already. Bottom line, you shouldn't come to the cinema not knowing anything about the series, you should at least know some basics to understand the movie totally."
7.0,22 August 2015,"I have been a fan of the Hit-man games for a long time, and this movie is absolutely awful.

The actor who played Agent 47 is terrible. The story is awful. The character of Agent 47 was the complete opposite of the character in the games.

In the games, Agent 47 is methodical, stealthy and calculated. In this movie, the character throws all of that out the window and turns the movie into a typical shoot 'em up. So much terribleness. The first Hit-man movie is much better.

This movie is so bad that all comments on the Facebook page are positive, only because all negative comments get quickly deleted. Some people have even had the audacity to say that this movie stays true to the games. Other than the title and Agent 47's suit, nothing. Terrible! Save your money."

7.0,24 August 2015,"The video game based plot comes to the big screen for the second time in a reboot, the first one that came out in 2007, which was okay. I'll admit I never played the game.

The plot seems nearly similar to Wanted(2008), action scenes are pretty well done, the film is shot in a film noir like style. Rupert Friend plays Hit-man Agent 47 as basically a human terminator, he does play it well I must say. Everybody else plays there parts pretty well. There are some surprises in some corners. But the film itself is enjoyable for it's action and nothing more. In a film like this you have to suspend a little dis believe, I never take it seriously, I liked it better then the last Hit-man movie."

6.0,22 November 2015,"5.8/10 from 28,215 users, I know it will be bad but I cannot help it I have to watch it~! I have grew up with the love for the original game. Unfortunately, some people like to take advantage of the fame of good games, and make bad films, pulling many original fans into a pitfall. I feel like a moth flying towards a fire will I get burnt?

6 minutes – terrible not even one game had such ridiculous action going on + 47 doesn't even remotely look like the original

8 minutes – another scene looks like a copy of John Wick (2014) but it is much more cringe-worthy

15 minutes – WTF is this s*** Aleksander Bach should be banned from the film industry the guy has no clue

51 minutes – I have decided to watch this film despite of the negative ratings, in hope that I can say something good for a change but I really cannot. It feels like a mixture of Terminator/Resident Evil/Matrix films, but only when you take everything what is bad from them

1h 10minutes – the main character is quite likable, even when he doesn't have much in common with 47

If I would rate it solely, on how truthfully they have presented agent 47 from the games, the rating would be -4 /10 Terrible from the beginning to the very end, avoid like a poo.

tgchan's rating: 4 /10"
7.0,22 August 2015,"Went to this not knowing anything about the video game, previous films, etc.

It was pretty decent. Nothing earth shattering or monumental, but competently done and a pretty decent action movie overall.

I gave it 6 out of 10 as I felt it was slightly above average.

There were a few scenes where the actors didn't quite maintain their characters, but the directing / editing covered it up pretty well.

Pretty good action sequences and special effects. It is quite bloody and graphic with a lot of killing, so if that sort of thing bothers, then you might want to think twice.

The plot and character development are average, but at least this film does have a plot and does attempt character development which is more than I can say for most films these days so . . .

Overall, decent."
4.0,4 September 2015,"I am a huge fan of the Hit-man video games and have been playing the games for several years. I could resist but to give this movie a shot because I simply love the Hit-man franchise and will support anything they put out there. The positives - this movie hit the nail on the head perfectly in some areas. Hit-man really looked like ""hitman"" at times. The lead actor I found to be a fine choice for agent 47 and had that kind of creepy look to him like in the games. And the moves, costume changes, props (including the silverballers and fiber wire) were well demonstrated. Some parts of the movie very accurately portrayed the behavior and attitude of Agent 47 based off his video game persona. I also have to say that in general, the movie was also well directed/produced with no major flaws and it fell like a well- budgeted film.

The negatives - first, the action sequences were a bit over the top. Being a fan of the video games, Hit-man was always a stealthy assassin. But this movie turned him into some gun-and-gun super soldier at times. Some parts of the film they did so right but then others they got a bit carried away with. There were definitely one too many car chase scenes (with some obvious Audi product placement...). If my memory serves me correct, not one time did you ever drive a car in the Hit-man games. Hit-man was always a character that went for his contract, kill who needed to be killed, and leave with a clean job. This movie is polar opposite of that. Besides the action, the story, although passable, felt very generic. Final verdict - I would say this movie is average at best, a 7/10. Part of my wants to like it more, but I felt like I wanted more out of this film. Also, I have to say if you are NOT a fan of the video games, well, I can't see you liking this movie too much, not compared to more superior films of it's style. With that being said, I did enjoy it and I would love to see a sequel made. I think if they continue the story things could get more interesting and better developed with this reboot."
7.0,23 December 2015,"Although it ain't saying much but the 2007 version is better than this one. And it's not only because you get to see Olga Kurylenko topless either. It seemed like they actually put some effort into the 2007 version of ""Hitman"" the movie. This one just seemed like a cheap attempt. Just about every potential in this movie is wasted, such as Zachary Quinto. The whole thing suffers from Paul W. S. Anderson's direction when it comes to video game to movie form. Except it doesn't stray that far from the source material. Audiences that doesn't know about ""Hitman"" video games will find this movie odd for negative reasons. And the gamers that know about this video game franchise will be left disappointed. Because the actor that plays Agent 47 does not resemble 47 besides the shaved head. And the way Agent 47 does things in the video game is very very different. Kind of like how Paul W. S. Anderson took a survival horror game into a straight up kung-fu action movie with bullet time and people pulling off ""The Matrix"" maneuvers. Watching this was like watching a crappy version of ""The Terminator"". On a positive note, maybe it's because this movie is just 1 hour and 30 minutes but the characters weren't really annoying but they are still easily forgettable. The hand to hand fight choreography was choppy but alright as well. However I was just checking my watch throughout this whole mess of a film, even though I try to give it a shot and see the positive aspects of it. I have just seen way way better action movies over this one. The whole premise and direction is lame and for a movie that actually made it to theaters, the CGI in this is really bad. Especially for a movie that made it to theaters in 2015. It's not really worth a rental, but it wouldn't be a awful rental.

4/10"
5.0,4 September 2015,"Way better than the first movie! by a long shot! a lot like Sherlock on BBC one with his mind been like a map. This is a strong fight back from the first one a few years ago, this shows what a Hit-man will be like and this movie makes its mark as a good one! it is also based on one of the games but upgraded and have a funny twist to the end, with the ending to the movie kind of putting it to a cliff hanger in a way where they can continue it or just leave it. easy way out if bad, or easy way back in if a hit! which i think a hit! If they make another movie they have an easy plot line from the end of Hit-man: agent 47 and his ****ter."
7.0,20 August 2015,"Hit-man: Agent 47 teems with spectacularly choreographed action scenes, so real looking you would think you are actually watching a real video game, like the one the film's based upon. But you can't expect more than that. Outside the territory of its gore explosiveness and visual intensity, stretches bare ground of pure dumbness, of pointless narrative entanglements, that is more often bereft of sense and tension, you probably wouldn't care to follow. It's ironic, really, when the film itself suits itself as a complex one, but barely constructs a coherent storyline to make us drawn and interested. It's an effort to lay groundworks for supposedly incoming conflicts and answers, but the thinly-structured backstories, more often than not, mess up during the process.

The narrative is complex. That's probably what first time director, Alexandre Bach, and his team of writers, want to claim. That's one easy thing to justify when you've stuffed your storyline with bunch of needless, if not poorly-structured expositories, but looking at it as a whole, it's basically just about a genetically-engineered assassin trying to stop a malevolent organization from making more killing machines like him. This involves going after a girl named Katia (Hannah Ware), who is actually the daughter of our hero's creator. In pursuit of her, is Agent 47(Rupert Friend), the last and perfect, of his kind, and John Smith (Zachary Quinto) of the international criminal organization, Syndicate International (nope, not the one we heard in Tom Cruise's Mission Impossible). Katia, herself, has been trying to locate her father, and that's exactly the information the 'Syndicate' hopes to get from her, so they could resume creating more of Agent 47's kind, a dream only Katia's father could help them fulfill.

Once the adrenaline picks up, deadly cat and mouse chases follow, and explosive breath-takingly executed fight setpieces roll out like dominoes, as if nothing can't stop them.'Hit-man' works fine with this set up, and those who only look for action of such seismic scale, should get satisfied, but for a film that actually seems to aim achievements far beyond just perfectly-choreographed violence and visually explosive setpieces, this film is a misfire."
3.0,13 September 2015,"This was a good movie and lived up to the hype and the Hit-man gameplay. Was a really good standoffish film and a good remake with a true to life Hit-man in a young actor who plays a controversial video game hero with a lot of grace. The film dies out in the end- but is saved by good action sequences that relate well to the video game. For someone who has not played the game, I still enjoyed the movie and am compelled to start playing the game- although it is a departure from the typical video game that does not promote such violence or gore. While the film delivers a real life-like Hit-man, it falls short in some places- or glamorizes a world that is too implausible for its own sake."
8.0,24 October 2015,"Hit-man: Agent 47 is an exercise in style over substance. Its reminiscent of a long running commercial with lots of highly stylized elements, glitzy cars, flashy guns, designer clothes. Indeed, even the bad guys headquarters looks like it was decorated by the sort of people who might outfit an Apple store.

The sad fact, however, is this is ""almost"" all that's on offer here. Lots of mind rotting eye candy and some predictable, formulaic action sequences. To be fair, some of the action is well executed but its not enough on its own to carry this film. The storyline is too simplistic and shallow and the characters of the one dimensional, cardboard variety.

My advice, if you like flashy commercials for, say, exotic cars, phones, computers, watches and other unnecessarily expensive consumables watch them instead. At least they are free (unless, of course, you succumb to the advertisers marketing ploys). Three out of ten from me."

6.0,22 August 2015,"Those who know the game series will miss the real Hit-man in this movie. Hit-man in the games is someone who assassinates, make kills look like accidents and who searches secret paths to get himself a benefit.

The movie however is just another action movie with a not so interesting story. The movie features lots of gun action, but nothing special we have not seen in other movies before.

There are a few fun scenes when shot enemies fall from catwalks but the most spectacular parts are already given away by the trailer.

The story is put into the background a lot and the actual enemy of Hit-man and Katia seems to be playing a guest role and is not a just worthy antagonist.

All in all this is a nice action movie that lacks story and tension."

some parts of the film seem commercials movie as part of garage scape

I did not like to see this actor the perfect actor for this movie style would be jonathan statham would make a perfect player agent 47 but the character's movements are well achieved.

in general this is not good! It has a lot to evolve even further ..is a film to see once does not wish to see again. In my opinion this movie has not overcome the first, if they not know to make movies make seasons based on the game at least would have more success!"
7.0,18 August 2015,"Hit-man games has been inspired and entertained me so many times. In this sneaking franchise, there are many, many possibilities to do superior thriller moments.

The first Hit-man-movie (2007) was big disappointment. The new... is also.

Every character are flat, action is boring and all the greatest and coolest stunts are made in computer! Why? God, why? CGI is cool when done right, but in these car accidents and jump stunts there are no reason to be rendered 3D-graphics. It should done real, like in 1990's.

There is something good though – the blood looks good and Hannah Ware has nice boobies."

7.0,31 August 2015,"I won't bore you with everything that went wrong with this film, but if you liked the 2007 Hit-man you probably won't like this.

Firstly, the casting for Agent 47 was terrible. In the games, he has a big physical presence and stealthy approach to his kills. In the film, we got a skinny dude in a Topman suit who is about as stealthy as a pregnant nun. The actor looks more like a 'Paul from accounting' than an assassin. I can't decide whether he was unconvincing as Agent 47 because of his look, or because of poor acting — I suspect both.

The action scenes/fights feel boring and generic. The whole point of the Hit-man games was to use your brain to kill without alerting everyone in the building. An all out shoot-it-out is entertaining on occasion, but not when every fight scene involves 0 stealth. I could have looked past this inconsistency if the fight scenes had been vaguely interesting or well done, but alas 95% of them were 'agent 47 spots enemy, shoots in head with pistol, then moves on'.

And just when the film was about to bore me to sleep, they'd slip in a raunchy scene with our damsel in distress which just about kept me from leaving.

Don't waste your money on this film, it feels low budget and has poor acting/action scenes from the get go."

No one had a meal, or ran out of weapons or ammunition throughout this joke of a film. Passports and visas ? Nah, no need ... the director takes care of that. The father, at long last was a damp squid with a strange East German accent ! I fell asleep before the end knowing I wasn't going to miss ANYTHING ... Oh, and in case you didn't know, it seems that all the cars in Singapore are left-hand drive !"
7.0,25 August 2015,"I'll be honest, I didn't go into this movie expecting much. I'm not a big fan of the Hit-man franchise because I've always been a story-orientated player and the idea of playing a seemingly static character like 47 never appealed to me. Since seeing this movie, I've done some research and found out my initial opinion of the franchise was wrong and I should probably give the games a chance.

Rupert Friend does an excellent job as Agent 47, capturing a man who is stoic and seemingly emotionless but also a liar. One of the cool elements of the movie is you can never tell if 47 is genuinely opening up to Katia (Hannah Price) about his feelings or whether he's just trying to manipulate her. Given he's contrasted, directly, against John Smith (Zachary Quinto) who does the exact same thing, it leaves the viewer with an interesting conundrum as to whether anything they're seeing from them is true. This is a cunning and cerebral 47 who knows exactly what he needs to do in order to get his target.

The action scenes are, of course, the only reason anyone should go see this movie and they don't disappoint. They're silly, awesome, fun, and bloody. Agent 47 can do the John Woo guns akimbo thing with the best of them but he's also capable of taking down people with piano wire or shoving them into plane engines. None of them make a damn bit of sense in the real world but, honestly, who cares? This isn't the real world. This is the world where the Syndicate and ICA are dueling over a cloning project's future despite having cyborg super-soldiers at their beck and call.

I'm not a believer that big, dumb action movies are automatically forgiven for being dumb. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a big, intelligent action movie for instance. However, I do think Hit-man is a big, silly action movie, which is something else entirely. It also benefits from a re-watch, yes I saw it twice, because 47's motivations are consistent throughout the movie but hidden from the viewer. I would very much be willing to watch another installment of this franchise with the same cast and hope it does well at the box office."
1.0,1 September 2015,"This is a B grade movie masquerading as an A grade film. Yet it doesn't make it a terrible film. The action is great and we would expect nothing less from the guys that did John Wick. Rupert Friend is convincing in playing Agent 47 but the role is not challenging and could be played by most actors in Hollywood today. He didn't take the opportunity to really own the role. Zachary Quinto was disappointing in this film, people expect better from him but instead get the standard assassin like character you see in all movies of this genre. The storyline is standard for an action film, It has enough of a story to keep people interested but no real surprises in what's going to happen next. In short it is a good action movie if you just want to sit down relax and watch some violence."
6.0,28 November 2015,"This is the second installment of a hit-man movie. I guess we all hoped for something better this time, despite the trailers obviously showed the casting agency worked even worse this time.

Once again we got fed with a simple, boring, pointless action movie. This might have been good enough for 3 points out of ten. Considering the franchise and all the story and character development that was done over the years, its a complete disappointment.

Makes you wonder why they buy the rights to the franchise and make a movie. It should at least please the fan base, instead its a worthless piece of trash to anyone.

But to be less of a fan-boy, even in its prime scenes its hardly mediocre. the storyline is pure bull and the actors can't be considered acting. All bad, Uwe Boll bad, maybe even worse."

5.0,30 October 2015,"Truly entertaining piece of movie filled with great performances and great directory. The action scenes felt refreshing and simply unique. The overall pacing was perfect, which is hard to find in modern action flicks. The storyline while not too elaborate, felt satisfying and complete. No redundant dramatic moments were present, and the ones who had, had their place. Even if it didn't show the true essence of the agent presented it its eponymous gaming franchise, it is only because it didn't intend to. An adaptation is what it is; an adaptation. I.e. The director has all the right to present his own vision of the character and the plot. Really cannot grasp the concept of overlooking and degrading a movie due to some external aspect rather than its true core. Tl:Dr don't listen to a mob of sad 15 year-olds and watch the movie."
7.0,21 August 2015,"Like drinking Kool Aid without sugar.

The only thing I knew about Hit-man: Agent 47 is that it's based on the video game which I have played a few times, is the squeal to a movie so bad, I've only seen once and what the trailer showed me which was everything.

If you see the trailer than you know everything about the movie. The entire plot and all the twist and turns are actually in the trailer which makes no sense.

That should not bother me that much after all it's an action movie. You can forgive the trailer telling the whole story of the movie if the action was tight.

It was not. It was like Agent 47 was trying to shoot me from a foot away while I was standing still, and missed every time. Well, to be fair, not every time. Agent 47 had one or two ""oh snap"" moments, but considering the movie was littered with what was suppose to be super cool stylish action sequences, one or two is not gonna cut it.

Zachary Quito was pretty cool in this movie. Makes me feel bad that this is all he could get after Star Trek. Although I have to say I've seen him do better battle scenes as Mr. Spock than I've seen with this movie.

So, Agent 47 could have been a more Sci-fi driven, superhero influenced Taken, but it's not worthy to lick Liam Neeson boots

Catch it on Netflix if there is nothing else to watch."

This is my first review and i have no idea how it will be.

Re-watching the movie again,both actually,got me thinking that in the first part,Agent 47 was so bad a** and tough looking guy compared to the new one. That is actually why i gave 10 stars to the first and only 4 to the sequel.

Now can someone tell/explain me why they changed the actor of Agent 47 ?

Thanks Cheers"

6.0,27 August 2015,"An assassin teams up with a woman to help her find her father and uncover the mysteries of her ancestry. ...no, really, that's it. Well, there are twists, and it doesn't do everything you think it might. But much like the IOI games, this has little plot, focusing instead on extensive backstory. And at least it isn't the overly complicated mess of the '07 film, which this handily beats in all respects, keeping a few elements from it.

This has a surprising amount of character moments. Interactions and when they're alone. 47(Friend, detached from what he does feel, in control of the situation and not shy about it. He pulls off the baldness without it looking chemo and his face is ""plain"", not Hollywood, so he could disappear into a crowd. Or could, if he had hair), is entirely by himself. By necessity. And desire? Katia(Ware, keeping her distance, owning her anxiety and using what it to comes from to her advantage) may have been abandoned, and is driven to find out why, yet is a strong, independent woman. They compliment each other, rather than her being towed along. The others, I shouldn't give away. The genetic tampering allows bringing up the old determinism vs. free will debate, and the ethics of the practice itself. Is this too dumb to take those on? Otherwise, yes. And it owns it.

The action is elegant, choreographed, often OTT and ridiculous. A stronger, faster and smarter human, trained from childhood to kill, creatively taking on dozens of literally faceless goons? That is exactly the direction to go with it! She has incredible memory, instincts, intuition and senses. He's in his red tie, black suit, white shirt, and uses his R93 Blaser sniper, his dual silver .45s, his knives, melee and tactics. And it is glorious. The first third of this feels like The Terminator, with our titular hero as the T800! This is stylish, slick and badass.

There is a ton of bloody, violent and disturbing content, a little gore and strong language. I recommend this to anyone who wants to turn their brain off, and I mean, fully off, and enjoy themselves. Fan or not of the decade and a half old franchise? You'll grin through it either way. Doesn't matter whether you know the material, or not even like it. 8/10"

But I found some disappointing in this film it was not good as it's predecessor was though it concentrated on more action than that but still it cannot cross the original...

I found some good thing also as the film's length was only 90 minutes so it was OK and theu adjusted action some how so it was good as they were not wasting time on silly scenes and all....

Action was good no doubt but the thrill ness which the first one delivered this hasn't so I gave 6/10 to this... but it is not bad....it's above average.."

6.0,5 September 2015,"I Went to see this movie expecting it not to be good but also not to be as bad and most of people that I talked to review it to me. I've played the 2 last games of Hit-man sequel and can't find almost anything to relate the movie to the games and that was a one of the negative parts of the movie.

I missed silent kills thru all the movie but if this movie was a complete separated movie from the name ""Hit-man"" it would turn out to be a great movie with great action (could had more). In conclusion it is a bad movie about the game sequel itself and a good movie for those who are not Hit-man fans."
1.0,26 August 2015,
6.0,1 January 2016,"As with the first 'Hitman' movie, this one falls into the same trap. It's all over the top, constant action. Now, that's all well and good if you're into that sort of thing, but anyone going into these movies as fans of the games, prepare to be extremely disappointed. The entire point of the series of games was to remain unseen, only engage people when necessary, get in, eliminate the target, and get out again with minimal fuss. This (and the first) movie are the exact opposite. Obviously a ploy by the makers to cash in on the name and make a cheap buck off of fans of the games. Don't even get me started on the awful casting and the fact they couldn't even make 47 look completely bald, rather than just the shaved head look...

It's another 'Resident Evil' situation, for me. Instead of the taut, tense horror/thriller, we got CGI, over the top nonsense with zombies thrown in. They acquire the rights to these titles and make the worst possible movie versions.

Fassbender is up next in Assassin's Creed, at least he already brings some credibility to it, I hope they stay true to the source material, by God they need to."
1.0,4 December 2015,"This is the second version, or we could say the reboot after the 2007 film did not receive well. This should have been a franchisee with at least 3-4 films by now. It's very clear that something is not working out for it. As for this film, there are several issues. But fairly did at the box office, which is poor for an action film like this. From the director who had never worked on any project before and the writers with good experiences.

The money was well spent, the production quality was so good, then what is the trouble? Well, my first point out is the casting. Preferably someone top star who can pull the crowd into the cinema halls. Perhaps Jason Statham would have been a better choice, after Paul Walter's death who was suppose to play the lead. I'm not denying, but Rupert Friend was very good in the replace. But my point is there's no star value in this project, especially for the foreign markets, these lead stars are the strangers.

The other drawbacks are, this film rated R, which is utterly pointless. Because there are no kisses, no sexy outfits, or drugs consumption, but only violence and gore which are mostly CGI works. Could you believe what the films are turned out to be nowadays. LOL. Though, I enjoyed the action sequences, so I can't thumb down and it does not enough to me to thumb up as well. Decent story with a speedy narration. Definitely an average film. Never seen Singapore better than in this film before. You could watch it for the time-pass and for the stunts, or in a situation when there are no other options available.

7.0,24 November 2015,
4.0,28 December 2021,"This film had amazing cinematography, excellent choreography, and I loved the over-abundance of mindless action, but one of the problems is the mis-casting of Rupert Friend, who imo, was the flattest, boring, and unconvincing action character I've ever seen. I kept visualizing him as a bald Mr. Bean, but Mr. Bean being the better action character. I'm sure part blame goes to the inexperience leading to failure of Aleksander Bach directing his cast properly, although for an amateur first-time filmmaker, his directing (especially the action) was very impressive - almost Michael Bay-ish. But the biggest problem with this film, was the convoluted, misguided, soulless, and muddled screenplay. Add the terrible editing - with scenes popping in and out of nowhere (who was the guy on the ground mid-end credits that opened his eyes, and why?). The score was spot on and most of the casting and performances were on point, especially the easy-on-the-eyes firecracker smokeshow Hannah Ware. Had this film had a once-over by seasoned filmmakers - even as consultants, it could've been the Polish/British John Wick. Nevertheless, I still enjoyed it, especially the action, and thus giving this one a 7/10."
9.0,23 August 2015,"I saw Agent 47 last night and my reaction was meh at best. I am assuming the people who have made the Hit-man movies never actually played the game, or chose to use the tired Hollywood formula instead of creating a worthy adaptation! In the game, 47 is a cold-blooded ruthless assassin without feelings or morals. He receives his assignments and executes them flawlessly. He doesn't warm up to clichéd female characters, he doesn't attempt to justify why he is doing what he does, and he doesn't carry human baggage. He is supposed to be stealthy, sneaky, and efficient. Instead, Hollywood attempts to make him the Jason Bourne of the assassin world, which strays too far from the source material. Until Hollywood realizes that not EVERY movie has to contain an empowered female character and a moral justification for the anti-hero's actions -- we will continue to get substandard productions such as this. This movie has its entertaining moments, but fall far short of being an actual Hit-man film and ends up being a mindless B-Movie at best."

Agent 47 (Friend) is the most advanced result but someone wants to improve upon him. His mission is to stop anyone from finding the formula, at any cost. I have to start by saying I was not a fan of the original Hit-man movie and was a little hesitant about watching this one. I will admit that this one was better then the old one. On the other hand the story wasn't all that exciting and when the action wasn't happening it started to drag a little. The action was really exciting and inventive in some areas and the movie is worth watching for that but it just needed less time in between the excitement to keep it moving. Overall, better then the first one but still doesn't hit the same excitement as the video game series does. Much like the Fantastic Four series this is one franchise that they just can't seem to get right. I give it a C+."
6.0,16 December 2015,"First of all: the movie has very very little in common with the game. Above all: where are the scenes which contain the MAIN idea of the game: dress up as another person and walk through security areas being unrecognized? There is one scene which is about 10 seconds long, that's all. If you played Hit-man: Codename 47 then you have a completely different atmosphere in the game than in this movie.I played all Hit-man games and would really wish that some director would make a Hit-man movie worth this legendary game-series. Nothing about this movie is even average. I am honestly speechless... maybe after some beer this movie might be watchable as a standalone trash-movie, thats all.

Well, i think it's time to listen now to the real Hitman:Codename47 soundtrack in order to shake away all this 96-min.-disappointment"

1.0,14 December 2022,"Stunning and gripping story with plenty of noisy action , crossfire , spectacular fights in a comic-book style . In this videogame adaptation Agent 47 centers on an elite assassin (Rupert Friend) who was genetically engineered from conception to be the perfect killing machine, and is known only by the last two digits on the barcode tattooed on the back of his neck , holding a lethal capacity . He is the culmination of decades of research and forty-six earlier Agent clones -- endowing him with unprecedented strength, speed, stamina and intelligence . Agent 47 will find himself dragged into an impossible mission . Teaming up with a young woman Katia (Hannah Ware) who atttempts to find her missing father (Ciaran Hinds) and she may hold the secret to overcoming their powerful and clandestine enemies, 47 confronts stunning revelations about his own origins and squares off in an epic battle with his deadliest foe. As he is on the run and going after a powerful international organization , as he is the target of hit men : an army of genetically built killers on his trail and everywhere . An assassin is embroiled in twisted conspiracy involving ruhless murderers as he teams up with a woman to help her find her father and uncover the mysteries of her ancestry. The legendary hitman will be forced to unearth his meticulously concealed identity and to carry out a relentless manhunt . Your number is up !. Every Action Has Consequences !.

Ultra-violent follow-up with lots of killings , thrills , noisy action with overwhelming escaping , car pursuits , suspense , shootouts and high body-count . In the original Hitman (2017) the genetically manufactured assassin was played by Timothy Olyphant, here's played by Rupert Friend giving a cold and hieratic acting . This thrilling and nail-biting second installment in Hitman saga displays violent combats and very high body-count , as our starring going after a mega-corporation that plans to unlock the secret of Agent 47's past to create an army of killers whose powers surpass even his own , as he will immediately unleash a carefully orchestrated maelstrom of destruction against those attempt to chase him. It's an action-packed film with an interesting mingle of suspense , scientific investigation and bloody combats . There're coold credit sequences , but beyond that ¨Hitman : Agent 47¨ doesn't make much sense and is laden with clunky dialogue , unpersuasive interpretation , old six-gun stand -offs and tired , known set pieces in ¨Keanu Reeves' John Wick¨style. The plot is simple and plain , as Agent 47 being forced into action to save his life and steadily butchering his merciless enemies , while inching ever closer to the long-awaited final confrontation at the enemy headquarter . It's a mindless but enjoyable for thrillers and martial arts aficionados of the old style , but adding some new technical being made by means of digital computer generator as well as expert stunts . Of course , highlights of the film are the breathtaking and groundbreaking confrontations with lots of blood dropping here and there . The serious Rupert Friend is nice as agent 47 , the expert assassin , a taciturn and pitiless man who'll stop at nothing - at whatever cost- to get his purports . He's well accompanied by a good cast , such as : Hanna Ware , Thomas Kretschmann , Ciaran Hinds , Zachary Quinto , Angelababy and special appearance in a brief role by Jürgen Prochnow.

It displays a thrilling and pulsing musical score by Marco Beltrami . As well as colorful and evocative cinematography by Óttar Guðnason , shot on location in The Gardens by the Bay, Singapore , Chinatown district, Changi Airport, , Marina Bay Sands Hotel Singapore and Potsdam, Brandenburg, Berlin, Germany. The motion picture was well directed by Aleksander Bach at his film debut."

It also films in Singapore which I've never seen an action film filmed there before. The story is pretty good although some head-scratchers at the end. How did they rig that up and how did that guy know how to trigger it? But other than that the movie is a blast to watch. It moves quickly and logically for the most part.

But this is very much annoying that they completely misjudged the concept of Hit-man. He is a silent assassin. Whatever his mission is, he always tried to avoid killing unnecessary peoples and also tried to save his bullets and money. But in the movie their is some unwanted violence, he kills whoever he wants. Also, in the game he tried to enter any area without seeing. But here, he was like dying to show his face. It was just like a normal action movie. Moreover, the story line is also very poor. ""Rupert"" was unable to walk like ""Timothy"" from the first movie.

And the main thing that really bugged me from minute one of that awful monologue, they didn't even get the name of the cloning scientist right. It was Dr Ort-Meyer. Not whoever in the blue hell this ""Litvinenko"" chap is.

Honestly I would have settled for them using ANY of the Five Fathers to be the ""creator"" or ""monetary backer"" for the cloning program, but no, instead they made it up."

If you don't like that kind of movies then just don't watch this one because that is what you are going to get. To me it's better then James Bond movies because here the hero at least bleeds and gets hurt sometimes while in OO7 movies that seems impossible. The action scenes were good, the script is just okay but then again I didn't except much on that part. The actors were all good to me, and that's what it is all about."
6.0,21 August 2015,"The stunning Rupert Friend explodes onto the screen here as ""Agent 47"" – one of a numbered group of genetically DNA engineered 'Hitman' from the popular video game giving a second try at a film franchise here. Hannah Ware plays Katia van Dees, the daughter of a missing scientist Dr. Litvenko (Ciarán Hinds) who back in the 1960's was responsible for creating a super-soldier program that brought Agent 47, and at least 46 other deadly assassins into the world. Syndicate International, one of those typical diabolical organizations that always seem to exist, run by Le Clerq (Thomas Kretschmann) wants Katia's father as they think he holds the secrets to making more. Agent 47's employers want her dead.

Zachary Quinto's aptly named character John Smith – who's name pun you will understand when watching.. seems not to really fit his part in the beginning..after a few decent plot twists in his favour he turns it around and pulls his character off. He after all is also an 'agent' in a sense with a pretty neat change up of DNA in him.

Along with a bland storyline and too many plot holes to count or even care about, the films plus side is in if there is one demographic that it would try to please, it's obvious that aim is for 15-20 yr olds video-gamers who live for hours stepping into this world of CGI-done assassins killing off his enemies while wreaking maximum havoc in the process. And oh..the blood looks good. I'm serious it really does.

Friend as Agent 47, is a killing machine fighting other killing machines with whom I'd thought that we'd seen every imaginable killing stunt – but this film truly does become imaginative in that area and comes up with some doozies I'd think the likes of us haven't even dreamed up.

In the end, we do have a few surprise twists but there is no spark of life is to be found in a few of the characters most disappointingly in Ware, whose Katia is meant to be the supposed emotional linchpin of the enterprise. We've seen Friend do the cold and calculating before as Peter Quinn on Homeland where he actually scares us at times. The same goes here, American accent included. They have a few moments of mild playfulness mostly that Friend tries half heartedly to inject in their partnership without much success.

And of course what would the ending be if not to give us a little after name credits roll – scene of what is to come. And for the third time in a month, I'm seeing in that teaser scene what will probably be a better sequel than original.

End note: Paul Walker was scheduled to play Agent 47 and due to his untimely and tragic passing, Rupert Friend stepped in. RIP Paul

As I watched Hit-man 47 I could not help but notice that every single goal that Ritchie had failed at in UNCLE, Bach nailed here.

The story was fast-paced. full of clever tropes. the characters were engaging and the cinematography was breath-taking.

I can understand perhaps why reviewers comparing it to the original might get frustrated -- Olyphant is such a strong presence that he commands the screen where here Bach had to work harder and better to hold attention. And he does.

Quinto is solid but I am concerned at the arc his career is taking. In HEROES, he was mesmerizing. In Star Trek, he nailed young Spock. Here he is merely solid and competent.

Would recommend."

2.0,6 September 2016,"While the original Hit-man adaptation was not as bad as the Max Payne adaptation, it still seemed to lack some of the stylish choices of the game. If you have played the games, than a lot of shots that are used in the movie here will seem familiar. I'm a bit shocked that another reviewer didn't like the amount of shots the ""reloading"" of the guns got in this. If that bothers you, than any action movie will seem ""bad"" in the sense that there is more shooting than reloading.

Same is true here, but the main actor seems to capture the essence of the game character. I'm not saying it's a perfect movie of course (see rating), but it does a really good job and does not take anything for granted. Trying to please fans of the game and action fans at the same time is not the easiest thing to do. But going for an ""R"" instead of making this a family friendly affair (Hitman just isn't that) shows the amount of respect for the source the filmmakers brought to the table.

So if you're looking for a decent action movie or you actually enjoy the games, this probably will please you (except for the mentioned reloading sequences of course :p )"
7.0,11 November 2015,"When I see the ratings for both main Hit man movies (2007/2015) , I felt bit disappointment for their ratings. These two action thrillers deserve better ratings than what seen on the site. Because I've seen average movies get 7 out of 10 which supposed not to be. Plot might have not much to offer. But the action sequences look quite stunningly shot. I must say if you are follower if Hit-man movie or video game this is a worth of watch. Your time will not be wasted. If you still not confidence I would say this may even better than Liam Nesson's u know or sequels of taken. As I stated in my caption this movies is under rated film."

3.0,10 November 2015,"When it comes to movies based on popular video games, a majority of them intend to fail and get the fanboys of the game source to rave and rant on what's wrong with it and question why it was made. In this scenario, Hit-man: Agent 47 does stand somewhere near there, but it does improve on its 2nd attempt to bring the 'silent assassin' on screen in the best way possible.

The film follows an assassin known only as Agent 47 (played by a great and bald Rupert Friend) who seems to team up with a woman named Hanna (Hannah Ware) to help her find her father and uncover the mysteries of her ancestry. Together, they aim to take down the leader of Syndicate International, a terrorist group who is aiming to discover and create more deadly hit-man that process Hannah's unique ability and are more deadly than the assassin himself.

What makes Agent 47 so redeemable is the fact that it tries to improve on its plot and following the game source material than what the 2007 adaptation did (not to mention that the casting of Timothy Olyphant is mixed for me), it may not have done its 100% faithfulness to be label how game-to-movies are made but it's better than what most people say. The plot itself stays simple and is a no brainer to follow what's happening, but I did feel that the movie itself ran smoothly and kept pace in strong hold but the 96 minute running time is still considered short for my tastes (hopefully in future there will be an extended cut of the film that could help bring the film longer).

The casting range here may or may not seem recognisable but the cast do put on their best performance roles, Rupert Friend (from TV's Homeland) suits better as Agent 47 than what Olyphant's take did. Agent 47 is pretty much an emotionless, ruthless and yet cunning like in the game and Friend sticks close to that with good results. Ware makes a good impression as the female lead, playing a character that is searching for not only her past but embracing the future ahead as she learns more about her 'unique' side. Zachary Quninto plays a decent role as well though other reviewers say that his role was wasted, I won't give away too much but he does give his best on-screen role that's not a waste.

Hit-man: Agent 47 is a better but not yet best game to movie adaptation to surface in years, Arming itself with a great choice of casting, direction, plot and action, the film is a worthy watch on a lazy afternoon and it's a 'leave the brain at the door' so you can't take it to be full-on serious.

It is based on the Hit-man video game series, developed by IO Interactive, and its main character, a mysterious assassin known only as Agent 47. The film stars Rupert Friend, Hannah Ware, Zachary Quinto, Ciarán Hinds, Thomas Kretschmann, and Angelababy.

The plot of the movie focuses about an assassin who teams up with a woman to help her find her father and uncover the mysteries of her ancestry. Together, they aim to take down the leader of Syndicate International, a terrorist group based in Singapore.

Believe me from start to finish this movie was Absolutely Breathtaking.

Finally,I gotta thank 20th Century Fox For This Great And Must See Movie."

1.0,25 October 2015,"The movie is entertaining if you would like to see an action movie, and it does contain some aspect of the game. The aim of the game was to attain the award of silent assassin and that is who 47 is. He plans his route and his execution style with utmost precision. Also, he doesn't kill whomever he isn't paid to kill. Usually gamers would strive to achieve this level of assassination.

The movie itself has good action scenes but when basing it off a game such as hit-man, one would want to see a higher degree of accuracy. Granted it is way better than the first hit-man movie after watching it you leave with that sense of feeling that it could've been a lot better.

5/10 just for the entertainment."
7.0,4 September 2015,"An assassin teams up with a woman to help her find her father and uncover the mysteries of her ancestry.

Hit-man: Agent 47 is directed by Aleksander Bach and stars Rupert Friend, Hannah Ware and Zachary Quinto. This film is based on the successful Hit-man video game series. Writers and producers are trying to reboot a film which basically failed at starting a franchise the first time. This former film was yet not good at all, the critics and people weren't very of it. I'm confused because there are so many other great stories that could be turned into movies beginning with Metroid or even Zelda for God sakes! Eventually Rupert Friend is good at portraying the Hit-man but his character is so boring, it's frustrating. Plus, Zachary Quinto really disappointed me as well. This film isn't that great and it eventually sucks. It's written by Skip Woods, the man who wrote X-Men Origins: Wolverine, A Good Day to Die Hard or Sabotage. Do I need to say more? The exposition is about 20minutes long, explaining the world of the movie to the audience, trying to overload us with information and yet you are supposed to care about these characters. Epic fail because you genuinely don't. Moreover, the film ""profits"" from modern day rapidly edited and quick-cut scenes but the thing is, we need to see things happened in an action movie. No one wants to wonder what their looking at. No one wants to see a blur of an action scene done with horrible choreography and fake stunt work. Each time this assassin pulls his guns out or shoot at things, it's in slo-motion. In fact, for every gun shoot scene, you have three to four dumb scenes. Finally you begin to deconstruct the movie and when you do that, you're not enjoying it.

Overall I enjoyed mostly the Hit-man himself, Zachary Quinto would have made a good villain if he weren't to deal with this script. Hit-man: Agent 47 is a big mess."

6.0,29 October 2015,"Let me say for the record that I finished Hit-man: Absolution twice, one of my favorite games ever. This movie ''adaptation'' is an absolute garbage.

I saw a few people saying they never played the games, and they enjoyed the movie. Well, if you would've play the damn games, you'll know why this game is god awful.

Let's begin by saying that the only real similarity between the movie and the games is that they both feature an assassin named Agent 47. That's how bad of a movie it is. Other than that, this movie is confusing, stupid, boring, truly awful and barely an adaptation. Now let's start the rant:

The action scenes are boring, the performances are below average, you barely know 3 of the whole cast in this movie, so many plot points (the only truly amazing thing in this trash), so many stupid and unnecessary slow-mo sequences, a truly horrible awful plot twist and let's not forget my main issue with this trash (it's not a movie, it's trash)- you get absolutely NO BACKGROUND story of Agent 47 and the even worse part is that all the kills Agent 47 does are in no way silent. You only see him put on a silencer in his gun ONCE throughout the whole trash. JUST. ONCE.

This film is truly a betrayal of the original games, it doesn't do any justice to the games, every scene films awful and fake, and like I said before- the plot twist is so awful and makes you wonder what the hell did you just see.

This is probably one of the worst video-game-inspired films. This film is useless, worthless, doesn't make any sense AT ALL, confusing, bad action sequences, and please don't give this film your money. please.

Other than that, hope you have a nice day, and don't even think about watching this trash- even if you play every Hit-man game, and even if you didn't play any of the games."

10.0,20 August 2015,"I was pretty excited to see Hit-man 47, I thought they would learn from their mistakes with the previous film and build upon what was good about it and do something better.

The movie starts with a bang for the first ~ 20 minutes, and what could have possibly been exciting scenes where 47 disposes of a large group of assailants, was so utterly boring that I'm pretty sure my heartbeat actually slowed instead of increased.

But what came next was even worse, the dialog in the movie was so horribly wooden that I just can't believe this script was green lighted.

The movie was filled with nods to the video games, obviously trying to win over the gaming crowd (which I'm one of), however the movie is just plain bad.

I actually enjoyed the first Hit-man movie to some extent, but dear god, stay away from this flaming pile of dung."

7.0,6 February 2016,"Agent 47 is one bad dude! Even though I had not seen most of the actors before, I thoroughly enjoyed the fast moving action, special effects and graphics. I was on the edge of my seat the entire movie. The story line was suspenseful and the acting was better than most in this genre. The stunts in this film were among the best I've ever seen. The filming and clarity of the audio was also excellent. I sure hope there will be some sequels, I want more. And I really think that Zachary Quinto may have found a new calling, I totally hope to see more action films in his future. In fact, maybe a James Bond role? All in all, IMHO, this is a must see if you are a die hard action film buff.

I can only imagine that some of the bad reviews are due to the movie not resembling a video game or the series, which I have seen neither. My opinion is based solely on the merits of the movie itself."
7.0,23 November 2015,"I was expecting Terminator - Genysis (Genisys? Genesys? Whatever) level of awfulness and franchise disrespect but in the end, this movie was just a random action movie branded with Hit-man trademark.

The main problem of this movie is that it's nothing like Hit-man games and Agent 47 is an action killing machine and not a calculated and resourceful stealth assassin. Yeah, there are hints here and there, but most of the movie was generic shooting everything and everybody with few chasing scenes slapped in for a good measure.

But, it has nice set pieces and in the end, it's just an OK action movie, unfortunately marketed as a Hit-man movie. Story is just rushed and not that important, plus - characters are pretty shallow. Although, movie did have some bright moments, brief, but they were there.

It's not that bad but it is an ""don't expect much"" action movie. I'm not a huge Hit-man fan but I do have a strong respect for the series and what it did for nonlinear and stealth game play in video games. But even like that I approached this movie as an action movie and nothing more. And in that case it's a flimsy 6, but if you watch it strictly as a hardcore Hit-man movie, then it's 5, maybe even lower, depends on your emotional state of distress at the moment.

All that being said, Hit-man is in a bit of a dry place as a franchise these past years. Here, they did laid some groundwork for a sequel but having it that the movie bombed pretty hard at the box office, I doubt we'll see anything like it in a near future. In any case, surprisingly, I don't see this movie as a complete failure and a waste of respectable brand. There are things that can make it better in a potential sequel, be it movie or maybe even better - a TV show continuation from this movie. I guess we'll never know."
2.0,18 December 2020,"Its just bad and nothing doesent look like the games,awful"
6.0,10 September 2018,"Hitman: Agent 47 won't win any awards at the Oscars, but it is still a fun movie that can pass the time! Some of the hate following this movie is irrelevant, some say this movie sucks because of it's product placement for Audi. Like really, that's not even a valid argument. Hitman is still a good movie, not perfect not bad, just good in it's own ways."
3.0,13 July 2022,"Both this film and the previous Hitman adaptation with Timothy Olyphant aren't good adaptations. There's no doubt about that. This one is considered the worst of the two; the previous one was better made from a filmmaking perspective, whereas this one had a lot of visual effects, making it seem a little too artificial. Generally, the previous one was more well-put-together, although most people disliked that one, too; only this one, way more.

If you've read my review of that film, you'll know I found it serviceable. I wished it was a good adaptation because I feel like the source material, when faithfully adapted, would make for a pretty good film. I thought it could've been better on its own, but it was decent enough despite being a somewhat shoddy adaptation.

Regarding this film, I thought it wasn't as well-made, and everything about the story was a little too generic and not as atmospheric and immersive as the first film, specifically in a similar way as it was in that film. Despite that, I think I enjoyed it slightly more. It was the same outcome as before, when I watched both movies for the first time, except then, I liked this one more and rated it to the limit. Now, I care more and am more particular with that sort of thing.

Performance-wise, Rupert Friend seemed to fit the character better than Timothy Olyphant, even though the character's writing wasn't necessarily Agent 47-esque. Rupert was more properly villain-like, in the sense of having a commanding presence with a slight terrifying nature about him: as well as more monotone, which I'm pretty sure is how the character is in the games; I've never played them myself, only watched Let's Plays, and my memory of how he seems regarding that aspect is a little hazy. Timothy seemed too human. Does that make sense? But I seem to think, or remember, in a vague way, that 47 is humorous sometimes in the games, but still in a deadpan, monotone manner, and Rupert was doing so in a too (facially) expressive way, including not being monotone enough, generally; too many emotive instances. That's my only criticism.

And the other performances were decent. Hannah Ware, Zachary Quinto, Thomas Kretschmann, and Ciaran Hinds delivered decent performances. Hannah was a little one-note (more so due to the character), but she displayed noteworthy moments. Ciaran stood out the most to me, although I guess Zachary is a close second. Thomas (despite not having much screen time) had somewhat of a presence and appropriate line delivery, so he was decent, too.

While the story was generic and the filmmaking lazy, including the visual effects and whatever else: whether it has to do with the cameras used or something along those lines, that seems to be typical with multiple films (The Hitman's Bodyguard comes to mind), making them look similar, the score by Marco Beltrami, who has quite the résumé, was pretty good.

I suppose the cinematography by Ottar Gudnason was decent enough: although something about how the film felt sometimes or looked (that almost artificial look, which seemed prominent in The Hitman's Bodyguard and plenty of other films, I'm sure) isn't the way to go. And the action/fight sequences were as well.

A sequel would've been welcome. This film was enjoyable enough. Seeing Rupert Friend and Hannah Ware return to these roles for another film, especially given how the characters are close now, has an appeal to it. That hasn't happened yet, and it's been over five years already, so it probably never will."
6.0,26 March 2016,"For the past two decades, video games have become a source material to film adaptations, and most of which have proved to be unsuccessful. With the exceptions of 'Mortal Kombat' and some of the Resident Evil movies, most film adaptations to video games have come out very poor results not only by lazy acting and directing but simply because the structure of video games don't translate too well on film. Filmmakers try so hard to make the movies so close to the games that they hoarder over the style of games and the end results are often films that feel more like live-action games without control than actual films. This is certainly the consequence that occurs in this film adaption of the successful video game franchise by IO Interactive. Directed by first-time filmmaker Aleksander Bach, Rupert Friend plays Agent 47, a genetically engineered gun-totting assassin with high intelligence created by Russian scientist Dr. Peter Litvenko (played by Ciaran Hinds). With the help of the Litvenko's daughter Katie (played by Hannah Ware), 47 fights against an evil corporation who armed with a league of powerful clones much stronger than him, and searches to the truth of his origins.

Everything shown in the trailer is just about everything you need to see in this film, everything else is left to be an utter eye-sore to those who are looking for a fun, excitement-filled action flick. This all begins with some unrealistic action sequences filled with poorly animated blood spatters and CGI work that simply doesn't fit, although they manage to devoid from ridiculous shaky camera work that's become a gimmick in many action films today. The gun shootouts that take place are supposed to fun and pulse-pounding, but end up being rather tedious, though there is an intense car crash sequence that manages to work. Unless you grow fond in near constant slow motion action scenes, the excitement is pretty much left dry. Even worse, the characters including Agent 47, Katie, and the character played by Zachary Quinto feel so one- dimensional that you never come to care for these characters. With proper writing and character development, the characters become difficult to root for. Rupert Friend who plays the titular character looks so bored in his role and show almost no emotion for most of the time. The plot is fine per say, but nothing truly memorable or fleshed out in any way, consisting of mostly exposition dialogue and antagonist sadly underwritten. The plot is just too thin and underdeveloped to be compelling.

Hit-man: Agent 47 is just another film adaption of a video game gone wrong by a lazy script and direction. This movie fails in many areas and is utterly difficult to recommend to even the least demanding action fans out there. It comes to show that films based on video games have not shown any improvement in the past several years and are not likely to do so in the near future. If you have seen this movie, don't worry you aren't missing anything."
4.0,3 September 2015,"'HITMAN: AGENT 47': Three Stars (Out of Five)

Sequel/reboot to the 2007 action flick 'HITMAN'; about an unstoppable cloned assassin, called 'Agent 47'. This installment has the killer-for-hire teaming up with a woman; to stop an evil organization, from copying the bioengineering program that created him. Both films are loosely based on the popular 'Hitman' video game series (which began in 2000). This new chapter was directed by first time filmmmaker Aleksander Bach and written by Michael Finch and Skip Woods (who also wrote the original). It stars Rupert Friend as '47' (replacing Timothy Olyphant from the first movie) and it costars Hannah Ware, Zachary Quinto, Ciaran Hinds and Thomas Kretschmann. I'm not a big fan of the first movie, and this is certainly no improvement.

Genetically engineered hit-man-for-hire Agent 47 (Friend) has just been given a new assignment; to stop a powerful corporation from replicating the scientific project that created him. The evil company, known as Syndicate International, plans to create their own army of assassins; with skills even deadlier than 47's. In order to do this, the Syndicate must get their hands on the lead scientist, responsible for creating the elite agents; his name is Dr. Peter Litvenko (Hinds). 47 teams with Litvenko's daughter (Ware), in order to protect him.

The movie has some cool video game style action scenes, but that's about all it has; and that's just what watching the movie feels like, playing a shoot' em up video game (and I've heard these films are almost nothing like the stealth games they're based on). The characters are pretty boring, and underdeveloped, and the acting is all pretty stiff (even Quinto, who I expect a lot more from). The plot is just as boring, and stupid, as well. I do like the look of the film though, and Friend at least looks like a cool action hero (kind of like a Terminator, in a lot of scenes). It's not a complete waste of time, if you like mindless action movies, but it's close.

9.0,23 July 2017,"Unfortunately, the movie doesn't follow the success of the game. We only get a glimpse of 47' history and background, the character lacks depth and the whole premise stands out of the Hit-man concept. Pacing is not very good, acting is quite poor and so is the script. The plot is not bad but the delivery is flawed. There is a lot of action, fight scenes are naive and there are a lot of errors.Personally, I only wanted to see the movie because of Rupert Friend who gave a solid performance, but I must say it was a complete waste of time."

Apparently Ididn't like it particularly much and something tells me it can't have had that good of a story if it's possible to forget it after just one week. After having seen the trailer it looked promising, and some of the scenes from the trailer I actually remember. Maybe I'll see it again sometime in the future, but right now that's not an very appaeling idea.

Fun to see Rupert Friend, who played Mr Wickham in the 2005 production of Pride and Prejudice. Not entirely easy to recognize him maybe, but there he is. I haven't seen the later season of Homeland, but he appears there as well."

1.0,23 September 2015,"Genetically engineered from conception through decades of research, a man known only as Agent 47 (Rupert Friend) was made to be a perfect killing machine blessed with unrivaled strength, speed, stamina, and intelligence. His current target is an evil corporation, known as Syndicate International, led by Le Clerq (Thomas Kretschmann) who is looking to uncover 47's past in order to create an army of killers (agents) who are even more powerful than him. With the help of a young woman, Katia (Hannah Ware), he must confront revelations about his own origin and battle against his deadliest foe, John Smith (Zachary Quinto).

I'll just start off by saying not to listen to rotten tomatoes on this one. As I am writing this, the film has an 8% rating on the site. You know what also has that rating on the site (also as I am writing this)? The most recent Fantastic Four film does. That film is terrible. This film is no masterpiece but it is a lot better than Fantastic Four. My synopsis above implies that the film has a story but it really doesn't. I'm not sure if they thought they needed to explain anything since the film is based on the video game series of the same name or if they were trying to take its characters and give them a new story. I will admit that I am vaguely familiar with the video game series but you really don't have to be to be able to enjoy this film. This may be because of the running time but to understand what is happening, you must simply accept what you are being told. Luckily there isn't too much of it since the action sequences are at the forefront here. Although very well choreographed, very violent, and exciting, certain aspects defy both sense and reality. What I found unsettling was how bad all of the various henchmen were as they just seemed stupid and died a little too easily. I understand that the filmmakers are supposed to make the stars look good but I would have liked if they could have put up a little more of a challenge. Also, a lot of those sequences contain several instances of bad CGI which took me out of the experience but they panned away from it rather quickly. My favorite part of this film has to be Rupert Friend's performance as Agent 47 because I thought he really embodied what the character would have looked like. I thought Zachary Quinto was good too but he didn't really have too much to do and Kretschmann even less in this one. The real disappointment here is the story (or the lack of) what really seemed promising at the start where it tried to introduce and develop the characters as well as their motivations fell apart around half-way through and became an average, flashy, action movie. The last time I've seen this is in the Ryan Reynolds movie Self/less from a month ago. This film is watchable but I just wanted a little more.

The only thing this movie has in common with the IP is that the main dude is called 47, is bald and has a barcode on his head. Thats it.

Bad action, bad effects, abysmal story, guns that dont cycle when being shot, an absolute weird attempt at trying to establish a sequel (dear gods please no) with a cringemax post credits scene.

If i would have gone to the cinema to watch this burning heap of dung i would have had the very strong urge to burn the place down to the ground afterwards.

3.0,29 July 2023,"Action-packed film based on the popular video game series about the genetically engineered assassin known as Agent 47.

Rupert Friend takes on the role of Agent 47, bringing a cool and calculated demeanor to the character. His portrayal captures the essence of the deadly assassin, showcasing his exceptional skills and lethal precision.

The film is filled with high-octane action sequences and intense fight scenes, showcasing Agent 47's prowess as a highly trained killer. Fans of the video game series will appreciate the faithful adaptation of the iconic action and stealth elements.

The visual aesthetics of Hitman: Agent 47 are sleek and stylish, creating a sharp and polished look that complements the world of contract killing.

However, while the film delivers on action, it falls somewhat short in terms of character development and storytelling. Some plot points may feel predictable, and the supporting characters lack the depth and complexity that could have added more substance to the narrative.

Hitman: Agent 47 is a solid action film that delivers on its promise of thrilling action and intense combat. It's a movie that will keep you engaged with its fast-paced sequences and killer instincts.

In conclusion, Hitman: Agent 47 is a fun and action-packed adaptation of the popular video game franchise. With Rupert Friend's convincing performance as Agent 47 and the film's stylish action sequences, it's a movie that caters to fans of the video game series and action enthusiasts alike.

If you're in the mood for a thrilling and visually striking action film with a lethal assassin at its core, Hitman: Agent 47 is worth a watch."
8.0,14 December 2015,"If you plan to watch this movie because you are a fan of the awesome Hit-man game series, then don't. Hit-man: Agent 47 does not even remotely grasp the essence of the actual hit-man. The actual hit-man is not a super human gun slinger but is a SILENT ASSASSIN who resorts to assassinating his targets in a very discrete way. And therefore this movie has miserably failed to do justice to the Hit-man. Rupert Fiend is a good actor but imagine how it would have been if the producers had tried David Bateson with his characteristic Agent 47 voice over. This movie seemed more like an advertisement of Audi or a bollywood flick where the protagonist can just about achieve anything. Agent 47's signature Fibre wire and silver-ballers have been used in vain. If only, the makers of had adopted the plot of Hit-man absolution they would have fared much better. Also the music/score accentuate the shortcomings of this title. A better option would be to hire the absolution sound team or better yet Jesper Kyd, who worked on the initial titles of the games. A Chinese Diana from the agency???? Srsly!!!! An utter disappointment for the Hit-man Fans."
7.0,22 January 2017,"First, let's get this out of the way. This is not as good as the video game that spawned it. Rupert Friend almost looks the part but simply doesn't have that Agent 47 quality. It is a little like if you had Jennifer Aniston play Lara Croft.

Rupert isn't helped by a plot that suffers from this time it's personal syndrome (see latest Bond films). Everybody is someone's sister, father, cousin, former chiropractor's receptionist. It is a tired idea that has been beaten to death in action films of late.

So the acting is subpar, the story is filled with tired tropes and it doesn't do justice to the source material. Thank god it looks so good and the action set pieces that start okay get more spectacular as the movie moves along.

If you can get past the someone subpar opening bit that is more Steven Seagal than Terminator the ride improves. That all this movie really is, a forgettable ride among some nice scenery. Sometimes that is enough for a Saturday night on the couch with the wife."

6.0,11 November 2016,"I enjoyed the games back in the day, and I also enjoyed the first ""Hitman"" movie from 2007. I was aware of this movie, but never really got around to watch it before I happened to come across it by sheer luck and then took the time to watch it.

And I was blown away. I had really been missing out on an action movie of high caliber here. ""Hitman: Agent 47"" kicks up into high gear from the very beginning and it doesn't slow down.

The story was good, albeit it is quite simplistic. Agent 47 teams up with a woman to find her father and thus finding out about her story and background.

""Hitman: Agent 47"" just pounds you with everything it got, and it is a thrill to sit through it all. Especially because director Aleksander Bach really punched the movie into explosive gear and just kept assaulting the audience with one impressive scene after another.

There is so much action in this movie, that even us who grew up with the movies of Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Van Damme, and the likes can't help to be impressed. I was blown away by the overload of action and adrenaline that this movie has. And it was all choreographed so nicely and equally so executed on the screen. It was a pure pleasure to sit through this explosive movie.

At first I was a bit hesitant about how Rupert Friend would handle the role of Agent 47. But he put my hesitation to shame early on in the movie. He was so right for this role and he was an excellent choice for Agent 47. I dare actually say that he played the part much better than Timothy Olyphant did back in 2007.

""Hitman: Agent 47"" really took me by surprise, and this is definitely a movie that you can watch more than once. If you enjoy action movies and haven't gotten around to watching ""Hitman: Agent 47"" yet, I can only encourage you to get around to doing it, because you are really missing out on an explosive movie."

Despite the movie original from a famous game ""Hitman"" which uses stealth a lot , the movie just full on mindless blowing stuff action movie and that's like i don't know what's going on anymore

Actually if you change this movie to any others name you will probably don't even know that it's original from a video games since almost 100% of this movie is just another loud dump stupid cliché action movie that delivers nothing new at all.

And for icing on the cake is the characters in this movie , while the bad guy are always stupid dump talking too much miss every single bullet , our main characters the agent himself is just like a god he can basically 1 - 50 easily without any effort and that just make the movie kind a boring since their are no threats to the main characters what so ever.

Overall it's still WATCHABLE it's not completely garbage like someone might say but it's not good or even mediocre either , just to think that Warcraft and Assassin's creed comes next year makes me wonder ,if those two movie failed what will happen next in these movie genre ?"

Katia herself seems to have abilities to sense danger and when danger does arrive only Zachary Quinto's mysterious John Smith is willing to help her out.

Right from the start we have a high octane action and body count as Agent 47 kills people in all manner of novel ways while he goes after Katia. John Smith really does well to go toe to toe with him.

It does not matter if you have never played the video games, the plot is just an excuse for action, killing and car chases with characters who stand still long enough for plot exposition and it has more holes than Swiss cheese.

There is some nice bit of location shooting in Germany and Singapore. It really is a film to disengage the brain and watch some action and adventure for 90 minutes. In that sense it is an unpretentious fun film. I think Olyphant would had been better if he reprised the role though."

7.0,1 September 2015,"Judging the movie within its genre, you may as well say that it's a 9/10! I am a bit reluctant to go that far, as I always keep in mind other movies that may not be in the genre but were great. For me, you can't give a 9 to both hit-man and LOTR. It may as well be that in their genres they're both great, but you just can't put them on the same level overall.

As far as the movie is concerned, I really enjoyed the transfer from the game to the big screen. The graphics were all there and some of the movements were really mapped to the game, which brought too many WOW moments for both myself and my brother that watched it with me. We are both fans of the hit-man games and it was a real pleasure to watch this.

We were not expecting as much from the movie. We actually wanted to watch the fantastic four but we were advised not to, so we went with the first alternative and were not at all disappointed. We were actually thrilled! The adaptation for the movie was phenomenal and some of the impossible scenes did not seem as implausible as in other movies. They did not throw you out of the movie by making you think ""what a big fat lie!"". It happened once or twice but not more.

The lead actor was amazing in his role and it really felt like the real thing. He could have been picked to be a bit more long-faced and with narrow characteristics, more Asian-like, but still he was an excellent fit to what we saw in the game. To address some comments, agent 47 is not a pumped up freak on steroids, he's a silent assassin. Get your facts straight first and then judge.

I also liked the lady (which was actually far by a sidekick as some suggested) that played a major role in the movie and that it seems that she will be the main character of the next movie, if one comes out. Nice, quiet, introverted but strong, beautiful as hell but no silicone, gym freak that looks unnatural. Someone that the ladies can relate to, which helps with the female target group of the movie I guess.

The plot was OK, again based on what we knew from the game. If you played hit-man, you will adore the movie. It's one of these pleasant flashbacks, bundled into a quality piece of work overall."

In the games he can wipe out entire buildings filled with armed personnel with mere fibre wires and anesthetics without any one ever having the slightest of clue/knowledge .... hence the title ""The Urban Legend"" .

The movie portrays him completely different .... A ""Mass Murderer"" so as to speak ... which is the exact opposite of a ""Silent Assassin""!

The guy looks and behaves nothing like the original game character.....(Nowhere close). Acts like an angry infant who is mightier than every other being around him.

I don't get it! Why is Hollywood so keen on making reboots of games into movies! ... Especially Epic games and animes like Dragonballz and many others.... They CLEARLY don't live up to anybody's expectations spreading unwanted hatred for the film makers and the actors.

They just cannot stick to the originality of these brilliant characters and story lines, Pathetic!"

It seemed as though it was a 90 minute advert..

All became a bit silly and I got the impression everybody in the theatre just wanted to go home.why oh why can't the bad guys learn to shoot properly??

I think the problem was it tried to be cool and viewer friendly but I feel it just missed the point time and time again.

4.0,7 January 2016,"I'll keep this short. I've never played the Hit-man games or seen the other movie. I have absolutely no interest in the idea of a movie spawned from a video game, in my experience that's a fools errand. I can count the number of watchable game/movies I've seen on one hand, and could fill a car boot with the ones I've seen that were execrable cr*p. Thankfully 'Hitman 47' is part of the former group.

It's fun, fast-paced, full of great action sequences, car chases, fights and sh*t getting blown up in public places. It has great locations and some humour. Zachary Quinto is awesome and more than a bit creepy - especially starting out as he does seeming like the romantic hero - and Hannah Ware isn't too dusty either. Rupert Friend however is superbly watchable as 47. Physically beautiful and superbly kickass, he gives the character of 47 a subtle undercurrent of pathos that allows you to actually give a toss, despite his seeming lack of personality. I watched 'Spectre' a few days before I saw this and am amazed at how this, far smaller and less explosive movie managed to succeed in ways that the mighty Bond franchise entirely fell down, number one being the fact that it was entertaining without being insanely misogynistic.

It's no 'Bourne Identity' but it's a fun pacey action movie for when you're in the mood for just such fare. And 7/10 for not throwing in a gratuitous sex scene somewhere, even though we all wanted it :P"

A clear upgrade from 2007's Hitman, this movie embraces its video game roots while still successfully transferring its action material to the cinema. Rupert Friend's performance (and Zachary Quinto's if I'm being honest) is pretty flat, but it's worth mentioning that Hannah Ware actually has a solid showing. She feels like a video game version of Beckinsale's Selene from the Underworld series

9.0,2 September 2019,Hitman 2007 was my favourite and Timothy Oliphant has had it nailed. But the hit man in this movie was just a pencil sketch of Timothy. Plus the storyline was utter nonsense.

2.0,31 December 2015,"When will the fascination and obsession with killing stop? It is in the television series, games children play, and movies. Assassins and hit men/women are the toast of the town, and if that is you cup of tea you will love this movie.

Written by Skip Woods and Michael Finch, Hit-man: AGENT 47 as directed by Alexsander Bach centers on an elite assassin (Rupert Friend) who was genetically engineered from conception to be the perfect killing machine, and is known only by the last two digits on the barcode tattooed on the back of his neck. He is the culmination of decades of research and forty-six earlier Agent clones -- endowing him with unprecedented strength, speed, stamina and intelligence. His latest target is a mega- corporation that plans to unlock the secret of Agent 47's past to create an army of killers whose powers surpass even his own. Teaming up with a young woman Katia (Hannah Ware) who may hold the secret to overcoming their powerful and clandestine enemies, 47 confronts stunning revelations about his own origins and squares off in an epic battle with his deadliest foe (Zachary Quinto) in an attempt to find Katia's father (Ciarán Hinds).

Rupert Friend, still appealing as a leading man with a shaved head, fills the role well and the cinematography of all the impossible special effects is impressive. The ending is a bit on the sappy side – but maybe that will be altered for the next episode (which by public demand for this ilk will likely come soon)."

2.0,7 December 2021,"After putting it up for so long (and dreading wasting my time and being utterly disappointed).. I finally gave this Videogame movie a chance.

I'm a bit invested through the game.. and while this pay homage to bits of the story and several details, it feels stand alone and doesn't really seem to dwell much in the canon (they've retconned bits in comics, novels and such anyway, so you can't get mad at this attempt).

I'm pleased to say I was entertained!

Had low expectations, but they managed to deliver good action, good performances, globetrotting, good looking sets and a proper narrative that doesn't leave you feeling insulted for watching it. I'd go as far as to say this is superior to the previous entry (2007 release), where Timothy Olyphant pales in comparison to Mr. Rupert Friend.. who is quite imposing as the character! Calm and collected, scary, yet not invincible. He was the most impressive part of it, as I believe he was great for the role.

The story itself is nothing new : Evil corporation wanting to do evil things, and an opposing force willing to go against it. While it is simple, (yet effective). It does deliver a structured plot that can be followed, makes sense, and you can tell the writers took their assignment seriously. Not heavy-handed and decent dialogue. And good, well-defined villains as well.

Overall, I had fun and would want to watch more like this."
10.0,5 September 2015,"...are the Hit-man games. Unfortunately this movie is not.

main character - way too skinny, looks like a Bulgarian clerk - where is the cool deep voice of the games, where is the dangerous look and feel of 47..

girl - I've never seen such an uncongenial, unappealing actress - probably she's the girlfriend of the (poor) producer.. - awful audi - well as mentioned in other reviews, this movie is an audi commercial - and because the movie is so bad, I'm not sure audi is too happy about it..

Overall - some shooting, some cgi, bad main characters, boring story - not recommended - 2/10 Hint for the producers - before doing such a movie, play the games - get some staff from IO to work with you on the movie - get a better casting agency (the two main characters are plain awful - it was really hard to watch them - maybe the movie would have gotten better ratings if the cast would've been better).

3.0,26 August 2015,"How many critics does it take for Skip Woods to actually get off his bum and play the damn game? Do we really have to wait until current generation players grow up and magically happen to become script writers? Who would remember the game by then? Just because you have a scene from 2nd game box cover doesn't make it legit.

For this movie, I didn't care what professional critics said: they don't play Hit-man games so their opinion doesn't count. I went to see this and discovered that neither do people who made this waste of time and millions of dollars.

Some say that Hit-man just isn't the kind of game that translates to a movie, that it's all about player choice and playing it yourself. I don't believe that either. Hit-man - the game series has motifs that you rarely see even in best movies. That's what's the game really about. Let me name some:

* Shady world behind the curtains of rich and famous. In games, you often explore what powerful persons do when they think they're not watched. A fetish-induced ""meat party"" in abandoned slaughterhouse in Eastern Europe. The villa of south-American drug lord. The mansion of powerful British aristocrats. A shady meeting in a Vegas Casino. A rocker's bar in Rotterdam and it's basement. A rehab center for celebrities. And so on... Those themes alone could fill any movie with times more material and exotic sets than boring sky shots of modern capitols (that seem to be in every movie lately) and parking garages, which seem to be most popular place for shootings to happen.

* Hit-man always enters ongoing life, it doesn't revolve around him. In games, Hit-man makes use of what people do around him, that's what helps him to blend in and truly be Silent Assassin. A love affair in the White House. Noise of the Chinese market. Police discovering hippie commune and raiding it, while having no idea Hit-man is nearby. SWAT team preparing to raid a ship... In this movie, nothing of sort exists. Whole world seems to be revolving around the conflict of main characters and there's even no police to distract them, let alone normal civilians who would have no idea whatsoever.

* Sudden turn of normality. What makes Hit-man games absolutely great is that everything seems to be normal most of the time. Hit-man steals a disguise, blends into crowd, walks around in a french theatre, The White House, an embassy, a strip club, Chinese restaurant, snowy streets of St. Petersburg or wherever and it's very casual. Until... SHOCK! someone's being choked to death, dumped into garbage bin, injected with poison, suffocated in sauna.... aaand then it's suddenly all normal again. He changes disguise and keeps on walking. No one even noticed that a murder has been committed.

THIS is what I would expect from a Hit-man movie. Think it wouldn't make a decent movie?

Nothing, nothing of the sort is in this movie. It's a simple, cookie-cutter, ""we're sorry"" script for your typical Van Damme movie. And that's all that's to be said."

But if you've played and liked the video games the movie has it's short comings. While it was nice they used the plot of Hitman Absolution with major changes, but Agent 47's voice lacked that gruff cold expressionless tone from the games. Though credit to Rupert Friend he did play the role with a cold expression only Agent 47 would have, it was a nice touch. As a video game to a movie it was ok, not nothing special."

So much shooting in the first fifteen minutes. I'm surprised there's anyone left to finish the film. The only name i recognize here is zach quinto from star trek. The middle part really drags. And they slow it down even more with slow-mo. Who should we trust? Who is telling the truth? Directed by aleksander bach. To date, the one and only film he has directed. Original story by skip woods.

10.0,25 January 2016,"""We determine who we are by what we do.""

Before, when I had no responsibilities and enough time in the evening, I was hopelessly addicted to playing video games. Many hours I spent behind my monitor slogging myself through all sorts of levels. Wondering what would follow. I had this relentless drive to improve myself on all fronts. Nowadays, I can't bring myself to stare at a screen for hours as an addict. On the one hand I don't have the time anymore and on the other hand I don't feel like doing that anymore. But I do get excited every time there's an attempt to make a film adaptation of a video game. The meager attempts there have been to date (and somewhat successful in my opinion) are for me the ""Tomb Raider"" and ""Resident Evil"" franchise. But still there's something subtle missing in those movies when you compare them with their console version. Perhaps it's because you don't have control over it and must undergo it. Perhaps the reason is plain simple. Maybe video games aren't suitable for screen adaptations.

What about this Hit-man film? Unfortunately, I haven't seen the original film from 2007. So I have no clue how bad or good that was. And I don't know what comparables there are with this version of ""Hit-man : Agent 47"". Agent 47 (Rupert Friend) is a cold-blooded, dispassionate secret agent who is a kind of reincarnation of Neo, mixed with John Wick and ""The Equalizer"". Fearless, intelligent, very fast and deadly. On the cover you see a bald, unemotional man in a sleek black suit and a red tie, holding two dangerous looking guns. A genetically engineered assassin, originating from the laboratory of Dr. Pitor Litvenko (Ciaran Hinds). Apparently everybody is looking for Litvenko. But all have their own reasons to find him. Agent 47 is looking for the abandoned daughter Katia (Hannah Ware). His task is to eliminate her, so that the ""Syndicate International"" can't use her to track Litvenko. This organization wants to restart the Agent program.

""Hit-man: Agent 47"" is nothing more than a series of action-packed scenes full of meaningless violent confrontations with a rather weak storyline. The violence is abundant and waves of extreme skirmishes hit you continuously. At those moments you'll witness the superhuman features like for instance a sub-dermal titanium body armor (yep). In addition, there's excessive use of slow-motion effects. Not exactly innovative. So don't expect a complicated story. It's all pretty predictable and simplistic. You can't say the dialogs are intelligent or interesting.The characters can be seen as very sterile. But claiming Rupert Friend just shows a total lack of emotion and nothing else, is kind of ridiculous, since this is a key feature of Agent 47. This manipulated agent can't comprehend the concept of emotions.

Hit-man provides amusement and brings mindless entertainment, but as a whole it's anything but a real hit.

5.0,30 November 2022,"I do not know anything about Director Aleksander Bach but what is immediately obvious is that he is very adept at Computer Generated Imagery (CGI). As it is, the main characters are supposed to be programmed assassins, so CGI is not that far out of line - it is just a pity that you see such few recognizable human beings in this pic, even if many of them have human shapes just before getting shot, blown to pieces, or thrown off staircases and buildings.

Even worse, from my point of view, is the shameless ripping off of the US film, TERMINATOR (1983). There is a switch to that story line and the supposed defender is anything but - however, by that point I had lost patience and respect for this poor and carelessly violent reprise of the TERMINATOR franchise, where even the leading lady resembles Linda Hamilton, and the leading fellow seems a cross between Michael Beihn and Robert Patrick, the terminator in TERMINATOR 2.

Acceptable photography, CGI special effects, and acting. In the end, though, I felt that the movie went on for longer than its official 96'. 4/10."
2.0,19 October 2021,"Action thriller with an interesting but unoriginal storyline. With some cool action scenes, but with an inexpressive ham that brings the movie to mediocrity.

5.0,15 February 2016,"We watched so many spy and assassin movies and Hit-man Agent 47 is one of our top hit movies. The opening scene is more amazing than Spectre and more gripping. Although there were a few moments where you wish there was more substance or emotions, the continuity and the style seems to make it worthwhile ignoring. The choice of scenery is impressive and so are the action scenes. The Singapore scenes are truly unique as it have not been seen before by many living in the USA or Europe. Car chases are incredible. Hannah Ware and Rupert Friend seems to be a good pair. But I can't say the same about Zach Quinto. Overall, it does reminds me of Blade Runner with a more gripping tension. The music is excellent too with some never heard beats before. For this movie budget, Hit-man Agent 47 is amazingly up there with Spectre whose budget is nearly 4 times more!"

The film had so many good action sequences but the story line was so shallow it looked like that agent 47 all had was his muscle but no strategies. It kinda loses it's story on the way as well.

So overall so much funds and technology wasted for another pointless action film."
1.0,26 May 2017,"I know, I know, this movie is rather superficial and simple. More effort has been spent on cool action than on depth of the story. Well, you know what? I do not care! I quite liked this movie. Agent 47 is cool and kicks ass. The bad guys gets plenty of ass whooping. The action is good. There is quite a lot of high tech and gadgets. What is there not to like? The movie starts of with a quite cool sequence introducing Agent 47. I have to say that I got into quite a bit of ""wow"" mode right a way there. The movie continues with plenty of action sequences with just a wee bit of slowdown in between. Actually the first-half, at least, of the movie is pretty much one long chase.

Perhaps I should point out that I have not played Hit-man and do not really know what the original story is about. From a lot of the comments I have read it appears That this might be to my advantage when it comes to enjoying the movie.

Some people are probably complaining about bad acting since Agent 47 do not really show much in terms of facial expressions or emotions. Well, news for you, he is not supposed to! He is supposed to be a cold emotionless killing machine so stop whining. Personally I found Agent 47 to be an excellent character. the re is on scene in particular that I liked where Agent 47 intentionally allows himself to be caught in a embassy. Once inside he, to no one in the audience surprise starts to tear the place apart. You have to see it to know what I mean.

The second part, or perhaps just the last third, of the movie turns into more of a search and destroy for Agent 47 and his new ""partner"". this part is of course as action filled as the first part of the movie. Naturally it all leads to a big show down between the Agent 47 & Co. The and itself did not really deliver any surprises but was satisfying.

The one thing in the movie that annoyed me was this subdermal armor stuff. The idea was not a too bad one but they really overplayed it. Come on! Just shoot him in the head or an eye or some other ""sensitive"" part for Christ sake. Bulletproof my arse! I honestly do not understand the low rating this movie has received. 5.7 at IMDb is really a bit harsh. Rotten Tomatoes rating is, not very surprisingly, abysmal. Rotten Tomatoes and their ""critics"" ratings must be the worst of any ratings site. When these dickwads rate down a movie, that's when I start to get interested. First step is to drill down into the real audience ratings which more often that not gives a different picture.

Any way I digress. Bottom line is that, for me, this is a simple, straightforward, high octane action movie and I quite enjoyed it."
3.0,17 July 2024,"This movie shows from the beginning what it's going to be and it's just another action movie which has a disappointing plot and a huge amount of cliches, seriously when I was watching it I already knew what was going to happen because it's a totally predictable movie so the script is really bad already talking about the story it's just another science fiction and action story it doesn't innovate at all and it even has certain scenes with errors because when they're in a fight you could notice that they didn't touch each other mostly in the hits they land on each other's faces which takes away realism and another thing that took away realism was the amount of stupid things the characters did like for example in a fight between Hitman and another person for some reason the other person throws himself to the ground for no reason and starts to turn around while shooting in my opinion when I saw things like that I said to myself ""what the hell is he doing"".

A boring and not very recommendable movie. I wasted two hours of my life. It's totally bad. It's not even worth thinking about watching it."

Jason Bourne need only a pencil to kill, Riddick use a cup (or a pin would do as well). But this ""da best assassin on earth"" of course need a full set of James Bond's approved super gear killing machines.

And of course he's easily killed ALL those trained agents, cops, soldiers (a.k.a rented STAR WARS' STROMTROOPERS), with his BADDA BOOM! BANG! CRASH! American style... He's succeeded to shot dead from ALL those ridiculous angles, and yet MISSED when he tried to shot his target (the teenage girl) point blank. WTF?"

5.0,5 March 2019,"Amazing stunts, brilliantly choreographed gun-fights, slamming car chases, all add up to a good 90 mins of pure entertainment, supported by a beautiful leading lady, a disciplined to-the-point hitman and a couple of dastardly villeins. I've seen at least one of previous Hitman movies and this is a major leap forward. Bond movies would be jealous. What they did with a helicopter was insane. It could have had a little more sophistication, perhaps with the soundtrack and better use of world locations, but that would be as far as true criticisms could venture. The other Hitman movies were good, this one is great."
5.0,25 May 2019,
8.0,27 April 2018,"It all comes down to the fact that Agent 47 doesn't look or act the part. The suit, gloves, his weapons - they're all very authentic, but his looks, voice, and especially his guns blazing style with explosions and insane noise making - it's all wrong. This isn't a silent assassin, it's more like Bruice WIllis in a suit on the set of Die Hard.

First thing I noticed about the ""world"" of this movie is how badly men are portrayed - generic ""fat losers playing games"", generic wife beaters, generic all bad things. And they're included for no reason whatsoever. Just your typical ""we threw this unrelated scene in here to remind you men are horrible because we are Hollywood"". The vast, general unoriginality of this movie is shining almost as bright as the visual effects inside the many computer screens showing flashy animations unlike how any software works in real life but like how they often appear in most bad hacker movies.

As per Hollywood law there's also a raggedy female sidekick wearing hipster homeless man clothes and untied shoes, waving a gun around (as you know, we need the strong whamen to be featured in every movie despite Agent 47's only minor sidekick being Agent Smith - a man, and even including him would've been a mistake).

What killed me is that suddenly Diana makes an appearance and she's a generic demanding asian woman instead of a classy, middle aged british woman. Laughed my ass off. How hard was it to at least do this one simple thing right and hire a british woman to play a british woman? I bet she'll be black in the next movie, and maybe black, transgender and with purple hair in the third one, right? Lame ass virtue signalling Hollywood racial politics b/s.

Seeing and hearing Diana, that's when I was finally like ""okay, I'm definitely not watching a Hitman movie"".

Also, 47 isn't even the main character. ""The girl"" is. She's worthless until 47 finds her, then suddenly she's a ""cool killing machine"". She's ungrateful and annoying, just the most generic forced female character. So the movie isn't even about 47. The camera's on her way more than him. It's trash show on all ends. Speaking of ends, the ending is just as corny as the rest of it, and far from anything related to the games. Where as in the games Diana and 47 have a connection and care for each other, asian Diana here seems to not because it's more edgy that way according to Hollywood.

Did I mention 47 ends up fighting a Terminator? Yes, it's not just Die Hard, ideas are rehashed from Terminator as well.

They seem to have taken clues only from the one Hitman game that nobody likes and didn't have much to do with the franchise itself - Absolution.

The best way to sum up this movie is calling it a mash-up of tired old action movie ideas with a knock-off Agent 47 thrown in it.

I could've enjoyed the action aspects of it at least, if the story was somehow related to the game, or if men weren't portrayed this badly in no relation to the plot or any reason whatsoever. Or if the actor playing Hitman at least sort of looked or sounded like him. I don't understand why you won't just hire the voice actor for Agent 47 - he might be an older gent but he looks and SOUNDS the part - make a movie about 47 in his later years, whatever, I don't know. Bruice Willis is old and still stars in action movies - it can work. Of course even getting the real deal to play 47, you'll need good writing and this didn't have that.

For fans of absolutely the most generic action movies of the 80's and 90's, and zero knowledge on the game series - you might enjoy this. For fans of the game series - you'll definitely not enjoy it, it's almost as bad as the previous Hitman movie with Timothy Olyphant, and that's some achievement."
4.0,30 January 2016,"Action movies have evolved into an artistic expression of killing. Except that the art is that of a five year old's finger painting. Efficiently kill when it is necessary and choose the most far-fetched elaborate means of killing when efficiency is too boring. What we get is a flimsy plot, putrid dialog, and contrived excuses for showing us the latest trick someone learned with his CGI program. An orgy of explosions, gunfire, car chases and choreographed fight scenes. Occasionally there will be some nudity but ""Hitman: Agent 47"" opted not to be so cliché.

Judging by what I've said so far you'd think I hate action flicks. Not so. I loved the Terminators, Die Hards, Predator, and.... There I go dating myself. It's just that as much as CGI has added to film making it has hurt almost equally as much. I know that there is some suspended disbelief in action films but how much of my brain do you want me to switch off?

So the question remains: where do we go from here? There are only so many laws of physics we can break. Come on, we have to be believable."
4.0,17 December 2015,"Greetings from Lithuania.

""Hitman: Agent 47"" (2015) is a very poor action nonsense. It is not involving, not impressive, not interesting and many things more of ""not"". For what it is, it's not worth your time or money. It is more like live action cartoon. Rupert Friend was by many more menacing in ""Homeland"" then in this flick. The movie lacks also any kind of humour - to have this kinda nonsense plot you have throw some humour because you can be deadly serious when having this kind of plot and premise.

Overall, ""Hitman: Agent 47"" is even worse then it predecessor. It has only one more or less cool scene which is in interrogation room, but it lacks only for ~3 min. Wheter you like the game or not, this movie best to avoid by any cause."

I haven't watched Hit-man before, so I was exceptionally happy with this movie: Good storyline, unexpected plot (not that unexpected, but come on, how many thousands and thousands of movies aren't out there?!) and good acting!

This movie kept me entertained and retained my attention during the whole movie (which cannot be said about a lot of other movies), so I will definitely recommend this movie for those wanting a break from the usual horror and romance-comedy movies.

10.0,23 March 2020,"Where to begin. This film just like the title, should be named 'Hitman Agent 007'. It's a cross between James bond and the 1st Terminator. If the action scenes were carried out in the game like they was in this film, you wouldn't of got passed the first level. Instead of an in-depth film about how he was made to be Agent 47 and getting in touch with how the personality was created, we get an invisible Terminator destructing and killing everything in his way from the jump. Making me feel like I couldn't of cared less if Agent 47 was shot down and then brutally decapitated anytime in this movie. His skills in silent assassination are about as smooth as grit painted on concrete. I think the guy in the movie got his barcode out of a Kellogg's cereal box. Say no more."
4.0,11 June 2019,"Only gave it one star for the actors. Really one of the worst movies, especially the bad action scenes."
2.0,24 August 2015,"The trouble with any kind of adaptation into film is that they're trying to take something that was perfectly suited for one medium and make it into something else. That's not to say that it's a bad idea, as many adaptation figure out what needs to change in order for a film representation to work. No one can tell an entire life story, so a biography needs to pick and choose which parts are important. A novel's pacing needs to be sped up in order to feel like a journey we're observing rather then reading about. So why are video games such a tough nut to crack?

The leading answer has to do with out main protagonist. At least in a biography or novel, we still have a fully established character that with the right actor can work in film format. A video game character may have some personality traits, but the idea is that YOU are the star. YOU'RE the one killing bad guys and saving the princess. Hit-man is a prime example of an empty shell that you take control of rather then watch for one's personal journey. After getting a film adaptation in 2009, Hit-man: Agent 47 gets another shot at a cinematic adventure.

In the heart of the Ukraine, a secret lab has been set that takes children and alters their genes in order to make them the ultimate killing machines. Gone are pain and most emotion in place of enhanced fighting skills and gunmanship. They are without names, but numbers that are forever implanted with a barcode in the back of their heads.

One successful agent is 47 (played by Rupert Friend), who in in Berlin tracking a young woman. She is Katia Van Dees (played by Hannah Ware) who herself is looking for a man she remembers, but doesn't even know who he is.

47 tracks her in Berlin where he prepares to encounter her. Just as he's getting closer, a CIA agent John Smith (played by Zachary Quinto) find her first and gets her away from the hit-man ala Terminator fashion. They try heading to the American embassy, but 47 gets inside and continues his hunt for the young woman. Just as Katia makes it to safety, she starts to sense uneasiness with John Smith and learns that 47 wants to keep her safe rather then kill her. He too has been looking for the same man and all traces lead to Singapore.

The idea of Hit-man has some potential as a film series. None of that is visible in Hit-man: Agent 47. I didn't know what to expect as I've never played the games, barley remember the original movie, and am not even sure if there's still an audience wanting a Hit-man movie. I guess I got what I expected, which was a mindless, action-spy thriller of sorts. I just don't know what Fox had in mind. Parts of the movie want to be a senseless, run and gun feature or an intriguing dive into the corruption of a mad scientist's experiment.

Hit-man: Agent 47 tries to meet halfway in the middle, coming out more like a Michael Bay film. I'll give it credit for at least being short, but that still can be a drag given that none of the actors offer much. I can understand Rupert Friend not having emotion, but I was surprised by how bland everyone else came out. How do you make the same guy who gave Spok on Star Trek new life emptiness? By putting him in this movie. I wasn't mad or even that disappointed with Hit-man: Agent 47 as this film only exists to fill in future space on cable television rainy afternoons.

I'll give this three barcode tattoos out of ten. Had the story been more crazy or even had bad actors, I would have felt more ripped off, but at the most, the movie is simply bland. I'd say check it out if you're a fan of the game, but most people will be scratching their heads wondering if this is still relevant."
3.0,30 March 2017,"I don't understand why this movie received so many bad reviews. Perhaps the film deviates from the comics and computer game it's supposed to be based on, neither of which I am familiar with.

All the actors gave excellent performances. I was especially impressed by Rupert Friend and Hannah Ware.

I saw this movie for the first time on TV and then bought the DVD for my collection. It's a great action/adventure/mystery/thriller film. I love how the two main characters progress from beginning to end. They were not what I expected and I was delighted.

I really hope there is a sequel to this film (hurry, please!) and that both Rupert Friend and Hannah Ware reprise their roles.

Very entertaining and enjoyable film!!"

1.0,29 October 2015,"As we wait for the day where a good video game movie will fall from the heavens and on to our movie screens, we have to sit through pieces of crap like Hit-man: Agent 47. This isn't just a bad adaptation of a video game, it is just simply a terrible movie. This was a complete bore-fest from start to finish with a few cool looking scenes occasionally. And to make it even better, it had literally nothing to do with the actual Hit-man games, why not just give it some other shitty name instead? By giving it the name 'Hitman' most people don't think of the popular video game, most people think of the 2007 adaptation, and trust me, you don't want people to relate your new film to that one.

The main problem with the movie was how dull it was, every damn scene was completely lifeless, emotionless and some of the most unexciting stuff i've seen all year. Even the action, that is supposed to be fast paced and exciting was terribly boring. Some of it looked cool but thats all it had going for it. When an 'Action' film can't capitalise on the 'Action' it is destined to fail, and you have to wonder if these people know how to actually make a movie. Then you look at the director and realise that this is the ONLY FILM HE HAS EVER DIRECTED, EVER, and he hasn't even been involved in any other films...... WTF? But hey, he's directed some music videos........ that counts..... right? You can even see it in the film, the way it is put together is really sloppy, the pace is all over the place, and the whole film is incredibly generic. Even the plot of the film is just terrible, predictable and borrows crap from other films. It wasn't interesting in any way whatsoever, and oh man the dialogue was an abomination. It was bland, emotionless and almost like they were reading off a prompt on set. You know what this felt like? It was in part just a rip-off of Terminator 2 without the time travel and SkyNet, except in this case everything was poorly executed.

The acting was really, really bad. There was no life at all to these characters, you don't like any of them, and because of that you aren't rooting for anyone. I don't know if ""be dull and boring' was the advice they were given, but if it was then hey, great job guys. The weirdest character has to have been the main heroine, Katia played by Hannah Ware. She had no character arc throughout and wasn't really developed or introduced in any way that explained her abilities. She also has some random sudden personality change late in the film that was out of no-where and made no sense at all. She has no chemistry with Rupert Friend and when half the movie was depending on that, it really showed.

In the end this movie was dumb, dull and downright boring. There was no fun, no excitement, the action looked kinda cool and i guess was well choreographed but wasn't entertaining to watch. And to top it all off, it had nothing to do with 'Hitman' so this film is just packed with disappointment for everyone. - 3.2/10"
3.0,7 September 2015,"Before I start I am a huge fan of the Hit-man games, so naturally I was disappointed by the movie. Their is no character development, the acting is mediocre at best and the action scenes use too many jump cuts. I felt that they didn't spend enough time on Agent 47 himself (Rupert Friend)and that it was mainly about the other lead girl (Hannah Ware)perhaps it should have been called Hitwomen Agent 90. I also felt that the movie was too short and that it completely strayed away from the game.It was just loud shootouts all the time. I mean Agent 47 is known for using the twin silverballers with silencers and I tell you he doesn't use the silencers once, at least in the previous hit-man film he uses them. However I did find that Rupert Friend was much better in the role than Timothy Olyphant was in 2007 you can see he was committed to the role and the cinematography was also quite good at times. If you want to watch a very dull action flick with no heart then this film is for you but as a film fanatic and a video gamer it certainly did not live up to the standards set by the game! 5/10"

10.0,11 September 2015,"My first major issue: what on earth does this movie have to do with Agent 47 or the entire Hit-man franchise, besides (obviously) the ""hitman"", who is similar in some parts of his appearance only? Besides him there is really only 2 characters that can be linked to the game; that is the ""father"" (who died in the first Hit-man game, hence a major plot hole) and who I can only guess is Diana, though she plays a completely insignificant part. All in all the storyline completely alien, there's really not much to add to that. So if you for some reason are interested to see any resemblance of the actual game just forget it, big movie fat cats decided to spew out another completely irrelevant movie.

My second major issue is the sci-fi part; the ""hitman"" can, apparently, see trough walls, sense people from a distance, see the future etc. What???? Is this Star Wars? Does he use the force or something? Why not just add light sabres and Bobba Fett just the same, would literally not spoil the movie and not sidetrack it, like at all! Also if you have watched Equilibrium you will see a lot of so called ""gun kata"" ripoff scenes, almost directly lifted from that movie.

Third issue: this is an action movie, pure and simple. Something along the lines of Transporter and the Bourne franchise, so if you like that action/thriller genre, by all means this movie is a blast. But then why call it ""hitman"" if the game is about not some superman but an incredibly cunning character, who uses lots of stealth, is by no means immortal, and chooses his fights very carefully and does (Hint, hint! The name!) a lot of Assassinations! And the game was pretty much aimed at making the player being the best assassin possible; ie sneak, kill target only, leave everyone else preferably unhurt and clueless, not go in guns blazing... because that would cost you dearly.

Sorry but this time, yet again, as Hollwood has already sharpened its axe with many encounters with various novels, this time they beheaded a game franchise with it. Now I can only guess why they did it, most likely a complete vacuum of new ideas, but given the fact that games a very.... very... very hard to translate into movies without the final product being too cheesy or completely ""off topic"", they should have picked something different.

This movie is just another nail in the coffin for cinema that engages the viewer, rather, it is a prime example of a fast-food version of cinema; quick, very simple, and made for the masses the same way as livestock feed is. It is no fine dining for the grey matter, that's for sure.

And lastly I would like to say that though I am always looking forward to games made into movies, crossing my fingers so hard they almost snap at the joints, 90% of the time it ends as a huge letdown. One game though, ""hitman: contracts"" could be made into an epic film noire / slasher / thriller combo, but would require and extremely good script writer, and an even more talented director, and now that there's been two Hit-man movies and both are complete s***, this option is perhaps reserved for an alternate universe where Hollywood is not the cinema version of McDonalds."
2.0,30 August 2015,"For me it looks like Hollywood has very poor quality right now. Worst and worst every year. Now new ideas. From great Hit-man game story they created few Audi Commercialsin one movie and few theater look fight scenes. What kind of camera did they use ? I don't know but probably some cheap one. Many scene in this movie looks like theater or TV series, not like cinema movies. Completely no storyline, poor soundtrack (only trailer song was great) They said this movie is based on IO Interactive game but it's not. Not even close. In the game there is a great storyline, great mood. In the movie there is nothing like that. Screenplay for the movie should be created by IO Interactive Team instead Hollywood studio. This would be much better. IO Interactive knows how to create good story. Hollywood people - not. They totally destroy great Hit-man story and were unable to properly use Ruperts Firend acting skills. Previous Hit-man was not too good but better."

5.0,19 November 2018,Review: I really liked this movie because it shows that hitman may have human compassion based on the situation. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
4.0,28 August 2015,"If you were a fan of Timothy Oliphant's ""Hitman"" (2007), avoid this new version which borrows only slightly from the original. The plot itself is reasonable, but the acting is so stiff that it's hard to be engaged. Of course if the basic premise is that ""agents"" are designed to show minimal emotions, you're not going to expect to see Brando-like histrionics on the screen. But just about everyone is devoid of any facial or tonal expressions. And what happened with casting Jurgen Prochnow (""Das Boot"") for a 30 second cameo? Only Ciaran Hinds (""Above Suspicion"") turns in a reasonable performance.

The best thing about this film is the location shooting in Singapore."
9.0,2 September 2015,"In addition to writing the story and co-writing the screenplay, ""Skip Woods"" also produced the film, and was the only producer credited who was not a member of the Producer's Guild. Also, the other screenwriter (Michael Finch) did not work directly with Woods, as his name was separated by the word *and*, rather than an ampersand, &. This all makes it a bit more suspect as to whether ""Skip Woods"" is a real person, or just a pseudonym, as some believe.

Anyway, I liked some of the aerial photography of Berlin, and Singapore (two places I enjoyed visiting several years ago, which brought back fond memories) and 47's suit looked quite nice also (I've always appreciated a nice suit as well) and the girl is cute, but the remainder of this was a slick looking void, one part video game, one part Terminator ripoff. Film's first action sequence amounts to nothing more than 47 striking poses in slow motion, as he takes out a seemingly never ending series of anonymous henchmen, followed by Terminator rehashed for about a half an hour, topped with some of the stupidest character behaviour (Katia gets bored and decides to dismantle 47's guns while he's sleeping!) and a ridiculous exploding helicopter climax, with some of the poorest CGI explosion effects I've seen since Asylum's Scyfy network garbage.

Of course, all of these things could make it laughably bad, however, if that is what one is looking for. Personally though, I just didn't get it."
5.0,6 February 2016,"Review: I really wasn't expecting that much from this movie because there wasn't much hype when it was originally released but it actually wasn't that bad. The action scenes were pretty impressive and the storyline was detailed and put together well. Rupert Friend was the perfect choice for Agent 47 and Hannah Ware put her new found abilities to good use but it seemed very straight laced and to the point. Rupert Friend plays Agent 47, whose an genetically enhanced super soldier created by Doctor Pitor Litvenko (Ciaran Hinds). The Russian geneticist, disappears before the completion of the Agents project and leaves behind his daughter, Katia (Hannah Ware) who is being hunted down by agent 47, who works as a hit-man for the ICA (International Contracts Agency) and is contracted to find her father. His most recent targets were mercenaries led by Delriego (Rolf Kanies) who have been trying to find Litvenko in order to recreate the Agent program for his own means. Meanwhile, Katia is living in Berlin and is also looking for her father and constantly deals with her acute ability to see and hear things well outside a person's normal sensory radius. Whilst travelling on a subway, Katia is approached by a man who calls himself John Smith (Zachary Quinto), who tells her that agent 47 is on his way to kill her and that he is there to protect her and has information about her father. She then puts her life in his hands and they manage to escape from Agent 47, who grazes Katia's arm with a sniper shot. They then hide out in a hotel room were Katia reveals her information to find her father. John Smith tells her that he is working for Syndicate International and he tells her that her father can speak 3 languages and has stage 3 Lung cancer. When they put together all of the clues, Katia works out were her father could be but Agent 47 bursts through the door and kills Smith before knocking out Katia. When she wakes up, Agent 47 tells her that she is also an agent and that her abilities are more advanced than his. He then explains how she can channel her amazing abilities during combat against the Syndicates henchmen. John Smith then reappears and reveals that he has an engineered subdermal body armor which means that he can take gunshots without being harmed. After escaping from Smith and the Syndicates henchmen again, Katia makes the agent promise that her father won't be harmed if she reveals his location, which is in Singapore. When they eventually find Litvenko, he explains to Katia why he had to abandon her at such a young age and he refers to agent 47 as her brother. He constantly uses his inhaler, which he keeps close by his side and they become under attack by the syndicate, who capture Litvenko and put him through gruesome torture because they want him to reopen the agent program. Katia crashes a helicopter into the Syndicates headquarters and agent 47 gets through there security, disguised as a firefighter. They then fight against the Syndicates henchmen and agent 47 comes face to face with John Smith, who he eventually defeats by electrocuting him. On the rooftop, the head of the Syndicate, LeClerq, manages to escape with Litvenko in a helicopter while Agent 47 and Katia are fighting against the security and Litvenko detonates the inhaler, which turns out to be an explosive which Agent 47 handed to him earlier. There is a sense of intensity throughout the movie which made it interesting. I can tell that most of the budget went on the action scenes because there isn't any A-Class actors, who would have made the movie more attractive to audiences. With that aside, I still enjoyed it and I hope that the next one will have some top actors on board. Enjoyable!

Round-Up: When I first saw the trailers for this movie, I really thought that it was Orlando Bloom in the lead because he really does look like Rupert Friend, 34, whose known for his performances in Homeland, Young Victoria and Pride and Prejudice. He also starred in the great Starred Up, The Libertine, The Last Legion and the weird Zero Theorem so he has some experience in front of the camera. This is the first movie directed by, Polish born Aleksander Bach who took on quite a big project as his first movie. He done quite a good job, in terms of the action and the intense storyline but it still felt like it was missing something. For a franchise that didn't go down to well in the past, it certainly made a big profit at the box office and judging by the ending, I'm sure we're going to see another movie in this franchise soon.

Budget: $35million Worldwide Gross: $83million

5.0,14 December 2023,"Restart of the Hitman series, even though there was only one previously. Based on the video game. Now, I really liked the game, but there is nothing new or original here, not even fan service. The new actor just looks wrong. He should be bald, not have a 5-day scalp growth. And I couldn't get past his really weak jawline, not something I thought fit the character at all.

And again, a cut to black, inconclusive ending, and an end credit sequence setting up a sequel. Yawn.

This movie isn't that old, but considering how long wire removal effects have been around, one would think they could do tire (track) removal as well. It's obvious that a certain take has been done several times when there are tire tracks showing you where they're going to skid."

While the films are based on Edios' video game series, Hit-man: Agent 47 (2015) is another story featuring the cue-bald assassin who is assigned to terminate a woman who has the ability to see the future (even the past) and another agent starts to go after them. This may sounded like another Terminator-like retelling while the action being the main highlight as for the rest I didn't cared much. And yes, I would prefer the first film myself instead this sequel for which concludes this review since everything else in the film just faded away and can't expect to have a better sequel in the future. Sorry, action gamers.

My Rating: 2/5"
5.0,19 February 2019,"In addition to the classic biochemistry and Laura (relying on the popularity of the protagonists), the adaptation of the game can only expect Warcraft (relying on faith and a variety of historical stories). Shooting all seconds, standing unshielded seconds 360 degrees, the protagonist halo is too strong"
4.0,5 May 2020,"You know this is a bad movie when even the gunshot sounds was ridicilous... bad acting, dumb fight scenes, dull action scenes... I don't recommend this movie at all... 3.5/10"
5.0,12 November 2017,"I'm afraid I don't share your opinion on this one, people. With the twists and 47 not being only a silent killing machine who just walks around murdering people, this movie is absolutely fantastic. I know people can hardly let go of what they got used to, just like with Duke Nukem Forever and its previous games. Still, this movie is a masterpiece."
5.0,23 October 2015,
10.0,14 September 2015,"Eight years have passed since the abysmal adaption Hit-man. Timothy Olyphant's agent was bland, clunky and awkward. Rupert Friend's agent fairs just as bad. He's the 47th human that's been genetically enhanced since birth, brought up to be a contract assassin, killing with no emotion. Emotions have been stripped from 47, making him the least affectionate character in film since the 2007 excursion. 47's helps a woman (Hannah Ware) find her father and discover the truth behind her dark past. Others are out to find her father and kill him, including crooked agent Zachary Quinto. All characters are bland, including Hannah Ware's Katia, the only one showing any emotion, made weak by a boring script. There's plenty of action, though. The kill count's high and the blood runs deep but the choreography's regimented and robotic. 47's never in danger. A few well-done set-pieces occur in Hit-man's 90 odd minutes, just enough to keep the mind occupied."

4.0,16 December 2020,"I don't know but i think that Friend is not good actor for this kind of action movie. First ""Hitman"" movie was hit on target, same as actor Timothy Olyphant. They said that new Hitman movie will be pronounced in 2021, and I really hope that Timothy Olyphant is new/old actor, it would be pleasure to watch him again as Agent 47."
1.0,23 April 2020,"I did not know about this movie. I just played the game. My friend suggest me to watch this movie. After seeing this, I found that movie can me more attractive than a video game. Thanks Jeff, you suggested me to watch this."
4.0,3 December 2015,"If you're anything like me, you get really excited when they bring your favorite gaming title to the big screen (personally, I'm still waiting for Zelda).

Then there is that moment you think to yourself... ""But what if it sucks?""

Well without ranting away on why video games always suck when they come to cinema (Super Mario Bros, Resident Evil, Doom, Silent Hill, Prince of Persia, Max Payne, Mortal Kombat... actually I loved that one when I was 9), Hit-man unfortunately suffers from the same curse.

Let's just look at the film for a moment. First off, the film tries to set up the premise of the whole Hit-man franchise in about... 2 minutes. The problem with the sped up back story is that you have no time to digest this massive amount of plot... I know what you're thinking, ""But they already covered that in the FIRST Hit-man movie with Timothy Olyphant!!!"" Well hold on there a second. These movies are not even related. The plot for the first film in 2007 has nothing to do with this one. The only relationship is the title character with the bar-code tattoo and a murderous skill set. It would have been better just to make THIS movie based on the first 5 minutes of the film. It would have made a much better plot than the rest of this rubbish.

Action wise... yeah okay it's cool watching him shoot a bunch of people, but after his 100th kill it's a bit repetitive. 1 shot... 1 kill... repeat... blah.

Personally, I think it suffers the same problem as every other video game adaptation. In a game you control what happens, you bond with your characters, and you have to live (or die) by the consequences of your actions. This is just... forcing you to bear witness to a single series of events that are so... FORCEFULLY action-packed that you get bored pretty quick.

I suggest dusting off the old ps2, playing the games, and discovering why Agent 47 is such a bad ass. It's his silent kills that make him such a bad ass anyway."
9.0,13 January 2022,"""Hitman: Agent 47"" is a Crime - Thriller movie in which we watch an assassin helping a woman finding her father while trying to solve the mysteries of her ancestry and the history behind her.

Since I had already watched and enjoyed ""Hitman"" of 2007, I had high expectations from this movie but I was disappointed by the result that I watched. The interpretations of both Rupert Friend who played as Agent 47 and Hannah Ware who played as Katia were average. The direction which was made by Aleksander Bach was below average. Lastly, I have to say that ""Hitman: Agent 47"" is an average movie and I am sure you will enjoy it if you have not watched ""Hitman"" of 2007. If you have watched it then I advise you either to skip it or to lower your expectations otherwise I am sure you will be disappointed."
4.0,3 July 2021,"I'm a big fan of the game series and this movie does the game series a disservice its not even close to any of the games, its also a boring movie. Total Waste of time, dont bother. The first one is better, but not close to being good. If I could give this movie a zero I would."
5.0,22 December 2018,Literally copies the first Terminator film scene for scene
5.0,13 December 2015,"In the intro credits we learn how the Agent came about and that the main researcher vanished at some point. His daughter is the key to finding him, and the Syndicate is eager to find him to restart the program.

The daughter Katia, now an attractive adult is herself looking for her father, but she also seems to have heightened senses if not downright clairvoyance. A guy named Smith approaches her and tells her that someone is after her and offers protection. And indeed, Agent 47 shows up shooting up the place and fighting with Smith. They manage to escape and Katia reveals her research on her father to Smith, based on intel he shares, she thinks she known where he is. 47 shows up again and shoots Smith. There is a revelation about Katia identity and her relationship to 47. Now both 47 and Katia join forces to find the father as Smith and his goons are out to get them and the dad as well.

In the process there are car chases, plenty of fights and shootouts. They do find the old man who eventually is grabbed by the Syndicates boss, someone many agents have failed to eliminate. Will 47 succeed with the help of Katia and her dad?

First things first. Gamers by now should have leaned that video games don't make good source material for movies, hence most movie adaptations are poor. Except that Hit-man: Agent 47 is very good. Still, as reviews here show, gamers aren't satisfied and they never will be. And that's fine. The game is a game, the movie is a movie. I don't care whether this is faithful or not, or whether it conforms to someone's fantasy of the games. As an action movie Hit-man: Agent 47 is very satisfying. You have a very strong cast in Friend, Ware, Hinds, Kretschmann. Now the problem is that few actors can pull off the bald look--Olyphant didn't, Friend does it a little better but he's still not the ideal Hit-man, despite being a great actor. Ware does a good job as the girl who unwillingly and unwittingly finds herself thrust in the role of an action heroine. But once she pulls her lovely hair back, it's on. Hinds is always great, and reminded me here a bit of DeNiro.

The story is strong and offers some surprises. The movie is very stylish, in the typical German modern style. All the fight scenes are good and thrilling, but they are not as loud as American fights. And it's surprising when a punch isn't accompanied by the usual excessively loud sound of cabbage being beaten.

In the end, I wanted more Hit-man: Agent 47, a longer movie that could have clarified the story a bit more, more fights, more stunts. This movie compared to most action movies these days is far more restrained in its ambitions. And that's fine. 47 and Katia make a great pair for future sequels."

8.0,29 September 2024,"It kind of looks good, the actors are alright, the locations are great, it should have all of the ingredients to work but it never really pull it off... Somehow this super action assassin Flick just always manages to miss the point, underdevelop the character, You name it, they've missed it... A lack of continuity, plot holes that make you cringe I want it to work but it just doesn't, it worked for me as a couple of hours of mindless entertainment I think maybe I should have watched Romcom instead.

It did make me curious about Robert Friend though, I think with a good script he could be rather good."
4.0,31 October 2015,"This movie don't have the best story, but have a lot of action i liked this movie, there are some things that are in the game and if you play it you can understand better but honestly i prefer the first hit-man movie with Timothy Olyphant, the part with the red car in front of all the people in the street, come on, what part of silent assassin the producers don't understand, i bet they never play the game, Hit-man is all about stealth and being a silent assassin, but this is a plain insult to the Hit-man franchise.If you're a fan of the games, you'll hate this movie, if you don't know the games, you'll find it average.Wouldn't recommend this ''movie'' to anyone."

It has good action scenes and to me the ideas for how the characters see things I found innovative and pretty cool. Good cast. Good acting. Caught stuff the second time I watched it which made the story make more sense. Its like any movie translating from a book. There are changes, but unlike video games, books are much more indept with the details. I feel like video game movies get more freedom because it doesn't have as much development."
3.0,12 September 2016,"Agent 47 (Rupert Friend) is a genetically engineered assassin created by Doctor Petr Litvenko (Ciarán Hinds). Katia van Dees (Hannah Ware) is stressed by her super awareness. She is looking for her father and is approached by John Smith (Zachary Quinto) who offers to protect her. Agent 47 is coming after her but not necessarily for the expected.

The twist is cool but nothing else is. The play on name is a fun little reveal. The characters are charisma-free. Agent 47 has never seems to be lead character material. Katia could be the lead but Hannah Ware doesn't have it. She is absolutely stunning but there is a lack of power. The action is mostly chaos with a few cool moments. This is not a compelling movie."

Once again, this was one of those movies I didn't expect to be really good; I just couldn't leave it unseen.

8.0,10 December 2015,"As a Hit-man games series, I simply don't understand how IO Interactive lets the image of a legendary character of 47 ruined by some 2nd degree Hollywood people. Instead of trying to make him look like a hero, make him a super villain, ""the bad guy"" to create the real image of 47. Nowadays villains are more attractive people in action movies if you can create a good image.

And please, no more Zachary Quinto. This guy is no actor... Better casting is needed.

Still, I was smiling when I some scenes from the game series. 5/10 is because I love 47.

Ok here is what you got Bad story Bad plot The actor wasn't bad, yet he didnt understand the character If you want to change the context and character that much why would you name the film after a loved franchise? Create a new one..."

10.0,1 January 2016,"If this as nothing to do with the game please do not name it Hit-man.

The firts second the actor who plays 47 appears i just stop watching the film, its so wrong wrong. The story is crappy the action typical of bad movie.

Is it possible there is no actor,who is not A list that can play this char, blank face and shaved head, come on there is a video game to be based on it.There will be only, one Hit-man movie tha will be good,and as to be produce and write by someone who loves and understands the game. If the game is so sucefull, why this movies aren't made by the game company."

9.0,13 January 2016,"Genetically engineered Agent 47 (Rupert Friend) needs to find Katia (Hannah Ware) the daughter of Dr Litvenkoi (Ciaran Hinds) the creator of these special agents so that she will lead him to her father (Litvenko) who will lead him to bad guy Le Clerq (Thomas Kretschmann) who wants to amass an army of these super agents. Agent 47 needs to insure any program to create these agents is destroyed.

This is every bit as good as the Hit-man movie with Timothy Olyphant and that was terrific. Yes, this is based upon a video game, but there is a story in here with many twists. Of course, we like Agent 47 taking out all bad guys and even some good guys (say what?) in a police station. We are intrigued and like the relationship between Agent 47 and Katia, who has a secret within her that she is unaware of. Oh, oh, what could it be? No worries as Agent 47 tells her what that secret is and we are off to the races.. so to speak.

Some of the stunts - CGI or otherwise - are simply almost unbelievable: Agent 47's get-a-way car being harpooned (being what?) in a busy city intersection is probably the best one. The stunts throughout do not disappoint and there are many of them. Yeaaaaay! (are you forgetting about the helicopter going through a hi-rise office building windows?)

Zachary Quinto does a very good job as John Smith who also needs to find Katia and kill Agent 47. Perhaps the best lines in here: John Smith: "" If you give me what I want, I will leave your daughter in peace."" Litvenko: ""If I give you what you want, there will be no peace.""

A nice touch is seeing some very good scenery and buildings in Singapore.

A special shout out must go to Rupert Friend. We saw him as CIA Agent Peter Quinn in the TV show Homeland and wondered if he would get a shot at being a James Bond type in the future. We now have our answer: Yeaaaay! He is every bit as good as Timothy Olyphant was in the 2007 Hit-man movie. Kudos.

But talk about a special shout-out, we cannot overlook Hannah Ware as Katia. She is beautiful, can act, and can fight too. Hey, she has her moments. You really need to know the secret Agent 47 told her about. Did I give something away? Hmmmdoes not matter. She is fantastic.

The very last scenes give us hope for sequels. Yeaaaaay !!! (9/10)

Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Some, not much."

8.0,27 November 2016,"I was honestly shocked at the score on here, so much so I made an account. I've played the game, I watched Timothy Olyphants version... yet this film I loved! Yes okay Agent 47 wasn't as stealthy as portrayed in the games but in the games, you're in control and apart of the action, which makes it riveting, to sit and watch that as a film would be rather boring to say the least. From what I've read of other reviews this seems to be the main reason for the low score, which I thought unfair. I thoroughly enjoyed this film, jam packed with action, (action that's fast paced but shown in such a clever way you can see it all played out if that makes sense) the actors were I thought spot on, I hadn't heard of Rupert Friend before which put me off watching it a little but I will most definitely be watching out for him in the future. Apart from the not so clean shaven head I thought he nailed it."
8.0,24 December 2016,"Only not a 10/10 because, they just go to Singapore and go to any Orchard and find him? Should be a search scene for this.

Also the actor (For Agent 47) wasn't the best cast, but he wasn't for the worst. I would like to see someone who could portray him a little better.

This movie was really good, the plot, the rest of the casting, the acting and special FX were really good! I have played Absolution, a tiny bit of blood money and the new Hit-man.

Now you could argue that the Hit-man in the film is not like the one in the games, while that is half true the movie is still pretty good!

So if you were to base it off the game and how much it reflected it and detail? Probably a 7/10 movie

For a movie itself not going off the game? A 9/10 or 10/10 movie

(Not really a spoiler) A cliffhanger was left, so I guess we'll see another"
8.0,27 November 2018,"Honestly speaking, it is very true that the movie doesnt exactly follow the trend of the game, but that shouldnt be used as a total benchmark to judge the movie. I for one, found the movie quite interesting and enjoyable. I dont understand all this critics, if the movie was exactly like the game, what would be the point making it if we are already aware of what would happen. I strongly feel that the differences were worth it."

The acting is good. The effects are pretty cool. The plot is good enough to keep you interested. The action is enjoyable. It's choreographed fairly well, and the car chase scene was pretty awesome. There are a few points of humor. I don't know if they were intentional or not, but we got a few laughs.

If you're looking for an enjoyable action film, this one is worth a mention. We got into the movie and will probably see the next one if there is one."
8.0,14 January 2016,"Hit-man:agent 47 is a great action movie and is the best video game movie in years. because I know there are a lot of bad ones. But this one is different from them. The plot is about an agent program that has these killing lethal killing machines but then the government demanded the creators to destroy it and to destroy every robot. But one of them survives and that is agent 47. Agent 47 is finding the creator's daughter and it's up to them to put a stop to the agent program once and for all. It has a wonderful script, well made action scenes, and great soundtrack. This film does not disappoint. And I can't wait for a sequel and future films the director will make. Hopefully maybe a new Lara croft movie. Have fun watching Hit-man."

8.0,9 August 2023,"""Hitman: Agent 47"" is a slick and stylish action thriller that will satisfy fans of the popular video game franchise. Directed by Aleksander Bach, this fast-paced movie brings the iconic character Agent 47 to the big screen with a thrilling plot and adrenaline-fueled action sequences.

As they dive deeper into a dangerous conspiracy, they find themselves pursued by a ruthless organization determined to eliminate them. The story unfolds with twists and turns, keeping audiences engaged and on the edge of their seats.

Rupert Friend delivers a captivating performance as Agent 47, perfectly capturing the character's calculated demeanor and lethal skills. His intense presence and physicality bring the iconic assassin to life, making him a compelling protagonist. Hannah Ware shines as Katia, displaying both vulnerability and strength as she embarks on a journey of self-discovery.

The action sequences in ""Hitman: Agent 47"" are a definite highlight. From explosive gunfights to exhilarating hand-to-hand combat, the film delivers adrenaline-pumping moments that will leave action enthusiasts satisfied. The fight choreography is skillfully executed, showcasing Agent 47's precision and lethal abilities.

Visually, the film is stunning, with sleek cinematography and stylish production design. The settings, ranging from bustling cityscapes to opulent interiors, create a visually immersive experience. The film's color palette and atmospheric lighting add to the overall mood, enhancing the suspenseful tone.

While the film excels in its action and visual aspects, the storyline could have been more fleshed out. The plot occasionally feels formulaic and lacks deeper character development. However, the film compensates for this with its intense pacing and thrilling set pieces, making it an enjoyable watch for action aficionados.

""Hitman: Agent 47"" is a solid addition to the action genre, paying homage to the beloved video game franchise. It delivers on its promise of stylish action and high-stakes thrills, propelled by Rupert Friend's strong performance as the iconic Agent 47. If you're seeking an adrenaline-fueled ride with impressive visuals and intense action sequences, this film is worth a watch."
8.0,17 July 2022,"I didn't really expect an oscar-worthy script. Production and action scenes were great. Quick-paced storytelling. CGI was tasteful. Very entertaining. Maybe disappointing for people who have played the game, but that's their experience. Not mine."
8.0,23 January 2022,"With fast, sleek action, supernatural special effects, John Wick calibre shoot 'em ups and high-octane car chases, this film stands on its own as a fun entertainment experience. No need to compare it to the video game or the previous movie. Although absent of any compelling (or even coherent) story line, unless you're looking for Shakespearean poignancy or challenging philosophical considerations. The acting is in tune enough with the vacuous premise so that you can just lighten up and enjoy the show."
8.0,20 March 2022,"It's a slick, fast-paced action film. It's not pretending to be anything else. I actually found it a ton of fun.

It's trope filled so it's not meant to be taken too seriously and I think the acting is perfect for the archetypes they portray. The stern Agent searching for a mysterious scientist. People being killed in new and cinematic ways, never super gory but always entertaining. Everything is so pretty and shiny, the actors, the visuals, it has a really polished almost heightened reality look.

I've never played the games, so what do I know, but I think this film has a distinctive quality that elevates it to feeling almost artistic, well choreographed, like a ballet or something.

Some truly memorable sequences including a chase in a multi-storey car park and the final showdown. I've seen this film more than once and it's just as good on a rewatch.

Nice bit of escapism. Great film to watch with beer and a pizza."
8.0,12 May 2016,"This was not the ordinary Hit-man movie. It took risk by introducing new concepts to the agent program, and it paid off. This would be a great way to start a new series for the Hit-man story.

Agent 47 was much more tactical than what was ever shown before. His intelligence is through the roof. His gear is innovative and deadly. But his suit and tie are still the same, and it should be kept that way for future installments to the Hit-man series.

But with this movie, there was a different and interesting twist to it. There was a female agent by the name of Katia van Dees, played by Hannah Ware. People are used to seeing a shaved headed male as the hit-man agent, and it was time for change. This gave the story a bit more of an edge to it, and it introduces a new direction for the series. She was much more effective than Agent 47 in every way. Katia did not know it at first, but with 47's help, it was all realized. Katia's speed, intelligence, anticipation, and tactical skills all exceeded that of 47.

Many may not like this Hit-man movie because of the introduction to Katia van Dees as an agent, but it provides a new opportunity for viewers to experience something greater instead of the usual and ordinary type of story."
5.24,25 December 2023,"As a woman who play computergames and prefers action/fantasy/adventure, suspense, Godzilla or Jurassic park movies over chick flicks or ""girl movies"". I enjoyed this film! I haven't played the game(s?) but I like the idea and ""world"". And perhaps that is what some people find annoying and thus give a lower score? I'm not sure. I watched it in my hotel room before going to sleep and I thought it was totally worth the time.

I think the acting was good and the cinematography was also nice, I had no complaints when I watched it. I only got frustrated with one character but it was totally bearable :)"
5.24,24 January 2022,"My wife and I both thought the rating was a little low. This movie was fun..it had some great creative action sequences and the acting was good. At first, like others, I was questioning the lead because he didn't look like a lead. In the end, he was great and carried the film well. Maybe Hollywood should take more chances and use lesser known actors that can actually act, like this guy can. The lead actress is beautiful and subtle. The storyline was adequate for the genre. Overall, pleasantly surprised."
5.24,19 December 2015,"Ever since I have seen the Matrix, which is my favourite movie of all time, I don't expect much from action films, and keep my bar relatively low, except for Marvel movies. Given that, I think this movie was one of the best action flicks I had the pleasure to enjoy at the cinema in 2015. I should add that I have never played the video game.

I don't expect an action movie to be believable, or to have a great plot. I just want a confident character with superior fighting skills who takes out the bad guys, and a little bit of ""what's going to happen next?"" even if I can guess most of the time.

So if you are an action fan like me, ignore what everyone is saying and watch this movie. You will be entertained."
5.24,30 March 2023,"Horrendous acting right from the start a boring , spaced out zombie like feel with no feeling of action or suspense a cheap money grabbing movie with no thought behind it so much too work with with the initial opening story it went so badly wrong the action scenes are so plain nothing even remotely exiting the only hint of this being an action movie is the explosions.the main character was dull the scenes felt rushed too the whole movie needs scraping and starting over it was so bad that I'm not even lying I turned it off you couldn't pay me too sit through that movie even if it was short no amount of money was worth that much boredom truly horrendous work And dis credit too the franchise of hit man and a disgrace especially for those of us who liked the first movie which wasn't perfect but atbleast it provided some entertainment and a few memorable scenes if someone asks me worst movie of 2015 this would be it it as it's certainly going too be memorable but for all the wrong reasons."
5.24,23 November 2015,"Trained and genetically engineered to be the ultimate killing machine, one agent will stop at nothing to put an end to a corporation's plans of creating an army of super assassins.

Award-winning Polish music video director Aleksander Bach makes his debut to the big screen with his first full-length feature film, Hit-man: Agent 47, a ""modern"" reboot of the infamous 2007 video game adaption Hit-man. Is it just me, or does it feel kind of silly to be rebooting a mostly forgettable film that's not even that old yet? Not that I hated the original, but I certainly never had the craving to watch it ever again. Obviously this raises a pretty obvious question: why did I bother watching this new Hit-man film in the first place? To be quite honest I have no clue. I suppose I often feel the need to give critically panned films a fighting chance as some of these underdogs end up becoming some of my most loved flicks. Take Neil Blomkamp's Chappie or the hilariously epic '90s slapstick comedy Beverly Hills Ninja for instance. Nevertheless, I have to agree with the bulk of the critics this time around. Despite having an unquestionably talented cast, this latest action flick doesn't really offer enough memorable moments worth mentioning.

Hit-man: Agent 47 carries itself with cold and violent force, effortlessly keeping a straight face throughout, but that's not necessarily a compliment. Where the action sequences prevail, the yawn-inspiring script continuously sets things up for failure. Action without depth is like a grilled cheese without the cheese: dry, bland, and easily crumbles from its lack of integrity. Served with an unimpressive side of ""thin plot"" and a tall glass of ""0.5 % character development,"" Agent 47 clearly failed to satisfy this action enthusiast.

Maybe if I would have played the video games that this film's loosely based on, I would have appreciated this live-action adaption a little more. Judging by most fans of the games themselves though, it sounds like they're genuinely disappointed with the misguided adaption of their beloved character, 47. Perhaps it's time studios give the green light only to directors who're actual gamers that have at least played the games the movies are based on. This certainly paid off in the recent Crackle original Dead Rising: Watchtower. But what's done is done, and from this poor attempt to reboot a potential Hit-man film franchise, I'm betting we won't be seeing any sequels in the near future."
