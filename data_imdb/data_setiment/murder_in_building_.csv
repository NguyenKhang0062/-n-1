0,0,9.0,22 October 2021,"Season 1 (9/10) When this series came my girlfriend wasn't especially interested. I'm a huge fan of comedy mysteries and loved Steve Martin when I was young, but her enthusiasm for either is mild.

But after five minutes I had to stop and make her watch it, because we are New Yorkers and this series nails New York in five minutes. The weird relationships with by-passers, the artsy types, the justified paranoia, it was all there and immediately hilarious.

The series is about a trio of murder-podcast fanatics who bond over an actual murder in their luxury apartment building. Soon they are investigating and podcasting. But they are also each keeping secrets from one another in a wonderful mysteries-in-a-mystery structure. Everyone has secrets, the series says, and digging deep is fascinating exercise.

The cast is terrific. Martin is low-key funny, Short, who I am generally lukewarm towards, is very funny as a flamboyant theater director, and Selena Gomez more than holds her own as a hilariously snarky temporary tenant.

This show has been a hot-ticket item as far as I know - certainly my friends (and fellow New Yorkers) love it - so I was shocked to see how many user reviews just hate this show, or only find it mediocre, to the point where they insist all favorable reviews are paid for. This response is inexplicable to me. The show is amazing. When a new episode dropped we watched it immediately. It's just so, so, so, so good.

Ignore the naysayers, this is a must watch.

Other seasons: Season 2 (8/10): A shade weaker than the first season, but still excellent.

Season 3 (6/10): What the hell happened? Season 3 had Steve Martin playing his character as a complete idiot and after 2 great seasons, Selena Gomez turned lackluster - more glum and less snarkily witty. And when the mystery was solved, oh my God these were the most nonsensical motives you could come up with.

Sure, there were still good moments, good guest stars, surprisingly enjoyable songs. But OMG.","August 31, 2021 (United States)",season when this series came my girlfriend wasnt especially interested im a huge fan of comedy mysteries and loved steve martin when i was young but her enthusiasm for either is mild but after five minutes i had to stop and make her watch it because we are new yorkers and this series nails new york in five minutes the weird relationships with bypassers the artsy types the justified paranoia it was all there and immediately hilarious the series is about a trio of murderpodcast fanatics who bond over an actual murder in their luxury apartment building soon they are investigating and podcasting but they are also each keeping secrets from one another in a wonderful mysteriesinamystery structure everyone has secrets the series says and digging deep is fascinating exercise the cast is terrific martin is lowkey funny short who i am generally lukewarm towards is very funny as a flamboyant theater director and selena gomez more than holds her own as a hilariously snarky temporary tenant this show has been a hotticket item as far as i know certainly my friends and fellow new yorkers love it so i was shocked to see how many user reviews just hate this show or only find it mediocre to the point where they insist all favorable reviews are paid for this response is inexplicable to me the show is amazing when a new episode dropped we watched it immediately its just so so so so good ignore the naysayers this is a must watch other seasons season a shade weaker than the first season but still excellent season what the hell happened season had steve martin playing his character as a complete idiot and after great seasons selena gomez turned lackluster more glum and less snarkily witty and when the mystery was solved oh my god these were the most nonsensical motives you could come up with sure there were still good moments good guest stars surprisingly enjoyable songs but omg,POSITIVE
1,1,8.0,11 September 2022,"So I just finished watching Only Murders in the Building and have to say I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. I originally had no intent on watching because it looked like a show aimed for people 60+ years old. I was wrong. After seeing all the great reviews and all the award nominations for both seasons I finally gave in and watched it. It's a funny who dun it kind of show. It's about three strangers who all love true crime podcasts and then all of a sudden find themselves making one of their own from a murder in their own building. These three (Selena Gomez, Steve Martin and Martin Short) start to put together the clues to find the murderer. The series has something for everyone. If you're looking for a show to just have a good time with and keep you entertained then give this a try.

2,2,8.0,29 September 2022,"I was actually surprised by how much I liked Only Murders in the Building. There's a reason that both seasons have been nominated and won so many awards. The cast (Selena Gomez, Steve Martin, Martin Short) and writing is what makes this show so special. Martin and Short play off one another like the legends they are and Gomez is a lot better actress than I expected. The three of them are just so likable and easy to root for in this series. This show was so good and every episode is so entertaining that I binged both seasons over the course of a weekend. It's a murder mystery show that has plenty of twists, turns and laughs.

3,3,9.0,19 October 2021,"When the initial episodes of 'Only Murders in the Building' started raking in 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, I must confess that I was skeptical that Steve Martin and co could keep up the quirky fun nature of this comedy-thriller series till the last episode.

But Martin Short, Selena Gomez and him form an unlikely yet rambunctious trio who keep us hooked and entertained till the very last episode of this brilliantly written, infectiously funny series.

Steve Martin and a fantastic Martin Short star as a pair of geriatric has-been performers who run into a young gild (Gomez) who also happens to be a fellow murder podcast fanatic. How this rag-tag trio come together to solve a strange murder that takes place in their apartment forms the rest of this story.

Although some comedy-investigative series' have had huge fan bases like Monk (2002-09) and Psych (2006-14) this genre has always been a tightrope walk that most creators shy away from.

Finding humor in the most unlikeliest of places and filled with unexpected twists and turns and a host of delectable supporting characters, it is no surprise that Steve Martin was also one of the creative geniuses behind the writing of this work.

Leaving us on a tantalizing knife-edge with a cliffhanger climax, I cannot wait for Season 2. Well worth the 100% Rotten Tomatoes rating. An immensely bingeable, suspenseful, laugh riot!

11,11,6.0,9 October 2024,"When I first found ""Only Murders In The Building"", I thought it was clever, funny and kept me wondering what would happen next. Season Two picked up nicely where one had left off. The dialogue was great.

However, Season three found me feeling as though they were undoing what made this show unusual.

Now we are at Season 4 and it's like a piece of gum after you chewed it for an half an hour. It's tastelessly bland, uninteresting and more trouble than it's worth.

Sad, really. Martin and Short are great together and Gomez was tolerable. Adding all these cameos was a big mistake.

I enjoyed Martin Short's character but I didn't think Steve Martin was that funny in this which was a shame. Kind of felt like a male version of Grace & Frankie... with Selena thrown in to widen the viewer age range.

I like Selena but for whatever reason she put on this dull, monotone voice throughout the whole thing which began to really grate on me a couple of episodes in.

I'm hearing impaired and the deaf episode just felt too much. All the hollow, muffled sound in that episode was just really annoying for me and left me turning my hearing aids down. I understand that they are trying to be inclusive but just felt weird.

15,15,9.0,10 November 2021,"Some barely plausible characters end up starting a podcast on a murder that happens in the tower block they live in.

I loved the characters and I thought the casting was excellent - I had never heard of Selena Gomez but I loved her in this.

It is very light going with a scattering of jokes and mild drama.

There is the odd speciality episode like the one without any spoken dialogue.

Other reviewers have stated that, although alright, this is not as great as people make out.

Technically they are absolutely right - it isn't ground shattering stuff.

But as a fan of the likes of ""Monk"", ""Jonathan Creek"", ""Rizzoli & Isles"" it feels like there has not been anything new in the same vein for quite a while.

This is good, honest, light, sleuthy fun and the smile on my face as I watched every episode justifies my 9 star rating alone.

It's not gripping or tense more curious and fun, some of the critiques and scores here are over the top, it's good but not that good.

I personally don't really like the musical theme of season 3, but others appear to love it.

The reveals are obvious and easily guessed at the beginning, and aren't very interesting/twists.

The writing seems way less serious, as though they know it's a stupid premise so haven't put as much effort into the writing.

28,28,10.0,5 November 2021,"But with a nice addition of Selena Gomez, who I didn't know could act, although she mostly plays third fiddle to show's greater talents of Martin Short and Steve Martin.

I hate the term binge-watching but that's exactly what I did with Only murders in the building - it hooked me from the start, not just because this show reunites two thirds of one of my favorite childhood cinematic teams (Chase-Martin-Short trio from 1986's Three amigos) but also because the premise sounded promising and once I started watching I couldn't really let go.

As all of the murder mysteries go, this one follows the same beaten formula of twists and turns, suspects and innocents with an unlikely trio to lead the investigation the police seemed to have dropped from the get-go. So many questions and most of them get answered my the season finale (can't wait for the second season by the way) and overall atmosphere of the show, although a bit pretentious and too predictive at times, captures and opens up the characters to the core so much that we instantly fall in love with them and route for.

The gem above all is Steve Martin's Charles with his once big now small and broken little man who just wants some peace and quiet but rushes headlong into life as soon as another person loses it and finds friends he seemed to have long forgotten how to make. Martin Short's Oliver is his usual charming self with his own interesting story yet to unravel and Selena Gomez' Mabel is an extraordinary insertion to the team of 70 year-olds which gives it that life and vigorousness they all (including the tenants in the building) needed.

Above all, besides the outstanding performances by the cast, fantastic soundtrack and one-of-a-kind episode 7 are among this show's greatest moments and I hope it would get only better and bigger in the upcoming season.

I am seatbelted in and can't wait to see where this story takes us.

The series is about a murder in an expensive piece of residential real estate in New York called The Arconia...or at least our three strangers turned podcasters think it's a murder, the police think it is a straightforward suicide. The three strangers, played by Steve Martin, Martin Short and Selena Gomez, all live in the building and are brought together during a fire alarm because of their love of a true crime podcast (the podcast is done by a character played by Tina Fey), everything is not ok in Oklahoma. When the three of them discover there has been a death in the building, they decide to come together to solve it...and naturally do a podcast about it.

36,36,9.0,2 September 2021,"I'm a long time fan of Steve Martin and Martin Short so I had to check out this series. Their past collaborations are electric. Im not aware of Selena Gomez's work but I know WHO she is.

After reading other reviews, it's fairly obvious there are many Selena fans who wanted to voice their overwhelming approval of her performance to pad the rating. Those ""reviews"" stand out because they are not really reviews, just kudos because they are ardent fans. Tell us WHY you liked it!!!! I'm sure many who stated such and also stating their admiration for the other leads' past work was a token. I can't imagine the fandom realistically includes legendary septuagenarian comedic movie and stage actors and a Disney popstar. If I had a dollar for everytime I read the word ""amazing"", I could produce the show.

I digress - this show, after 3 episodes is fabulous!! I hate most TV shows created in recent years. Comedies are formulaic, recycled crap. Drama is redundant and stale. I give some with an interesting premise a chance - 99.9% fail. The ONLY network shows I like now are NCIS, the original, and Young Sheldon. Streaming: Stranger Things and Alien TV. Yes, I'm odd that way. Castle Rock was cancelled, so.... I love quirky original concepts like 3rd Rock from the Sun, Big Bang Theory, the aforementioned Stranger Things and Alien TV ,etc. This show has it all. It's hilarious, dramatic, thrilling, mysterious, eclectic, thatrical and insane all at the same time. It's a definite rollercoaster ride of emotions. If you didn't bust a rib with the cats ""arrival"" on scene then you are dead inside.

Steve Martin is his usual sardonic self and teaming him with Martin Short's over-the-top theatrics - their sarcastic banter is always entertaining, add to that Selena Gomez's deadpan snarky often dismissive repartee with them is priceless!! They have fantastic chemistry for their 3 very distinct personality types. I'm quite impressed at her ability to hold her own with these two and it was so refreshing to hear a young woman have a lower register voice for once and NOT hearing ""super"" this and that constantly. C'mon people, there are other synonyms for that word. It makes you sound silly and unintelligent.

The storyline kept my attention and I love how they cut to each characters unique perspective in interpreting the clues they have; Short ""auditioning"" the tenants and Selena's visions/delusions. They throw in backstories with flashbacks and ambiguous habits to build the character profiles.

Finally, the supporting cast - masterful casting in my opinion. The tenants are the kookiest group of people you could ever imagine and they all live in the same building!!! Nathan Lane AND Sting as well!! Great!!

I was sad when episode 3 ended, I now have to wait until next week but it's worth it. You never know what will happen scene to scene or for that matter, what may come out of their mouth.

41,41,7.0,27 October 2021,"This was a phenomenal show! It is so much better than I thought it would be. I started watching this show late. I didn't start watching it till 6 episodes in. I saw commercials for it before it aired, but it didn't peak my interest. Then, weeks later, I am scrolling through Disney+, this show catches my eye, so I decide to start it. (I live in Canada. We don't get Hulu, Disney+ Canada imports some of Hulu's shows to the country). I binged the first six episodes of the show in under 48 hours. I then had to wait for episodes weekly which is normal. Because this show is a murder mystery, I feel making the fans wait a week for each episode built so much more suspense than if all episodes were released on the same day. I loved everything about this show. The acting, the writing, the characters, and the story. Martin Short, Steve Martin, Selena Gomez, and everyone else, and I mean everyone were absolutely perfect in their role. My favorite was Martin Short as Oliver Putnam. The character of Oliver was so quirky and funny, and Martin Short was perfect for him. Oliver wasn't the only perfectly written character. All of the main three, as well as the side characters, and all the suspects were so unique in their own way, especially most of the suspects. They were all funny. It was perfect. Lastly, the writing of the show was perfect. The writers made the perfect murder mystery. The suspects, the leads, the red herrings, all perfect. I also loved the character development of the characters. It was cool to see their backstories.

This show was incredible. Everything about it. I 100% recommend this to anyone. Trust me, you won't regret it. They left us on a massive cliffhanger at the end of season 1, I need to find out what happens next.

43,43,10.0,7 July 2022,"Before I start this, I think season 1 is an absolute treasure, 10/10 from me! The plot is great, character relationships feel real and authentic, and just the feel of the show is just captivating!

Okay, lets start off with Amy Schumer. I know her role is giving mixed opinions, and rightly so. The way they presented her in this is not well written at all! I think this was a last minute decision and they didn't have too much time to write her character a good story. Also, her playing herself... doesn't make sense in this show. I get the whole keeping celeb thing intact but come on now, it's just a bit too random.

The next point is Cara Delevingne. She should not be in the show at all! It simply doesn't suit her or the show! She plays a bit of a wacky painter and enters the show through Mabel. Now her character entry is okay... but in general, this seems too fast paced and there is ABSOLUTELY no chemistry between her and Selena! It feels so forced and unnatural, what on Earth is going on. Please tell me these two do not actually get together, it seriously feels empty and cold! Don't get me wrong, both Selena and Cara are good actors but them being in a relationship... yeah unfortunately we need to pull the plug on that, as I said before it was SO forced, rushed, and awkward. I honestly want to know what was going through the writers, producers, and directors' heads when they saw this scene!!

My final point, the plot is fine but after seeing the first three episodes, it's not drawing me in like season 1. When watching season 1 I literally could not wait for the next episode to come out, but season 2... I really hate to say it but the series has lost its magic :(. I told all my friends about this show and didn't ever shut up about it too! Such a shame.

44,44,8.0,30 July 2022,"I think overall Season one was quite good. Steve Martin and Martin Short, while not a magical duo, worked very well together, especially as each others' straight man. In think we all agree the false leads was overplayed and season one could have been perhaps two episodes shorter.

Season two, in contrast, is just insufferable. The writing is cringe. The humor has changed from subtlety, repartee, and irony to entirely dumbed down sophomoric or physical humor that simply does not work. I dare anyone to show how and where this is a script with any intelligence at all. Where is there anything that would even bemuse a New Yorker. Were are the funny references to well known Manhattan foibles and uniqueness? The only one I saw in the entire season was stolen directly from Woody Allen. And this seasons supporting cast is there for what exactly? Selena Gomez did a yeoman's job considering her struggling with serious illness and being thrown in with the mega talents.. Great comedic star? No. But she did well considering. People should know the original script did not include her character. But Cara Delevingne and Schumer? Please, their inclusion is forced, artificial and they add nothing at all.

The repetitive gushing positive reviews of Season Two here on IMDB are glaring in that they are uniformly not specific. (they also include a lot of repetition, making many possibly shills) What is so enjoyable about it? They don't say. I can only guess it is because they got more of the jokes because it was so dumbed down? And what on earth is with the ticking of every woke box? I can see that if it supports the story, but how does that does that support the story here? It doesn't. It seems like a glaring and forced substitute for quality writing.

58,58,8.0,27 October 2023,"I started to watch the show with the mindset that this would be a light 30 minute episode comedy to shut down your brain in those lazy days, yet I was surprised how engaged and entertaining it turned out to be!

Steve Martin and Martin Short are long time collaborators (and I assume friends as well in their personal lives) so their chemistry is unquestionable, this on its own is a major positive aspect of the show.

Murder mysteries are a Hollywood classic and there's ton of content already on this topic so it's hard to be original in the realm.

With that being said this show actually does that in a refreshing way! The chemistry is, again, the glue of it all, the comedic duo gives the heart and are the major source of comedy, which on most cases is well timed so we have plenty of funny moments.

While being a light hearted kind of show, the murder plots are actually interesting and well designed, of course some folks are obviously not guilty and depending on which episode you are it might become more clear who de culprit is, yet the moments leading to the inevitable revelations are great and most of all they make sense which is something not all murder mysteries get right.

I did enjoy all seasons including the third, while it becomes more far fetched as more seasons are made (season 1 and 2 murders are more plausible while the third could arguably be debated as stretched) I still felt that the plot was interesting, the actors involved did an amazing job, they really went for an all start guest list of actors!

It's a well written story with great depictions and it maintains that balance of being a TV show about murders while at the same time it feels like a cozy light hearted family comedy.

I do struggle a bit with Selena Gomez performance, I've seen her in other movies and I don't think that she is a bad performer but her delivery on this character feels off and distant, you get used to it at some point but I don't know why she seems to struggle to deliver intensity or charisma to the character, although her chemistry with Steve and Martin is great!","August 31, 2021 (United States)",i started to watch the show with the mindset that this would be a light minute episode comedy to shut down your brain in those lazy days yet i was surprised how engaged and entertaining it turned out to be steve martin and martin short are long time collaborators and i assume friends as well in their personal lives so their chemistry is unquestionable this on its own is a major positive aspect of the show murder mysteries are a hollywood classic and theres ton of content already on this topic so its hard to be original in the realm with that being said this show actually does that in a refreshing way the chemistry is again the glue of it all the comedic duo gives the heart and are the major source of comedy which on most cases is well timed so we have plenty of funny moments while being a light hearted kind of show the murder plots are actually interesting and well designed of course some folks are obviously not guilty and depending on which episode you are it might become more clear who de culprit is yet the moments leading to the inevitable revelations are great and most of all they make sense which is something not all murder mysteries get right i did enjoy all seasons including the third while it becomes more far fetched as more seasons are made season and murders are more plausible while the third could arguably be debated as stretched i still felt that the plot was interesting the actors involved did an amazing job they really went for an all start guest list of actors its a well written story with great depictions and it maintains that balance of being a tv show about murders while at the same time it feels like a cozy light hearted family comedy i do struggle a bit with selena gomez performance ive seen her in other movies and i dont think that she is a bad performer but her delivery on this character feels off and distant you get used to it at some point but i dont know why she seems to struggle to deliver intensity or charisma to the character although her chemistry with steve and martin is great,POSITIVE

60,60,9.0,31 August 2021,"This is definitely a series worth watching, 3 episodes in and I am hooked! Only Murders in the Building not only has a star-studded cast, but a hilarity in its dark material that makes the series totally binge-able and entertaining. If I could compare it to another show it would be Search Party. I can honestly say I can't wait to see how this ends.

The only problem I have with this series is that it was not released in full in one day, I hate waiting around to watch it on a weekly basis like its 2004.

Update: 12/24/2021

I rewatched the series and would have to say that although the first time around this show was exhilarating to view, the second time did not hit as hard. I LOVE the show, I think it was fantastically produced, the sets are gorgeous, the dialogue is funny, the characters are well written. However, I would agree with most of the reviews this time around that the twists were predictable and could be seen from a mile away.

(For instance, let's make yet another NCIS with a bunch of unlikable people doing the same old tired things in a new place. But I digress...) I love Nathan Lane in anything, and all of the actors do a good job. I am looking forward to more twists and turns before the final reveal. My one criticism is Episode 7, the silent episode. I get it, very artsy, fartsy, or maybe just an attempt to show what it is like to be deaf. Whatever the reason, just because you can do something does not mean you should. I do not stare at my TV when watching it without ever looking away, so this was very difficult to watch. Also, I missed the texts and some stuff because it was too small and I could not see it.

63,63,10.0,8 October 2022,"I really liked season 1. It was great. There were signs of things to come with all the emphasis on how wonderful in every way Mabel is. Eye rolling in the extreme. It's intersectional feminism. She's called ""amazing"" so often, it's ridiculous. That aside, the writing was solid and engaging and the irritations I felt could be compartmentalised and didn't ruin the overall enjoyment of the mystery. If Steve Martin wasn't in it, however, I would probably not watch.

The intersectional post modern writing is very sadly turned up to 11 in season 2. What on Earth is Amy Schumer doing in this? Or Cara Delevingne? The quality of the writing took a dive.

I am watching season 4 episode 2 as I write this. I may or may not make it through the season. Making it through the episode is also in question. The actors playing the actors who are going to be in the OMITB movie set a new low for the series.

98,98,10.0,1 September 2023,"I enjoyed the first two seasons, though mainly for Martin and Short, but the third season is just drifting aimlessly and episodes have gotten repetitive.

Characters wander about spouting limp dialogue with the rare flash of humor, and then someone finds a ""clue"" in the last scene that points to another character possibly being the murderer, but that character will have an alibi in the next episode so they start all over again.

Even Martin and Short look bored this season. And Gomez has never added anything to the show. She's completely out of her depth as a character and ""actress.""

She stumbles about with her dead eyes droning out words in an irritating nasally voice that makes you stop listening as soon as she appears. Even the occasional flashes of cleavage and lesbian kiss from last season haven't made her interesting.

As for guest stars, Streep is always a joy, even with little to do, but Rudd is completely wasted.

I'll keep watching but unless this thing kicks it up several notches (and maybe Gomez flashes more than cleavage) I suspect they won't have a fourth season.

124,124,10.0,31 August 2021,"First Off: The show is average. Average and that isn't bad. If you think Knives Out is the best mystery ever created you will love this. If you are a fan of everything from Death In Paradise all the way to Father Brown Mysteries you will think this is average.

The start is not needed... The three telling a tale of ""their"" new york isn't needed. It's too ""woody allen"" and it's like bad poetry... Artistic decisions only look artistic when done for artistic reasons. This reeks of trying to hard to be intellectual. There of course is the obligatory ""women get raped by men cause it's a mans world and wah-men"" reeled off by Selena Gomez.

This isn't novel or unique. In fact it literally follows the same beats as so many before... To the point where Ultra City Smiths lampooned it only a few weeks ago on our TV screens.

The positives. Steve Martin and Martin Short. They are legends and this isn't a ""payday"" for them. This isn't phoned in. I will agree with that. Amazing from them. Selena Gomes. I love her. I am not a huge fan of her music but her personally I actually like as she has never come across the same as Miley and Tay-Tay... Both seeming up their own... Ahem... Ms Gomez has always seen like the cheerleader that didn't want to be mean like the other vapid airheads but couldn't help being attractive and popular. I am so glad she is normal in this and that she plays someone that isn't just a 20-something idiot. She actually is playing a functioning adult!

The cinematography is lush. No other words for it. Money spent well. The acting between the 3 is amazing.

Now the negatives.

The pacing is off. The story is taking too long to set up. Exposition can be done far more naturally. The start is elongated and filled with horrible little cliches and tropes. The pilot is bad... But I give the show a 6 as pilots aren't usually the peak of a show.

The mystery is not that smart with the only good aspect being that they are fans of podcasts... No different to the main character of Zomboat being into zombie movies or things like Truth Seekers. It's been done and worse still... You should never touch a subject that Rhyse Sheersmith and Steve Pemberton have touched with their amazing Inside Number 9.

The pilot follows Campbells Journey way too much... At the 18th min mark they literally hit one of the steps on time...

As for the reviews... Anyone that has given this above a 9 needs a word with themselves. Worryingly on here and google the reviews seem fake made by people that have had their profiles for less than a week.

Is it bad? No. It is amazing? No. It's average. Worse still it's a hackneyed mish mash of Agatha Christie tropes. We have them all here... From Miss Marple to And Then There Were None.

The music is also a nice surprise from the well written theme tune to the clever choice of music in the different episodes.

DO not listen to the haters, they know nothing. This is the real Deal. Happy to report that the long wait of Steve Martin and Martin Short back on the screen, is well worth the wait! And the very talented Selena Gomez definitely holds her own.

135,135,10.0,25 October 2021,"Firstly, ignore the haters. If you hate whodunnits or things that do not rely on gore/extreme violence, nonstop cgi action, gratuitous use if the f* bomb, and/or sports, then this is not the show for you. It's also not about rebellious mensa youths playing chess.

But, if you like murder mysteries/whodunnits, and are looking for something clever, fun, and just a tad lighthearted despite being about solving murders, please watch this show. The filmmakers do a great job of taking the podcast medium and bringing it to life in an entertaining and colorful way (more entertaining, in fact, than many actual podcasts themselves regardless of your imaginative capabilities).

The casting is fantastic and the main 3 protagonists have a great chemistry together, really bringing life to their characters. And while some supporting roles aren't fleshed out too deeply, you get a great sense of the overall ecosystem of sorts at the Arcadia through the protagonists adventures - which is all that matters here. It isn't the deepest show or the most dramatic, but it's approach to death, our differences, and the weird things that can bring us together is honest, thoughtful, and genuine. Yes, there are silly moments, and silly characters. But this is a comedy - and unlike other shows/films purporting to be comedic, does actually contain amusing things. As a millennial, I enjoy a real range of genres from romantic period pieces to rob zombie style horror, but, at the end of a long day, I truly looked forward to each episode drop of Only Murders as something light- but still thoughtful - to enjoy and decompress.

138,138,6.0,4 September 2021,"Only Murders in the Building is fun and entertaining from the start. I caught a review from David Bianculli on Fresh Air just prior to the show's release that grabbed my attention and had me marking the release date on the calendar. His review is spot on. The show is as good as advertised. Those disappointed after expecting a novel and superior crime/mystery series are partly missing the point. The mystery cliches are part of the humorous parody. The podcast plot line provides an amusing relatability - many watchers will know the experience of discovering a friend or acquaintance shares an affinity for the same true crime podcast (e.g, Serial, etc.). The enthusiasm for such podcasts is noted with a hilarious reaction by a detective outside the murder scene to the three main characters snooping around: ""Goddamnit, What F'n podcast are you all hooked on?"" Many viewers will also connect with the characters from a childhood and/or adult secret desire to be a real crime detective.

Martin, a co-creator, is more subdued and cynical in his role, allowing Short and Gomez to balance either side of him with their typical high-energy and dry sarcasm, respectively. Gomez really shines and her character has depth. The viewer gets to share the tension and conflict Mabel must feel hiding her secrets from the other two.

This show hooked me like I hoped it would when I heard about it, and I simply can't wait for more.","August 31, 2021 (United States)",only murders in the building is fun and entertaining from the start i caught a review from david bianculli on fresh air just prior to the shows release that grabbed my attention and had me marking the release date on the calendar his review is spot on the show is as good as advertised those disappointed after expecting a novel and superior crimemystery series are partly missing the point the mystery cliches are part of the humorous parody the podcast plot line provides an amusing relatability many watchers will know the experience of discovering a friend or acquaintance shares an affinity for the same true crime podcast eg serial etc the enthusiasm for such podcasts is noted with a hilarious reaction by a detective outside the murder scene to the three main characters snooping around goddamnit what fn podcast are you all hooked on many viewers will also connect with the characters from a childhood andor adult secret desire to be a real crime detective martin a cocreator is more subdued and cynical in his role allowing short and gomez to balance either side of him with their typical highenergy and dry sarcasm respectively gomez really shines and her character has depth the viewer gets to share the tension and conflict mabel must feel hiding her secrets from the other two this show hooked me like i hoped it would when i heard about it and i simply cant wait for more,POSITIVE

142,142,10.0,7 September 2021,"I am liking this show well enough after 3 episodes. First of all, Selena is gorgeous as always and also somewhat coy and mysterious. Good on her landing this gig.

But some things bother me a bit. The attempt to be edgy seems to just be gore and swearing. There is not a clear direction on what the target audience is. Is this for young adults, old people, what??? I watch things outside my target demo, but I want that to be a consistent experience. I don't flip on some Looney Tunes from my youth expecting it to be adult oriented, I want it to be a kids cartoon. So far I'm being pulled in a few different directions so it's a bit annoying.

From an acting perspective I think Martin is standing out. He fits the character as written almost to a T and seems to jump out of the screen at you. On the other side, Steve just doesn't quite work for me and I've never really considered him a top level actor anyway. But he still kind of works as a contrast to Martin. As for Selena, let's all be honest here and admit she's just not a top-level actress, but she's cute and is clearly there to counter the two old guys with her youth. And as we've seen in the trailers (no spoilers), she's a central character but so far maybe hasn't had a chance to flex her acting range. (I'm also throwing out the question: what is up with her speaking voice? Her tone is so very nice as always but her enunciation is off almost like she had a jaw injury.)

Another comment on the acting in general is that everyone seems to be a bit distant. Put another way, I am not seeing as much chemistry as I would like. We'll give them some more time to warm up but for now it's almost like each person is acting to the camera, not to their costars.

This show does give me vibes of ""The Flight Attendant"", which I also liked, but sometimes it feels like they copied some things here and there. Could just be me...","August 31, 2021 (United States)",i am liking this show well enough after episodes first of all selena is gorgeous as always and also somewhat coy and mysterious good on her landing this gig but some things bother me a bit the attempt to be edgy seems to just be gore and swearing there is not a clear direction on what the target audience is is this for young adults old people what i watch things outside my target demo but i want that to be a consistent experience i dont flip on some looney tunes from my youth expecting it to be adult oriented i want it to be a kids cartoon so far im being pulled in a few different directions so its a bit annoying from an acting perspective i think martin is standing out he fits the character as written almost to a t and seems to jump out of the screen at you on the other side steve just doesnt quite work for me and ive never really considered him a top level actor anyway but he still kind of works as a contrast to martin as for selena lets all be honest here and admit shes just not a toplevel actress but shes cute and is clearly there to counter the two old guys with her youth and as weve seen in the trailers no spoilers shes a central character but so far maybe hasnt had a chance to flex her acting range im also throwing out the question what is up with her speaking voice her tone is so very nice as always but her enunciation is off almost like she had a jaw injury another comment on the acting in general is that everyone seems to be a bit distant put another way i am not seeing as much chemistry as i would like well give them some more time to warm up but for now its almost like each person is acting to the camera not to their costars this show does give me vibes of the flight attendant which i also liked but sometimes it feels like they copied some things here and there could just be me,POSITIVE

160,160,7.0,7 September 2021,"I know I'm going to upset a lot of people here with this one, so I'm going to get it out first... I'm not sure Selena Gomez was the right person to put up against two comedy powerhouses like Martin and Short. As dynamic and outstanding as these two, Gomez is equally flat and uninteresting.

Adding in guests to the show like Tina Fey, Sting, et al. And she really pales on screen with her flat affect.

Other than this, I'm a huge mystery fan, usually British mysteries, but this has enough of a feel to compare to those and I'm enjoying this show very much.

The story line grabs you from the moment Martin says, ""Only murders in the building!"" Given it's a mystery, it moves slower than I'd like. But... British mysteries usually wrap up very quickly, so I'm allowing this to not bother me. I like how the character's lives are fleshed out so we can know them better.

The show's not at all heavy or dark, other than the fact they're investigating and podcasting about a murder in the building. The jokes are also light and the byplay between characters is enjoyable.

It's my sincere hope when this one is done, Martin and Short will consider others, sans Gomez, but with a more talented actress.","August 31, 2021 (United States)",i know im going to upset a lot of people here with this one so im going to get it out first im not sure selena gomez was the right person to put up against two comedy powerhouses like martin and short as dynamic and outstanding as these two gomez is equally flat and uninteresting adding in guests to the show like tina fey sting et al and she really pales on screen with her flat affect other than this im a huge mystery fan usually british mysteries but this has enough of a feel to compare to those and im enjoying this show very much the story line grabs you from the moment martin says only murders in the building given its a mystery it moves slower than id like but british mysteries usually wrap up very quickly so im allowing this to not bother me i like how the characters lives are fleshed out so we can know them better the shows not at all heavy or dark other than the fact theyre investigating and podcasting about a murder in the building the jokes are also light and the byplay between characters is enjoyable its my sincere hope when this one is done martin and short will consider others sans gomez but with a more talented actress,POSITIVE

Half the time he doesn't even need to say anything. But he feels a bit underused at this point, especially considering he created and produces the show. I want to know more about his character (maybe it is coming). The character played by Gomez is set up very well, the dialogue is good and there is ample intrigue. It would be a bit harsh to say Gomez cannot act. It could well be the direction is also poor. What is with the monotone nature of her voice? It sounds to me like she is just reading the script out loud most of the time, barely a hint of feeling in the words. I get the distinct impression she is trying too hard.

192,192,9.0,26 October 2021,"Most older viewers will go in to this to see Steve Martin and Martin Short team up while younger viewers are likely here for Selena Gomez. You will certainly get your fill as far as screen time goes, but not quite the best as far as performances go. All three are fine enough in their roles but we are talking a spoofy murder mystery here.

Steve Martin gets more humor and drama than the others and does well with it and generally being a lot less over the top than we are used to seeing him - which I found refreshing.

Martin Shorts character works more an annoyance that lets others be funny although he does have some funny lines, but much less than we normally see.

Selena Gomez is a bit uneven. She works best when she is investigating and not so good when she is supposed to be emotional. It can't be easy holding your own with this cast, but I do think she held her ground pretty well.

The story is a spoof about crime/murder podcasts and manages to go through many different phases during the 10 episode run. It started strong and then ambles along very pleasantly until it crescendos with a very good final episode. It feels comfortable all the way through and that isn't a bad thing.

221,221,9.0,16 February 2024,"This show is pretty good...but honestly it peaked in it's first season imo, which is a shame.

Season 1 was quite outlandish but in a controlled way. Like fireworks. Whoever decided putting coloured gunpowder in a pipe and setting it on fire - crazy. Whoever decided to shoot a bunch of them up in the air and make a display - genius. Season 1 is twisty and dramatic, a little bit hammy, a little bit cliché and very self aware. The acting is solid, the mystery is entertaining and engaging, the resolution is great fun. It just works.

Season 2 is...fine. That's not fair, it's actually pretty good too, but it's essentially a rehash of Season 1 so meh.

Season 3 sucks. It couldn't hold my attention at all. The dynamic changed far too much, far too dramatically. The situation doesn't work, the character balance is off and the chemistry is dead.

223,223,10.0,6 September 2021,"This is a show I was eager to see. There are aspects that, personally, disappoint - the pacing (Woody Allen used to do these things so much better, with an under-appreciated energy and precision), the peculiar interactions between the 'odd trio' (yes, I know Gomez's character is supposed to be somewhat disconnected from the older pair, but her behaviour in the early episodes is just a bit too odd and illogical to work for me), the already-cliched 'talking to a dead guy' conceit (after The Flight Attendant, and others, this needs a long, long, rest) and (I know, I know, these things are subjective, but...) Gomez's weird, ultra-constipated, nasal mumble - but the charm of Martin and Short makes up for any misgivings and keeps one watching. Like so many shows these days, this feels like a 90 minute movie stretched out to fill up a non-negotiable run of episodes, but it's entertaining even during its detours and digressions.

243,243,10.0,2 June 2022,"I think I'll start with the bad stuff first. I was really looking forward to this show for a while and then after months of waiting I finally got around to watching it and at first I was very disappointed. So I seem to be in the very minority in that I didn't mind Selena Gomez's character, her acting didn't blow me away but it was fine. Her character wasn't actively annoying like the other 2 main characters were. I get they are great actors and I used to love Steve Martin in his older movies when I was younger, but I think the characters themselves were just so unlikable, but that's just me.

But aside from that, it took me over a week to get through the first four episodes, they were just so boring and nothing happened and no meaningful progress in the plot happened aside from a few seemingly interesting cliffhangers. I almost decided to stop watching completely. A character later in the season actually referenced an earlier episode and it seems the writers were self aware of how pointless the first few episodes were: ""A whole episode with no stakes."" Except I would say it was multiple episodes.

But starting at episode 5, stuff actually starts happening and the pacing becomes much better. I won't spoil it but it starts getting some interesting reveals and the characters become slightly less full of themselves and more bearable. I don't typically like whodunit murder mysteries, but I think the differing personalities of the main trio and the intriguing premise ultimately paid off, even though it was incredibly slow to start, so I don't really blame people who quit a few episodes in.","August 31, 2021 (United States)",i think ill start with the bad stuff first i was really looking forward to this show for a while and then after months of waiting i finally got around to watching it and at first i was very disappointed so i seem to be in the very minority in that i didnt mind selena gomezs character her acting didnt blow me away but it was fine her character wasnt actively annoying like the other main characters were i get they are great actors and i used to love steve martin in his older movies when i was younger but i think the characters themselves were just so unlikable but thats just me but aside from that it took me over a week to get through the first four episodes they were just so boring and nothing happened and no meaningful progress in the plot happened aside from a few seemingly interesting cliffhangers i almost decided to stop watching completely a character later in the season actually referenced an earlier episode and it seems the writers were self aware of how pointless the first few episodes were a whole episode with no stakes except i would say it was multiple episodes but starting at episode stuff actually starts happening and the pacing becomes much better i wont spoil it but it starts getting some interesting reveals and the characters become slightly less full of themselves and more bearable i dont typically like whodunit murder mysteries but i think the differing personalities of the main trio and the intriguing premise ultimately paid off even though it was incredibly slow to start so i dont really blame people who quit a few episodes in,NEGATIVE

They successfully poke fun at true crime nuts, police procedural dramas, and of course New Yorkers. The clues are interwoven a la Agatha Christie and Alfred Hitchcock, but the playful tone keeps the horror at bay. Shaping up to be a fun whodunnit.

My only beef.... They missed a chance to enhance the narrative in the opening credits! It shows a view of our 3 protagonists through the building windows each performing tasks specific to them... but they are in the wrong apartments 😂 If a show is to take place in apartment hallways and elevators with little to distinguish where we are in the space, it could get confusing. During the 1st elevator scene I was literally thinking...ok per the credits she's in the penthouse, Martin short is in the middle, and Steve Martin is on the lowest floor...only to find out I'm totally wrong 😐 They do a fabulous job of making the apartment interiors very distinctive which is such a blessing. It's a nitpick I know, but now 3 episodes in I still don't know where everyone is😂 It's also a distinction that may prove important later if say, one person passes a shady character on the stairs during a fire drill, but the others don't because they are on lower floors 😉","August 31, 2021 (United States)",binged the first episodes last night and i am so excited for more of this show they successfully poke fun at true crime nuts police procedural dramas and of course new yorkers the clues are interwoven a la agatha christie and alfred hitchcock but the playful tone keeps the horror at bay shaping up to be a fun whodunnit my only beef they missed a chance to enhance the narrative in the opening credits it shows a view of our protagonists through the building windows each performing tasks specific to them but they are in the wrong apartments if a show is to take place in apartment hallways and elevators with little to distinguish where we are in the space it could get confusing during the st elevator scene i was literally thinkingok per the credits shes in the penthouse martin short is in the middle and steve martin is on the lowest flooronly to find out im totally wrong they do a fabulous job of making the apartment interiors very distinctive which is such a blessing its a nitpick i know but now episodes in i still dont know where everyone is its also a distinction that may prove important later if say one person passes a shady character on the stairs during a fire drill but the others dont because they are on lower floors,POSITIVE
271,271,10.0,5 September 2021,"Well let me start off by saying that the show has potential to be a great. The story is intriguing and cheesy (in a good way) but the acting is pretty bad, especially from Selena Gomez. Her monotone character makes me not feel or root for her. Steve Martin and Martin Short both do a decent job but I have to note that Martin Short is carrying the show. Besides the acting, the show is filled with weird camera shots. Not sure if it's meant to make the viewer feel uncomfortable but I can assure you that I don't like it. For instance there was a scene where Steve Martin's character was talking and Selena Gomez was standing in the background looking very awkwardly. Now that the bad stuff is out of the way, let's talk about the good stuff. First let's talk about the story. It's a classic ""who's done it"" which you can never go bad with. If you add Selena Gomez's little secret to this, it provides the show the tools to make it great. In addition, I have to say that I love the wardrobe of the characters and how effortlessly they made a simple scenes look beautiful.

300,300,1.0,4 September 2021,"I must confess that, despite being a huge Selena fan, I tried to keep my expectations for the series not too high, because I didn't really know what to expect from the show, I had no idea how it was going to play out as I never had seen one like that before. But I admit that this strategy did not work very well. I was VERY looking forward to the premiere. Seeing her acting again in a series, and still alongside two legends, was reason enough to hold my attention. Assiduous viewer of Wizards since childhood, I already knew his gigantic talent for acting (for those who don't know it, search for Lisa's giving birth scene in Indubious Battle on YouTube - breathtaking), but despite not being surprised with the phenomenal work she does as Mabel, the character itself is a much bigger piece than I expected (and I didn't expect anything but perfection).

Oliver, Charles and Mabel are a trio who don't trust each other very much, but it's been fun to see that dynamic unfold in the first three episodes. They are very different characters, but, for some reason, they work very well even when they go wrong.

Mabel Mora is not only the most intriguing piece on the show, she really is the lifeblood of the show. Not only because she's connected to the case, but because her personality is so interesting, mysterious and, above all, relentless. Nothing escapes her gaze, she always has an easy answer for everything, making a meticulous and extremely surprising analysis seem obvious and inherent to her person, maybe because of the personal curiosity she carries about Tim. I dare say that in a line that is very similar to Sherlock Holmes.

Charles is lonely, down-to-earth, methodical, and clearly having trouble relating and bonding with others, probably because of his anxiety preventing him from being open to new things or clinging to other people and then losing them. It's what makes your forays into getting close to Mabel so interesting.

Oliver is a born creative and dreamer, who goes to great lengths to fulfill his desires or please others. He's the opposite of Charles, and maybe that's why he's the part that completes him and makes them the smartest and most curious pair of gray-haired men in New York City.

The series balances the trio in a very insightful way, separating them into different pairs each episode without us even realizing it. The dynamics between the information that the characters discover and that we, viewers, manage to perceive hidden in the scenes was composed in a phenomenal way, so that, every time I watch an episode, I come across things that I hadn't noticed at the previous time.

Only Murders In The Building is a mysterious, funny, calculating, intriguing and completely addictive series when we stick to the details. It is not a show to be watched without your attention being on it, at the same time it is a light work, which amuses and distracts us in a delicious and extremely fun way.

Tim Kono may be the victim the characters lean on to understand his death, but the protagonists' stories become another mystery to be discovered by the audience, and Mabel, without any doubt, is the character the audience is most curious to be unraveled.

I strongly recommend it!","August 31, 2021 (United States)",i must confess that despite being a huge selena fan i tried to keep my expectations for the series not too high because i didnt really know what to expect from the show i had no idea how it was going to play out as i never had seen one like that before but i admit that this strategy did not work very well i was very looking forward to the premiere seeing her acting again in a series and still alongside two legends was reason enough to hold my attention assiduous viewer of wizards since childhood i already knew his gigantic talent for acting for those who dont know it search for lisas giving birth scene in indubious battle on youtube breathtaking but despite not being surprised with the phenomenal work she does as mabel the character itself is a much bigger piece than i expected and i didnt expect anything but perfection oliver charles and mabel are a trio who dont trust each other very much but its been fun to see that dynamic unfold in the first three episodes they are very different characters but for some reason they work very well even when they go wrong mabel mora is not only the most intriguing piece on the show she really is the lifeblood of the show not only because shes connected to the case but because her personality is so interesting mysterious and above all relentless nothing escapes her gaze she always has an easy answer for everything making a meticulous and extremely surprising analysis seem obvious and inherent to her person maybe because of the personal curiosity she carries about tim i dare say that in a line that is very similar to sherlock holmes charles is lonely downtoearth methodical and clearly having trouble relating and bonding with others probably because of his anxiety preventing him from being open to new things or clinging to other people and then losing them its what makes your forays into getting close to mabel so interesting oliver is a born creative and dreamer who goes to great lengths to fulfill his desires or please others hes the opposite of charles and maybe thats why hes the part that completes him and makes them the smartest and most curious pair of grayhaired men in new york city the series balances the trio in a very insightful way separating them into different pairs each episode without us even realizing it the dynamics between the information that the characters discover and that we viewers manage to perceive hidden in the scenes was composed in a phenomenal way so that every time i watch an episode i come across things that i hadnt noticed at the previous time only murders in the building is a mysterious funny calculating intriguing and completely addictive series when we stick to the details it is not a show to be watched without your attention being on it at the same time it is a light work which amuses and distracts us in a delicious and extremely fun way tim kono may be the victim the characters lean on to understand his death but the protagonists stories become another mystery to be discovered by the audience and mabel without any doubt is the character the audience is most curious to be unraveled i strongly recommend it,POSITIVE

It was something different. I really enjoyed watching the mystery unravel, and getting a few good laughs in the process.

The second series was okay, but I didn't enjoy it as much. I just wasn't as into the mystery of the second series compared to the first, it wasn't as polished as the first one was.

363,363,10.0,2 December 2021,"He best part of the show is the press interviews between the odd trio of Steve Martin, Martin Short and Selena Gomez. Unfortunately, that's not part of the show itself which is surprisingly mediocre.

It's a shame because Martin Short and Steve Martin are generally can't-miss propositions and the idea of three amateur podcasters solving a murder plot involves a healthy degree of serialization.

So why is this so boring? For one, the actual murder isn't something that's particularly engaging. The idea is that one of the three members (Gomez) of this makeshift sleuthing team was a childhood friend of the murder victim but the show only commits to that angle half-heartedly.

Another problem with the show is that it feels awfully insiderish. ""Only Murders in the Building"" is set in a pretty insular Manhattan world and two of the three characters are aging showbiz archetypes. I'm on record as feeling pretty sated by sitcom characters who are in show business so this isn't drawing me any closer. The show tries to mine pathos from Martin and Short's characters as two old men looking back on their lives from the perspective of their twilights but there are character arcs are pretty predictable.

Season 2 -- Pretty good. Not quite as funny.. but still interesting and engaging...

You as the viewer are not presented the information you need to 'play along' and try to figure the mystery out for yourself. Which is part of the fun of mysteries, ESPECIALLY multi-episode mysteries where you have time to speculate and talk with friends. Critical information is withheld until the final episode.

The second problem is the comedy. For a show with Steve Martin, and Martin Short as regulars and with guests like Tina Fey and Paul Rudd, you'd expect the comedy to take a front seat...but it really doesn't. The comedy is pretty tame in terms of how funny it is, yet the characters often are very over the top.

Let's talk acting. You will see both spectacularly good acting and spectacularly bad acting on this show...sometimes in the same damn scene. The worst offender is Selena Gomez. This was my first exposure to her, and my god...she's terrible! This woman CANNOT act. Not even a little. She drags down every scene she is. She's often given the wittiest lines...and her timing is dreadful and the jokes don't land. It's honestly painful to watch.

Steve Martin is solid throughout. But seldom spectacular. Martin Short starts out VERY schticky playing an over the top broadway producer, and I found him repellent. But the good news is that he tones it down over time. And as he does a surprisingly good actor emerges from that. Short plays so many of his character loud and big that I was surprised to get quality acting from him.

The guest stars are hit and miss. Nathan Lane and Meryl Streep were the best by far. Streep is Streep. Lane has never been a favorite of mine. Like Short, everything I've seen him do he played so big. But this was excellent.

But some of the others I thought were pretty forgettable. Tina Fey was solid in her role, but nothing memorable. Paul Rudd was supposed to be annoying as the victim in season 3, and he was annoying. But not in a way that was fun or interesting. Matthew Broderick shows up for 20 seconds to play a bizarro version of himself that was basically one gag...and not particularly well executed.

Now, one of the things the show does really well is red herrings. Every season is just a shotgun of red herrings that feel like almost every side character has motive, means, and opportunity. But after a season or two of seeing that the show is REALLY going to withhold critical information until the end, it actually becomes quite easy to ELIMINATE suspects anytime they actually seem to have strong motives. This wasn't as bad with season 1 (the best mystery), but it very much was with seasons 2 and 3 and is something I wish the show would avoid in future seasons. I really hope they start 'playing fair' and presenting the audience with the information they need to solve the mystery and form reasonable hypotheses.

I'm sure it's not possible to replace Selena Gomez at this point...but MAN, nothing would improve this show more than de-emphasizing, or flat out recasting that character. She's really dragging the show down. Martin and Martin bring so much energy to their scenes and then her line arrives and it's just ... recited in the lowest energy way possible. I could get more personality out of an AI bot reading her lines.

Anyway. Overall a solid show...but uneven as heck.","August 31, 2021 (United States)",only murders is in exercise in frustration there are so many aspects of it that should produce really outstanding content and yetits watchable im still watching seasons laterbut this show is like an engine with a timing problem its never quite maximizing itself the first and biggest problem is the writing the murder mysteries generally arent that well done you as the viewer are not presented the information you need to play along and try to figure the mystery out for yourself which is part of the fun of mysteries especially multiepisode mysteries where you have time to speculate and talk with friends critical information is withheld until the final episode the second problem is the comedy for a show with steve martin and martin short as regulars and with guests like tina fey and paul rudd youd expect the comedy to take a front seatbut it really doesnt the comedy is pretty tame in terms of how funny it is yet the characters often are very over the top lets talk acting you will see both spectacularly good acting and spectacularly bad acting on this showsometimes in the same damn scene the worst offender is selena gomez this was my first exposure to her and my godshes terrible this woman cannot act not even a little she drags down every scene she is shes often given the wittiest linesand her timing is dreadful and the jokes dont land its honestly painful to watch steve martin is solid throughout but seldom spectacular martin short starts out very schticky playing an over the top broadway producer and i found him repellent but the good news is that he tones it down over time and as he does a surprisingly good actor emerges from that short plays so many of his character loud and big that i was surprised to get quality acting from him the guest stars are hit and miss nathan lane and meryl streep were the best by far streep is streep lane has never been a favorite of mine like short everything ive seen him do he played so big but this was excellent but some of the others i thought were pretty forgettable tina fey was solid in her role but nothing memorable paul rudd was supposed to be annoying as the victim in season and he was annoying but not in a way that was fun or interesting matthew broderick shows up for seconds to play a bizarro version of himself that was basically one gagand not particularly well executed now one of the things the show does really well is red herrings every season is just a shotgun of red herrings that feel like almost every side character has motive means and opportunity but after a season or two of seeing that the show is really going to withhold critical information until the end it actually becomes quite easy to eliminate suspects anytime they actually seem to have strong motives this wasnt as bad with season the best mystery but it very much was with seasons and and is something i wish the show would avoid in future seasons i really hope they start playing fair and presenting the audience with the information they need to solve the mystery and form reasonable hypotheses im sure its not possible to replace selena gomez at this pointbut man nothing would improve this show more than deemphasizing or flat out recasting that character shes really dragging the show down martin and martin bring so much energy to their scenes and then her line arrives and its just recited in the lowest energy way possible i could get more personality out of an ai bot reading her lines anyway overall a solid showbut uneven as heck,NEGATIVE

413,413,9.0,11 September 2021,"First of all, this show has amazing production. It is really nice to see the vintage-looking building and interestingly decorated New York apartments and basically every shot looks like it was very well thought out.

Secondly, Steve Martin and Martin Short are pure joy to watch. At first, Short strikes as the most entertaining character - an optimistic ageing bohemian director who faced a series of failures but have not lost hope of directing his 'next big thing'. And later on Steve Martin's character develops in such a way that allows him to showcase some of his best work, playing a neurotic and self-conscious but gentle, kind and at times hilariously confident actor. At some point he stole the show from Short for me since his character is so interesting to watch.

As for Selena Gomez - she is OK. A tell-it-like-it-is 'modern' girl with not much of a background story. Lacking personality, but that it is 100% screenplayers' fault, not Selena's.

And here is what the show's problem is: the screenplay is not more than 5 out of 10. It is kind of slow paced, characters lack motives for some of their actions, there are very few background details and because of this you may wonder every now and then, how come this is a murder story but I feel no sympathy to the main plot whatsoever and do not even care who the 'murderer' is. You surely get involved when Short and Martin steal the scene but other times, the show feels just boring.

Add some bright sparkly dialogue to it (maybe I am being obvious but the whole thing would become alive if some Woody Allen-like kind of conversations were there), give the main female character more background story and actual words to speak, add some interesting secondary characters to fill the 'building' with life - and it would have been a 10 out of 10. Currently, by episode 4 it still feels empty - I would call it 'Only Steve Martin and Martin Short in the building' because I haven't noticed anything else.","August 31, 2021 (United States)",first of all this show has amazing production it is really nice to see the vintagelooking building and interestingly decorated new york apartments and basically every shot looks like it was very well thought out secondly steve martin and martin short are pure joy to watch at first short strikes as the most entertaining character an optimistic ageing bohemian director who faced a series of failures but have not lost hope of directing his next big thing and later on steve martins character develops in such a way that allows him to showcase some of his best work playing a neurotic and selfconscious but gentle kind and at times hilariously confident actor at some point he stole the show from short for me since his character is so interesting to watch as for selena gomez she is ok a tellitlikeitis modern girl with not much of a background story lacking personality but that it is screenplayers fault not selenas and here is what the shows problem is the screenplay is not more than out of it is kind of slow paced characters lack motives for some of their actions there are very few background details and because of this you may wonder every now and then how come this is a murder story but i feel no sympathy to the main plot whatsoever and do not even care who the murderer is you surely get involved when short and martin steal the scene but other times the show feels just boring add some bright sparkly dialogue to it maybe i am being obvious but the whole thing would become alive if some woody allenlike kind of conversations were there give the main female character more background story and actual words to speak add some interesting secondary characters to fill the building with life and it would have been a out of currently by episode it still feels empty i would call it only steve martin and martin short in the building because i havent noticed anything else,NEGATIVE

It's essentially an intro episode then 8 episodes of leading viewers to suspect it's someone it's not, then in the last episode it's someone where there is almost nothing linking them to it in the previous 9 episodes. Season 2 was even worse in that they didn't explain at the end how the killer was connected to many of the clues and how it fully played out. You can essentially watch the first and last episode and have just as many clues linking the actual killer as someone who watches every episode.

Steve Martin (always the most tolerable of the look-at-me I'm funny North American funny people), is really good, because he is not playing it for laughs. Martin Short is obviously irritating, and obviously not a good actor, but I think that is the point of Martin Short. Selena Gomez is good; I like her.

The supporting cast are great, as are the sets, and the rest of it.

Except Cara Delevingne. She is, literally, the opposite of acting. Personally I do not find her attractive. But, apparently, there are enough that do.

There were a few minor grievances, and a rather big one. Some story scenes were handled a bit clumsily, especially when it came to reveals and resolutions. The one constant and big complaint I have is Selena Gomez. I am stunned how bad her acting was in this. Everytime she had to walk, she walked very awkwardly. Her lines were wooden, as if she had just read them for the first time. After ten episodes, we have barely learned any interesting character traits. It was almost mid-school level bad.

474,474,8.0,31 July 2022,"Only Murders in the Building is an ingeniously crafted murder mystery with an impeccable script. The comedy shines through the lead actors Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Selena Gomez. On paper, pairing Steve Martin and Martin Short with Selena Gomez might seem weird, but works brilliantly. Their chemistry is palpable from the start, and the camaraderie between their characters makes this worth watching from the get-go. Martin Short oozes with charisma and his wit and zeal as Oliver Putnam might give him an Emmy win. If there is an Emmy category for best trio, then Only Murders in the Building would take the top spot. What I admire the most is its capacity to seamlessly mesh individual plot lines together, and the ability to give the audience little nuggets of what's to come in each episode. The series manages to foreshadow the outcome and the eventual reveal in a sleek and bold manner. The storyboarding of the opening credits sequence and the overture intertwined with it pulls the viewer into the storyworld and entices them to keep watching. Whoever skips the opening credits sequence is not a true fan of the true crime podcast. Each episode is filled with an abundance of twists and turns. Every episode is immaculately crafted, high stakes driven, and offers the perfect blend of humor and mystery. Only Murders in the Building is one of the best comedies I have ever seen. Each episode leaves you wanting more. It keeps the viewer engaged and in a positive and upbeat mood. Plus, it is extremely addictive.

476,476,8.0,19 April 2023,"""Only Murders in the Building"" is a new comedic mystery series on Hulu that has gained a lot of attention, thanks in large part to its star-studded cast. The show follows three neighbors in a New York City apartment building who bond over their love of true crime podcasts and become amateur sleuths after a murder occurs in their own building. The premise is intriguing and has the potential to be a lot of fun, but the execution falls short in several key areas.

First and foremost, it must be said that Steve Martin and Martin Short are comedic geniuses. They bring their trademark humor and chemistry to their roles as Charles-Haden Savage and Oliver Putnam, respectively, and are easily the highlights of the show. Their banter and one-liners are a joy to watch and provide many of the show's funniest moments. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for Selena Gomez, who plays Mabel Mora, the third member of the trio.

Gomez's acting leaves a lot to be desired. While she has improved over the years, her performance in ""Only Murders in the Building"" is often wooden and lacks the natural charisma of her co-stars. She struggles to keep up with Martin and Short's comedic timing and falls flat in several key scenes. It's clear that she's trying her best, but the contrast between her performance and that of Martin and Short is stark.

The direction of the show is solid, with a clear vision and style that sets it apart from other comedies. Director Jamie Babbit infuses the show with a sense of whimsy that suits the offbeat premise, and the show's visuals are often striking. The use of split screens and other stylistic flourishes adds to the show's charm and helps to keep things visually interesting.

The acting of the supporting cast is also good, with standout performances from Nathan Lane as a washed-up actor and Amy Ryan as a grieving widow. Each of the characters in the show is given a distinct personality and backstory, which helps to flesh out the world and make it feel lived-in.

The story itself is entertaining, with plenty of twists and turns to keep the audience guessing. The show's central mystery is intriguing, and the way it slowly unfolds over the course of the season is well done. The show also delves into themes of loneliness, friendship, and obsession, which adds depth to the characters and makes the stakes feel higher.

However, the story does have some noticeable plot holes that are hard to ignore. Several key developments feel contrived and lack the necessary setup to make them feel believable. The show also relies heavily on coincidences to move the plot forward, which can be frustrating for viewers looking for a more cohesive narrative.

Overall, ""Only Murders in the Building"" is a mediocre show that falls short of its potential. While Martin and Short are comedic powerhouses, Gomez's performance leaves a lot to be desired. The direction and supporting cast are solid, and the story is entertaining, but the plot holes are hard to ignore. Despite its flaws, the show may still be worth checking out for fans of the cast or the mystery genre. However, viewers looking for a standout comedy or mystery may be disappointed.","August 31, 2021 (United States)",only murders in the building is a new comedic mystery series on hulu that has gained a lot of attention thanks in large part to its starstudded cast the show follows three neighbors in a new york city apartment building who bond over their love of true crime podcasts and become amateur sleuths after a murder occurs in their own building the premise is intriguing and has the potential to be a lot of fun but the execution falls short in several key areas first and foremost it must be said that steve martin and martin short are comedic geniuses they bring their trademark humor and chemistry to their roles as charleshaden savage and oliver putnam respectively and are easily the highlights of the show their banter and oneliners are a joy to watch and provide many of the shows funniest moments unfortunately the same cannot be said for selena gomez who plays mabel mora the third member of the trio gomezs acting leaves a lot to be desired while she has improved over the years her performance in only murders in the building is often wooden and lacks the natural charisma of her costars she struggles to keep up with martin and shorts comedic timing and falls flat in several key scenes its clear that shes trying her best but the contrast between her performance and that of martin and short is stark the direction of the show is solid with a clear vision and style that sets it apart from other comedies director jamie babbit infuses the show with a sense of whimsy that suits the offbeat premise and the shows visuals are often striking the use of split screens and other stylistic flourishes adds to the shows charm and helps to keep things visually interesting the acting of the supporting cast is also good with standout performances from nathan lane as a washedup actor and amy ryan as a grieving widow each of the characters in the show is given a distinct personality and backstory which helps to flesh out the world and make it feel livedin the story itself is entertaining with plenty of twists and turns to keep the audience guessing the shows central mystery is intriguing and the way it slowly unfolds over the course of the season is well done the show also delves into themes of loneliness friendship and obsession which adds depth to the characters and makes the stakes feel higher however the story does have some noticeable plot holes that are hard to ignore several key developments feel contrived and lack the necessary setup to make them feel believable the show also relies heavily on coincidences to move the plot forward which can be frustrating for viewers looking for a more cohesive narrative overall only murders in the building is a mediocre show that falls short of its potential while martin and short are comedic powerhouses gomezs performance leaves a lot to be desired the direction and supporting cast are solid and the story is entertaining but the plot holes are hard to ignore despite its flaws the show may still be worth checking out for fans of the cast or the mystery genre however viewers looking for a standout comedy or mystery may be disappointed,POSITIVE

484,484,10.0,20 July 2022,"The first season was decent, in fact mostly enjoyable to watch, although it could get a little frustrating at times, so hence the fast forward comment. Season two is not decent, it's hard to watch and the fast forward gets used a lot more, which is a shame. The reason for the negativity of season two is simple, Amy Schumer, she just does not fit, in fact I'd go as far to say her character and performance is cringe-worthy. For the love of me I can't understand where the idea came to put her in any part of this show, sorry but the proof is in the viewing. Selena Gomez is actually the star of the show, she holds the balance of the three main characters and makes it work, Steve Martin plays to his strengths and you get what you expect from him. Martin Short can be frustrating at times, and at other times he can be really funny, but he fits into the chemistry of the show. I honestly think ""Only Murders In The Building"" could be a real winner, it needs a little help with the storyline and script but it has real potential. Also some of the other characters could come into play a little more, Bunny was a great character but unfortunately season two kind of put a crimp in that idea.

I don't like to have to tune in to an episode every week. Which is kind of done. Netflix has those. But is willing to put a full season on demand. You binge watch. I wait for that.

494,494,10.0,14 March 2022,"If you want to see a very creative, smartly-cast, visually-stylish, amazingly-musically-scored, atmospheric, superfunny comedy with a neat murder mystery, look no further than ""Only murders in the building"". It's very pleasant viewing, just a delight to watch (and listen to). My opinion is also that its dramatic elements range from inspired and excellent to lame and paint-by-the-numbers, and the acting slips on occasion. Now, my cultural-geographic and age-related demographic profile means that I only know Selena Gomez of the three leads, I've listened to a few of her songs, and I like at least one ('Good for you"", with ADollar-SignAP Rocky), she's a perfectly decent singer. She's a pretty decent actress too, as it turns out, but she stumbles at times and needs to develop a bit more range. People sometimes seem to think that playing an emotionally-reserved character means being a bad actor, which is absolutely dumb, but Selena's not entirely without fault here. To be fair, I also would say that about Steve Martin, and he has decades of experience, and as such fewer excuses. In the meantime, while Martin Short's character has cringier moments, for the most part he's an absolute joy to behold, a charming, jovial aesthete and wheeler-dealer of the art world, a formidable theatre director past his prime. He outshines the other two a little bit for me, I guess I'm a ""Putnut"" by the show's own terminology.

This series is in a way a love-letter to New York's elite classes' scene, where intelligentsia and bourgeoisie mix. I'm not sure whether I'll ever watch through ""Russian doll"", which taps into the same captivating surroundings, while a seemingly worse series, but this one surely sates my appetite for a while. The premise is as follows: three ""bohemian layabouts"" (if you know, you know), two of them very elderly, live in a big housing complex, the Arconia. They share a passion for ""true crime"" podcasts and, befriending each other by chance, decide to launch their own when a murder occurs in the building. They won't cover any other murders, ""only murders in the building"", see? In a way, the tidal wave of podcasting is presented as a modern reimagining of the classic ""American Dream"", or ""conquering New York"", where even your average Jane, or some have-been down-on-their-luck losers can have a shot at grabbing a huge audience, and captivating people's minds. To be fair, the podcasting stuff is more of a backdrop: it informs a lot of things, but the series is very liberal with assumed time-skips, so we mostly see the sleuthing, not the recording, and a lot of events happen off-screen. But this unlikely trio not only desperately tries to solve the case (or figure out whether there is at all a case), they also legitimately develop chemistry, and help each other grow. Here the show loses me a little bit: Mabel's story is interesting (Zoe is a great character with a very cool plotline, mostly told in the most creative episode of the show with minimal spoken dialogue), but is executed a bit handwavily, and Charles' story occasionally is quite lame and cringy. The actual, central mystery is, however, pretty neat, even if there are some simplistic, cliche-ish parts. Something to fix for the upcoming Season 2, hopefully. They have a true jewel with this series, it just needs more refinement.

Finally, as to the overall presentation of the show: the colourful, stylised intro sequences and outro stills are great, and the music that plays sporadically throughout the series and during some of the outros is absolutely euphoric - outros of episodes 2 and 3 especially brought me total bliss, I really gotta find the OST on YouTube. Additionally, a neat little detail is that episodes typically begin with some abstract ponderings by a character, typically a supporting one, new each time. It's not a hugely important detail, but I found it a nice bit of flair.","August 31, 2021 (United States)",if you want to see a very creative smartlycast visuallystylish amazinglymusicallyscored atmospheric superfunny comedy with a neat murder mystery look no further than only murders in the building its very pleasant viewing just a delight to watch and listen to my opinion is also that its dramatic elements range from inspired and excellent to lame and paintbythenumbers and the acting slips on occasion now my culturalgeographic and agerelated demographic profile means that i only know selena gomez of the three leads ive listened to a few of her songs and i like at least one good for you with adollarsignap rocky shes a perfectly decent singer shes a pretty decent actress too as it turns out but she stumbles at times and needs to develop a bit more range people sometimes seem to think that playing an emotionallyreserved character means being a bad actor which is absolutely dumb but selenas not entirely without fault here to be fair i also would say that about steve martin and he has decades of experience and as such fewer excuses in the meantime while martin shorts character has cringier moments for the most part hes an absolute joy to behold a charming jovial aesthete and wheelerdealer of the art world a formidable theatre director past his prime he outshines the other two a little bit for me i guess im a putnut by the shows own terminology this series is in a way a loveletter to new yorks elite classes scene where intelligentsia and bourgeoisie mix im not sure whether ill ever watch through russian doll which taps into the same captivating surroundings while a seemingly worse series but this one surely sates my appetite for a while the premise is as follows three bohemian layabouts if you know you know two of them very elderly live in a big housing complex the arconia they share a passion for true crime podcasts and befriending each other by chance decide to launch their own when a murder occurs in the building they wont cover any other murders only murders in the building see in a way the tidal wave of podcasting is presented as a modern reimagining of the classic american dream or conquering new york where even your average jane or some havebeen downontheirluck losers can have a shot at grabbing a huge audience and captivating peoples minds to be fair the podcasting stuff is more of a backdrop it informs a lot of things but the series is very liberal with assumed timeskips so we mostly see the sleuthing not the recording and a lot of events happen offscreen but this unlikely trio not only desperately tries to solve the case or figure out whether there is at all a case they also legitimately develop chemistry and help each other grow here the show loses me a little bit mabels story is interesting zoe is a great character with a very cool plotline mostly told in the most creative episode of the show with minimal spoken dialogue but is executed a bit handwavily and charles story occasionally is quite lame and cringy the actual central mystery is however pretty neat even if there are some simplistic clicheish parts something to fix for the upcoming season hopefully they have a true jewel with this series it just needs more refinement finally as to the overall presentation of the show the colourful stylised intro sequences and outro stills are great and the music that plays sporadically throughout the series and during some of the outros is absolutely euphoric outros of episodes and especially brought me total bliss i really gotta find the ost on youtube additionally a neat little detail is that episodes typically begin with some abstract ponderings by a character typically a supporting one new each time its not a hugely important detail but i found it a nice bit of flair,POSITIVE

All three bring different things to the table and I honestly think most reviewers just hate Selena because that's what I seen most reviews focusing and not really on the show it's self. It appeals to both older and younger generations. The one character I actually don't really enjoy is Jan I find her a slightly boring but still intriguing nonetheless. The whole idea behind the podcast is really fun and I like that it allows them to pursue different suspects in each episode. I also enjoyed the mystery's that are being revealed throughout.

522,522,9.0,3 September 2021,"This show is great, in that Steve Martin & Martin Short play 2 different-personality amateur sleuths. It's generally light-hearted, and is meant to be. What I find distracting and detracting is the amount of f-words used, mostly by Selena. I get that she is supposed to be a third personality type in the trio, a sarcastic younger-generation versus two older guys, but the frequency and ease with which she says f-word iterations definitely takes this series out of the ""sweet"" classification that some reviewers are calling it, and her. I wonder if she talks that way in real life, or if it's mainly because the writers wrote it that way, or maybe both.

Thumbs down to the writers for trying to spice it up in this manner. And points-off from Selena for going along with it. Unfortunately it seems that it's currently in vogue for folks to talk this way in public, online, social media etc.

Believe me, I have heard every vulgarity in the book during my social services career jobs, and have been called every foul name; but that doesn't mean that it should be considered okay, normal, acceptable for people with any amount of Class to talk that way.","August 31, 2021 (United States)",this show is great in that steve martin martin short play differentpersonality amateur sleuths its generally lighthearted and is meant to be what i find distracting and detracting is the amount of fwords used mostly by selena i get that she is supposed to be a third personality type in the trio a sarcastic youngergeneration versus two older guys but the frequency and ease with which she says fword iterations definitely takes this series out of the sweet classification that some reviewers are calling it and her i wonder if she talks that way in real life or if its mainly because the writers wrote it that way or maybe both thumbs down to the writers for trying to spice it up in this manner and pointsoff from selena for going along with it unfortunately it seems that its currently in vogue for folks to talk this way in public online social media etc believe me i have heard every vulgarity in the book during my social services career jobs and have been called every foul name but that doesnt mean that it should be considered okay normal acceptable for people with any amount of class to talk that way,POSITIVE

The show is about a trio of true crime podcast fans-Oliver (Martin Short), Charles (Steve Martin) and Mable (Selena Gomez). The three of them started bonding over a murder that happened in their building and decided to start their on podcast to investigate the murder.

The characters are very well-written, Selena Gomez really brought a great balance and the chemistry between the three is amazing! The storyline has some twist and turns, the pace is just right, the mysteries are not too predictable, and the show keeps running in a quirky, engaging, funny atmosphere.

Looking forward to the next season, the producers really did a great job casting Selena, her interviews with the duo are funny as well, it's like a gen-z babysitting her grandparents lol!

569,569,2.0,29 March 2022,"The trailer made this look like one of those desperate high-concept made for TV movies, or a bad reunion show. But it's fantastic. A tight, topical and insightful script - both comic and melancholic, bringing to mind Planes, Trains and Automobiles. Beautiful locations and cinematography. All the technicals are top notch, as is the casting and acting. Nothing about the show feels dated or out of touch.

The chemistry between Martin and Short is something to behold, so much so that ""Martin and Short"" might as well be admitted to the pantheon of ""Martin & Lewis"", etc. And it's great to see the singular Martin Short in a major role again.

Actually that's not true: it ought to be ""Martin & Short & Gomez"". I was baffled to see her name in the cast (I've not seen much of her work) but she not only fits in perfectly with Martin and Short, but I think her stoic, hard and (sort of) sweetness balances the combination of the two other leads (a mix akin to Kirk, Spock and McCoy.).

573,573,10.0,4 October 2023,"OMITB is really special and, while I understand that Selena Gomez was likely cast to incorporate her large/younger fan base as viewers, she is ruining this great show!

Martin Short and Steve Martin do the heavy lifting, entertainment-wise, but Selena's severely nasal voice and desert-dry acting is more than terrible... it's extremely distracting and offputting. If not for the magnificent aesthetics of that gorgeous building and the magic of the Short/Martin chemistry, I wouldn't be able to keep watching this show.

My husband and I started watching it together, but Selena's voice was a deal-breaker for him. He does keep trying, due to our love for Martin and Steve, but he can never sit thru any 'Mabel' scenes. I barely get thru them, myself.

I understand the deadpan/moody-youth character she is trying to play, but she is failing miserably. Better examples are Jenna Ortega as Wednesday or Lisa Kudrow as Ursula (Phoebe's twin, on Friends). It's not the character, as many Selena fans would argue, it's Selena. The acting is sub par and dry, her voice is way too nasal, and even her body language is constantly awkward. It also seems like the costume designer is working against her. Most of her looks are either ill-fitting or just hideous.

Short and Martin can/do carry this show on their own. I don't anticipate the showrunners will replace Selena at this late stage, but I do hope they reduce her lines in Season 4 to reduce the cringe-factor a bit.

This show has such charm and true Hollywood showmanship in the more mature members of the cast. While I can appreciate the dynamic of the generation gap between the stars of the show, 'Mabel' is quite immature in the way she responds to ""the olds"". The writers have her behaving like a moody teen, but she is nearly 30. This was a misstep. I hope they smooth it out in future seasons.

Well, wow. Of course she is PERFECT. And what a strange coincidence that in episode three, the theme runs to one particular actor outshining the others.

588,588,7.0,23 August 2022,"I originally decided to watch this solely because Steve Martin was in it with the bonus of Martin Short. I was worried when I saw Selena Gomez was part of the cast. Not because I had any particular issue with her I just had never seen her acting before and her music is not my preference.

As it turns out it those three work beautifully together. Don't expect an out an out comedy, and don't expect the most taxing thriller. What we do get is a gentle comedic mystery that leaves you with a big smile on your face at the end of each episode together with a little teaser of what's to come. It draws you in and makes you yearn for the next episode. I've seen a review where a minor gripe was the length of the episodes. I see the point because you are always left wanting more. However, most podcasts are released in short but size episodes and this replicates that feel.

Bear in mind it is an homage to True Crime podcasts and not intended to be a Complex thriller though you do need to pay attention to keep up with the twists. A regular flow different characters, of guest stars, some appearing as themselves, keeps it fresh. This is one of my favourite things out there at the moment and am really pleased it looks like there will be a series 3.

It's close to a 10/10 but a few red herrings are a bit too obvious.

As far as where to watch it, these are options as of late January 2022. It's a Hulu original series so you could subscribe and watch it there, but they ask for your birthday and gender. Your birthday is sensitive information and none of their business. Once I gave a fake birthday to another nosy company. They reported it to a credit bureau and caused some issues.

Due to this, I tried subscribing to Disney+ because they said they had this series. That was a waste of time. First it was hard to tell which subscriptions had it. I guessed. AFTER they got my money I learned I had to download an app. Then I still had to sign up for Hulu. The Hulu sign up process malfunctioned.

The beautiful building, and the secrets it hides, is a perfect way to tie everything together.

Mixing the old hands of Steve Martin and Martin Short with younger actors was a master stroke to widen the appeal of this series. The gentle digs at the misunderstandings between the generations is especially lovely without being disrespectful.

606,606,7.0,20 March 2024,"""Only Murders in the Building"" embarks on a delightful journey, blending fantastic writing, surprising chemistry among the leads, and well-developed supporting characters. With high production values and witty dialogue peppered with slapstick humor, it promises an enjoyable watch.

Season 1 introduces us to a trio of murder-podcast aficionados investigating a homicide in their upscale apartment building. Steve Martin and Martin Short shine with their comedic prowess, complemented by Selena Gomez's refreshing performance. Despite Gomez's nasal voice, the trio's dynamic keeps viewers engaged, making the series binge-worthy.

The first season captures the essence of New York City with its quirky characters and witty banter. It's a light-hearted romp with a sprinkling of mystery and drama, reminiscent of classic comedy-mystery series like ""Monk"" and ""Jonathan Creek."" While not groundbreaking, it offers good, honest fun that earns its 9-star rating.

However, Season 2 struggles to recapture the magic, stumbling with clumsy humor and a jarring guest appearance by Amy Schumer. Although it eventually finds its footing, it treads familiar ground, failing to match the originality of its predecessor.

Season 3, unfortunately, sinks further, losing its charm and coherence. Steve Martin's character becomes caricatured, and Selena Gomez's performance lacks the spark of earlier seasons. The once-engaging mystery devolves into nonsensical motives, leaving viewers disappointed.

Despite its uneven trajectory, ""Only Murders in the Building"" remains a commendable effort, buoyed by its standout first season. While subsequent seasons may falter, the series' initial brilliance ensures it's a must-watch for fans of comedy mysteries, offering a tantalizing blend of suspense, humor, and quirky characters.","August 31, 2021 (United States)",only murders in the building embarks on a delightful journey blending fantastic writing surprising chemistry among the leads and welldeveloped supporting characters with high production values and witty dialogue peppered with slapstick humor it promises an enjoyable watch season introduces us to a trio of murderpodcast aficionados investigating a homicide in their upscale apartment building steve martin and martin short shine with their comedic prowess complemented by selena gomezs refreshing performance despite gomezs nasal voice the trios dynamic keeps viewers engaged making the series bingeworthy the first season captures the essence of new york city with its quirky characters and witty banter its a lighthearted romp with a sprinkling of mystery and drama reminiscent of classic comedymystery series like monk and jonathan creek while not groundbreaking it offers good honest fun that earns its star rating however season struggles to recapture the magic stumbling with clumsy humor and a jarring guest appearance by amy schumer although it eventually finds its footing it treads familiar ground failing to match the originality of its predecessor season unfortunately sinks further losing its charm and coherence steve martins character becomes caricatured and selena gomezs performance lacks the spark of earlier seasons the onceengaging mystery devolves into nonsensical motives leaving viewers disappointed despite its uneven trajectory only murders in the building remains a commendable effort buoyed by its standout first season while subsequent seasons may falter the series initial brilliance ensures its a mustwatch for fans of comedy mysteries offering a tantalizing blend of suspense humor and quirky characters,POSITIVE

619,619,5.0,19 February 2023,"Had no idea this existed until the gf wanted something similar to Knives Out and Clue. Over the course of a few weeks we watched season 1 (very solid, worth the current review score) and season 2 (sloppy mess, feels more like a 4 star).

Season 2 review: Dont bother. The ending is almost pointless and feels like a rushed re-write when everyone realized who the REAL killer was supposed to be by episode 6. It feels obvious by the script, as well as Selena Gomez's massive weight changes throughout, that the second season went through massive reshoots, to its detriment. The only highlights are really Steve Martin and Martin Short hamming it up.

Season 1 review: Steve Martin and Martin Short are back together with the same chemistry they had in the old days. My gf, having only just having seen Three Amigos for the first time shortly before we learned about this, commented on the duo's comedy chops, which are still quite strong. Selena Gomez, unfortunately, is far more one note in all of her acting. Her speaking mannerism is this odd grumbly flatness and she rarely shows emotion or acting range and often just stands there and says her lines in her flat, monotone voice. Shes not exactly BAD, but she definitely is not good. Her lack of acting make Steve Martin and Martin Short shine by comparison. The trio stumble their way into each others otherwise secluded lives via their shared love of true crime podcasts. The story is engaging and often fun and funny, though there are also some very 'real' moments sprinkled throughout.

The first season gave us enough information to go on that you could absolutely figure out whodunit, while throwing in ample red herrings to throw you off the scent.

No such luck for the second season when it feels like the revealed killer comes out of the blue, and feels messy and disjointed.

There will inevitably be a season 3, and I hope that they have a better script than what they put us through from season 2.","August 31, 2021 (United States)",had no idea this existed until the gf wanted something similar to knives out and clue over the course of a few weeks we watched season very solid worth the current review score and season sloppy mess feels more like a star season review dont bother the ending is almost pointless and feels like a rushed rewrite when everyone realized who the real killer was supposed to be by episode it feels obvious by the script as well as selena gomezs massive weight changes throughout that the second season went through massive reshoots to its detriment the only highlights are really steve martin and martin short hamming it up season review steve martin and martin short are back together with the same chemistry they had in the old days my gf having only just having seen three amigos for the first time shortly before we learned about this commented on the duos comedy chops which are still quite strong selena gomez unfortunately is far more one note in all of her acting her speaking mannerism is this odd grumbly flatness and she rarely shows emotion or acting range and often just stands there and says her lines in her flat monotone voice shes not exactly bad but she definitely is not good her lack of acting make steve martin and martin short shine by comparison the trio stumble their way into each others otherwise secluded lives via their shared love of true crime podcasts the story is engaging and often fun and funny though there are also some very real moments sprinkled throughout the first season gave us enough information to go on that you could absolutely figure out whodunit while throwing in ample red herrings to throw you off the scent no such luck for the second season when it feels like the revealed killer comes out of the blue and feels messy and disjointed there will inevitably be a season and i hope that they have a better script than what they put us through from season,NEGATIVE

647,647,9.0,27 March 2024,"For me by far the highlight of this is Martin Short. In series 1 and 2 he's simply dazzling, series 3 still decently good.

Steve Martin has good chemistry with him but he feels either a bit flat or a bit 2D. Just a dash of 1970s/1980s Martin to pep things up would have made such a difference.

Everyone else has their moment(s) but they really feel like glue connecting Short and Martin.

When the glue is strong, as it is in season 1, the show is excellent. There are clunky sections (especially episode 1) but the show just zings along frothily. Very enjoyable.

Season 2 the glue isn't quite as strong and it feels to me like too many hands wee involved, muddying things and so detracting from that central pair.

Season 3 was really disappointing, the joint screen time not enough to make the show more than ""interesting, should have been better"", and the side stars simply distracting. Short also seems flatter, less energetic.

I hope they don't make a season 4 and dilute things yet more.

If they want to do anything, please make it one off specials or movies, kept nice and tight and really, really focus on keeping the 3 on screen together.","August 31, 2021 (United States)",for me by far the highlight of this is martin short in series and hes simply dazzling series still decently good steve martin has good chemistry with him but he feels either a bit flat or a bit d just a dash of ss martin to pep things up would have made such a difference everyone else has their moments but they really feel like glue connecting short and martin when the glue is strong as it is in season the show is excellent there are clunky sections especially episode but the show just zings along frothily very enjoyable season the glue isnt quite as strong and it feels to me like too many hands wee involved muddying things and so detracting from that central pair season was really disappointing the joint screen time not enough to make the show more than interesting should have been better and the side stars simply distracting short also seems flatter less energetic i hope they dont make a season and dilute things yet more if they want to do anything please make it one off specials or movies kept nice and tight and really really focus on keeping the on screen together,POSITIVE

657,657,10.0,1 February 2024,"SO i had been wanting to watch this show for a while having not watched much on Hulu but I decided to watch The Bear after all the success that show had received and loved it and needed something more light hearted after that so I thought id try ONLY MURDERS IN THE BUILDING. And I just loved this show!

The characters are really well written and although its based around the three main characters it really does have a good ensemble cast that add new additions each season. Howard is defiantly a standout. Bunny and Uma are also great, and I love how they flesh out the characters and they aren't just there for the sake of it.

Sometimes they do glaze over certain things, which I do find a little annoying, but its usually basic things like why is that character there, because before they were in jail etc. (not saying who to avoid spoilers)

I also love how inclusive this show is without hitting you over the head with it. I would like to see more from the podcast fans cause they are funny and add a fun angle to the stories. Its so rare to see a person in a wheelchair on tv so its nice that you have a show with deaf, physically disabled and what seems like a few mental health issues characters in a show and it not be about their disabilities.

I do find it fun that the murder mysteries are always twists but not ones that you find unbelievable.

This show has made me laugh out loud multiple times which is rare for comedy shows but it just keeps up in quality. I hope this show does end with the next one. Why? Because i think it will get stale if they mare more, and end it when its on a high. Learn from the british, we end our best shows after 2-3 seasons of usually 6 episodes.

664,664,9.0,13 August 2022,"Only Murders in the building follows a trio of tenants as they try to solve a murder that took place in their building.

I was not at all expecting to like this first season as much as I did. The show was something I looked at but was never really interested in, I saw it as more of a parody of sorts so it didn't appeal to me. That being said when I saw a critic I deeply respect praise the second season I figured I should give it a go.

What I like most about the first season is the mix of genres. This is through and through a dramedy, but it takes that genre and blends it with a murder mystery so not only does it take you on a roller coaster of emotions it continuously keeps you guessing at who killed Tim Kono.

The core trio of Steve Martin, Martin Short and Selena Gomez have some of the best on screen group chemistry I've seen in a modern day show. Each one of them plays off of the other extremely well and it's a lot of fun to watch.

In terms of gripes I don't really have many, the only thing that slightly annoyed me was that their were certain subplots, that I feel could've been explored more so that when they came to and end it would've felt more earned.

Overall ""Only Murders in the Building"" season 1 is fantastic. With a stacked cast and a extremely talented group of writers this show is far better than I expected.

9/10 A.

After another murder occurs in the building our core trio are under the spotlight as the prime suspects

This season is just as good as the first and honestly I feel the exact same way as I did the for the first season, so I'll keep this short.

The core trio of Selena Gomez, Martin Short, and Steve Martin are what make this show their chemistry is off the charts and it's awesome to watch.

The story unfolds in a very well structured manner. The twists and turns keep you on the edge of your seat while the character development is strong throughout.

This show does have a theme of underdeveloped subplots which isn't a big deal because they are subplots but something to mention.

She knows how to handle the two neurotic and self-centered comedy duo and she plays her part very well. She is funny, serious , beautiful and lovely all at the same time.

674,674,10.0,19 March 2023,"All thanks to the recent drama and Selena Gomez showing Meryl Streep and Paul Rudd that I decided to check into this show.

As a true crime listener too, this show has everything that I love. A great puzzle and question, great cast and characters, spot on humour and just an all out charm.

It is not too dark but it has the mystery set out perfectly. The puzzle is not too hard but not too easy either.

Season 1 pilot was really well done. It hook you in, introduce the characters, and set the mystery perfectly.

Season 2 has some sloppy bits. The mystery is still great but some set setting is a bit off.

Shout out to Theo. S1 ep 7 was a standout. I really like how they switch up the narrative a bit and see from other character's perspective. Even the dead one. It makes the series a lot more interesting and less monotone. 10 episodes are perfect length too. Not too long or too short.

Steve Martin and Martin Short do a great job playing those two nuts. They are vivid and memorable. It's a great duo. Selena Gomez plays their young, serious and snarky counterpart to balance it out.

The pacing is great, narration well thought-out. Every episode absorbs characters in a tiny sub-story revealing bit by bit the whole puzzle so even when things go sideways, it pins it on personality quirks.

This show is amazing, and refreshing. I love all the characters. I love their dynamic together. Martin Short is hilarious. He always adds such zest to whatever he is in. Selena Gomez is actually really good. If you get what kind/type of person she is portraying she will be both funny, and understandable to you. This show is a rare type in that I can watch multiple episodes in a row, and not even want to stop (binge watching, as the kids call it). Usually I don't like watching tv at all but this show sucks me in, and I can't stop watching. Wanting to know what the next episode has to offer.

The second season was as exciting as the first. It was great to see Shirley MacLaine. Though I do hope that we won't be seeing any more of Amy Schumer.

A little over the top at times but that is to be expected if you have both Steve Martin and Martin Short in the same show. It was that casting got me interested although the truth is I did not expect much so i was very pleasantly surprised.

Now lets talk about Selena. There has been a lot of criticism of her limited acting skills and her lack of screen presence. She is certainly a very famous artist for younger viewers who probably do not know the two Martins. So she would widen the viewer net.

However, casting Selena works on another level for me. Almost all the other characters in the show are almost cartoon like while Silena´s character is quite the opposite. Wooden? Maybe, but the casting works for me. I like to see her in a scene, she seems to average out the energy levels of the two male leads.","August 31, 2021 (United States)",i find only murders in the building to be a fun watch a little over the top at times but that is to be expected if you have both steve martin and martin short in the same show it was that casting got me interested although the truth is i did not expect much so i was very pleasantly surprised now lets talk about selena there has been a lot of criticism of her limited acting skills and her lack of screen presence she is certainly a very famous artist for younger viewers who probably do not know the two martins so she would widen the viewer net however casting selena works on another level for me almost all the other characters in the show are almost cartoon like while silenas character is quite the opposite wooden maybe but the casting works for me i like to see her in a scene she seems to average out the energy levels of the two male leads,POSITIVE

Rating it an 8 as I binged all three available episodes it kept my attention and made me feel general happiness which is a bonus in today's world! I like the main mystery, and I am wondering more about the story. They could move a bit quicker with actual pieces of the mystery though, a few more twists would be fine. It's not laugh out loud funny but I had several chuckles.

Btw- the reviews here ? A bit much. The gushing, ""best-ever-show"" 10 ratings are all from one-show reviewers which is suspect of course. I'm sure Hulu had to put some money into paying three big name actors so trying to push this to a higher rating perhaps for popularity?

I did enjoy the first few episodes, the surprises and twists were well timed and kept me engaged.... And then the entire middle of the season slowed way down and I got bored.

Steve Martin carried the show, he did a great job and seemed to be having a blast in his role. Selena Gomez was enjoyable to watch as the New York Millennial, but goodness does she have a monotone voice (I'll never know how she's such a great singer with a talking voice that is as flat as Kansas). Finally, Martin Short... perhaps he was doing an excellent job - perhaps his instructions were ""be the most annoying neighbor you can think of, so annoying that you even irk the audience.""

Script for this character is dead inside..

Each episode. Everyone is great. But, Mabel just seems extremely depressed and medicated. I don't know if that's part of her character yet. I'm only on Episode 7. But, it's just so hard to watch.

Maybe this show could bring in a character. From the past a best friend who was forced to move away and now she's come back to help Mabel with the podcast. Each day she brings Mable's charter back to life. I would love to see that.

This was expensive production, so they could have invested in better writing, at least. But no, the story flow is hectic, with change of rhythm and pace all the time; dialogues are lacing point and timing al the time. It looks like somebody really neglected post production.

717,717,10.0,13 August 2023,"Only Murders in the Building hasn't been extremely popular with the people I engage with. I can name exactly one person that watched it, who made me watch it.

I've came across this show a few times. I hadn't read about it or seen any trailers but the cast made it interesting enough for me to try and give this a chance. And then... I finally did.

The show has a ''what's going to happen next or who is going to get killed next'' vibe but set more in modern times, through their podcast. I must say I loved it from the first episode but I got instantly hooked after episode 2.

I have a very short attention spam and for me to binge something, it has to be really good, which I think this show was. Steve Martin is great, Martin Short is absolute brilliant and brings such a great dose of humor to the show and I got an unexpected crush on Selena Gomez who is just great in this.

Without spoiling too much, you'll have thoughts and suspects throughout the show. You suspect the show to be a funny dark comedy, but the storyline is actually written very well. Might not be for everyone, but I'm a fan.

Will probably re-watch season 1 soon as I called my mom last night after I finished the last episode of season 1. Just watched the trailer for season 2 and I' very excited.

741,741,9.0,3 September 2024,"I absolutely adore Only Murders in the Building! Each character brings something uniquely delightful to the table. Steve Martin as Charles showcases brilliant comedic timing with his deadpan delivery and hilarious expressions, especially that confused look he gets when he realizes he's in a murder mystery. His attempts to be cool often lead to adorably awkward moments that are just pure gold. Martin Short as Oliver brings a whirlwind of energy, with his snorts and exaggerated expressions making every scene entertaining. He balances being hilariously self-absorbed with genuine care for his friends. Selena Gomez as Mabel adds a refreshing touch with her dry humor and relatable cynicism, keeping the guys grounded while delivering spot-on comebacks. Together, they create a charming dynamic that not only keeps you laughing but also makes the show feel uplifting and engaging, unlike typical crime stories. The mix of humor and real themes makes Only Murders in the Building a delightful watch!

What sets this show apart from typical crime stories is its lighthearted approach. It manages to keep viewers entertained and uplifted, even as it delves into serious themes like friendship and loneliness. The chemistry between the three leads is fantastic, creating moments that are both hilarious and heartfelt. Their quirky personalities and comedic timing elevate the mood, making the show feel less like a standard crime drama and more like a fun adventure.

Each season introduces new mysteries and twists, ensuring that it never feels boring.

743,743,8.0,19 January 2022,"I Love Steve Martin, Martin Short and Selena Gomez! Period!

Beginning right from naming of this series, it is a sheer work of Geniuses. As the name suggests, it is based on murder mystery and with the 3 top names to the tag, one can expect nothing but a masterpiece.

The story is pretty slow in the beginning and picks up in around 7th episode but let me assure you that it keeps you glued throughout because of the cracking jokes and amazing acting done by Martin Short, Steve Martin, Selena Gomez, Nathan Lane, Amy Ryan and the rest.

I personally feel that there should be more cracking jokes added to the story, which will make it definitely more appealing plus a more challenging plot would be welcoming as I had already guessed the murderer and just like me, other people would too.

The writing is wonderful and I give credit to the directors who have done an amazing job with the twisting plot and keeping the things moving.

Great chemistry between the cast.

Steve Martin and Martin Short play their parts perfectly, with Gomez masterfully pulling off the difficult ""snarky, mean loner who is actually very likeable"" role.

I wanted to know about the characters from the very start.

745,745,10.0,13 September 2024,"I loved the central place of the heritage apartment building called The Arconia in the first two seasons...it is like a character in itself. That seems to drop off somewhat in Season 3 when another venue begins to ""steal the show.""

I was pleasantly surprised by Meryl Streep's singing ability demonstrated in Season 3. Everyone knows her acting talent but I hadn't known of that extra talent in her back pocket.

I have to agree with reviewers who have commented on Selena Gomez' performance, her nasal and expressionless voice especially, bringing down the show's quality. I just finished Season 3 and have found her increasingly irritating as time goes on. Unfortunately with the three amigos scenario built into the series, there just wouldn't be a way to replace her.

I have assumed Gomez is in the cast to add a little youth appeal because Steve Martin and Martin Short are older actors. But, wow, this performer is a distraction because she isn't up to the level of the rest of the cast. I have continued watching despite her seeming like a fish out of water (or the elephant in the room?)

I will watch the Season 4 episodes that are out already and decide if I want to spend another month's streaming subscription fee to watch it to that season's end.","August 31, 2021 (United States)",i loved the central place of the heritage apartment building called the arconia in the first two seasonsit is like a character in itself that seems to drop off somewhat in season when another venue begins to steal the show i was pleasantly surprised by meryl streeps singing ability demonstrated in season everyone knows her acting talent but i hadnt known of that extra talent in her back pocket i have to agree with reviewers who have commented on selena gomez performance her nasal and expressionless voice especially bringing down the shows quality i just finished season and have found her increasingly irritating as time goes on unfortunately with the three amigos scenario built into the series there just wouldnt be a way to replace her i have assumed gomez is in the cast to add a little youth appeal because steve martin and martin short are older actors but wow this performer is a distraction because she isnt up to the level of the rest of the cast i have continued watching despite her seeming like a fish out of water or the elephant in the room i will watch the season episodes that are out already and decide if i want to spend another months streaming subscription fee to watch it to that seasons end,NEGATIVE
746,746,6.0,26 September 2023,"My expectations were high, after all the positive reactions, almost a hype that arose around the series. But unfortunately, this series absolutely could not ignite with me and it does not even come close to the hype. I tried to like it and almost struggled through the episodes. It was supposed to be fun, funny and engaging but unfortunately everything seems so forced.

To make it extraordinary creative ways are taken, the suspects are put on a stage, or there is an episode that takes place completely without speech, only background noise and sign language, with subtitles. But all this doesn't help make it more entertaining. Because the overall pace is so slow that it was just insanely boring.

The three characters, Charles, Oliver and Mabel, already seem to harmonize with each other, but honestly it seems like a last desperate gasp for relevance for Martin Short and Steve Martin. Sadly, it ends up being ridiculous and cheap. Selena's one dimensional acting, adds nothing to the series. She has a single facial expression and I could not detect any acting talent in her in this series. She delivers her lines so monotonously that she lacks any comedic timing.

The plot is nonsensical and swings awkwardly between boring drama and flat comedy, the action is slow and the dialogues are stilted. An arc of suspense isn't built up, as everything is talked over and over again, the focus is too much on the three characters with their backgrounds and the podcast project. The resolution at the end seems very far-fetched and not comprehensible.

The series commits one of the biggest writing mistakes possible, it explains too much, it even explains the comedy instead of being funny. It all comes together, jokes that could still make it into the 80's, poor casting, tired, terrible script that tries to fit a joke everywhere, even with the cliffhangers at the end of each episode it's still boring and dialogue that could be from a school play. In addition, music that goes in the direction of musical, with which I can not do so much.

The story progresses unbearably slowly, becoming uninteresting over time.

The last episode of the first season ends with a cliffhanger that you have to watch the second season if you want to know the resolution. I have only watched half of the second season so far and will not continue unless I have to. In addition, fans of the first season are disappointed by the second and third and the reviews are getting worse. Thus, it will probably not get better for me.

The three strangers, played by Steve Martin, Martin Short and Selena Gomez, all live in the building and are brought together during a fire alarm because of their love of a true crime podcast (the podcast is done by a character played by Tina Fey), everything is not ok in Oklahoma. When the three of them discover there has been a death in the building, they decide to come together to solve it...and naturally do a podcast about it.

Amazing cameos and wonderful melancholy storylines...everyone seems to be hiding something, which is a great set up for a who-done-it. I loved the characters and I thought the casting was excellent - I had never heard of Selena Gomez but I loved her in this.

It is very light going with a scattering of jokes and mild drama.

There is the odd speciality episode like the one without any spoken dialogue.

Other reviewers have stated that, although alright, this is not as great as people make out.

Technically they are absolutely right - it isn't ground shattering stuff.

But as a fan of the likes of ""Monk"", ""Jonathan Creek"", ""Rizzoli & Isles"" it feels like there has not been anything new in the same vein for quite a while.

This is good, honest, light, sleuthy fun and the smile on my face as I watched every episode justifies my 9 star rating alone.

767,767,8.0,10 September 2024,"""Only Murders in the Building"" is a masterful blend of mystery, comedy, and drama that has quickly become one of the standout series of recent years. Created by Steve Martin and John Hoffman, this show is an impressive demonstration of how a well-crafted premise can evolve into a deeply engaging and entertaining narrative.

The series is set in the luxurious but enigmatic Arconia apartment building, where three seemingly disparate residents-Charles-Haden Savage (Steve Martin), Oliver Putnam (Martin Short), and Mabel Mora (Selena Gomez)-find their lives intertwined by a shared fascination with true crime. When a murder occurs in their building, these three neighbors, who bond over their mutual love for true crime podcasts, decide to investigate the crime themselves. This decision propels the show into a labyrinth of twists and turns that keep viewers on the edge of their seats.

Characters and Performances

The heart of ""Only Murders in the Building"" lies in its remarkable cast. Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Selena Gomez deliver standout performances, each bringing a unique flair to their roles.

Steve Martin's Charles-Haden Savage, a former TV actor, is both endearing and hilariously out of touch with the modern world. Martin's portrayal of Charles is a perfect balance of charm and comic timing, highlighting his character's vulnerability and complexity. Martin Short's Oliver Putnam, an exuberant and often theatrical Broadway director, provides a comic counterpoint with his over-the-top personality and emotional depth. Short's comedic genius shines through, creating moments of genuine laughter and emotional resonance.

Selena Gomez's Mabel Mora, the youngest of the trio, brings a fresh and nuanced energy to the series. Gomez skillfully navigates Mabel's emotional layers, from her sharp wit to her poignant past. The dynamic between these three characters is nothing short of electrifying, as their different perspectives and personalities create a delightful blend of humor and drama.

Writing and Direction

The writing in ""Only Murders in the Building"" is exceptional. The show's creators have crafted a narrative that is both intricately plotted and richly layered. The dialogue is sharp and witty, often delivering clever commentary on the world of true crime and podcast culture. The mystery itself is engaging, filled with twists and red herrings that keep the audience guessing until the very end.

John Hoffman and Steve Martin's direction ensures that the series maintains a perfect balance between suspense and comedy. The pacing is spot-on, with each episode contributing to the overall mystery while also delving into character development and subplots. The show's use of cliffhangers and unexpected revelations ensures that viewers are always eager for the next installment.

Production Design and Atmosphere

The Arconia building, with its old-world charm and eerie ambiance, becomes a character in its own right. The production design is meticulous, capturing the building's grandeur and quirks in a way that enhances the show's atmosphere. The stylish cinematography and well-chosen soundtrack further contribute to the series' unique tone, blending the classic elegance of the building with modern sensibilities.

Themes and Social Commentary

""Only Murders in the Building"" is more than just a mystery; it also explores themes of loneliness, connection, and the search for purpose. Through its characters, the show delves into the impact of modern technology on human relationships and the ways in which people cope with isolation. The series provides a thoughtful and sometimes poignant look at how we seek meaning and companionship in an increasingly disconnected world.

Conclusion

In conclusion, ""Only Murders in the Building"" is a triumph of contemporary television. Its clever writing, exceptional performances, and engaging mystery make it a standout series. The show effortlessly combines humor and suspense while exploring deeper themes, making it both entertaining and thought-provoking.

768,768,7.0,4 August 2023,"I haven't quite made it through the first season yet. What caught my, like most I'm sure, attention was the age old Martin/Short team coming back together. It was great to see some comedic heavy hitters in something a little different. It feels like mystery of the show is just as much who the murder is as it is what famous person will show up next.

Although I realize we live in an age where so many ideas have already been done, I couldn't ignore what felt like an obvious nod to the first season of Sarah Koenig's Serial podcast. The music, Tina's Fey's character, the idea of regular(ish) citizens making a podcast attempting to get to the bottom of a murder mystery . . . It's pretty clear. And it felt a tad played out if you've heard the podcast.

Given that we seem to live in an age where good ideas have mostly been done and feesh takes can be difficult to find, each episode being presented from a different character's perspective, I thought, I was clever.

The show was very well done, but I couldn't quite seem to get completely sucked in from the start like I imagined I might, but I'll keep watching out of curiosity.","August 31, 2021 (United States)",i havent quite made it through the first season yet what caught my like most im sure attention was the age old martinshort team coming back together it was great to see some comedic heavy hitters in something a little different it feels like mystery of the show is just as much who the murder is as it is what famous person will show up next although i realize we live in an age where so many ideas have already been done i couldnt ignore what felt like an obvious nod to the first season of sarah koenigs serial podcast the music tinas feys character the idea of regularish citizens making a podcast attempting to get to the bottom of a murder mystery its pretty clear and it felt a tad played out if youve heard the podcast given that we seem to live in an age where good ideas have mostly been done and feesh takes can be difficult to find each episode being presented from a different characters perspective i thought i was clever the show was very well done but i couldnt quite seem to get completely sucked in from the start like i imagined i might but ill keep watching out of curiosity,POSITIVE
770,770,8.0,8 December 2021,"I loved the humour and the warmth you feel watching the characters interact. Our ""detectives"" are an odd ensemble of very different personalities, all of them keeping their painful past experiences secret from one another, but as they are bound together by the mystery they are trying to solve, they end up helping each other heal. I feel this series really could have been a 10/10 if only... well, if only the actual crime mystery was a bit more compelling.

The rare combination of warmth and comedy with crime brings to mind the film Knives Out. And it's not a favourable comparison to Only Murders in the Building, in my opinion. Whereas Knives Out was an Agatha Christie-style whodunnit where everyone was a suspect for the greater part of it, Only Murders in the Building dumbs the mystery down by tackling only one piece of the puzzle at a time and mostly resolving it before introducing another lead, resulting in a structure that's rather linear and not particularly stimulating to the viewer's brain cells. Regardless, I am looking forward to the second season; if it improves on this one aspect, the show may become something really great!","August 31, 2021 (United States)",i loved the humour and the warmth you feel watching the characters interact our detectives are an odd ensemble of very different personalities all of them keeping their painful past experiences secret from one another but as they are bound together by the mystery they are trying to solve they end up helping each other heal i feel this series really could have been a if only well if only the actual crime mystery was a bit more compelling the rare combination of warmth and comedy with crime brings to mind the film knives out and its not a favourable comparison to only murders in the building in my opinion whereas knives out was an agatha christiestyle whodunnit where everyone was a suspect for the greater part of it only murders in the building dumbs the mystery down by tackling only one piece of the puzzle at a time and mostly resolving it before introducing another lead resulting in a structure thats rather linear and not particularly stimulating to the viewers brain cells regardless i am looking forward to the second season if it improves on this one aspect the show may become something really great,POSITIVE

Even better for the pathos generated for the lead characters- you like them, pity them, envy them at times, all of which make this a very watchable programme.

More of a comedy show than a murder mystery, I only remember laughing out loud especially at Steve Martin's and Amy Ryan's love story plot which was soooo funnys...can't believe Steve Martin is still funny I loved him since I was a kid watching Pink Panther so I'm glad to find that I still love his comedy even as an adult! The acting otherwise in the series is very questionable, feels like we're watching a Nickelodeon show, but since the show is lighthearted I feel like perhaps that was intentional to have bad performance like Selina Gomez's acting looks like she is still acting in Wizard of Waverly and that can also be said about other actors in the series as they all were terrible as a whole which could also be down to the implausible plot which made their acting even less convincing! However, all of the horrible acting and even the plots with so many holes were saved by the genius comedy that has been written into and laced throughout the series!

The secondary cast was mostly great as well. Some memorable scenes on some great episodes... Martin Short had me laughing out loud regularly with his shenanigans and outbursts.

The only things i didn't really love, and the reason why my rating isn't higher are a couple of outlandish cameo inclusions and a very monotone, ultra bland Selena Gomez.

Three strangers share an obsession with true crime and suddenly find themselves wrapped up in one.

When I saw the trailer and saw Steve Martin and Martin short are doing a tv series thought this would be good and it was brilliant.

The first series episode one I thought I'm not sure about this, but it does get better you just have to persevere with it every episode gets better and better.

It's cheesy, silly but it works very well.

It is a very different American comedy with a great cast of celebrities as of Selena Gomez, Meryl Streep, Steve Martin, Martin short and Paul Rudd with other famous celebrities along side.

844,844,8.0,7 November 2021,"We've been told a story, happens in one of the never expected places in the city, the Arconia, an upper-class residency that only has had a bunch of wealthy, -unsurprisingly, and mostly- old, boring residents, that know nearly anything about each others' lives. Which is a perfect start point for an unusual friendship to be formed: two wealthy (at least they used to be), old white men in their 70's (actually, one of them is in their early 60's) and a pretty, loner girl in her late 20's.

Along with the 'mostly' believable storytelling, some aspects occasionally get in the way of the series after a few episodes; making it hard for me to look at the story as serious or applicable to real-life, and returns these justified expectations that formed in the first few episodes upside down.

Over-caricatured characters that stretch boundaries of their characteristics even more, with every encounter they make with our trio, is not being helpful to this -out of the blue- murder mystery to be more believable or more genuine. It does not make the series worse but doesn't add up much to the tone they were trying to give. Twists, turns, and surprises are the main elements and the touchstones of murder mysteries, but I'd like them to be well-placed to the story, that doesn't show up just because the 'writers' wanted them to be out, but more out of from a natural track. There were a lot of twists in the show, and most of them were not even the subject of being believable or not, no. They could've been seen as believable all day long, that was not the real problem with twists. They were believable, quite applicable most of the time, but the incidents which make these twists occur usually made me question the analytical and deductive skills of our main characters. (Going onto pieces of evidence to discover new leads every 3 episodes just to be in shock and go into a whole new direction was on the edge, and was hardly acceptable for my taste.)

And I know that a good twist -actually any twist- is hard to write. And the watchers, basically don't want any murder mystery to be solved with the first lead the detective, police, or a solver got his/her hand to. So, still a good job on the writers' part to make this story more intriguing and worth watching overall. It was a fun watch. 6/10.","August 31, 2021 (United States)",weve been told a story happens in one of the never expected places in the city the arconia an upperclass residency that only has had a bunch of wealthy unsurprisingly and mostly old boring residents that know nearly anything about each others lives which is a perfect start point for an unusual friendship to be formed two wealthy at least they used to be old white men in their s actually one of them is in their early s and a pretty loner girl in her late s along with the mostly believable storytelling some aspects occasionally get in the way of the series after a few episodes making it hard for me to look at the story as serious or applicable to reallife and returns these justified expectations that formed in the first few episodes upside down overcaricatured characters that stretch boundaries of their characteristics even more with every encounter they make with our trio is not being helpful to this out of the blue murder mystery to be more believable or more genuine it does not make the series worse but doesnt add up much to the tone they were trying to give twists turns and surprises are the main elements and the touchstones of murder mysteries but id like them to be wellplaced to the story that doesnt show up just because the writers wanted them to be out but more out of from a natural track there were a lot of twists in the show and most of them were not even the subject of being believable or not no they couldve been seen as believable all day long that was not the real problem with twists they were believable quite applicable most of the time but the incidents which make these twists occur usually made me question the analytical and deductive skills of our main characters going onto pieces of evidence to discover new leads every episodes just to be in shock and go into a whole new direction was on the edge and was hardly acceptable for my taste and i know that a good twist actually any twist is hard to write and the watchers basically dont want any murder mystery to be solved with the first lead the detective police or a solver got hisher hand to so still a good job on the writers part to make this story more intriguing and worth watching overall it was a fun watch,POSITIVE
845,845,7.0,5 October 2023,"Selena Gomez is a magical elf. She has managed to bring the two old geezers back to life in the best thing they ever did (but I still like Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid)

I loved the musical. It tied into the story in a literary yet silly way. At some points (like the white room) it was even genius.

Season One was clunky and I hated the frozen cat and poisoned dog part. They just couldn't give up cat abuse in Season Two with the allergy thing. Which was the low point of the otherwise much better season where they were more accustomed to their characters.

Season Three was a Tour de Force of buttkickingness!!!

Martin Short's efforts also did not go unnoticed.

***** 8/31/24 update....

I forgot to mention the baby elephant abuse in season 3. I did not like that boyfriend. The magical elf deserved better. Moving on...

I was pleased with the season 4 premiere, even though I don't like Once Upon A Time In The West. I don't have a huge amount of respect for the Western genre, but still there are a few I like. Once Upon A Time In The West is not one of the one's I like. It is pretentious and unfulfilling.

I'm tired of this habit of using an actor or actress for an audience, obviously she was used as a hook for younger audiences. There are really talented actors and actresses on the market. Aubrey for example would have been a good choice.

Apart from Selena Gomez's terrible acting, I almost enjoyed the show but to be honest I quit two times to continue again because I wanted to know the end.

I loved the characters and I thought the casting was excellent - I had never heard of Selena Gomez but I loved her in this.

It is very light going with a scattering of jokes and mild drama.

There is the odd speciality episode like the one without any spoken dialogue.

Other reviewers have stated that, although alright, this is not as great as people make out.

Technically they are absolutely right - it isn't ground shattering stuff.

But as a fan of the likes of ""Monk"", ""Jonathan Creek"", ""Rizzoli & Isles"" it feels like there has not been anything new in the same vein for quite a while.

This is good, honest, light, sleuthy fun and the smile on my face as I watched every episode justifies my 9 star rating alone.

Love the view, the plot is interesting enough to get me hooked. The directing is not so much though. The story jumps around a lot and the pace is quite slow. It does give you a bit of clue along the way but not enough to make any educated guess. So it's a mystery, frankly because they keep it that way, not because it's that hard to crack.

About the cast, im so in love with the dynamic duo ""Brazzo"" and the passionate stage-director. They are fun, classy, and yet chatoic and problematic just like the city itself. The only ""off"" thing for me is Gomez's acting. I know she's going for the ""tough"" and snarky, and not-that-emotional character but it came out plain, stiff, and very confusing to watch.

This time around, the victim is Ben, a Broadway neophyte who apparently dies during his opening night performance--but doesn't--only to perish, rather horribly, later on.

Look for a bunch of new faces, the usual amount of funny one-liners and razor-sharp repartee, and, naturally, an assortment of carefully placed clues--some of them red herrings, others legit.

866,866,6.0,22 July 2022,"I'm only half way through the first season but I am really shocked by how well Short, Martin and Gomez work together. Usually the boomer/millennial discourse jokes never land well but this series managed to create such a refreshing dynamic between the three leads.

Martin Short plays Oliver, an eccentric theatre director/writer who hasn't been able to catch a break after many failed projects, while Steve Martin plays a former D-list actor called Charles who can't seem to let go of the past. Selena Gomez then rounds off the trio as a much younger guest of her Aunts' in the building that Oliver and Charles live in. All three characters share a passion for a Whodunit-style murder mystery podcast, hosted by Tina Fey, before starting their own podcast following a shocking death in the building. Even though they're working together it's obvious that the three leads all have separate agenda's associated with solving the mystery and creating the podcast.

Short and Martin are particularly engaging in this series as the trio interview the building's tenants to try and find the murderer. Gomez does seem a bit flat in her acting style initially but I just choose to attribute that to the characterisation of Mabel. I found that once I got over that mental-block I really started to enjoy her character, and I cannot emphasise enough how surprised I was to see Short, Martin and Gomez have such good chemistry. All of the characters seem to have a great backstory and many secrets that come to head as the show progresses.

There's definitely some good laughs in here too and I was delighted to see a fan favourite from the office Amy Ryan show up in the last few episodes I watched!

872,872,9.0,19 February 2022,"Not going to play it down and be cool in my review this was absolute perfection in my opinion. I LOVED IT!

If like me, you have a penchant for true crime podcasts or the genre in general, this show nails the current love and popularity (and in some cases down-right obsession) the modern world has for theses stories. Mix that with the true legendary Hollywood and comedy talent of Steve Martin and Martin Short, and then add a splash of the gorgeous, and I'll confess truly delightful Selena Gomez, and you've nailed it.

Yes, at first I was concerned that Steve Martin and Martin Short might be a negative aspect as I haven't really seen them in much since their hey day movies of the 80's and 90's, but I was completely wrong. They both gave, for me, such personable and likeable portrayals of their characters. They were funny, weird, campy and vulnerable in all the right places. I liked Selena Gomez too and was fascinated by her super deep sexy voice. They all have great chemistry together and couple that with a lovely set location and it really worked me for.

I liked the format used with narration overlay by the characters in the style of true podcasting shows and add some quirky music and you've got a nice authentic feel to the episodes.

Story arc was good and well mapped and supporting characters and characters side stories gave it some real heart.

The cast is great. Steve Martin, Martin Short and Nathan Lane all shine, and the supporting cast all bring something fun to the table. The only ones that stand out in a negative way would be Selena Gomez - who just cant hold up against her peers in such a key role - and Detective Williams, who came off as flat.

905,905,10.0,8 June 2023,"Let's face it, the murder mysteries premise is a cover for comedy. With Martin and Short why waste your time.

Too bad Selena is then left to be the 'straightman'.

I'm glad a season is not 15 episodes because murder mysteries do require a lot of characters to produce a lot of red herrings. And that would have to be really dragging the plot out.

To spice up season 2, many returns and connections was made to season 1. That is reasonable but it also seems to just to pad and fill. The building setting restrictions came into used a bit. But for sure it need to branch out of the clausophobia.

924,924,1.0,18 November 2023,"""Only Murders in the Building"" swiftly captures attention with its mix of comedic detective thrills. The show's play between mystery and humor hooked me from the start and kept me engaged throughout. Initially drawn in by the first season's opening episode, I found myself not compelled to return to the series after the pilot. This could be because of the low emotional connect.

Although the notable strength of this series lies in its pacing, ensuring there are no dull moments. However, this brisk rhythm sometimes hinders the development of emotional connections with the characters as discussed earlier. There was an attempt in the latest season to address this shortfall but it slightly altered the thrill factor, affecting the gradual buildup that some viewers appreciated less, but it didn't affect me. I found it good enough.

The writers faced with a challenge: striking a balance between emotional resonance and a fast-paced narrative. Finding this in a balance is tricky. Ultimately, the series leans more towards the thrilling detective elements, delivering a well-wrapped mystery bundle.

""Only Murders in the Building"" excels as a multifaceted production, blending thriller, comedy, detective work, and drama. Its broad appeal resonates across various audiences, marking it as a must-watch. I just want more of it. Keep it going.

Before you label me whatever you will, I actually have called people out on white male privilege more than you think, but when it makes sense. Doing so when it does not weakens its meaning and impact. Have these two old white guys said or done anything dated or offensive in this show so far? No! It might make sense if one of them was more like Archie Bunker, but obviously Short or Martin could not pull that off. It also doesn't make sense regarding race, unless you invent a problem of people of color being targeted more often for home invasion in such a neighborhood. It may actually be the opposite.

In fact I signed up for hulu specifically to watch it as it was well publicized, anticipating something really good and funny. The monotone gravely (or is it nasal voice) of Selena Gomez with her flat, expressionless face (was that supposed to be funny?) and her character to me add nothing to the series. I don't find her the least bit interesting or amusing. (I guess one should give her credit for at least having lips that moved.). I quite enjoyed the first week's episodes. They were somewhat amusing and Martin Short occasionally said something that made me laugh out loud, but by the second group of episodes it just got both really complicated and really boring at the same time. I think when the Selena Gomez's mother starts speaking and going on about her daughter..(won't give any further details of the 'plot' except to say it was in New Jersey or was it Long island?) ...it just got unbearably boring and lost me. Given that Only Murders in the Buildling seems to have gotten ""rave reviews"" from both critics and viewers to me it is actually a bit of an Emperor has no Clothes situation. I don't see it deserving 5 stars. It certainly is being well promoted, yet it seems highly over-rated. Perhaps this is occurring because audiences love the actors so much and are expecting great things from them, so they dub it 'great' and are in a sense blinded by their expectations. It's working really hard to be funny and clever...but for me really just petered out and became more like an amateur high school creative play writing attempt.

For black humour, watch 'Curb Your Enthusiasm'. For murder mystery, stylish digitally-enhanced direction and deep characterization, watch 'The White Lotus'. You get the idea. Steve, Martin and Selena got their loose money together and decided to make a tribute to their favourite shows of the past ten years.

It didn't come off, but that didn't stop this vanity project getting a third season. I'll check it out to see if it improved - in fact, OMITB could hardly get worse. Selena Gomez not only can't act, she barely registers as an extra.

999,999,3.0,31 January 2024,"Did you ever experience paying a King's ransom to watch a live theatre performance only to eventually and disappointingly walk out of the theatre saying WTF? Well maybe the $9.95 per month Disney charges to watch Only Murders in the Building isn't a King's ransom, but I do value the 30 plus hours Mrs. Shullivan and I invested in watching the first three seasons and yes, we were disappointed.

I have always enjoyed both Steve Martin and Martin Short's physical comedy but their banter back and forth each and every episode with their moderator and third amigo Selena Gomez who plays Mabel Mora, the interior designer and artist, was nothing more than boring banter. Steve Martin plays. Charles-Haden Savage an unemployed TV star from a long forgotten crime series as the 1990's TV Detective Brazzos. Martin Short plays the most unluckiest stage director Oliver Putnam, and unlike having the Midas touch it seems any play Oliver creates falls flatter than actress Cara Delevingne's chest.

Mrs. Shullivan and myself watched the first couple of episodes and we realize that you have to invest some time in the first few episodes of any new TV series before you can actually assess whether or not, a TV series is both entertaining and intriguing. Unfortunately we continued watching each and every episode of the first three (3) seasons and the banter between the three (3) actors just continued to get more meaningless as did the storylines.

There are quite a few cameo appearances by first rate film and/or stage actors such as Nathan Lane, Amy Ryan, Paul Rudd, Tina Fey, Michael Rapaport, and even Meryl Streep, but even with all that talent and the mantra ""the show must go on"" , I asked Mrs. Shullivan ""how much more of this boring series do you want to endure?""

The series has a considerable amount of time on the actual stage of New York City's iconic 3,400-seat United Palace Theater which is another failed attempt of trying to convince us the audience we are watching a live stage performance for only $9.95 a month, rather than the average $400 ticket price for a front row Broadway experience. Actress Noma Dumezweni plays stage critic Maxine Spear and if her opinion counts, she's not a fan of stage director Oliver Putnam's plays, and unfortunately neither are Mrs. Shullivan and I.

But as the late great P. T. Barnum always said ""There's a sucker born every minute"" Welcome to the club.

In fact, is misses pretty badly. The first couple episodes were cute, lively, and fun. It really felt like the characters were going to develop, but they just stay stuck in themselves episode after episode. After Ep 5, I had to pull the plug. As is the case with so many stories that take place in New York, the characters are anxious, mealy-mouthed, loud, and overly loquacious. We already did that shtick to death in the 70's with Woody Allen, so why are we revisiting that shtick now? Martin and Short need to reduce their spoken lines by about 50% and their characters would improve markedly. That Mrs. Maesel show suffers from this very same problem...way too many spoken lines to the point of boredom. A person just gets tired of listening after a while.

1058,1058,3.0,31 December 2021,"... it's not entirely her fault. It's clear she was badly miscast, presumably to help fulfill some ethnic-diversity requirement, and she sounds as if she was poorly dubbed. Her lifeless, beady-eyed expression never changes.

The two male leads are considerably more fun to watch. But Martin Short's aging-showbiz-loser character -- animated, garrulous, bubbly, and soft -- comes off as gay (that's what he would be in real life), so it's weird to see him visiting his adult son, and even weirder that the son is another example of nonwhite casting. Implausible.

Steve Martin's character makes more sense, but he's also the series' creator, and so it's probably his fault that, from the start, the story tends to drag. Even, for example, in the first episode -- an episode that really ought to hook us -- the camera lingers on him as he delivers a tedious, uninterrupted monologue about his past; Gomez is given one too, equally tedious; and... Well, put it this way: When Larry David, in the latest season of his own series, gets bored and impatient with what someone is saying, he begins humming the music that's played at the Academy Awards when an Oscar recipient's speech drones on too long. He even whips out his cell phone and plays it on that. All too often I had the same reaction, hearing Gomez and Martin.

1064,1064,1.0,12 August 2023,"A pretty awful vanity project for Steve Martin and Martin Short.

I watched the whole of the first season (on Disney+ in the UK) and that was as much as I wanted to see. My biggest problem with the first season is that Oliver Putnam, played by Martin Short, is such an appalling human being with absolutely no redeeming qualities. Clearly, much of this is down to bad writing. But Martin Short and his directors also need some of the ""credit"" for not toning down what was written. And I just couldn't believe that Oliver Putnam had ever been a functioning director of musical theatre -- I just couldn't suspend my disbelief.

And as a male who is closer to Steve Martin's age than Selena Gomez's, I found the sexual relationship between his character and Amy Ryan's character to be rather vomit inducing. And another instance of my not being able to suspend my disbelief.

All in all, this seems a rather muddled production. It should really hang on the chemistry between the three ""investigators"", but there is little actual chemistry there.

1073,1073,5.0,28 June 2022,"How is this a ""Good, ""Clean"" series when practically every character drops a million F-Bombs?! I swear too, though as I've gotten older (56), I've really cut back cuz I've realized it's just not an attractive trait to have especially in the office or out in public. Sorry but that's my top complaint about this series. Who are they trying to target with that kinda language anyways?

When I asked my 86yo mom if she liked this series, she didn't like the swearing and said it was too boring as well. Too many times ""hell"" should've been said instead of F-bombs or ""$h1t""... the sentences didn't make sense with how they were said. This just isn't a funny LOL kind of series like it was being hyped up as. A few sorta funny moments in episodes 1&2 does not make up for the boring, tired writing that's being played out. I grew up on Steve Martin records (King Tut rules!), movies & SNL even got a ""I'm a wild & crazy gal"" t-shirt with the bunny ears and arrow going thru it from my sister when I was 10 & wore it proudly! Loved most of his movies and liked some of Martin Shorts too (many were too over-the-top for my taste like ""Clifford"") but I had much higher expectations from them both though. Sad to say, I'm not actually too surprised at how lame much of this is. I wanted to like Selena Gomez but like others have commented, her monotone voice and acting like she's so bored during her scenes has been a huge turnoff. I guess that's how they wanted her character to sound & act? All 3 are Executive Producers so if she wanted to not act bored, she could've said or done something about it.

1075,1075,3.0,17 December 2022,"I can't quite get attached to this. Having grown up on Sherlock Holmes, Hercule Poirot and Murder She Wrote, I wanted a murder mystery that had some semblance to these shows. And I was hoping OMITB would live up to that. Initially, I did have my doubts - how could two comic actors provide the edge needed for such genre? I'm thinking how effective Benedict Cumberbatch was in his take on Holmes.

Well, doubts are proven true. OMITB feels more like a vehicle for Martin and Short, built with trademark comedic elements peculiar to both of them, in which the murder mystery feels more like a support act rather than the framework on which the show ought to be built upon. There's also too much introspection on the part of characters, some of which doesn't add anything substantive to the plot. And that part with Sting? What is that? How was his character even necessary to the plot? It just gets mired in silliness. I'm surprised the legend from The Police was even willing to take part in such a portrayal. He certainly doesn't need the paycheque.

The acting's generally ok, you get what you've always expected from Martin, Short, and Nathan Lane. On that, even Sting pulls his weight through, despite the limitation on his self portrayal. For a singer who hasn't acted much after his Dune days, his timing remains spot on. On the other hand, Selena Gomez looks and feels lame, it's like she could only come up with a single expression delivered in a monotone, in each episode.

1092,1092,7.34,15 September 2024,"In Only Murders in the Building Season 1, Episode 6, I noticed a portrayal that seems to touch on a recurring theme in some U. S. productions: Turks being depicted in a negative light, particularly in relation to Greeks. I find it curious, as historically, after the events of the early 20th century, the Turkish and Greek nations have maintained a relatively peaceful relationship. Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder of modern Turkey, is even known to have shown great respect towards Greece, famously refusing to step on a Greek flag.

Today, Turkish and Greek cultures are incredibly similar, and many people from both nations regard each other as friends. So, it makes me wonder why certain narratives continue to portray conflict between them. It feels like these portrayals might be missing the nuanced relationship these two nations share.

Perhaps it's worth considering the broader impact of such portrayals in popular media, especially when it comes to fostering understanding and peace between nations. It's always important to question the motives behind recurring stereotypes and their influence on public perception.","August 31, 2021 (United States)",in only murders in the building season episode i noticed a portrayal that seems to touch on a recurring theme in some u s productions turks being depicted in a negative light particularly in relation to greeks i find it curious as historically after the events of the early th century the turkish and greek nations have maintained a relatively peaceful relationship mustafa kemal atatürk the founder of modern turkey is even known to have shown great respect towards greece famously refusing to step on a greek flag today turkish and greek cultures are incredibly similar and many people from both nations regard each other as friends so it makes me wonder why certain narratives continue to portray conflict between them it feels like these portrayals might be missing the nuanced relationship these two nations share perhaps its worth considering the broader impact of such portrayals in popular media especially when it comes to fostering understanding and peace between nations its always important to question the motives behind recurring stereotypes and their influence on public perception,POSITIVE

1095,1095,7.34,14 September 2023,"""Only Murders In the Building"" Season 3 delves into intriguing mysteries yet again, but this time, not without some notable shortcomings.

One aspect that marred the viewing experience was the portrayal of interactions with the Deaf character, Theo. It's evident that the show failed to conduct thorough research into how Deaf individuals converse. The countless instances of Mable turning her back to Theo, expecting him to understand her without clear lip movements, were a cringe-worthy oversight. Effective communication with Deaf individuals relies on exaggerated lip movements, which was notably absent here.

Furthermore, the performance of the character Mable left much to be desired. Whether it's due to apparent Botox or plastic surgery work, her lack of facial expressions became a significant distraction. Scenes involving her felt monotonous and lacked the emotional depth needed to fully engage the audience.

However, the saving grace of the season lies in the performances of Charles and Oliver. Their chemistry and charisma shine through, elevating the show. If not for the offensive representation of the Deaf community and Mable's limited facial expressions, this season had the potential to be a perfect 10. Instead, it stands at a middling 5 stars, held back by its missteps in these critical areas.","August 31, 2021 (United States)",only murders in the building season delves into intriguing mysteries yet again but this time not without some notable shortcomings one aspect that marred the viewing experience was the portrayal of interactions with the deaf character theo its evident that the show failed to conduct thorough research into how deaf individuals converse the countless instances of mable turning her back to theo expecting him to understand her without clear lip movements were a cringeworthy oversight effective communication with deaf individuals relies on exaggerated lip movements which was notably absent here furthermore the performance of the character mable left much to be desired whether its due to apparent botox or plastic surgery work her lack of facial expressions became a significant distraction scenes involving her felt monotonous and lacked the emotional depth needed to fully engage the audience however the saving grace of the season lies in the performances of charles and oliver their chemistry and charisma shine through elevating the show if not for the offensive representation of the deaf community and mables limited facial expressions this season had the potential to be a perfect instead it stands at a middling stars held back by its missteps in these critical areas,NEGATIVE

1106,1106,7.34,3 January 2024,"This series of 30-minute episodes is a HULU original. It just completed its 3rd season in 2023, there are 40 episodes in all. We had not watched any of it because we are not subscribed.

Now, as 2024 begins, the ABC network, which we catch via antenna in our attic, has started to broadcast episodes, starting with season 1, episode 1. The first night they broadcast the first 3 episodes, with commercials, over a 2-hour time slot. Same a week later, then also the next week. Now the last night, January 23rd, is the single, last episode.

The show is from a Steve Martin idea, here he plays one of the three main characters, actor Charles-Haden Savage and in the 1990s played a character, a New York detective, called Brazzos. What a curious name, most likely a result of Martin's sense of humor. Back in 1945 he was born in Waco, Texas, a city on the Brazos river, and his character Brazzos is most likely an homage' to his birthplace.

The second main character is another 70-something, Martin Short as stage director Oliver Putnam, who seems to have fallen on hard financial times and now is in danger of losing his prime Manhattan apartment. Not a big fan of the actor, his variety of humor rarely connects with our sensibilities.

The third main character is 30-ish Selena Gomez as Mabel Mora. So far it isn't very clear what her job is but she seems to be renovating her aunt's apartment. She is a good addition to the three-person team who were all mutual strangers at first.

Against expectations the three of them develop an interesting and entertaining Chemistry right away. Motivated by a podcast they all admire, they decide to solve murders, but only the ones that take place in their building.

It is interesting, being a TV broadcast, they bleep out all profanity and it demonstrates that profanity is ABSOLUTELY UNNECESSARY if you have a good story.

So, as with most crime entertainment shows, as things develop the audience is led to suspect a range of different characters as the murderer, at the same time led to not believe certain characters could be. And, some twists at the end are designed to surprise.
