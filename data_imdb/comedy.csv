0,6.0,7 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",and i wish i could rate them separately the first act of the film is a fast paced tale of innocence cast into a world of debauchery its a beautifully shot fantastic tale showing the dramatized excesses of show business and the people who would do anything to gain entry into that world the second act was a somewhat more tame and methodical tale of the innerworkings of s film production with the standout scene being the hello college scene out of place however was the whole tangent around the party leading up to the snake while decidedly funny i didnt like the pacing very much the final act was a tricky one and probably could have been minutes shorter despite absolutely loving tobys character the little sidequest they go on pushed to already exaggerated babylonian theme to to a point of absurdity its obvious that some sort of narrative bridge was needed to set up the final scene but i felt it was overdone pitts character arc wasnt bad but it lost a lot of steam and i honestly wouldnt have noticed if his character had only been mentioned in the precredits sequence if there is one strong point throughout the entire film its the use of the dueling saxophone score and quick cuts to drive home the manic energy present throughout the film without that score many of the slapstickheavy scenes would have felt tiresome in an already very lengthy movie i have a hard time recommending this film to any but the most serious of film nuts but its impossible to deny that the bones of a great story are here they just needed to leave some of the fat on the cutting room floor,NEGATIVE,Comedy
1,6.0,7 February 2024,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",so i just finished watching babylon i really liked it but i hated it i was bored but i was entertained it was an emotional rollercoaster and it was plain like the great salt lake it was clear but it was confusing it was happy and it was sad omg what a mess not necessarily and not always a bad mess just a mess theres a lot going on in this movie and throughout this complicated web of moving pictures and sounds comes through a story i think but im not sure the whole movie rests on a feeble script and thats not good but theres some decent acting halfdecent cinematography kudos to the crew for managing to navigate through in tight closed quarters with hundreds of naked and clantily clothed people around and some absolutely fantastic music in fact i rated this movie stars but added for the score its mesmerizing just do me a favour and be patient through the entire credits at the very end youll hear justin hurowitzs new york big budget big actors huuuge production but really not much to write home about did i waste hours of my life not really yes for sure confusing,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2,8.0,4 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",whether it be orgies showcasing various bodily fluids plot threads or the runtime of the film damien chazelle is fully unrestrained in his latest film la la land and whiplash are some of my favorite films and im a big fan of chazelles directorial style he shows flashes of that brilliance often throughout babylon but does indulge in his most extreme tendencies as well in this modern hollywood epic there is a lot i liked here the opening sequence is a sight to behold and had me mesmerized with its vibrant energy the film chugs along at a good pace for the next two hours to the point i really didnt feel the runtime for most of it its the last hour or so where chazelle loses the story a bit there were several instances where i thought the film was over but another scene would pop up next the runtime really feels unnecessary and theres honestly whole plot lines that could be cut out that wouldnt affect the film justin hurwitz has composed another terrific score with some nice hints of la la land and the photography costumes and production design are all stellar outside of some shoddy editing especially a bizarre movie montage at the end that really did not gel the technical aspects of the film are quite an achievement chazelle really needed someone to tell him no with this film some better editing combined with some selfrestraint and this would be much closer to the epic masterpiece status hes clearly aiming for as it stands its a pretty entertaining tale of excess and fame in early years of hollywood,POSITIVE,Comedy
3,8.0,29 December 2022,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",after an interesting opening scene about our main character manny diego calva trying to get an elephant up to a party in belair babylon floors the gas pedal and barely comes up for air for the rest of the run time i wanted to credit damien chazelle and his team for providing a unique experience in regards to pacing setting and tone the expression fever dream is overused but babylon is captured in such a chaotic and constantly shifting way that kept me enraptured the movie looks fantastic and even if you dont have an interest in this period of cinema i dont doubt that babylon will still pull you in the costuming and sets are dynamic and show how disorganized and tumultuous early hollywood was i was hooked from the getgo and for all the movies flaws its presentation is vibrant and fastmoving to keep help you entertained while babylon is distinctive with its look and pacing when it comes to the characters things are a little more familiar conrad and laroy are loosely based on a couple of people from that era but the lessons the movie wants to teach us about hollywood chewing up and spitting out talent are pretty routine i think babylon is effective at getting those across but i was a little let down that the movie starts so bombastically and then quietly tip toes into conventionality by the end some characters are meant to be less distinctive manny is the audience avatar for example but while i wish they were a little more fresh i did want to follow them throughout the length of the movie damien chazelle has enough of a name now that he could probably get any actoractress he wanted in his cast he still attracted some big and interesting names for babylon i think every member of the main cast did a fantastic job and its a credit to them and chazelle for getting the most out of his performers brad pitts the biggest name and i really enjoyed the work he put in as jack conrad hes appropriately funny in conrads lush and overthetop behaviour but he garners some genuine sympathy for him when the world turns against him pitt could have played it so big that he came off as an entitled prick but theres some warmth and passion to conrad and pitt gets that across ive always liked margot robbie and shes on point here as nellie she throws herself into it completely theres a surprising amount of physicality and nuance in nellies whirlwind behaviour much like pitt shes really funny when she is given the opportunity to be despite the pretty telegraphed arc for her character you understand why manny cant resist nellie even when its crystal clear shes bad news wrapped in pretty packaging i would hope that pitt and robbie both get awards consideration for their work here diego represents the audience hes witnessing all the craziness and has to go along with it hes a pretty blank slate but theres enough from diego that his character is distinct and you understand his motivations i want to credit li jun li and jovan adepo as lady fay zhu and sidney palmer respectively their characters are written with a heavy hand but both are sympathetic and have their respective moments the oddest casting is tobey maguire as threatening mobster james mckay but maguires surprisingly good at being a creepy underworld figure getting to the negatives babylon is a movie that indulges in the exact same vices that its lambasting as a film babylons determined to show all excess and hedonism of the era in all its glory i appreciated some of this but there are moments where the movie gets pretty gross theres an early scene involving a elephant that is going to shock people and while i get what chazelle and his team are trying to show was it really necessary id argue not babylons lengthy run time is also going to drive some people away but it also has an affect on how the story twists and turns characters that started out with more depth gradually turn more generic nellie specifically comes to mind and you could have easily trimmed some of the fat off this movie the total length of babylon feels a little selfindulgent and while the previously mentioned frenetic pace keeps you guessing it saps some of the endings impact i got what the movie was trying to say with its wrapup but i cant deny i was bouncing in my seat in anticipation of getting to leave just like the lavish and insane partying that babylon presents you have to choose to take the hit of whatever your poison of choice is and dive in headfirst or not to indulge and slip out the back babylon is going to be an incredibly polarizing film and while i enjoyed large parts of this movie there were also many scenes that fell flat for me id grade babylon somewhere between a and an but im rounding up because there are moments where babylon has some real cinematic magic im not comfortable wholesale recommending babylon if youre interested in a wolf of wall street style comedy about the excess of hollywood in the s that gets pretty dark check it out,NEGATIVE,Comedy
4,7.0,26 December 2022,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",babylon is a long messy repulsive and magnetic spectacle unfortunately despite the great performances and set pieces it doesnt live up to chazelles previous work the movie wants to bring you down into the waste yard that is hollywood then pull you out to see the beauty that grows out of the trash the problem is the movie spends so much time in the mud and goes so deep into it that by the time it tries to pull you out at the end its too late on the upside the cast are great and almost completely carry the movie especially margot robbies enthralling performance as nellie and as with chazelles previous work the set pieces are well executed and some characters are memorable however these positives could not completely overcome the movies fundamental flaws which are going too far with trying to revolt the audience to the point of childishness not spending enough time with the characters or important scenes despite its decadent runtime and the ending coming off as completely pretentious in the context of how practicalcynical everything leading up to it was in the end babylon does serve its purpose as an entertaining spectacle but like the hollywood it critiques its selfindulgence prevents it from achieving greatness,NEGATIVE,Comedy
5,1.0,26 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",wow i came into this flick without great expectations so maybe thats why i was able to really enjoy this this film was very entertaining to me and thats hard to find in todays film industry of rinse and repeat big picture films and the predictable art house and indie scene which is ironic considering its supposed to be whats different and boundary pushing it was big and loud and at times out of control just like the s film industry the sets are amazing cinematography is stellar the acting is amazing and over the top in the right way and a fitting soundtrack the story is a bit all over but this film is better if you approach it like a film that is supposed to be lived in as opposed to followed i think babylon is going to be a film more celebrated and enjoyed as time goes by and more people find it its the most fun ive had with a newly released film in the past few years film is my favorite hobby and it has been since i was a child ive seen every type of movie and seen them from every era and modern film is the most disappointing to me theres no magic anymore and its just plain boring but this was a nice change of pace its is a movie lovers movie and it will now be in my rotation and i think it will only improve on rewatched because there is so much in this film that you cant catch it all the first time around,POSITIVE,Comedy
6,6.0,1 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",this film felt like it was written and directed by a high school drama class kid with adhd it was exhausting to watch and it was all over the place with too much filler too many unnecessary subplots convoluted scenes and dialogue with horrible editing and scene start and cuts in the hands of better more experienced filmmaker this couldve very easily been so much better and more enjoyable writer and director damien chazelle gave us a hackjob screenplay with overzealous and pointlessly outlandish scenes that are all style with very little substance the all star stellar cast were all amazing especially margot robbie who was the only reason i didnt stop watching mins into this utter disastrous nonsense the critics got this one right its a very generous from me all going to the performances and decent cinematography,NEGATIVE,Comedy
7,8.0,23 December 2022,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",babylon tracks the career of manny torres an aspiring filmmaker from mexico who crosses paths with fellow aspiring starlet nelly laroy at a bacchanalian party one night in s los angeles the film also follows several other characters at the same party including movie star jack conrad cabaret performer fay zhu tabloid journalist elinor st john and musician sidney palmer as each rise and fall in their respective careers spanning the end of silent films and the beginning of sound productions each of the characters cross paths throughout as they navigate the shifting business of hollywood this largescale epic from damien chazelle is in a word ambitious both in scope and mere technicality it opens with an utterly ravishing debaucherous party sequence that captures the maddening spirit of roaring twenties hollywood setting a visual bar that is fairly high while there are a number of fantastic sequences throughout the film this key party sequence where each of the characters are introducedfirst intervene is without a doubt the highlight of the film while its characters are fictional the screenplay blends them in with passing names of reallife historical hollywood figures as well as thinlyveiled references to others firstly it almost goes without saying that babylon is gorgeously photographed the performances are also uniformly solid diego calva is a likable presence as the centerpiece character while margot robbies portrayal of the brash and troubled jersey girl flying by the seat of her pants is comical and poignant by turns brad pitt fittingly plays the drunken but goodhearted movie star and jean smart is also a welcome presence as the curt and astute gossip columnist ostensibly based on louella parsons or a writer of her ilk the film is consciously over the top at many points capturing the madcap spirit of something the late ken russell would have directed its first three quarters are particularly outstanding and demonstrate the realities and technicalities of how the transition from silent films to motion picture talkies posed legitimate careeraltering or more often careerdestroying challenges for nearly everyone who was part of the business chazelle projects this theme to the audience in one memorable and protracted sequence in which robbies character along with the sound man struggles fails is interrupted and struggles again to perform a simple onepage scene the nuts and bolts of these logistical challenges in a thenfledgling industry are perhaps the most intriguing components of the story highlighting just how vastly different and more arduous the process was of making a sound picture for the actors and filmmakers accustomed to the established ways by the time it reaches its final act however the viewer does get the sense that the project is beginning to implode under its own weight to some degree the focus on certain characters ebbs and flows and the film begins to lose some steam it is revived somewhat by an insane sequence in which torres and another crew member of his film studio in an attempt to save laroy from reckless gambling decisions cross paths with an eccentric crime boss played by tobey maguire and journey into a subterranean gathering place for the citys debaucherous denizens who have literally gone underground following the more reserved moral code of the s the garish and ghoulish sequence feels like a tour of dantes inferno probably quite intentionally and is almost more madcap than the opening party sequence the film grinds to a somewhat abrupt halt as each of the characters lives and careers face further significant devastation in the last thirty minutes and the sense of tragedy that one might expect to feel is strangely absent perhaps because these characters are in and of themselves larger than life even cartoonish at times still i felt that there was an emotional core missing as their stories are resolved the film ends on a profoundly cynical note showing hollywood as a place that metaphorically devours its own only to be constantly replenished by the unending stream of those who make pilgrimage there seeking to etch their mark in the tapestry of cinema the observation is astute and the implications are splashed across the screen in a centuryspanning montage of snippets from the earliest films to contemporary ones all in all babylon has many strong points mainly its visuals sturdy performances and focus on the industrial realities of early filmmaking that most stcentury viewers would take for granted it eventually grows a bit long in the tooth into its third hour and loses some tenacity but not enough so that the film entirely collapses in on itself though it comes close if nothing else it earns its keep as an ambitious and scabrous love and hate letter to cinema,POSITIVE,Comedy
8,6.0,15 April 2024,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",an american epic historical blackcomedy drama a story about the rise and fall of hollywood careers during the transition from silent films to sound films in the late s the burgeoning era of the american film industry was no less prurient harsh or nasty on its artistes than modernday tinseltown which is why the films theme is interesting people who are subject to rapid change and exposed to excess struggle to curb their personal indulgences and suffer for their art in the hope of big success the tone is provocative and tragicomic but in overstating excess in the way it does too many character stories dont lead anywhere lavish felliniesque scenes with their sweeping camera shots and highspirit music test ones patience in the longer sequences also it doesnt quite capture the period stage sets props and costumes look overembellished the selfentitled way some characters speak sounds like they belong to the s not the s there is no one to especially care about with only brad pitts jack conrad being relatable all in all it dazzles and shocks to please theres a definite feel of good intention to show the magic of the movies but sometimes the story lacks cohesion,NEGATIVE,Comedy
9,4.0,1 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",so many reviews praise this film for the level of debauchery shown in it or the devotion the actors gave to said debauchery but just because you have the willingness to fill your film with an over excess of sex drugs violence and human bodily fluids doesnt mean you have a good film this movie feels like it goes on forever and has endless character who serve no real purpose to progressing the story at the core there is a decent plot but it falls apart and some of the scenes feel like they were written by a teenage boy imagining what his ideal fantasy would play out like this movie will easily become a cult classic just for how vulgar it is,NEGATIVE,Comedy
10,9.0,24 December 2022,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",incredible performances several amazing scenes but doesnt come together for me probably better after several viewings which would be helpful to take in some more of the intricate symbolism and some more nuance that i definitely missed however this movie nails its unique style as a gruesome fairy tale of sorts sadly i didnt feel damien chazelles usual tension and emotion even in his intense and unique ending im really hoping ill find whatever i missed in my next viewing i really want to love it sorry for this compliment sandwich this is coming straight off the top of my head,POSITIVE,Comedy
11,6.0,4 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",its hollywood the silent movie era is having a party of epic debauchery manny torres diego calva is the mexican fixer servant doing all the dirty jobs jack conrad brad pitt is the big movie star nellie laroy margot robbie is the flamboyant nobody who fakes it until she makes it she makes it and then the silent era ends everybody works to master the new sound era this is not an appealing start i dont know whats happening with every oscar bait movie which insists on an overly broad comedic scene with bodily functions the elephant is completely overboard i wouldnt open with that scene its an indication of whats to come this movie is desperately trying too hard i guess were supposed to root for margot robbie but i dont i find her abrasive and not always appealing she does find her tragic heartbreaks and that helps her character this would work better if it concentrated more on brad pitts character he has some of best heartfelt scenes during his climax manny torres is probably the other main character with a big character arc i like the character but the performance is too stoic i need a different performance from him besides brad pitts character arc i love the general premise of redoing singin in the rain its a great premise that needs a little foreshadowing and less outrageousness it could be a simple modern day revival with admiring fans watching singin in the rain to open this movie damien chazelle is just trying too hard it hits a few false notes and the whole enterprise stumbles it always gets back up with some very compelling scenes for example the first sound shot is fun i dont like how it ends damien keeps pushing the comedy one step too far i do appreciate the overall premise and the ambition of the work,NEGATIVE,Comedy
12,4.0,25 December 2022,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",my main takeaway when i left the theater this evening after watching this film was that it was far too long and had probably one storyline too many to make this movie fly but instead after the first act it drags and drags and drags the funny thing is the best moments of this film are within the first hour the less cohesive and more chaotic the film was the more exciting it felt after that point though the film falls apart the plotlines stray and the film has maybe of the crazy energy that the first third had it attempts to try and regain that energy in the finale but doesnt quite capture what came before it it turns from debauchery to horror and it didnt gel well for me felt like the tone contradicted itself from where it began the acting on the other hand is fantastic robbie and pitt are electric and the way diego calva can emote without saying anything is brilliant i just wished the script and direction from la la land writerdirector damien chazelle was as good as the acting sometimes the film felt like i was watching four films at the same time each of these plotlines could have had their own movies and seeing them all jumbled together here felt self indulgent and exhausting by the end of it only one of the storylines have any sort of ending that makes it feel justified in its telling afterward when the credits start to roll youre just sat there with no feeling for what you just witnessed for a little over three hours overall i only recommend for people who dont mind the three hour runtime but keep in mind that the films plot goes absolutely nowhere and although it might be a fun trip at times it is a rather pointless one talking pictures out of,NEGATIVE,Comedy
13,8.0,23 December 2022,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",i recently read a biography of silent film it girl actress clara bow margot robbie looking more like a grace kelly from a few decades later rather than a bow plays a character highly inspired from her blue collar new jersey upbringing to a father following her to hollywood and making money off her image even opening a restaurant based on one of her famous movies a gambling addiction to an offcolor joke at a hoity toity part these are all inspired by bow and her life the film is great as a love letter to bow warts and all played magnificently by margot robbie and just to the magic film can have on its audience transcending time it visually details the difficult transition had on the film industry with the transition from silent films to talkies showcasing actors producers and musical performers adjusting to it all brad pitt gives a great performance as a douglas fairbanks like silent star edging toward irrelevancy but newcomer diego calva really steals a large part of the movie with his powerful performance great music from justin horiwitz who reunited with his la la landwhiplash director damien chazelle with excellent cinematography and performances however the film was a bit much at time consistently frantic lots of characters melting down and screaming andor stressful with excesses abounding it was a little much at times certain scenes such as an elephant having explosive diarrhea on a man would have been better not seen so graphically solid film,POSITIVE,Comedy
14,6.0,13 March 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",the movie is really vivid at times peculiarly or perhaps deliberately the more vivid the less rich the end result is the glitter and madness of the backstage shines most brightly when they still film the blackandwhite silent pictures and so is the movie pace and coherency its a sharply cut but consistent narrative for roughly the first half of the movie and then is starts leaping years ahead and the narrative loses much of its meaning and focus the last part before the ending brings madness anew but surprisingly a completely different kind as if taken from another story for no particular reason those few last characters add nothing to the fact that they were already mentioned yet the scene goes on and on and then the whole message is unclear from the beginning and the epilogue and from a few dialogues in between it seems as if its an ode to the cinema something grand and timeless and bigger than you and me but most of what happens inside is about greedy and soulcrushing and disposable nature of the whole showbiz where nobodys a victim but everyones trying to get what they want at any cost so its a grand spectacle half of the time and a frenetic misanthropy the other half perhaps still worth watching though,POSITIVE,Comedy
15,8.0,7 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",babylon had some moments that were better than every other movie ive seen this year they just needed to cut it down about minutes its all about hollywood and the beauty of filmmaking and it gets a little too big for its britches in some places leading to some unfortunate selfseriousness the whole thing is apparently a tragic rewrite of singin in the rain and the technical accomplishment on display in this film is astounding the first hour is alltime great truly deeply moving as well as visually astounding the question when walking out of the theater is whether the sublime moments outweigh the unnecessary length its crazy for some random guy to give notes to maybe the most successful yearold director in history but who cares he needs a trusted editor who hell let make some cuts all the pieces of a classic are there but unfortunately the fluff distracts we need like a studio cut for this movie lol,POSITIVE,Comedy
16,7.0,26 December 2022,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",quentin tarantino once said hacks dont go that far there are some filmmakers that have a creative confidence that delivers a film that many people will find repulsive but some will find exhilarating because if its creative audacity yes this film is too long but there is so much talent and so much detail to admire in every frame of this film diego calva has one scene where you feel so sorry for this man you wanna cry for him the moment when brad pitt is kissing a young woman before a perfect sunset and a butterfly lands on a shoulder is the moment that encapsulates exhilarating fun of filmmaking,POSITIVE,Comedy
17,1.0,9 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",babylon is cinematic marvel that damien chazelle is a messy dazzling epic masterpiece that film hasnt yet accepted or had before damien chazelle has called babylon a hate letter to hollywood and a love letter to movies but his messy dazzling epic doesnt support that simplistic idea set in the early days of cinema when talking pictures were a jawdropping phenomenon and hollywood was still being created babylon suggests a deeper reality the film industrys raw selfdestructive narcissistic impulses and its glorious magical results have always been opposite parts of the same whole chazelles ambitions are huge babylon is full of remarkable set pieces with richly drawn characters music dancing love and betrayal the films strengths more than make up for its serious flaws including too many endings and a wrongheaded reliance on singin in the rain as a touchstone but if babylon makes you groan occasionally there are many more times long exhilarating stretches that are mesmerising in one of the films multiple endings which leaps ahead to a major character sits in a cinema tearfully watching singin in the rain that enamouredofmovies scene hasnt been fresh since sullivans travels in not to mention cinema paradiso in and this years empire of light the fact that the scene can be viewed as a homage to all those films doesnt make it less cliched and a montage of other movies through history is a bravura but needless coda at its best chazelles film is a cinematic marvel evidence enough that movies are magical as it sweeps us into the beautiful terrible world we recognise as hollywood even now the cast up and down babylon is amazing and almost eerily in sync with my own tastes actors i deeply love like taylor nichols and ethan suplee show up ohsobriefly as if casting director francine maisler had thumbed through my own mental rolodex and said to herself ah heres another face sonny would like to see this is perhaps another reason i found myself drawn in by babylons excess i just liked spending time with almost everyone up on that big beautiful screen i fell in love with the cast and the story believing babylon to be over thus missing the last few of its minutes this was itself a fitting almost serendipitous way to end the movie audiences come and go they are as ephemeral and everchanging as the names on the marquee the darkened theater filled with flickering light thats eternal everlasting deathless the actors and the audiences alike come and go but the show goes on forever,POSITIVE,Comedy
18,9.0,25 December 2022,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",reality blows we want something more we want a new high or something to chase this movie is built around escapism the same escapism that draws people to watching movies draws people into making movies that same escapism starts to flee when we are no longer entertained we then want something more this movie is built around the never ending chase for more in life only to make us ask if it even matters its fairly existential underneath it all it begs the question of when entertainment becomes evil when we lose site of humans and see them only as objects for our entertainment there is graphic content that people will cling to and badmouth the movie over but if you are someone who loves independent cinema this has the flavor of an independent film with a massive budget im grateful it got made but there is no way this will do well in the box office it has cult classic written all over it years from now,POSITIVE,Comedy
19,6.0,29 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",the film starts on the wheel caps we quickly get to the massive party that the film trailers promised us and its masterfully shot with long takes masterfully paired music and explosive character intros the first discussion between the two main characters funnily reveals the absurdity of the s hollywood but then the movie never recovers to such heights save perhaps for the sunsetchasing sequence and the scary underground party moment amazing bit by tobey maguire the story is weak the characters are poorly developed even the main ones as a spectator you feel like youre hovering above the ensemble cast without ever meeting them each character is struggling and fighting against prejudice in its own way being a woman being black being an immigrant becoming obsolete but the depiction of those struggles feel botched and cliché and we never believe in the love story between manny and nelly once or the twice does the dialogue elicit a laugh but given the material this could have been way more fun finally the ending stretches on forever by this point we get that its an ode to cinema itself but the director drives his point so heavyhandedly that he undermines his own argument a completely useless retrospective of movies from the next years were even served excerpt from the matrix and avatar is inserted towards the end at which point we felt it was over and ready to leave but no theres another min of the main character crying and flashbacks to the main party almost to remind us why we came to watch this in the first place because we got tricked by some dishonest movie trailers oh hollywood always so full of contradictions,NEGATIVE,Comedy
20,4.0,20 July 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",it is a higenrgy assault on the senses there is always something happening visually loud music or loud screaming or loud animals aor something happening it is overthetop bombastic and rarely boring the problem rollercoasters are fun but they are fun because they last about five minutes would you want to ride a rollercoaster for an hour or two hoursno you would not and that is the problem with this movie it is throwing so much at you and it does not let up long enough for you to digest the last scene if there was a cohesive story i missed it if there was character development it got lost with the direction and editing if you are just looking for soemthing to watch and get lost in then this works otherwise it is less of a movie and more of a collection of wild scenes with famous actors just slammed together,NEGATIVE,Comedy

22,6.0,1 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",far too long for the reward that it withholds although its fearless and adventurous quite daring and quite bold overflowing with depravity full of wicked immorality indulgence and degeneracy quite an orgy that unfolds the roaring twenties and roaring doesnt quite capture the excesses presented here with a film that paints quite a colourful picture of the world of silent movies and their transition to the planet of sound margot robbie smashes it out of the park as well as producing voluminous amounts of vomit however take away the spectacle and youre left with an often told tale youve seen many times before and an eager anticipation to watch singin in the rain for the nth time a revisit your unlikely to make quite as often with this as once is more than enough,POSITIVE,Comedy

32,1.0,30 December 2022,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",i had rockbottom expectations when walking in to see babylon with mediocre reviews from audiences and critics alike i assumed that this film would be a bloated lengthy and pretentious cinematic experiment from director damien chazelle imagine my surprise however when babylon turned out to be a rather gripping film about early hollywood and the transition from silent film to talkies babylon is a good no a great movie at once a criticism of early hollywood as well a celebration of film this picture isnt afraid to depict to audiences the excessive disgusting and gratuitous lifestyle of the rich and famous during the roaring s while simultaneously addressing the fact that movies play an integral and essential role in the lives of millions of people art requires pain the movie seems to say and pain plays a major part in this film underneath the glitz and glamor that many seem to covet and yearn for indeed that many seem to associate with movie stars babylon depicts the seedy underbelly of early moviemaking from extras getting wounded during filming to crew members dying on set from the excessive use of drugs and alcohol that would make even tony montana blush to the even more illegal proclivities that people had a taste for a shame that one chris hansen wasnt around during the time period this movie at once disgusts its audience while also planting the wondrous rapturous seed of the undeniable euphoria of movie magic ive seen many reviews mention that babylon seems to portray its excess in a positive entertaining light and that couldnt be farther from the truth the opening party sequence plays out more like a nightmare than anything with the scene drenched in a hellish red and accompanied by an overbearing overloud percussive score partygoers drink to excess hire young girls to urinate on them dive out of the way of a stampeding elephant and choke to death on their own vomit from heroin overdoses its not a glamorous look at old hollywood but from the stories ive heard and read it seems to be a somewhat accurate depiction of the lawless wildwestesque roaring s and i for one found it endlessly fascinating while being repelled by what i was seeing on screen margot robbies character nellie laroy seems to be entranced she dances across the room as if hypnotized or under a spell and once she catches the eye of some bigwigs who need a backup actress in a pinch her descent into hollywood hell begins babylon is truly about hollywood during the transition from silent films to talkies and the toll this transition took on both stars and studios if you arent interesting in this then youre most likely going to hate this movie but if hollywood history is fascinating to you then youre probably going to love this movie there are so many interesting sequences that give you a dramatized look at behind the scenes shenanigans from the deafening chaos of filming a silent film to the pindrop silence that was necessary when creating a talkie babylon waves a magnifying glass at a point in history that has previously been touted as a golden age in american civility so youll get a little tour of history while simultaneously following nellies rise into movie stardom margot robbie fans rejoice because she is truly oscarworthy here i mean i dont think i can name a better performance this year brad pitt and diego calva are also standouts and luckily each share an abundant amount of screen time each of their stories are interesting individually and once their paths cross the movie really begins to pick up steam culminating in a razoredge conclusion featuring tobey maguire in a role so menacing that the joker would be alarmed and while babylon can get excessive in its storytelling what with its large cast of characters and plot lines it works for the story director damien chazelle is trying to tell directed and edited with pinpoint accuracy damien directs babylon like a thriller which at times it is though for a large majority of its over threehour running time the movie is simply a historical drama but because of this stylistic decision chazelle ensures that this movie is never boring i did not feel the length at all and i honestly couldve watched a longer cut babylon is a really good movie for film and history buffs alike there is a lot to offer here and off the top of my head i cant think of a movie i enjoyed more than this one in if youre at all interested in old hollywood you owe it to yourself to give this a watch and i cannot wait to go see this again,POSITIVE,Comedy

51,7.0,21 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",babylon is damien chazelles love letter to cinema as cinephiles or regular viewers witnessed earlier in the year with speilbergs the fablemans babylon is flashy over the top and magical set in the hay day of silent films to the eventual monumental switch to sound babylons chaotic opening perfectly denotes a style of film that viewers will witness over its lengthy hour runtime accompanied by a jazzy score quick editing and stylish cinematography babylon transports us to a vibrant and lavish world of cinema production in the early th century at its core babylons run time is supported and even helped by striking and stellar performances namely margot robbie and her showstealing performance accompanied by her dynamic range she delivers the grandeur nature of her character nellie laroy and ultimately her imperfections not as an actress but as an individual brad pitt equally holds his ground as jack conrad who exquisitely depicts his characters downfall from a star to a washedup actor with no future however we must remember diego calva who deserves equal praise for his exceptional portrayal of manuel who functions as the heart and soul that keeps babylon together babylon however does feel at times a series of set pieces within a more fantastic story but fails to connect the world and characters as one living breathing entity the film jumped from character to character too much and potentially tightening of the plot which interweaved them sufficiently emphasis on jack conrads character might have reduced the run time and left a slightly better impression on the overall story manuel and nellies relationship as lovers who wanted to run away together came about too abruptly and even forced chazelle could have developed their story subtly throughout the film before its conclusion however babylon is much more than a story about our characters and their journey throughout hollywood babylon is a message that maybe too on the nose exemplifies cinemas timeless impact on us as a viewer the range of emotions they resonate within us and the beautiful bittersweet memories they evoke the opening scene perfectly highlights this notion and the pleasure and euphoria cinema can cultivate in us people actors and characters come and go and are lost and forgotten but cinema itself endures and prevails perhaps damien chazelles babylon is a personal gripe at what cinema as an industry has become through the characterisation of the menacing villain james mckay portrayed by tobey maguire mckay states that anyone will do anything for money and chazelle articulates that the loss of cinemas true art is becoming apparent today babylons exaggerated flamboyant and chaotic tone creates an entertaining and humorous experience that is worth the watch but does not entirely escape its downfalls,POSITIVE,Comedy
52,1.0,27 December 2022,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",i loved this film it is absolutely a lovehate letter to cinema more specifically hollywood it did not bother me in the slightest that the film is hours long it held my attention from start to finish i may go see it again this week or next just so that i can find all the smaller details i may have missed especially in the party scenes the musicsoundtrack is top notch when it comes to the casting jean smart is absolutely brilliant her speech was extraordinary and i can see some deborah vance hacks characteristics in her role as elinor st john go see this film its well worth your time and money,POSITIVE,Comedy
53,7.0,22 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",i just finished watching babylon just a few hours ago and i must say i enjoyed it despite its significant flaw which i will mention later the story does follow our three main characters two of whom are hollywood megastars pitt robbie but dont be fooled the true star of the movie is cinema itself and hollywoods golden years to be precise going from silent to talkies and how that affected lifes about people who had a dream to create something bigger than life something lasting that would touch peoples hearts and of course about those people who truly enjoy movies the people that open themselves to the experience who willingly dive into and discover new worlds for a few hours those who seek to escape the true cinephiles if you fit that description i cant recommend this movie enough i also really liked the message that i think the movie tries to pass on that although as they say life imitates art sometimes art imitates life too thats when i think people fall in love with a movie or movies in general when they recognize their own struggles and their own self in a movie now for the bad the movie is too long could easily be cut to half an hour shorter i could feel people around me losing interest even heard some complain about the duration even i despite the fact i was enjoying myself found myself wishing for the credits to finally roll in the last minutes,POSITIVE,Comedy

55,1.0,4 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",did this movie flop money wise yes however i thought the movie was phenomenal and had great time it has been a while since i thought about a movie so much after seeing it and wouldnt mind going right back into the theater to watch it again this movie is meant for the theater as you can tell with all the sound the partys music is meant to be played loud and surround sound the ending is a montage better experienced in the theater while it wouldnt work as well on a basic tv the theme of film appreciation was achieved after thinking this whole movie was going to be a huge party it themes were shined own and they were excellent this film conveys things in a unique and excellent way one as i already said it makes you appreciate film two it brilliantly conveys the missing the good old days theme and the mental effect new times can bring on people brad pitts character showed this and his role was amazing he had so much yet so little the deaths in this movie were so random and you could choose if they were funny or sad of course if it was real life it would be sad but when you are watching this movie you arent thinking about the world and thats a good feeling the movie also presents political issues but doesnt force them forward anymore nobody starts a rebellion or anything huge this is a nice change of pace from other studios like disney where they force it the characters get screwed and the story continues you get to choose for yourself how to feel and you feel sympathetic towards characters three the plot tells a story about the changing of the film industry this sounds like one but i mean something different in one i meant the celebration of film in three im talking about the storyplot and the smooth progression of a somewhat historical story i found it very fascinating how much changed the introduction of sound into film was more interesting than i would have thought i loved the scene where the producers and laroy had to adjust to this and the director had a meltdown again the deaths were so random i didnt know whether to laugh or not the movie let me choose the comedy was spot on from the start with the elephant to the ending a little much but nothing cringe one last thing this movie did very well was different and not in a dumb way this was a unique vision and fun to watch play out it doesnt remind me of other films or of other films chazelle did himself there wasnt one actor i thought that was bad brad pitt keeps your attention and is and entertaining character at the beginning by the end he is a tragic character that you continue to think about margot robbie is the best actress out there in my opinion she constantly goes from crazy to sad a character starting from nothing seeking grandeur who by the end doesnt know what to do with her life i didnt know who diego calva was but he was very solid as someone who gets most of the screentime a character with a bright future and fixation in film who wont give up his obsession with laroy tobey maguire was amazing in every scene he had though they were few a character with clever movie ideas tobey underground scenes were some of the most interesting in the movie and set forward the stakes my two favorite secondary characters were the director that had a meltdown and conrads first director not sure if those are the correct titles the soundtrack and lighting in the film were very impressive the only reasons i could see it getting bad reviews is because of the runtime and not thinking the rrated content was necessary the thought of time crept into my mind but i had nowhere to be and was more immersed in what was going to happen next in the movie damien chazelle did a great job,POSITIVE,Comedy

57,6.0,26 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",this is a truly amazing movie but the amazement is that somewhere some people financed this awful fake of hollywood history the beginning shows apparently hundreds of actors many in what looks like the tv show westworld set in mini scale poorly photographed then to a large scale silent battle scene that years later in real life would be spartacus there seems to be a lot of repeating of themes some characters are prescient some self indulgent none interesting i do recommend one actor brad pitt is a standout in each scene where he appears even when intentionally ridiculous his appearance and voice remain magical though even he did not make this gruel worthwhile,NEGATIVE,Comedy
58,1.0,25 December 2022,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",its the story of the peak and fall of silent hollywood told through three individuals brad pitt who seems to be largely a mix of douglas fairbanks sr and john gilbert margo robie whos clara bow with a little jean harlow and diego calva who starts off as an odd jobs man spends some time as pitts gopher and then a producer trying to save miss robies career the movie establishes its credential as anhistorical right off by a reference to garbo as a big star at a time when mgm was groggily becoming aware she was not just a bimbo they had to take to get victor seastrom to leave sweden soon enough we hear the band at the orgy more later playing tito puente a musical score for pitts big picture stolen from and similar effects moviemaking techniques are those of rather than ten years after and miss robies first film sports the trademark k of kalem a patents trust company that collapsed in not to mention that her director is phoebe tonkin at a moment when there were two women directing in hollywood and neither was in charge of comedy shorts having established my credential as to my ability to spot some anachronisms i will admit they dont matter in the least no matter how much they annoy me as established in the first half hour of the movie before the credits roll this is not intended to be reality but a mythic time actors who were shooting the next day did not get blasted the previous evening fall into bed at sunrise for a couple of hours sleep and head over to the shoot the morning was when they shot closeups before a long days work lined the face they had to get to sleep early not attend orgies with elephants by the time the movie got around to i realized that this was singin in the rain shot as a tragedy instead of a musical comedy and the assumption was that hollywood babylon covered up the real smut of the era the rest of the movie confirmed my suspicions this was intended as a spectacle to outdemille demille and the formula for that is simple eight reels of people enjoying themselves outrageously followed by one reel of suffering and redemption that mythic sort of handling works for two hours but this one times in at three as the deep subtext of the film movies are art must be rammed down the audiences throat several times before pitt puts a gun to his head which is true enough but the long speech given by jean smart lays it out plainly we dont need the movie to continue through with an epilogue in fifteen minutes of singin in the rain followed by many clips which film buffs will preen themselves on recognizing so that makes this movie good pitt is excellent as always an actor who is too goodlooking for people to notice his abilities miss robie is fine playing a loon calva who i dont recognize is excellent and the large cast is impeccable my main complaint about the movie is its excessive length and the question i ask often these days whom did they make it for not the film buffs like me not the kids who dont care what happened twenty years ago let alone almost a century im sure that damien chazelle ran as economical a shoot as he could but theres a lot of money on the screen and the hard r rating and length will limit its take at the box office and its aftermarkets whats a succes destime worth to a studio these days,POSITIVE,Comedy

62,1.0,26 December 2022,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",given that whiplash and la la land were outstanding films it seemed reasonable to hopeand expectthat director damien chazelles new film would deliver it seemed to be a unique spectacle of excess and debauchery in s hollywood that would combine flashiness with hopefully and given chazelles previous track record a compelling story and profound character development tragically however babylon is a bloated misfire that ends up being unique for all the wrong reasons right off the bat chazelle brings the viewer along for a ride that ends up being a fusillade of pulsepounding jazz music a whirlwind of hedonism and increasingly sophomoric and eyerolling moments this would have all been fine if he had a more coherent story or contextual justification for his indulgence but alas he doesnt after all some exceptionally welldirected films such as scorseses goodfellas or even the wolf of wall street or paul thomas andersons boogie nights completely wrap themselves around a crackerjack virtuoso sense of intensity while simultaneously complementing their own narratives unfortunately babylon does not do the same the debauchery starts to get increasingly tiring after a while when the characters doing it are thinly written especially by chazelle standards and uninteresting in contrast to better films about excess that keep the viewer wholly engaged over a long runtime the films plot is pretty loose and unengaging for a gargantuan minute runtime which does not help matters much either the performances are fine but unexceptional yet even the more talented actors in the cast cant elevate the disappointing and sometimespointless screenwriting theyve been given to work with the result is a movie that feels far less satisfying and impactful than it should have especially since its many moving parts dont really add up to anything even the films message about the magic of cinema comes off as a bit hollow given that many far better films have dealt with that topic i hope chazelles next film will be stronger than this one and something i will be eagerly awaiting given some of his previous works he is certainly and clearly qualified of making great films unfortunately babylon isnt one of them,NEGATIVE,Comedy

65,1.0,2 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",babylon wasnt a bad movie it wasnt as good or as personal as the fabelmans but it was a decent movie you will either love it or hate it the entire movie felt more like a fever dream than anything the plot was messy at times where the plot jumped around way too much i dont really understand the message damien chazelles trying to say other than he has a love for movies i can see why people are saying the movie feels self indulgent with a lot of the plot seemingly going nowhere and you really feel every second of the runtime of hours margot robbies performance was very good in fact you can really see her acting range as well as her acting potential throughout this movie i dont think ive ever seen her give a bad performance this movie is defiantly not la la land so anyone going in thinking la la land will be disappointed this movie honestly felt like an allegory for hell in some ways the entire beginning of the film where everyones dancing getting high and having an orgy looked like something straight out of a painting depicting hell on earth or the end times to be honest i thought that they shouldve just went that route and left out the whole love letter to cinema bit however the movie jumps around with way too many timelines and time jumps to the point it gets draining to watch at time the beginning middle and end feel like were watching different movies overall id give this movie a solid for the acting music cinematography,NEGATIVE,Comedy
66,6.0,23 December 2022,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",a cinephiles dream exciting experience damien chazelle created a wild movie creating and party animal the kind of creation that gets me wishing so badly to work on cinema its just much harder for an autistic guy anyway babylon is about a journey of partying then making a movie then next day all of which was meticulously masterful so much character development and genuine flow of events margot robbie and diego calva manny torres plays producer so well with his beautiful stares and brilliant emotions throughout babylon is highly deserving of nominations like most of damiens films except first man was solid not as marvelous as others also i might be one of few to notice babylon resembles boogie nights in a lot of ways even though the story is different theres a bunch of similar scenes,POSITIVE,Comedy
67,1.0,17 September 2024,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",just okay perfectly sums up this movie while it boasts a cast of talented actors it is ultimately let down by a weak script and poor pacing the film had potential but the execution was flawed leaving much to be desired its best to watch it in parts almost like a miniseries because sitting through it in one go feels slow and tedious you dont need to be very attentive to follow the plot which says a lot about the films lack of depth or complexity theres technically a twist but it lacks the punch it needed due to poor delivery the script is the biggest downfall leaving an otherwise interesting concept feeling messy and unengaging id only watch it once and honestly id find it difficult to recommend however i will say the music was a standoutit added some muchneeded atmosphere and was one of the few enjoyable aspects of the film,NEGATIVE,Comedy

71,7.0,30 July 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",this movie works on the premise that anything said loudly is more cogent than something said quietly as such this movie is a thrill ride that is surprisingly uncinematic it is very acutely visual but it purposefully ignores any kind of meaning or emotional connection it delivers on the shock value of images to the point where it completely abuses it and withholds most of the emotion its almost a parody of a bad movie it does and shows everything a good movie shouldnt unfortunately it is played straight and therefore cannot be qualified as such it ambitions to have a grand message it wants to be an homage to pregolden age cinema and also a critique of something a reverence to the wholesomeness of early cinema and simultaneously a shining light on the excesses yet babylon is itself oblivious to basic screenwriting and movie making technique the argument becomes almost moot basic screenwriting suggests that a film should have a beginning a middle and an end it should have a recognizable protagonist the more relatable the protagonist the better you can have multiple protagonistsheroes but its more tricky and youre essentially diluting the emotional core traditional technique would be to divide the story in separate acts basically doing one thing at a time so the audience can understand what happens at any given moment you need to know what a character is doing and why and also sortof anticipate what will follow you can adjust the pace to what is happening in the acts to give thing more meaning or emphasis for instance you wouldnt include an interminable manic sequence without any connection with the rest of the story where a snake runs loose and bites a whole party in the middle of the desert with pacing it is also important to have loud moments followed by quiet moments when you keep the intensity of the film to a high throughout it is exhausting you need quiet beats as much as loud ones not only for that reason but also to absorb the louder moment and emotional rushes if you represented emotional intensity graphically it should be sinusoidal waved curves not a straight line more than anything this film is the story of damien chazelle the fall from grace of a hollywood wunderkind its a tale as old as time really he broke out with whiplash a sports movie disguised as a film about jazz then came lala land which is kind of a simple movie the plot is subpar and its rather manipulative emotionally but it charms you and it works because its a musical he is a smart man with a sense of rhythm and pacing with a reverence to jazz hes got a style a pattern a signature thoses were commercial and critical successes hollywood says we trust you make whatever you want youll have all the resources access to any and every actorstalent go nuts looks like mr chazelle took that quite literally,NEGATIVE,Comedy

86,6.0,31 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",there were moments of brilliance in screenwriting and overall cinematic framing was outstanding the cast was excellent though i do not buy the story built around manuel he was completely invisible and i only realized half way through the film wondering who the main character is robbie or pitt that its supposed to be manuels story and most importantly clearly chazelle did not get constructive feedback on the runtime pretty much all of the plots in the last min were completely unnecessary and killed the movie dynamics despite a great start and an excellent first h overall i left the cinema bored and could not wait for the film to end for at least last min now thats a wasted potential with such cast and production,NEGATIVE,Comedy

88,1.0,12 July 2024,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",in my opinion it is the best that cinema can offer in this era when it is difficult for something to move us and make us focus all our attention it talks about a clichéd themesex fame vanity drugsbut the way and the depth in which it portrays these topics make it more than just another movie it is a dive into the psychology of people through the passage of time and the rapid changes that technology and society undergo excellent performances from all the actors outstanding colors and direction and music that you want to listen to even beyond the movie i want to see this movie again so i can spot more details,POSITIVE,Comedy
89,6.0,2 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",im already a star oh what have you been in nothing yet a lot of people thought babylon would simply be another oscarseason movie about the movies but it turned out to be more darkly satirical than that to say the least a love letter to cinema but a hate letter to hollywood to paraphrase the director you think you know what youre in for when you see the oldschool paramount logo before you know it the frame is doused in urine and elephant feces reviews have been all over the place ranging from those who claim that this is the movie baz luhrmann wishes he couldve made instead of elvis or even the great gatsby to those who argue that this is just a flimsy emulation of the wolf of wall street or boogie nights the movie is in any case mightily entertaining and it has the energy weve come to expect of damien chazelle there is much to keep track of some of which is redundant failing to justify such a long runtime but most of it indeed tracks brad pitt margot robbie diego calva and especially tobey maguire give some wild performances the look of silent films is superbly emulated specifically the tinted kind which is rarely paid tribute to in the same way as the blackandwhite ones and chazelles ear for music is as exquisite as youd expect the score in particular is a periodaccurate jazz extravaganza and easily my pick for best original score this year of course i also appreciate that something ostensibly antihollywood slipped through the cracks and got a few oscar nominations but it does make me wonder why nope got snubbed probably because its undertones were too upsetting it may have been a comedy but its treatment of hollywoods habits of sensationalism and erasure was pretty serious but it might also have been the academys usual antihorror bias and possibly a bit of racist neglect which bolsters the point of the film so bravo peele,POSITIVE,Comedy

91,8.0,5 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",every character in this movie is stupid unlikable and boring i guess thats what they were going for but that cant be used an excuse for the movie being way too long and not worth watching debauchery for debaucherys sake is not entertaining or thought provoking what is even the central message why was this even made besides being an obvious vanity project theres no stakes in this movie because all the characters personalities and motivations are paper thin when a certain traumatic event happens to one of the main characters i was hoping it would kill them again it feels like youre not supposed to like any of the characters butif thats the case whats the point of making or watching the movie well its like i mentioned earlier its just debauchery for the sake of debauchery,NEGATIVE,Comedy
92,1.0,23 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",a fun but messy mix of la la land and boogie nights with a bit of cocaine added in to the mix good amazing jazz score by justin hurwitz great acting from everybody with the scene stealers being margot robbie and tobey maquire those montage sequences chefs kiss aside from the ending probably one of the most epic movies about movies when it comes to scale badmeh the ending loses me after that montage i though that ending it earlier would have been a great way of showing how great movies are but also showing how people making them have to suffer for it sometimes the movie is so vulgar that it feels like an edgy teenager wrote the scenes it does have some dull parts mainly in the rd act li jun lis character felt underutilized movies tone kind of put me off guard the humor can be really over the top so when the movie does get darker it feels like a scene from a different movie the snake scene felt pretty pointless for me aside of getting the two characters together strong,NEGATIVE,Comedy

94,5.0,17 June 2024,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",nursing a sprained ankle i finally sat down and watched damien chazelles floptastic masterpiece babylon set in the s to mid s babylon charts the story of hollywoods transition from the silent to sound era but also indulges in the excess the drinking the debauchery the kinks and the general bad behaviour associated with hollywood at the time and lets be honest even today and its impact on the screen there is a really interesting and fun movie in here especially for those who love the movies and are fascinated by the history of hollywood i think babylon tackles a lot of interesting ideas both from a plot standpoint the impact on technology on film making and its players and thematically the feeling of behind left behind i also think despite the films completely unnecessarily long run time its never boring from the moment it begins with a avalanche of sorts to its truly out there final scene which almost feels an extended solo that just keeps going on and on the movie kept my attention entirely i did however feel it took about an hour and twenty odd minutes to really get going plot wise and i cant say thats a good thing the problem is i dont think any sane person could tell you babylon is a tightly constructed well told story it meanders and goes off in so many different directions but unlike once upon a time in hollywood which is beautiful to look at and envelopes you in a world and time that youd kind of want to stay in babylon is seedy gross and unhinged thats obviously intentional but that along with the zippy editing especially in the first half makes this a truly exhausting watch i often felt the movie was trying too hard to be shocking at times theres one scene in particular involving margot robbie at a party that just felt excessive to the point of an eyeroll the film also doesnt quite feel like were witnessing events in the early th century theres something about the way people talk the way they act and the slang they use that felt distractingly modern i didnt find the costumes or set design particularly good either and this is one of those movies where you really need that i havent mentioned the performances because frankly no one really stood out to me margot robbie is kind of doing her new jersey accent thing brad pitt is pretty solid as always and everyone else is fine but nothing noteworthy to be honest a bit more restraint from a lot of these people wouldve been better overall i liked babylon enough but im never going to watch it again i dont think its a surprise this movie was a gigantic flop it shows a lot and touches upon interesting ideas but is almost too obsessed with spectacle to really delve into the emotional aspects of whats going on i can admire what chazelles doing but this one desperately needed some editing and script revisions although characteristic for him the films jazzy score is excellent,POSITIVE,Comedy
95,1.0,24 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",extremely disappointing experience and that from the director who made marvels like whiplash and lala land poor photography which could and should have been so much better poor use of decor poor cuts and a very poor storyline i really dont understand what has been attempted to achieve here it seems as if no real effort has been made to make something good the overriding feeling eventually is a lack of selection a lack of editing an inability to not be tempted to include almost everything that possibly can be included especially in the finale with all these pointless references to some if the modern greats for me this has turned out to basically be an insult to moviemaking why do this there is one great scene in this movie tho which is mostly jean smart monologuing brad pitt you can watch that on the plane skip the rest,NEGATIVE,Comedy
96,7.0,23 December 2022,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",i loved her in the wolf of wall street and as harley quinn in suicide squad birds of prey and the suicide squad now margot robbie gives one of her best performances in director damien chazelles new film babylon the story takes place in hollywood during the late s and early s when movies with sound were first being made it begins with a wild hollywood party where people are doing drugs and drinking and having sex and it really is outrageously entertaining and fun to watch the extreme behavior the movie follows several characters as they make movies and sometimes socialize and party margot robbie is truly outstanding and brad pitt is also excellent they both deserve oscars for their performances the film is very well made with excellent cinematography and production design it is a long movie but it is never boring ultimately it becomes a tribute to the magic of the movies i recommend seeing this movie on the big screen,POSITIVE,Comedy
97,9.0,12 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",the film features strong technical aspects showcasing the talent of the filmmakers however the characters lacked depth and development making it difficult to form an emotional connection with them despite margot robbie and diego calvas best tries it was not enough brad pitt was the only character that managed to leave a lasting impression the cinematography and music while good did not quite reach the level of excellence seen in la la land the long takes and practical sets were impressive the first half of the film was the strongest as it focused more on the portrayal of hollywood at the time and less on the shallow characters the movie is at times hilarious while chaotic but sometimes its just chaotic while the second half is not as good as the first it ends on a high note overall the movie was entertaining and worth your time,POSITIVE,Comedy
98,7.0,30 December 2022,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",i can see why the reviews are polarized and why people hate the film its a frustrating film at times mainly cause there is so much going on right off the bat its crazy flash and busy tho i enjoyed it at first at the film progressed it gets more busy and busy and then the ending is so busy and goes on and on and on and it doesnt know when to end thats the main fault of the film is that less is more and that would of helped the film there is also much characters that the supporting characters dont get enough screen time and story that they seem pointless at times or lost the acting is amazing especially margot robbie who deserves all the praise for the film i get what the film was aiming at but it just lands where you hate or love it at times its frustrating and at times gives you a headache i overall enjoyed the film at times and thought it was ok though i would not recommended the film,POSITIVE,Comedy
99,8.0,31 December 2022,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",im leaving a review because of how mixed reviews seem to be but i absolutely loved it it felt like a wild ride from start to finish and while it showed all sorts of nastiness of hollywood and movies it also was filmed so cinematically that it was a representation of all the good movies bring the score was so good throughout it almost felt like a musical bright and bombastic or somber and thoughtful it was always appropriate for each moment brad pitt and margot robbie were great and represented both sides of stardom but diego calva was so compelling and carried us through on the adventure great movie and i cant wait to watch it again,POSITIVE,Comedy
100,6.0,17 May 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",visually and emotionally reminds me a lot in many scenes of fellinis satyricon or bob gucciones caligula those are not movies for everyone the great illusion of photoplays comes at a human cost those made famous are wasting their health and wealth those would be famous are exploited and abused its a mad desperate race that creates the illusory and escapist factory of emotions trends fashions commentary and fake that becomes real real the ambitious project shows the underlying ambiguities of cinema as an art form after taking inspiration from the french director jacques demy for la la land mr hurwitz is now borrowing from federico fellini and presents us an ambitious movie about the pitfalls of cinematic art,POSITIVE,Comedy

136,8.0,27 December 2022,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",i thought the film was pretty good even if it dragged on at the end it felt disjointed at times and maybe had one too many sub plots damien chazelle coming off whiplash la la land and first man two very good movies and the third really a hit or miss i was expecting something great and i liked this a lot its a tragedy and that third act is really depressing no other word to describe it its a little wild and vulgar at times so mind that it really channels the wolf of wallstreet on that note this movie is kind of a cross between that film and singing in the rain doesnt sound like it would work well but i think it did also that tobey maguire stuff is really creepy hes such an odd little character i couldnt help but love just prepare your self for his minutes of horror towards the end,POSITIVE,Comedy
137,1.0,24 March 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",this is the first time i review something here after years maybe and its just my attempt to prevent you from wasting hours of your life with this abomination the whole theater was puzzled by this movie there is no plot to follow there are no character traits to be appreciated its just a bunch of colourful scenes glued together hoping for the best to stand out by being edgy and ridiculous it wasnt the graphic scenes that got to me it wasnt the run time as weve just been through avatar and its h its that the movie is a travesty i did learn something out of babylon to always do some research on the movie we are committing our weekly cinema time to save your time and cash skip this one,NEGATIVE,Comedy
138,6.0,29 December 2022,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",not spoliers ok shout out to daimen chazelle and the actors brad pitt who jack conrad diego calva who plays manny torres and margot robbie who plays nellie laroy to show to the people that you think that hollywood would make you happy make you feel at home make you feel that you can do anything but actually its the opposite of it and this movie shows it pretty much of what people experience of what they see when you go out to hollywood another shout out to the man who plays your friendly neighborhood spiderman tobey maguire and jeff garlin good job on this one overall,POSITIVE,Comedy
139,7.0,5 May 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",this movie was just ok for me quite different than most movies its about an hour too long no matter how you feel about it this movie will surely make you feel very thankful youre not part of the mess called hollywood you can ble societys collapse on politics social media or whatever but i now know it starts with hollywood nothing but greedy selfrighteous selfserving narcissistic swine ill take middle class income and be thankful im not one of them id like to see this same movie made about hollywood years later in just to see how things have or havent changed ill bet not much,NEGATIVE,Comedy
140,1.0,28 December 2022,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",damien chazelle is the goat fight me when this film was first annonced i got nervous because it seemed too good to be true a behindthescenes hollywood picture starring the best young actor margo robbie the always entertaining brad pitt and a very intriguing diego capva directed by the man that made whiplash and la la land either this will be the best film since s once upon a time in hollywoodparasite or this will be an utterly dissapointing mess that will deminish the once seemingly great damien chazzeles legacy i thought as it turns out babylon was my favourite film of giving me exactly what i wanted ever since the film was announced a fun time and great filmmaking the acting was also great margo robbie and diego calva were the two standouts brad pitt gave a solid brad pitt performance for a very brand pittesque character and id also like to mention p j byrne who really left it all on the stage this film is not perfect but jesus wasnt perfect eighter we need to celebrate films such as this so that we may break free of the ip movie hell that us film lovers are currently in if your looking for a marvel movie this aint it this is a movie movie strap in your seat bealt snort yourself a line of that good good and hang on for a hour pleasure of a film to watch thank you damien chazelle vive le cinéma,POSITIVE,Comedy
141,6.0,11 September 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",well this was a surprise there was so much in this movie to unpack it had so much bizarre content that i couldnt keep up it was chaotic even hilarious at times but it captured also the stress and dangers of film making in those days besides the humour there was also serious feelings like being broken lonely and people in desperation to fit in to feel special or to fill a void nellie was a classic example of someone from a traumatic past with was a hot mess she was a leech and made no effort to change manny a beautiful character that would do anything nellie and poor sad lonely conrad,POSITIVE,Comedy
142,3.0,20 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",this movie pulls no punches showing the darkest depths of depravity and unsettling hobbies the people of hollywood love to get up to as seen back the s s and s it even exposes hollywood for what it truly is and that is a highly exploitive business where if you have talent theyll suck you in promising you the world and all the riches making you feel like your important loved and accepted but when the time comes that theyll no longer need you or think you are of no use to them anymore they will discard you like yesterdays trash moving on to their next victim this doesnt just involve actors it can can involve anyone from journalist sound props or production crew if you die theyll cover it up and again move on i see why this movie has bad reviews but it isnt warranted because babylon is an uncomfortable hour movie that by the end makes you feel dirty sick horrified and exploited i certainly felt this way by the end of the movie by all means this movie can be bordering on horror real life horror this was not a flop for margot robbie despite what critics would have you believe this movie was really good and probably my favorite ive seen of margot outside of her harley quinn movies well acted and a talented cast great story that is disturbing an unsettling,POSITIVE,Comedy
143,9.0,19 September 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",babylon is as others have pointed out basically damien chazelles quentin tarantinos once upon a time in hollywood by way of paul thomas andersons boogie nights and martin scorseses the wolf of wall street just like those three key inspirations the movie is far from its directors best work its also worth mentioning that the piece kind of plays out like a remake of singin in the rain not just because it depicts hollywoods tumultuous transition from silent films to talkies but also because it explicitly references even recreates key scenes from that picture in doing so it kind of just makes you want to watch that superior picture which is also the case when it purposefully evokes a number of other movies most of which are actually far more interesting in letting his inner film nerd often clumsily roam free chazelle accidentally dampens the effect of his own effort thats not to imply that the piece is without merit as its often an entertaining and dazzlingly spectacular experience thats as technically impressive as it is deliberately idiosyncratic joining the likes of robert eggers the northman and ari asters beau is afraid as yet another ballstothewall bigbudgeted boxoffice bomb that will unfairly but almost certainly ensure its director never gets to work on this scale ever again its a shame that the apparent financial failure of these types of big swings will give the studio pause when affording previously proven filmmakers more resources to make something that so satisfyingly goes against the typical definition of a blockbuster and in that regard this sort of bombastic blowout that cares little about convention really ought to be supported more particularly by any audience members who have ever complained about superhero fatigue at the same time though you cant really blame someone for not wanting to sit through three hours of something theyre not interested in and the flicks reputation of being nothing more than gonzo excess and self congratulation in the form of an infatuation with old hollywood doesnt really do all that much to sell the prospect of planting your butt on a cinema seat and not moving for overindulgent minutes although that reputation isnt entirely accurate it does go some way in explaining the atmosphere and attitude of the feature yet theres certainly a bit more to the flick than its chaotic party scenes and period adoration for instance one of its best segments is an unexpected and almost outofplace descent into truly horrific territory marked by the appearance of a notsofriendly spiderman and a goodfellas esque spiral into coked out paranoia interestingly theres a very similar parallel scene in the aforementioned boogie nights there are also some quieter moments that come close to saying something quite profound particularly a dialogue scene between jean smarts gossip columnist and brad pitts fading star that succinctly sums up chazelles own feelings for the medium without pulling you out of the experience which is what happens elsewhere in the piece its also worth mentioning that the feverish festivities and frenzied film shoots are often genuinely striking in their technical construction a marriage of beautifully shot long takes and musically timed quick cuts that somehow make the already massive sets seem even more immersive and the already teeming crowds feel even more alive this is no doubt a very wellmade movie most of the affairs weaknesses actually lie in its screenplay its most obvious flaw is that it seems to desperately believe its actually saying something but it isnt really saying anything at all despite its micro successes in approaching poignancy but never quite reaching it its overall theming falls flat this is reflected in the ending which clearly thinks its bringing things full circle but actually leaves you feeling a little cold in many ways its the equivalent of the nicole kidman amc adverts actually to be fair the ending itself is fairly compelling when it uses footage specifically shot for it but incredibly underwhelming and distracting when it doesnt ill avoid elaborating for fear of spoiling things although the picture is filled with lots of fantastic performances particularly from the three leads a lot of the characters are somewhat underserved even those that appear to be key components of certain plotlines of the three central characters only one of them really has an internal arc the others just respond to their new situations in the same way they responded to their old ones this isnt inherently bad but there are some segments that skim over some important character work that may have been interesting to see unfold on screen another weakness is the fact that the feature is at least to me not funny in the slightest usually drawing its humour solely from bodily fluids there are some moments that approach the kind of absurdity that can put a smile on your face but none of them ever quite reach the point of actually doing that that isnt a massive issue in the grand scheme of things as the flick does hold your attention even when it isnt tickling your funny bone or even trying to generally speaking the movie is engaging right the way through although it does wear a bit thin in places and it doesnt really feel as though it earns its length sometimes it gives you the sense that its over three hours long just because something like spartacus is its entertaining for its majority and even at its worst its at least interesting though it isnt as jawdropping as its hype may have you believe its definitely a sight to be seen especially in the current cinematic landscape its one of those movies where i appreciate its audacity and its craft far more than i connect with it emotionally its enjoyable enough for what it is and it has a handful of really solid sequences but it sort of leaves you feeling eversoslightly underwhelmed and isnt likely to stick with you for too long although perhaps longer than something more generic its a solid effort overall and i definitely do recommend it but perhaps dont go into it expecting to be totally blown away,NEGATIVE,Comedy
144,7.0,24 December 2022,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",if i could give one word for this movie it is excess excess wealth sex love drugs class truth and most of all hollywood from brad pitts wonderful acting in possibly one of his most talented roles to a stunningly elegant yet eccentric margot robbie or maybe you are a fan of a genuine character full of love in diego calva nevertheless this is the most grotesque but beautiful movie from the breathtaking views of california hills or filming at the famous point dume beach in malibu ca the scenery is fantastic the only reason this is not a ten out of ten is simply how long the movie is as it takes forever to get a conclusion however the storyline is written so well it becomes a mute problem this movie truly shows the roaring s as they truly were in hollywood,POSITIVE,Comedy
145,9.0,31 August 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",this film throws everything at you and doesnt stop to do so for whole hours excess in every scenes the screaming and yelling while arguing makes it seem like a tv dating show at times and after hours it gets hard to watch apart from the chaotic energy the film conveys many parts were interesting the opening one for instance showcased the ultraextravagance of that period blending the dancing man and women into a pleasant picture of colours the reason i feel the film deserves a is because of the main cast fantastic display by everyone especially by margot robbie who made an incredible job in portraying nellie along with a steadfastly competent brad pitt who brings his experience into play once again a fun film who had too many minutes of screen and deserved a more careful writing but still a great watch,POSITIVE,Comedy
146,7.0,10 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",this movie should never have been made from the perspective of an historian who likes movies this was boring and stupid i typically enjoy brad pitt margot robbie and olivia wildes work but this movie was really bad the writing was atrocious the plot was boring and the story was obnoxious while the movie was way too long even as a minute short it would have been horrid there was nothing even close to a story that required such a long run time it was just a series of county fair sideshow scenes strung together with no coherence or purpose there was nothing about this movie that i liked,NEGATIVE,Comedy
147,9.0,1 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",this was a fantastic experience imho it was on the level of once upon a time in hollywood but with more layers of complexity the sound score is outstanding as well i enjoyed it very much all hours of it even though i saw some people walking out of it well it will likely not top the box office but i am sure that people will be talking about this move for many years to come the whole cast is wonderful maggot and diego are absolutely killing it pitt should get his second oscar for the best supporting role if you love movies and jazz do yourself a favor and watch it on a big screen enjoy,POSITIVE,Comedy
148,7.0,5 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",theres a great film hidden within babylon somewhere but unfortunately damien chazelle wasnt able to fully realize it damien chazelle is a director that i absolutely love and theres nothing wrong with the directing here at all but this was too long and felt like it didnt really get to a point there are tons of really great scenes scattered throughout the film but it doesnt flow together very well at all there are whole sections of the film like tobey maguires section which while interesting doesnt feel like it fits into the film at all in fact most of the climax feels kind of forced and the ending scene while interesting also feels weirdly placed i like the homage to cinema but it feels like a good scene in the wrong movie some characters just kind of feel thrown in like jovan adepos character he has some really great scenes but those scenes dont really affect the story at all i also feel that watching the trailer beforehand may have given me the wrong expectations the trailer gave this wolf of wall street vibe to it but the movie is not like that at all i wish it had more of that intense vibe to it while this review has been mostly negative so far i still think that everything around the story is great the directing is great diego calva is great and so is margot robbie brad pitt is good in this but some scenes feel like he was only there for the paycheck the music and cinematography are absolutely fantastic with the score especially standing out the music helps keep the pacing feel much faster than it is and it truly elevates the film the production design and editing are both phenomenal as well and i wouldnt be upset if babylon won the oscar for best production design i still think chazelle is an amazing director who has a lot of potential but i definitely left this feeling disappointed if you like damien chazelle then i would still say that this is worth checking out,POSITIVE,Comedy
149,1.0,27 December 2022,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",this movie shows how spoiled rotten actors are they get paid massive amounts of money to pretend to be someone they are not they drink and drug excessively they have outrageous and decadent parties all the time they have all the fame and fortune in the world and its never enough for them i honestly dont have too much sympathy for them in many ways this movie has no actual plot its just spoiled actors acting like whiny children it also is excessively long at over three hours of hollywood psychosis i for one dont worship actors like this movie wants me to they arent my gods they are just people who get paid way too much for their profession hollywood was depraved back in the s and it still is now i dont need to be reminded of that,NEGATIVE,Comedy
150,1.0,10 March 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",yes its a mess yes its way too long but damn is it fun the opening half an hour or so promises so much for the film and it achieves this not in the way you would think but in completely different ways there were times when i thought how did we get here but you just have to go with it and enjoy the ride a lot of people criticise the character development and i can understand since the movie is hours long and we hardly know anyones backstories however i think it shows how people came and go in hollywood fading in and out of anonymity others will see it differently which is understandable the highlight for me was the ending which felt like a major love letter to cinema and the progress of film up to the modern day despite the decadence and excess in the culture the production was groundbreaking it even moved me a little bit which surprised me for a film that is such a hot mess i really enjoyed the score as well it was nice and playful adding an extra lavish touch to the tone of the film those little trumpet riffs will be stuck in my head for a while,POSITIVE,Comedy

152,1.0,22 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",its genuinely hard to judge this movie as i have mixed feelings about it all i really loved the main idea and the characters well built touching and rich in deep details the scenografies spaces and in general the depiction of s hollywood is astonishing truly a great piece of filmmaking that praises the great cinema of the past through its passage from the silent films to the sound the acting as well was really toptier brad pitt margot robbie and diego calva were perfect for the roles and delivered outstanding performances through happy crazy and heartbreaking scenes justin hurwitzs soundtrack is beautiful and more essential than ever spacing through different genres of music in a single hours experience the whole symbolism and idea of the stars of hollywood climbing the society and decaying in a few years is simply incredible and on spot with these premises it was not hard to have an outstanding movie however it was the style that didnt work you have to love this style in order to love babylon and for me it wasnt so the excesses the feasts and the loud music were a bit too much resulting in an unfortunate headache at the end of the movie during the three hours these parties become heavier and heavier and in the end some parts with free violence and no reason for them were added to disturb even more the audience i get that chazelles intent was to disturb the viewer and he managed so well in doing so but it doesnt properly fit my style babylon is undeniably a bold movie that results almost perfect technically but for my personal taste it was a bit a wasted opportunity if this story had been adapted with a different style and approach i would have certainly loved it,POSITIVE,Comedy

157,1.0,5 October 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",was not quite what i expected like a few other more recent big production movies there is more production than substance its over three hours long and for me would have worked better if it was around two hours and there was a lot of fill in stuff in there not really all that relevant to the story as mentioned production was very good music was good cast was suitably cast it was very much carried by margot robbie who seems to take whatever part she is handed and manages to pull it off extremely well even in a poor movie it is worth a watch and i am not knocking it though it does drag on being so long,POSITIVE,Comedy

160,1.0,23 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",no pun intended you might have heard a lot about the movie good and bad things about it depending on your moral compass depending on how easy you can be shocked well the movie might be not the right one for you good thing is you will know early on although it may have been for you if the movie just stayed away from the depravities on display again no pun intended the movie starts with our main character on the receiving end of some well i dont think i can use the word but lets just say you wouldnt like the way it smells and it just proceeds to more nastiness some people describe it as golden shower and that is before we get to the gratuitous nudity that is sprinkled all over the place literally but even so the movie is actually a love letter a morbid and wicked one for sure but still a love letter to movies and movie making you have to be able to take the jokes some seem superficial even shallow giving us cliches and seemingly dimensional or even one dimensional characters but there is depth there and even more so in the performances one example is brad pitt with a flawless introduction quite old school with his back to the camera when he is drunk and then he isnt well he is but he also is able to do stuff like find his way to his bed sticking with him even if he is only one of many main characters he also is able to be drunk but be there on point when it comes to working his journey is quite something to behold and the things he learns again circling back to the love letter thing expiration dates may be imminent but there is also eternity to be earned well as far as we can tell while i understand that the characters are made up and the stories heightend to say the least the movie itself does portray a lot of truths i am again not sure what words i can use without being seen as offensive even if i only describe what the movie is telling us about the movie industry but also about society like when margot robbies character is being made to play a role in real life which she is not suited for at all she is as mesmerizing as eveyone else in this some stars are blink and youll miss them like olivia wilde and many others and that with a movie that runs over hours but is over before you know it many incidents and many little stories one could say and yet they make a whole movie they make up a lifetime of stories if you want to call it that but is it as bad and graphic as some have said well to a degree again especially the beginning is to blame for that with the party being as mad as you can imagine there are other scenes that you may find repulsive still there is romance in the air between characters but also between the audience and the movies we get some scenes we may know brad pitts character uses lines from other movies well he delivers them differently a nice tip of the head and like that incident there is much to be discovered be it dialog wise or visual wise like a pregnant woman at the party a lot of nudity and love making and god knows what else well he may be ashamed by what he sees that may be an intended pun right there anyway this is on the right side of wrong and it knows it very well so many goodies to be discovered i can only recommend it so much dont let the run time be an obstacle ps i thought i had written about it but looks like i forgot to give context to my summary headline the movie plays towards the end of the silent era film era that is and with that new beginning of sound in movies well things change some get obsolete some new stars are born and so forth the film has so many things that i could write about things that people surely can do essays about too the question is can you forgive the movie that it has a lot of things that are on the nose hopefully you can because it really is worth as is true with the graphic scenes take it with a grain of salt rather than drugs who wants to live forever indeed a song that would be fitting for this movie too or party forever i guess,POSITIVE,Comedy
161,1.0,7 May 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",i admire damien chazelle for wanting it all he is an ambitious young man whose babylon is nothing short of a doctoral thesis on the pregolden age hollywood era it contains everything from urban legends earlyhollywood depravity privileged critics and last but not least the artists themselves whose stars shine as bright as they are brief it is strange why a director who still has years ahead of him would entangle in such brutal retrospectives perhaps he is responding to the critics who said his la la landa more gentile take on the hollywood machinewas too soft and shallow or perhaps he just wants to be taken more seriously whatever his reasoning is he is struggling to push it to the audience in a manner that would satisfy him you can tell first of all by this movies three hours runtime and then by the insistence on depravity because adrenalineinducing scenes is what he is all about each one of them is stretched and insisted upon to the limit partially it works the depictions of the art of filmmaking are chaotic stressinducing for its participants even lifethreatening these scenes serve to show just how much work goes into making a simple scene and how much can luck influence the final product it almost justifies the characters need for the sodom they indulge themselves in during their many private parties they are means to survival among the many movie people three stand out an emotionally unstable but starstruck young woman a veteran actor whose time is ticking down and a composed mexican immigrant whose intelligence and powers of observation allow him to climb the ladder to the top all these characters rise and fall from grace in different ways but they never unite to a greater whole its almost as if the movie begs to be split into three different ones for each of them the actress nellie laroy another freewheelin performance by margot robbie succumbs to both her own emotional traumas and hollywood addictions the mexican manny torres diego calva despite being as straight of an arrow as possible in that world is dragged down by love but the most powerful story is that of jack conrad brad pitt his story of a hasbeen actor chewed and spit by the hollywood machine sounds like a cliché but pitt plays jack using his own brand of laidback charm and that really made me warm up to the character at one point he has a discussion with the magazine writer elinor st john jean smart who explains to him how this world is bigger than him and that while his time has passed he will live each time a movie with him is played its the singular most powerful moment in an otherwise messy movie a second of poignancy the truth of whichwhile i cannot confirm or denyi can feel its there even today some argue that chazelles depiction on the cruelty of hollywood as an inhuman machine is cynical andonce againshallow while i cant help but feel the same i cannot comment whether he is correct or maybe overdramatizing but i can argue about the ending its a confusing one which attempts to draw some sort of nostalgia but chazelle is simply to young for such a complex and tormenting emotion to truly settle down he thinks it did and i understand at years old i feel it two but i know that is nothing compare to what is to come as ill get older,POSITIVE,Comedy

166,1.0,26 December 2022,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",beautiful costumes set design and a list actors cannot mask the fact that the story writing and directing were bottom tier the movie which had very little substance felt very self congratulatory and self indulgent to its creators a pat on the back for people in entertainment but without creating anything actually worth watching also the movie would just not end even tho there were plenty of opportunities to wrap it up it just kept going and going and going without developing any sort of further resolution or insight the last minutes were painful to sit through not that any of the audience was left we were the last ones in the theater as every other person walked out hours before cannot recommend unless you enjoy punishing yourself,NEGATIVE,Comedy

190,1.0,23 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",damien i like you but this movie is way too long i appreciated a lot about babylon the music is the best thing about it the way that every scene has a melody a specific soundtrack the hypedup almost electroswingy score during the parties the way the music stops and resumes suddenly in transition with the different plots and characters i also loved a lot of the visuals the editing for the most part is very energetic and engaging although it becomes kind of nauseating especially past the h mark the visual aspect is very artificial but well crafted now the performances margot steals the show not necessarily because of the quality of the performance but because of how much exhausting things she had to do this movie is her revenant pitt plays the same character dicaprio plays in once upon a time in hollywood so hes good but kind of unremarkable the main character of the story manny is backed up by a good performance but hes also extremely bland and uninteresting as a protagonist mcguire did pretty good his role was sort of easy to pull off considering how off putting and well done his scenes were all in all the biggest issue in the film is the writing behind it which felt very unmemorable weve all seen like movies about how hollywood is messy and corrupted but also movies are great weve seen movies about parties and cocaine and sex scenes this movie wants to be a movie about hollywoods chaos and evil but also about these three characters and their lives and it ends short for both ideas the characters are underdeveloped their story feels like its been going on too long the pacing of the story that sometimes stops for half an hour on a specific event and then does time skips to tell the tragic decline of these characters is very disorienting and inconsistent and last but not least the ending sort of pissed me off that sequence went on for way too long it was so pretentious and self serving and vane and one of the biggest examples of how tiresome it is to watch hollywood movies that glorify themselves by virtue of being movies it also was extremely inconsistent with the rest of the film it felt like a cheeky attempt to win over a nostalgic audience and to wake people up after a long and boring ending to the boring character stories so yeah its not poorly made but it felt like hours of spectacle and selfaggrandizing hype with no soul and nothing new to say,NEGATIVE,Comedy
191,6.0,24 December 2022,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",the beauty about this movie is it reflects the title its a city that does not exist anymore but laid the groundwork for an empire in the future the acting was phenomenal the cinematography is a out of but the story starts a little bit slower overall even if it was a jarring start and a bit grosser than expected and at first i wasnt fully with it but the way to the truly ramps up to be the type of folklore of success in america and a warning of excess and accomplishing dreams could only exist in america but did mimic the lost names and stories of those that died in old hollywood folks well never truly know and they can truly only exist out west margot robbie as always was amazing as well as the rest of the star studded cast i absolutely recommend this movie for anybody thats a film buff,POSITIVE,Comedy
192,1.0,4 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",written and directed by academy award winner damien chazelle babylon tells hollywoods early days of silent film transition to the world sound era in the late s and the rise and fall of a bunch of individuals struggling to strive working in the industry im very nervous going into this movie since the reviews are a mixed bag so i lowered my expectation and just try to enjoy it it is a pretty tough one to watch especially within the first minutes lots of people said its too much etc but i think it was perfect for the context of the story and a great introduction for the characters also writerdirector damien chazelle wants to give the audience a headsup about whats to come with minutes of runtime this movie wouldve been better if the plot is more focused on the characters considering there are or maybe even five of them manny torres excellently played by diego calva is the only character who has depth you can feel his emotions and tears at the end and his dream of being involved in moviemaking finally comes to fruition but suddenly goes away just because he helped a lover nellie leroy who is an illfated aspiring actress wonderfully portrayed by margot robbie brad pitts jack conrad demise is the most tragic after he discovers a hard truth about how his career has come to an end the main point of the plot is a tale of broken hollywood dreams the production is grand and massive the original score by justin hurwitz is a jazz feast and a total blast my favorite part about this movie also the cinematography by linus sandgren is simply gorgeous babylon is a wild ride and an absolute spectacle that depicts the golden age of hollywood its a hitandmiss at the same time but worth to watch for the experience the ending scene is one of the most unexpected its literally breaks the fourth wall like cinematically this is basically damien chazelle love letter to cinema final rating,POSITIVE,Comedy
193,7.0,24 December 2022,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",likes the acting oscar worthy performances for sure these performances are elevated roles that tackle realistic problems smart takes the sassy nature of designing women but then adds the hostility of the hollywood beast she has one of the best monologues ever and i liked the pr she played diego calva is the man when it comes to my favorite actor of the movie his character evolves the most and he tears into so many characters adapting them to the changing nature of the character and doing it so naturally robbie is a shoe in for award nominations the way she play the starlet so engaging in both physical and mental aspect of the movie she is fluid she is wild and she works the scenes and i love her raw talent in her acting pitt is the same and yet different still playing the caveat role that launches so many things the evolution is less entertaining but this performance seems like a love letter to himself and the actors of old hes very classy and executes well and again has oscar roles must say the chemistry is very dynamic sometimes sharing insanity in the obscure language others being fun and endearing as they celebrate and some so emotionally connected its as if it was real the settingtechnology to make thing come to life im a sucker for bringing us into the moment with sets and costumes and this movie shines costumes alone sell the moment and really tell the times the personality and even the image being crafted they tell a story themselves and that is an art for me ladies and gentlemen the visual props and seeing the evolution of the industry in the set is amazing for a cinephile like myself it too helps sell the emotional material of the movie makeup helps with the passing of time and the emotional distraught that comes with each passing year loved the impressive marks they formed and the life they brought add the feel of the movie and the editing and you really get that set piece that shows how the film industry developed in the tech department solid work in using visuals to immerse and capture the moment of the movie the emotions youll feel something in this movie as the various acts bring a bevy of emotions that will hit many hearts in some form or manner a yearning and infatuation fills one part and is that true love itch that needs to be scratched and the rooting of the heroes who are unlikely others are going to fall into the hardworking story and feeling the frustrations and triumphs of working up the system for the characters that they will have to balance some are going to get lost in the euphoria of watching the movies made feeling like a kid in a comic store watching their moments come to life and reliving the happinessexcitement of the walk through history there will be those who will enjoy the seedier side of things and get caught up in the dramatic personae equipped to handle the harder moments its powerful and a true kiss to the theatrics that proceeded the entertainment industry of hollywood the character development to an extent its a movie that is not only about the parties politics and crafting of movies but several characters that go through the journey of the industry as the times change so do they and seeing the various responses to the times and the challenges really brings a wonderful arc to follow the pressures of the starlet and what is expected of the expectations of the people who run the movie world a legend who does discovering to find out just what he is made of and if he can get face the tide with the success he knows and another is about the newbie coming in and discovering so much in the industry incorporating everyone else in his life perhaps chasing a dream dynamic engaging and artistically crafted to be real and relevant it fits so well in this movie environment and i absolutely find it worthy of the award hype the messages life lessons come in many forms and certainly this movie does the trick with setting up important lessons to make you think metaphors are perfect an elevation of allegory usage to drive the point home seldom using direct lines to deliver it even those are crafted and time beautifully to sell the moment with relevance and engaging characters you will find yourself lost in the moment and have the impact settle hard like me its relevant to much of the story and helps pull it out of the documentary mode instead again smart storytelling the fact that we see culture we see the nature of the beast come in all forms and learn how risky and rewarding it can be the dreams at the start that lure so many in with the promise of paradise but find hardships remain is the perfect introduction to this film soon the chaos of the movies in the past combined with the soirees that followed added the partying atmosphere that was the exciting and humorous realms of entertaining then comes the politics and the darker side providing just how hungry an industry the world is and what many do to just survive in the fleeting nature of fame that element is dramatically classy and again the part that pulls us in and gives us the culture that was common in the past the fact that we get the history of movie making nerds geeks and big fans like me are going to love the first two hours and seeing just how movie filming turned from bloody fields of rough and tumble antics and became the finely tuned studios that shows made famous long ago the struggles the torment the ever changing hands of overactive greed shaped so many lives and you see how each moment drives the next big thing for american cinema this was the biggest highlight and again a solid two hours that pulled so much into the gravitational pull of the film making for a great uniting factor that should also please hollywoods ego dislikes pace i uneven and a bit slow no butts about it the movie has slower parts mainly the third act that felt like slogging through the mud the bouts of character development sometimes gets in the way and leaves us with extra time with little benefit which means boring for this reviewer the extra attempts at elevating things makes for some pretentious presentations and again does little for the common audience no matter how amazing the literary devices are used the languagelazy writing not a fan of ranting and cursing as much as they do in the movie loses the spice of the words and eventually lost the comedic flow even more when the joke runs on and on embarrassing at times then funny predictability so much foreshadowing set up in the first hour easy to figure out the ending the second act places things out too easily that again you get much closer to figuring out what is going to happen the third act essentially reveals everything but takes forever to drop the hammer and show us this again drags the movie out and throws off the pace when you are certain you know what is right and just want the hours to come to an end loses the theme of the first two acts of the movie i mentioned that the first two acts focus so much on making movies and progressing them with the times and how much that ties the movie together by the third act though the drama essentially took over and the film making was lost to the drama and shifts gears majorly to their stories while this is a plus for drama and character closure that loss of the production phase robbed the fun element and with it the magic and wonder of the movies for the usual depression that comes with the dark tale at that point the main drawing point was robbed and i just wanted to go home was not a fan of the last ten or so minutes the last ten minutes are trying to then take the directors vision of what movies seemed to motivate them and cram them in this odd way it tries to end on a positive note but seems to still lose that direction for another semidark though beautiful illustration of the challenges of the times and then kind of goes modern abstract art and flashes for like three minutes this odd display with booming loud sounds that again did little for me but might please those who love symbolism the verdict babylon is artistic as heck and is an oscar quality movie that is loaded with kisses to the industry that made the movie all the references and story building are brilliant in so many levels a true artistic approach to a tale that we know much about the settings the costumes and clothes certainly immerse you into the moment and help you dance through the decades of hollywoods growth yet its not some emotionless shell of a movie but rather holds merit and stakes for characters that are traversing through it as well i loved the movie making elements and that incorporation of so many pieces to give these actors the best world to work in and for great performances to shine in as well however the movie may be a bit too impressed with itself and that leads to the problems i had with the movie the pacing is uneven and the third act takes much of what i love of the movie and tosses about seventyfive percent of it away to amplify other elements relevant and emotionally investing yes but also bloating the movie and leading to an abstract ending lost on fans like me oscars can certainly delight in this movie but i have to say its not my favorite movie for the theaters this year best left for home this movies artistic nature is okay for me and my scores are comedydramahistory movie overall,POSITIVE,Comedy
194,9.0,22 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",pure art this movie is like a famous painting an undeniable work of art however there will always be some bad remark here and there best crowd control seen so far the movie parties the tons of supporting cast propelled this movie to the best hollywood history glamour movie ever made at times you wished you could pause the film midcinema projection and carefully look at all characters shown in the screen all so alive and vivid exactly portrayed like the babylon story the high of fame surpassing any drug available and the inevitable downfall margot and brad depicted this flawlessly oscar for margot here,POSITIVE,Comedy

196,1.0,25 July 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",i could tell from the tv spots promoting this selfindulgent mess that it was just that and the other question after my headline here is why would great film stars like robbie and pitt want to headline any scriptmovie that starts with an elephant shitting on a guy a woman pissing on a naked fat man and on and on with more of this for the next hours its not entertaining at all from start to finish and one scene after another is just more of the same in an endless and predictable jerk off by a director who cares nothing about entertaining a paying audience just the kind of movie that gives hollywood a bad reputation for rewarding the worst of the rich and famous in pursuit of parading their own sick fantasies,NEGATIVE,Comedy
197,7.0,4 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",fourth film from director damien chazelle im not lying when i say that this might be my favorite from him beautiful and crazy love letter to cimema story set in early days of hollywood when transition from silent films to talkies was happening its told mainly from perspective pf three characters up and coming film star filmmaker and already famous actor their rise to fame struggles of keeping up with changing industry and downfalls huge parties and filmmaking in different eras many hilarious moments but also some quite touching ones this film really is wild ride im kinda impressed how this film has almost every possible body fluid in it from tears and sweat to blood and feces quite long film but it never felt boring to me fast paced with every scene being more crazy than another amazing performances from main three diego calva margot robbie and brad pitt and even more impressive and amazing ensemble as supporting cast so many great names really amazing score music in this really made me dance little bit in my cinema seat many times also visually really beautiful film with great cinematography i definitely teared up little bit at the end during that tribute to films and filmmaking i just really loved this film but i kinda understand why some peoples didnt like this,POSITIVE,Comedy
198,1.0,26 December 2022,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",i really like chazelle as a a director he has a unique style and is definitely savvy with the cinematography of a scene where he falls a little flat is telling a story its not that this was a bad story just a bit of the same narrative overall weve seen before pack your patience for the third act he cant leave well alone until hes sure were bludgeoned with his love of cinema all the way i was getting frustrated that he could not arrive at his point the story was getting very long in the tooth and this coming from someone who loves film and filmmaking the first mins i thought was great,POSITIVE,Comedy
199,1.0,31 March 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",this was so terrible i was really hoping for a fun classic set in the debauched golden age of hollywood but this is just ten tons of sadness cliche and pastiche the poor lead actor has his first big break in a film with the top a list actors only to star in a schlock b movie that was given way to much hype and money the wasted budget must have been colossal i can only imagine the artset direction and wardrobe are well done but thats about all the positive one can muster for this epic display of sad sad sad hubris i would only hope to see the directo once in person and let him know i forgive him for birthing this huge elephant turd,NEGATIVE,Comedy

201,1.0,3 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",i was fascinated by this portrayal of early hollywood also known as the roaring twenties it was a time when women were more liberated after they got the vote and were able to dress as they liked and the peak of silent cinema the film opens up with an elephant defecating copiously on a handler while being shoved up a hill in the middle of the desert but this is not for a film set its for one of the wildest parties ive ever seen put on film i at first thought were people really that crazy and out there in hollywood at that time then it cuts to the next day at work when things are just as chaotic exhilarating and dangerous as the party they all attended in the secluded mansion play hard work hard its insane the way they used to make silent movies it was also more egalitarian as there were more female directors present and more overt sexuality this is all before the hays code and the talkies once the talkies came and made more money the fat cats took over cast the women out of positions of power and controlled every aspect of the buisness including the actors personal lives but also in the case of some of the characters in the film the immense drug taking gambling and inability to transition to sound took a massive toll on their lives and were unable to move on ive never seen singing in the rain which is a similar story to this film only far tamer and wellbehaved which was not exactly the case in real life though im not sure it was quite on the level of debauchery as seen in this film overall though it missed its mark in a few places its a fascinating film to witness and i recommend it,POSITIVE,Comedy
202,8.0,4 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",from somebody who really loves cinema i have to say that this is definitely one of the best movies ive seen in a very long time not only does it capture the attention of the viewer but its a dramatic tale of debauchery and a tale of the rise and fall of movie stars in the era of its setting its sad funny and dramatic all at the same time i personally think that the movie was amazing margot robbie and brad pitt did a fantastic job for the people that did not enjoy this movie i can understand why they did not it does seem overdramatized at some spots but almost every movie you see whether that be fiction or nonfiction thats how it is movies are meant to be dramatized versions of life yes there are movies that are true to the fact and theres nothing dramatized about it but movies are meant to be seen as an escape from reality and this movie truly was that a dramatized version of what its like to be living in los angeles between the s and s in the film industry and it showcased what it was like to transition from silent movies to talkie movie in such a interesting way that i was hooked from the moment the movie started there are some people who will see this movie as a overzealous representation of hollywood but i think that if you let yourself truly escape into the movie that you will be entertained by the acting direction and story that is presented if you love cinema andor movies or stories theres no way you cant at least somewhat be entertained by this film,POSITIVE,Comedy
203,6.0,4 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",there were only good things about the movie which doesnt make it a complete package first was the acting margot robbie and brad pitt did good and other actors were also good the presentation of some scenes was nice and entertaining for sure the music in the movie by justin hurwitz was nicely done he made sure the whole soundtrack was done justice to the actor playing the trumpet acted very well in the movie now all of this isnt enough at all when the storyplot is so weak simple and predictable many scenes were unnecessarily dragged and prolonged then a lot of filler content was there in the movie which extended the length of the movie unnecessarily nudity was way to excessive and unnecessary at some points it couldve been done moderately when the story is not solid and simple plus too much dragged out scenes to make it longer than needed makes the movies technically quite bad i saw a lot of people wanting the movie to finish already and saw a certain quantity of people leaving the cinema before the movie was even finished,NEGATIVE,Comedy
204,1.0,1 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",so glad i decided to ignore the lukewarm feedback and watched this movie i loved his first two films and was looking forward to this project but the trailer did turn me off the movie is not perfect but it almost earns its hour runtime i saw avatar a week back which is almost just as long and felt way more bored there because even though visuals are great everything else was flat not here the movie was so chaotic and honest and truly went all the way there and didnt hold back music cinematography acting direction set design production costumes all were great the ending was really moving and reaffirming and ive loved all his movie endings im so glad we have this original work that dares to go places where others wont,POSITIVE,Comedy
205,9.0,11 June 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",i had read this was a poignant look at the problems movie makers and stars experienced transitioning from silents to the sound era what i watched was a totally unconvincing rendering of the s and s and a total wast of time from costumes to hairdos to dialogue the filmmakers could not get out of the present time from the total debauch of a party that opens the film to the sequence showing the technical difficulties the new should technology caused the movie crew and actors each scene just fell flat truly one of the worst films i have ever seen a waste of a good premise and of the assembled talent,NEGATIVE,Comedy
206,7.0,20 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",watching this in a wartime kharkiv ukraine hoping there wont be any air raids i had a real good time babylon has a feel of a good old comfortable story you can dive in and forget yourself for a moment and i really appreciate this since in the past months only really good films could create this veil of comfort and distraction for me it also remind of the multiple memoirs of hollywood stars of the s the earnest and direct look at the viewer from the other side of the screen is quite visual and what is particularly interesting sidestories some that we never get to fully see still captivate and are good enough for us to feel that these stories matter,POSITIVE,Comedy
207,1.0,6 August 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",an actor who is a star from the silent era a helper who does lot of odd jobs and ants to make it big in the movies and a wanabe star who fakes she is a star till she becomes one the silent movie era ends and the sound erra starts how everyone copes with it there are lots of characters and sequences the start is superb with lots of energy and colours unfortunately the movie is too long and it becomes boring after a point some scenes do not fit the flow and seem to have been added just for the heck of it margot robbie is the star here and does a splendid job specially in some of the earlier scenes diego calva is good and brings lots of sincereity to his role the music score is excellent beware of the last hour,POSITIVE,Comedy
208,9.0,14 September 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",quickly became a snoozefest oh my god it just goes on and on and on some hour movies feel short but this one feels like it went for hours and you have to force yourself to watch it clockwork orange style one thing that bothered me was they kept messing up the camera focus too brad pitt has his moments as well as margot and the others hit a bright spot here and there but the movie is more like a tv show season condensed into hours wish id turned it off halfway and id actually have given it a much better score i dont understand how these directors with million and brad pitt and margot robbie can make a boring movie,NEGATIVE,Comedy
209,7.0,31 December 2022,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",the negative box office reportage on this film is toxic bs who cares about whos seen the movie in the meager seven days its been out instead lets talk about how damn entertaining this feast for the eyes and cinema lovers soul this is the cast is excellent the scenery sumptuous the music soul rattling the direction innovative and the entertainment factor off the charts give this movie time itll earn its right and good reputation i mean if i have any nitpicks its that the final film left out some scenes from the script i read in that added good stakes to the story for example in the original script the clara bowinspired character robie slept with manny the night they met this kind of bonded them more intensely than whats in the film also there were many more suicides that resulted from the end of the silent era including the female director and this added more pathos to the ending but the script is the script and the movie is the movie and what a movie it is,POSITIVE,Comedy
210,4.0,27 March 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",a horrible beautiful overdone amazing indulgent film that is just a good edit away from being a great movie the most gross parts cheapen it and the last minutes need to be cut out completely should have won for production design and costume margot robbie gives the best actress performance of the year and should have at least garnered a nomination the length is almost intolerable but unlike several of the movies that received best picture noms this year i couldnt tear myself away its the best and worst of hollywood then and now prepare yourself and dont let the kids watch it should be reedited and rereleased,NEGATIVE,Comedy
211,1.0,4 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",loved this one this was a really good and well executed movie in my opinion great story and a really talented and amazing cast the movie was amazing had a few good laughs and it was awesome in the theaters cant wait to get this on when it comes out to k physical copy so i can rewatch it whenever i mean the cast was just amazing you have margot robbie she was great also brad pitt so talented and thats not even all you got toby maguire and olivia wilde lukas haas ethan suplee some people i really like and also diego calva was great id recommend you to watch this movie it was a great time and i really liked it,POSITIVE,Comedy
212,6.0,9 May 2024,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",i consider myself a fan of writerdirector damien chazelle if not viewing him as one of my alltime favorites whiplash is among my top favorite movies of all time la la land is another favorite of mine i still adore after countless viewings and while first man was slightly disappointing it still had a lot of great elements to appreciate still need his debut film guy and madeline on a park bench to be available on a streaming service or physical media here in taiwan apart from the common theme of hardships during the pursuit of dreams which always resonates with me deeply another characteristic of chazelles films that appeals to me is how his movies always impresses the most during the ending despite the polarizing reception of the film i was still interested in seeing babylon apart from my love for damien chazelle as a director i was also hooked by the premise being about the transition of hollywood from silent films to sound films aka talkies singin in the rain which depicts the same time period is one of my alltime favorite movies after finally seeing babylon for myself while it wasnt as great as i hoped at the same time i found it to be better than reputed and dont think it deserves the overwhelming lambasting it got its technical aspects are done so well that even if the film didnt do much for me it would still get no lower than a and legit effort will be made to recognize its positive aspects rather than focusing on its missteps and overlooking what it did right as for how babylon ranks among damien chazelles previous films i liked it slightly more than first man without finding babylon on par with the excellence of la la land or whiplash in terms of releases it is nowhere close of deserving to be called one of the worst films of while also falling short of being one of the best as for how it compares to the other two cinema love letter films with steven spielbergs the fabelmans or sam mendes empire of light babylon may be nowhere close to reaching the brilliance of the fabelmans due to its frequent missteps but chazelle did manage to capture the magic of cinema fairly better than mendes did with empire of light its not hard to see why babylon has divided critics and audiences and hasnt clicked with many with one common aspect subject to criticism being towards the graphic content including the nudity drug use and grossout humor the opening scene in particular gives off a pretty bad first impression of what the film is actually about which may rub off viewers the wrong way myself included i understand that damien chazelle was trying to use the graphic content in this film to highlight the glamor and excess in s hollywood but i personally would have preferred to start off the film with something related to cinema history to set up the main story instead of beginning with a lowbrow joke that doesnt contribute to the main theme of the film a little rearranging of scenes would have certainly helped probably by starting the film with a plot point near the end instead many have raised complaints towards the massive threehour runtime of babylon and while i personally wasnt bothered by the length i can still see where the complaints are coming from the film did manage to keep my attention throughout the majority of the film but there were certain parts where i wished the movie would move on towards the next scene particularly during the wild and reckless party scenes where i wanted the film to focus back on the filmmaking aspect of the story the snakewrestling scene in particular i found quite cringy to watch even if the outcome of the scene did bring up an interesting issue that was left underexplored not helping the issue was the overstuffed plot with so many subplots that not all of them were developed properly while the script also had some interesting themes that were briefly brought up but undercooked by the end treatment of ethnic minorities toxic working environments during earlyday hollywood or cutting off ties with workers following personal controversies with a huge cast of main characters not all of them were able to be developed fully even with the massive threehour runtime li jun lis character seemed like she was going to be built up towards something significant by the end but she was sidelined for a majority of the second half of the film and had little to do during the conclusion overlords jovan adepos character as an africanamerican trumpet player ran through a major obstacle that provided an interesting highlight towards the treatment of ethnic minorities in earlyday hollywood but i found the issue too neatly wrapped up by the end without the necessary conflictsolving to make it feel like a satisfying resolution if not to the extent of being completely forgotten about by the end like li jun lis character was which is quite a shame as adepos character had the arc i was secondmost emotionally invested in behind diego calvas and wanted more development for adepo my last complaint towards babylon has nothing to do with the film itself and is more about the abysmal marketing strategy that may probably led to audiences having wrong expectations going into the movie and likely contributed to babylon becoming such a big boxoffice flop the trailers were overly vague in getting out the idea of what the film was about and just marketed it as a wolf of wall streetstyle wild partying flick when it was actually about hollywoods transition from the silent era of films to talkies and the rise and fall of stars during that era however while babylon had many problems there were also so many other aspects done exceptionally well with the first thing i want to praise about being the music score i have loved composer justin hurwitzs compositions for chazelles previous films and listened to them multiple times so its no surprise that his latest collaboration with chazelle in babylon didnt disappoint me either the catchy voodoo mama theme has been stuck in my head ever since i heard it the opening track welcome captures the wild glamor of the time period depicted and the more tender musical cue for manny and nellie is also memorable while recalling mia and sebastians theme from la la land at the same time also by hurwitz when it comes to the oscar nominations that year the award i was most rooting for babylon was best original score and i still listen to the babylon music score on spotify all the time even if it ultimately lost the oscar linus sandgren damien chazelles goto cinematographer since la la land delivers yet another winner of camera work with babylon i love the way he moves the camera through scenes with a breathtaking unbroken shot moving through the opening party done in one take sticking out the most in my mind with another sequence where the camera moves swiftly as it follows multiple films in production simultaneously impressing as well while also reminding me a lot of the notshotbysandgren whiplash curiously regardless of whether their characters were fully fleshed out or not the performances from the actors were strong across the board in terms of the two leads who get top billing brad pitt and margot robbie are solid but have been better in other films the real standout in babylon is diego calva as manny who is a great pointofview character to follow through this journey of changing times throughout hollywood i love mannys viewpoint towards what makes cinema special to audiences along with his unconditional kindness towards robbies character even with her being a complete mess as both a person and a public figure jean smart is another highlight of a role as a gossip columnist who follows careers of actors and she has a monologue near the middle of the film about the nature and lasting legacy of cinema that resonated with me on the same level as anton egos monologue at the end of ratatouille jovan adepo may have been underutilized but i still loved both his performance and the character arc while eric roberts also had a short but amusing role and im glad to see roberts in another proper movie instead of stuck in the zgrade syfythe asylum dreck he has been constantly stuck in recent years tobey maguire makes the most out of his limited screentime during the last portion of the film as well and i never expected to see him as such a shady and creepy character the story deals with a lot of ambitious themes present in the entertainment industry many of which i was able to get behind since i followed news in the entertainment industry and therefore understood what issues the film was trying to shine a light towards while not every aspect of the story is successful in its execution when babylon hits the mark it really hit hard the most welldeveloped theme throughout babylon is its homage towards the evolution of cinema throughout the years and the legacy of film continuing to resonate with generations of new viewers to which damien chazelles love and appreciation towards the art form shines throughout most notably during the previously mentioned monologue from jean smart and the ending ill get to later my interest and knowledge towards film history also admittedly helped me better get into the story the aspect of damien chazelles previous films that leave the deepest impression on me are always the endings and babylon is no exception i love the ending for babylon mainly for how it wraps up a certain character and how it pays tribute to cinema history in general which is the best way i could put it without spoiling anything overall had some major issues but still found a lot to like appreciate while also admitting that it wont be for all tastes i found myself enjoying babylon more often than i hated it therefore my score stands at a,POSITIVE,Comedy

239,1.0,22 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",i dont understand why this film was made i think its supposed to be a comedy but there is nothing funny about this this makes spielbergs look like lawrence of arabia ironically its a film about the excess of old hollywood but this film itself is drugged out excess it has to go down as one of the worst movies ever made every scene made me dizzy with so many characters crammed in to the frame and shot with cameras that move chaotically it made me nauseous there is zero plot there is zero character development during a time of severe economic hardship this film feels like a crime so much money and so much talent went into this it feels like its purposefully insulting the audience,NEGATIVE,Comedy
240,7.0,27 June 2024,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",babylon is not simply a movie about the love of cinematography it is in fact cinematography itself every scene every frame is imbued with love in cinema for some movie lovers it might seem a bit boring and tedious due to a great amount of long scenes but not for me it kept me on the edge of my seat from the very start to the very end there is meaning in each detail you notice on the screen this meaning is deeper than one can imagine there is drama and comedy mixed with action and elements of horror for an actor the very idea of being thrown away like garbage is inappropriate being needed being needed being a part of something important is what most actors are looking for to keep the bread on the table knowing that theres always going to be someone better hurts knowing that you will be replaced and forgotten hurts knowing that no matter how much impact you made in this area it will never be enough not everyone can accept this harsh reality and not everyone is strong and resilient enough to adapt and compete for me its another masterpiece by damien chazelle who became my favorite director after releasing la la land,POSITIVE,Comedy
241,1.0,17 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",i think this movie is a prime example of why editing is so important in film the editing and story of this filmed turned what could have been an insightful and comedic look at the prehays code era of cinema into a debacle with the pacing of a skit comedy show while this movie had great set and costume design interesting camera movement although sometimes a bit aggressive and pretty good acting the narrative structure was chaotic and the whole thing felt like a bloated mess with no direction this film was a weird mix of ruben ostlandesque class satire old hollywood musicals a dw griffith style grandiose production and college party movies i honestly think that damien chazelle picked a few old hollywood themes and stories like the influence of african american music at the onset of the talkies the difficulty of transitioning for a few actors at the dawn of audio in movies and the hollywood american dream that turns out to be a mirage and lumped them all together through a vignette of scenes that sometimes drew on for far too long this all sounds harsh the movie was enjoyable and sometimes easy to watch it just took over hours to tell a minute story old hollywood was fun but a facade the chaos and excess looks appealing from the outside but it will chew you up and spit you out and no one will bat an eye we get it could have been an with better editing,NEGATIVE,Comedy
242,9.0,20 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",from the wunderkind behind whiplash la la land first man comes a bold brash brazen story of outsized ambition outrageous excess set during the era of unbridled decadence depravity in early hollywood babylon chronicles the rise fall of multiple characters during the film industrys transition from silent films to talkies and is undoubtedly the most divisive film of the year written directed by damien chazelle the film brims with as much cinematic ingenuity as it is smeared with the loud chaotic almost overwhelming energy the prodigal talent here swings for the fences with nothing held back and is also unrelenting in his pursuit but not everyone will vibe with the films unrestrained aura however in between its manic episodes of debauchery there is an emotional core that grounds it the wild extravagant glamorous bits do evoke the unabashed freewheeling spirit of s hollywood but its also overdone to the point where it leaves you numb the film aptly captures the agony pains frustration of moving from silent to sound films and the victims the overhaul created in its wake margot robbie brad pitt diego calva shine in their respective roles while justin hurwitz yet again delivers a winning score overall babylon is a provocative polarising piece that both honours critiques its industry by showcasing the alluring hideous sides of moviemaking business and is at its finest during the soft tender quieter moments amidst all the deranged bits and though the reckless execution excessive runtime final sequence didnt work for me the technical bravura on display and the unhinged performances from the cast makes it at least worth a shot,POSITIVE,Comedy
243,8.0,26 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",this is one of the most entertaining and satisfying three hours i have spent in years its spectacular its funny its sad its moving its fascinating its poignant its exuberant its subtle its sophisticated its vulgar the basic plot of this film is essentially singin in the rain how the change from silent movies to talkies changed the business and created winners and losers there are even some lines directly taken from that film but babylon delves much deeper in to the characters of these winners and losers it is important to remember the connection between these two movies otherwise the fantastic final ten minutes wont make much sense that fabulous fantasylike ending is absolutely perfect for this film it flips all the negatives and all the sadness on its head creating an optimistic explosion of celebration without giving anything away years later a character watches singin in the rain and realizes that people have remembered them after all that they have made a difference and that some people have almost achieved immortality who will enjoy this anyone who has ever read any celebrity story in any magazine or website this is the ultimate glossy celebrity gossip big reveal ostensibly it first seems a little superficial style without substance but then you find out who these people really are what makes them tick and then youre hooked unlike with the recent netflix film mank about the s hollywood writer herman mankiewicz unless you knew who mankiewicz mayer and thalberg were you wouldnt have clue what was going on babylon set around that same time requires no background knowledge at all its a simple story about three people in the movie industry two trying to work their way up the greasy pole one sliding down who will enjoy this anyone who does know who mankiewicz mayer and thalberg were this could have been made for those of us who love watching motion pictures from the early thirties if youre thinking that s what price hollywood is more similar to this than singin in the rain is or have even watched what price hollywood then this is definitely your sort of movie if thats you then you will recognize on whom all these characters are based you will know the stories heard the anecdotes the scandals and will love being whisked back to the late twentiesearly thirties although it doesnt seem historical to me i suppose it is and the problem with historical films is that the characters have to be relatable to our modern selves they cant have the attitudes and opinions of the people actually from that time as they would seem too weird for us to be able to sympathise with they are therefore st century people in s clothes a necessity but it doesnt hurt this picture what is sadly lacking however is the fasttalking wisecracking slang which was one of the great things about american movies of the early thirties especially at warner brothers where james cagney and joan blondell were going at it ten to the dozen without that this doesnt seem as authentic or should that be this just dont seem on the level the st century script however is very very funny who will enjoy this anyone who would like to see margot robbie for three hours looking incredibly hot other than having an unbreakable appointment with the grim reaper i cannot think of any other reason why anyone of sound body and mind would not want to gaze at margot robbie for three hours wearing some of the sexist outfits ever seen on this planet margot robbie of course wouldnt be where she is today if she were just a pretty face and her acting in this picture is absolutely outstanding in making nellie leroy someone you will honestly care personally about her portrayal reminded me slightly of béatrice dalle in betty blue inasmuch that all we can see or are allowed to see at first is the alluring sexy image that she projects of herself until she allows us to glimpse her real self whom she has locked up deep inside her own personal dungeon in her mind nellie leroys journey is not a fraction as dark as bettys but margot robbie still manages to reveal a subtle and restrained sensitivity behind all that noise our own journey with margot robbie in this story isnt just how we see her change throughout the story it makes us examine our own perceptions and attitudes we have made of nellie and makes us realize that these perceptions can be so easily manipulated and mouldedand she looks incredibly hot are there any negatives just one its too long it should not be three hours long theres at least one subplot too many but thats the problem when you write direct and edit your own film none of my precious film gets left on the cutting room floor damien chazelle has tried to squeeze too much into his film and after three hours your brain starts to overload a little so that however effective mr chazelle is at prodding and poking at your emotions hes not entirely successful although he creates very real and completely believable characters theres a little too much to take in so even after three hours they have still not become your friends you will definitely feel that you know them and you will really like them but not quite enough to shed any tears over,POSITIVE,Comedy

great bacchanal that was hollywood having as a common thread manny torres a young mexican who fights to reach the highest levels and leave his mark in cinema one ridiculous and absurd situation after another adds to the highspeed fun the film successfully brought together famous stars and earned a moderate gross at the box office being panned by a lot of critics despite good and some hilarious intentions the film takes itself too seriously as a tribute to film pioneers but with damien chazelles wistful nostalgia partially lacking in perspective this uneven reenactment becomes entirely a work of times past theres certainly enough wit rhythm or verve to suggest its alive there are fun sketches and cute sets about the silent filming with a series of anecdotes highlighting the mistakes failures and upheavals however in some scenes several actors are completely exposed mugging in a clumsy and charming manner throughout all its outlandish incidents this wacky dramacomedy about early silent films rarely manages to elicit laughs filmmaker damien chazelles pacing seems a mistake at times and his actors could be acceptable when trying to record real roles there are acceptable actors paying silent film clichés and especially paying homage to singin in the rain and other films and the main roles are based on real people margot robbie as nellie to be based on clara bow the original

260,6.0,8 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",it seems that babylon has sparked some debate online it is being hailed as both a masterpiece by some and complete self indulgent trash by others i try to not let the chatter influence my desire to see or what i think about a film bit i knew i was in for an experience to be honest i got almost exactly what i thought i would get it is a hour and minute celebration of debauchery and filmmaking but it is not as daring and original as many might think damien chazelle is a very talented director and has an energetic style but he cant overcome his self indulgent script that seems to want to say many things and actually says nothing the film is set in and follows a group of characters through the end of the silent film era to the transition to talkies the best scenes in the film deal with how silent films were producesld and some with the difficulties in filming films with sound in the infancy of the format there truly is no main character but the character we follow most is nellie larpy played by margot robbie she is a wild aspiring actress that becomes the hollywood it girl there is manny played by diego calva that plays a film assistant that wants to grow within the film industry and brad pitt plays john conrad a big silent film star that is having problems transitioning to films with sound the film focuses very much on the lavish and wild parties of the day which are pretty much mass orgies all of this is done with great cinematography and set design and there is an emphasis on being as raunchy as possible but the film isnt really as daring in its presentation this its been done before the film is really long and though not boring it does get tedious in is outrageousness there is a switch in tone in the last couple ofi utes that is so unearned that it feels like its from a completely different film the film wants to put a mirror to hollywood with its excess but its been done before as good as the film is made and acted it just has nothing new to say that hasnt been said before about hollywood and filmmaking it is beautiful to look at and certainly not boring but there is nothing that hadnt been said before grade c,POSITIVE,Comedy
261,2.0,6 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",the film perfectly recreates the entire history of cinema in hollywood for over years always putting in context albeit subtly important features and characteristics of each era what i was able to capture in this first time seeing it was history in cars with the first diesel mercedes racism movie legends in their respective era charles chaplin marilyn monroe etc in the film we can see the story and the process of principal characters in their artistic careers and in their personal lives each and everyone of them with a different context we have a man a woman an africanamerican a latino and an asian this makes the movie great it shows the story behind this characters and how their lives and carrers despite working in the same industry was very different the ending of the film that brings to life a small tribute to the entire history of cinema including more recent films is something perfectly accomplished great great movie,POSITIVE,Comedy

264,7.0,28 December 2022,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",bear with me here this might be tough to explain director damian chazelle is a conundrum he directed a film about hollywoods excesses in the twenties and thirties and in doing so he created babylon a film containing many scenes that themselves suffer from excesses sewagepipe parties hollywood orgies filmed battles snake battles ratdigesting women wrestling bodily eliminations and more much more some but not all of these scenes actually do work they are if nothing else eye candy but none of them work for the excessive amount of screen time and likely production time devoted to them i wanted to holler ok enough i got it an example is a relatively sedate scene during which margot robbies aspiring filmstar character has to repeat her lines again and again and then again and once more or twice the point assuming there was one was made after the fourth or fifth attempt but no on we go and even when the scene is finally shot and the director says cut still there is more in babylon more is always more my sense is that a two hour version of this three hour film with those excesses trimmed might have been a real winner there are moments when the film presents the story in a more deeply personal way and in those scenes the storys poignancy gets across a quiet conversation between failing movie star jack morgan brad pitt and a gossip columnist jean smart another between toby mcguire as a hollywood hoodlum and diego calva playing manni torres the films hero if nothing else these scenes demonstrate the talent of director chazelle now for a personal gripe the films music its its all wrong the late twenties and early thirties was a time of distinctive music a jazz which when heard brings one back to that era even those who never lived through it think of the warner brothers musicals of that era gold diggers forty second street but babylon in its party scenes and there are plenty the music provided by live musicians is nothing like that eras in fact the music has a tribal beat an african sort of hysteria now i could imagine this at one of the parties but at all of them why what was chazelles idea the story itself is relatively simple weve got two main characters margot robbies who is hopefully on her way up and brad pitts whose best days are behind him pitt commands the screen he is as true a movie star here as was the character he played supposedly john gilbert margot robbie as a clara bow movie type is a powerful presence but i found her character hard to hold onto perhaps it was her diction it seemed to change at various times over the films course diego calva as our hero manni is dynamic when he has to be and lovingly soft when he can afford to be perhaps here is a starmaking performance so six stars out of ten a bit on the generous side but a lot of work went into this film this babylon its the least i could do,POSITIVE,Comedy
265,9.0,28 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",first of all a want to say that i agree babylon is vulgar and debaucherous and thats exactly why it is so good in my opinion people need to keep in mind that s hollywood was crazy with minimum restrictions as it is portayed in the movie but its not only about that its about the people who actually dont want that but who instead want something to be remembered for as we follow jack conrad nellie laroy and manny torres as well as sydney palmer babylon tells a thrilling and amazing story about excess glory relations and the meaning of movies as the people in it want to be babylon is a movie for the ages in my opinion with an unforgetable score brilliant acting performances exceptional cinematography and epic screenplay this movie blew my mind i smiled as i walked out of the theater and i hope youll do to,POSITIVE,Comedy

267,8.0,18 March 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",babylon is an extremely passionate love letter to old hollywood creatives but its practically incoherent sometimes the first major section of the story stands above the rest and i can only imagine this is because editors took a closer eye to the opening of the movie and quality assurance kinda fell off as it went the core premise of the three protagonists at different points of moving through hollywood life is fascinating but it often hyperfixates on unnecessary aspects of that life or just goes on insane tangents about even more characters tobey maguires scenes the opening and the ending seem like the feeling of decadent insanity the film wanted and i just want it to find a way to stick to it and remain watchable babylon deserves to be remade into a more effective story by cutting minutes and reediting some scenes because as is all thats really holding it up is the undeniable love the cast and crew has for the people and time its depicting,NEGATIVE,Comedy
268,2.0,8 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",i remember hearing things about babylon long before it came out that made it sound amazing a threehour epic with a fantastic cast about an interesting period in hollywood history and writtendirected by damien chazelle it sounded too good to be true and when the critical reception ended up mixed i feared it might be turns out im an idiot but so are the critics because babylon is brilliant theres nothing better than a hour movie that flies by and doesnt feel like it wastes any time at all and i can say that about babylon it constantly finds ways to top itself and continue pushing boundaries every scene is entertaining and adds something its all just filled to the brim with style fun tension and heartbreak its overflowing with emotions and all of them hit i think i felt everything chazelle wanted the audience to feel at every individual moment it all builds to another fantastic ending for the director the guy knows how to end a film and how such a dark and disgusting movie can conclude with something so sentimental and so ridiculous sounding on paper is remarkable it borrows heavily from cinema paradisos climax the same way babylons entire structure borrows heavily from boogie nights but it borrows things well and ends up being selfaware about how its recycling tropes motifs and movies in general and on top of that it successfully argues that thats okay brilliantly justifying its selfindulgence and excesses through the closing scenes i cant say enough good things about babylon if im allowed one more hyperbolic statement it would be that this the music score is one of the best ever written for a movie im serious its truly one of the greatest ive ever heard and feels instantly iconic and memorable the movies a masterpiece i think time will be kind to it and that much of the criticism thrown at it is ridiculous i fear theyre not going to give chazelle a budget like this again its underperformed apparently but at least weve seen what he can do with such immense resources at his disposal make one of the greatest movies of the s so far,POSITIVE,Comedy
269,1.0,3 April 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",with some judicious editing this could have been a really good movie when focusing on the bizarre graphic violence and bodily functions nothing was added to the veracity or entertainment value of the story it just seemed to amplify the sometimes depressing mood of the story line the run time wasnt annoying in itself but the unnecessary content was maybe some elements of the movie about hollywood have been told many times before but they could be presented differently with this cast and production the core cast members presented interesting characters from pitt to robbie to li calva and smart undoubtedly the music of the picture was one of the strongest elements in the final scene chazelle demonstrated the filmmaking excellence that is capable of unfortunately this level was not maintained for a significant portion of the picture,NEGATIVE,Comedy

271,9.0,21 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",i approached my viewing of babylon with mixed feelings given the wildly differing opinions about it as it turns out it was exceptional the ancient city of babylon was known for its opulence and decadence and the film is an apt reflection of its namesake babylon the movie tells a captivatingly gripping story of ambition excess and depravity in hollywood during the transition from silent films to sound films the characters are fleshed out incredibly well you understand their motivations for acting the way they do and you root for them even as they make poor decisions the cinematography is superb with a focus on glamour and opulence the soundtrack is fittingly decadent and jazzinfluenced adding to the atmosphere of the film margot robbie who plays nellie laroy the lead character delivers an excellent performance she perfectly captures the contradictions of nellies ambition and insecurity as she makes her way through a world of characters who are out to capitalise on her talents brad pitt portraying jack conrad is also particularly good his portrayal of a morally bankrupt yet charismatic figure is spot on rather than being actual historical figures nellie laroy and jack conrad are fictional composite characters and serve as allegorical figures to illustrate the excesses of hollywood during this era the director damien chazelle brings the story to life with an expertly crafted script and powerful performances he clearly loves cinema but is brutally honest in his portrayal of the ruthlessness and decadence of hollywood he artfully juxtaposes ambition and excess with morality and integrity its a captivating tale that helps us to understand how the movies of old were made and why they still have such a lasting impact i can understand why some people hate the movie and even walk out the opening scene is an overthetop party that is one big orgy of gluttony sex gross behaviour drugs and excess and it goes on for an extended period before the main title of the movie comes on screen but once you get past this it becomes obvious that this scene is a microcosm of what babylon is about and it sets the tone for the rest of the movie which settles into a fascinating story of ambition excess and morality for those who stick with it to the end theres a great payoff this is a wartsandall no punches pulled exploration of a very dark hollywood in the late s and s its a story that is at once engrossing and thoughtprovoking,POSITIVE,Comedy
272,6.0,7 May 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",well it wasnt boring at times i hated it at times i loved it and this seems to be the consensus amongst most it is a large epic ambitious movie it is deeply deeply flawed crass and at times the screenplay is achingly poor and immature there are few redeeming characters and a few are basically tropes yet i cant get this film out of my head its grand scale and pacing is unlike anything you have seen recently and all the actors put in committed impressive performances the film is full of intention anachronisms the characters speak as if the year is and there is a scene of an elephant defecating all over a character this occurs in the opening sequence truly a wild ride and i expect that this film will be reassessed critically over time,POSITIVE,Comedy
273,9.0,3 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",its pretty much everything good and bad you can imagine about hollywood as damien chazelle said this film is his love letter to the movies or may i add to the film lovers and a hate one to the very industry the remarkable scores throughout the entire thing kept reminding me of la la land which it surely should they did their jobs create the unsettled suspenseful and rather gripping feelings in most of the sequences in some scenes the jazz straightup gave me glimpses of the directors awardwinning film these might as well be my favorite aspect of this piece of art the casts are just phenomenal i meant how are you going to make a movie about the s or s hollywood if youre not going to star brad pitt the old guy just did it again his character was without a doubt lovable and unexpectedly piteous now for margot i believe she really just went all in for this one hers and the memorable performance of her partner diego calva whom ive seen on the screen for the first time were what kept me invested throughout the middle and near the end of the film after all this is most likely that one lovely part of babylon in conclusion even though i myself very much love this movie i believe its not going to be an easy watch but if you consider yourself a film lover you should go watch it you might hate it and that isnt going to make you any less of a cinephile or you can love it you know just like anything else,POSITIVE,Comedy

276,1.0,7 March 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",if theres one thing in common with damien chazelles films its how they center on the sacrifices people endure to pursue their dreams whiplash focused on the physical limits someone might endure to become a successful drummer la la land highlighted how relationships and careers might need to take a second seat to pursuing a dream first man showed how a family might suffer to pursue something greater following this trend babylon gives light to the inability of some who have attained their dreamsometimes at great personal costto keep it in an everchanging world i can succinctly state the problem with babylon as i didnt need to see that clocking in at over three hours long there were plenty of storylines that could have been cut for instance weve already seen brad pitts story of a famed silent film star struggling to find relevance in the talkies through the best picture the artist in fact the whole of babylon comes off as a gritty remake of singin in the rain additionally within the first five minutes theres elephant defecation and a woman urinating on a manand this is well before margot robbie has projectile vomiting later in the film its tragic that babylon could have been better there are significant moments that worked really well and highlighted the differences and difficulties working with sound theres also excellent subtext about making it in this era of hollywood through hard work if youre nonwhite or just plain luck if youre white topping everything off is the earwormworthy score by justin hurwitz which should win all the awards it deserves i wanted to like babylon more but theres only so much that can recommend it without having to also suggest fastforwarding through other bits a bloated if not occasionally poignant look at the hollywood transition to talkies i give babylon stars out of,POSITIVE,Comedy

289,9.0,3 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",as a nonamerican who grew up mostly watching american movies and dreaming of someday being a big shot in hollywood which never happened and at this point never will i can completely understand damien chazelles nostalgiadriven love letter to the cinema of old a sobering view of all the things we lost in todays american cinema politically correct franchisebased boring predictable multiplatform content they just dont make them as they used to except for this one an unapologetic threehour epic with lavish exuberant and daring visuals clearly influenced by robert altman constructed of several smaller storylines intermingled to create a story of a place instead of an individual and featuring a group of wellwritten characters damien chazelle looks at hollywood of old in a respectful but sobering view hes not shying away from racism privilege or the way hollywood cannibalizes its tragedies for profit but even when showing hollywood at its worst the movie is filled with pure love for cinema and the people behind it if anything the movie ends with a pretty optimistic view that cinema will survive and thrive despite hollywood dying like quintin tarantino before him once upon a time in hollywood its clear damien chazelle notices hollywood coming downfall and babylon is his loving wellcrafted requiem,POSITIVE,Comedy
290,7.0,15 August 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",the rating for this one is on mark babylon is a very good movie that shoots for greatness and comes pretty close the first hour is intense it was a relief when the pace slowed down many of the characters are based on real life individuals and incidents from hollywood in the s ie fatty arbucklevirginia rappe and a few folks are named ie irving thalberg and william randolph hearst things were so out of hand at the time censorship was enacted there are characters you will have empathy for some you might love and those you will hate one in particular you may grow to despise its worth the watch even at hours,POSITIVE,Comedy
291,7.0,16 June 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",i saw babylon and to my surprise it is not as bad as some say perhaps because i am a frustrated filmmaker i immediately connected with the plot covering the transition from silent to talkies in hollywood in the s the film written and directed by damien chazelle presents the rise of three hollywood celebrities john conrad brad pitt nellie laroy margot robbie and manny torres diego calva among others and how pressure and excesses destroy them while watching the movie i felt like i was at a party where liquor drugs and lust reign so it maintains a fast pace that doesnt get boring however sometimes it tries to cover too much by cutting from one story to another and one gets lost and takes several seconds to reconnect with the plot for me margot robbie steals the movie in every scene that comes out as she did in the first suicide squad movie did i mention its three hours long perhaps that is why by the end i was already tired of so many turns and twists and this is the reason why many did not like it i was very attentive to everything related to filming at that time but i dont know if this element appealed to the general public something like what happened with the puerto rican movie i am a director another point in babylons favor is that it has an r rating for sexual content violence and is not afraid to take advantage of it so i can say that i enjoyed babylon but its not for everyone,POSITIVE,Comedy
292,2.0,4 August 2024,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",i had my doubts about diving into this movie after seeing the trailer and reading the reviews the attacks against the movie because of the decadence and depravity onscreen are understandable before the title card appears minutes into the film audiences are treated to what best can be described as a pornographic fellini film merged with the wolf of wall street its as if writerdirector damien chazelle wanted to separate the casual viewers from the curious ones immediately after the first minutes youll either give up on the movie or proceed and if you proceed you probably wont be disappointed the movie turns into a deranged love letter to early hollywood and focuses on the transition from silent films to sound films singin in the rain instantly comes to mind and babylon turns out to be the twisted threeheaded stepchild of that classic musical brad pitt and margot robbie reunited from the previous love letter to hollywood directed by quentin tarantino are the headliners but really this movie is about the journey to hell and back by the quiet observant manny who starts as an errand boy during the silent era and then after making a bold suggestion about making movies spotlighting an immensely talented black jazz trumpeter becomes a powerful studio head mexican actor diego calva plays manny and he takes us on quite a journey pitt plays the biggest male star of the silent era jack conrad and robbies new jersey to the bone character nellie laroy is first spotted crashing the nearly xrated party that opens the film she and manny become unexpected friends during the opening party following the title card the movie is on its twisted way was early hollywood really like this full of drugs sex both straight and gay perverse use of animals and nonstop swearing by everyone and i mean everyone utters the f word every minutes in the first half of the movie probably not its like some fever dream but to accomplish the dantes infernolike tone of the movie this is meal we are served this movie received some of the worst reviews of a big budget movie since heavens gate and as the case with heavens gate some rare positive reviews it will probably end up with a cult following at least an hour couldve been trimmed but chazelle clearly wanted to take his audience on a rollercoaster ride and since so many movies are becoming hour marathons anyway its run time doesnt seem to excessive in this day and age movie buffs will probably get more out of this film than the average viewer the final minutes of the film are probably the most satisfying minutes of a movie about the movies since cinema paradiso and that was probably chazelles direct inspiration well done,POSITIVE,Comedy
293,9.0,2 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",i was q little bit skeptical about thisbut afteri watch it i was pleasantly surprised by so many aspects the acting is very decent the manuel character is interesting margot being margot she slayed the rolevery impressive the soundtrack was amazing the cinematography as well brad pitt being as we know very convincing lots of funny scenes combined with dramatic and some brutal ones hours very entertaining tobey maguire scene was funn and creepykind of so many actorsactresses in this movie its amazing what damien chazele has done with millions budget for this movie stars frim me well deserved,POSITIVE,Comedy
294,7.0,25 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",this video is such hot garbage is hard to express how bad it is its so full of itself ugly poorly written and overtly grotesque its unbearable the poop drugs sex and everything else in it seems to be written by a year old i honestly cant think of anything that makes me enjoy this movie margo acts like her role as harley quinn pitt is a bad the lighting is garbage the dialog is forgetful the acting is sub par how the hell the academy thinks this is worthy of an oscar is beyond me id rather eat raw catfish thats been sitting out for days than watch mins more mins if the film the only reason i can think hollywood thinks this deserves an oscar is nepotism there has to be someone related to the idiot director who is supporting this trash,NEGATIVE,Comedy
295,1.0,8 August 2024,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",not sure why this movie was so misunderstood and low rated to me it was one of those masterpieces that will go down in history absolutely loved it fantastic cast acting cinematography stage design a story about magic and harsh realities of majestic dirty inspiring tragic unforgiving hollywood bras pitt margot robbie and diego calva did an excellent job at portraying their characters i cant believe it didnt get more awards i feel like this film made a lot of hollywood feel uncomfortable with its honesty exposing the underbelly and the tragedy of what we see as glamorous and dreamy highly recommend to watch,POSITIVE,Comedy
296,1.0,19 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",babylon has an interesting auteur style great performances by pitt and calva and some amazing scenes like the chaotic silent film shoot helmed by german director caricature spike jonze the first sound shoot and the heartbreaking blackfacing scene but it indulges too much in its own fascination and ends completely ridiculous serious that end montage i get what he wants to say but come on this is first semester filmstudent naivitee if the studio would release a m shorter cut maybe then its a great film otherwise watch singing in the rain and the impeccable sunset blvd about this era as well as babylon berlin from which this film stole not only the title but all its hedonistic moments,NEGATIVE,Comedy
297,1.0,24 July 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",i once read the book by harold robbins about the rise and fall of cinema the socalled behindthescenes parts in this movie were just copied from that book the movie is good but way too long the whole underground scene is unnecessary in the opening scene with the slow song i almost fell asleep the best scenes are all the ones with brad pit and all the behindthescenes parts about casting brad pit is doing a great job because you actually can place him in that time classic acting is that margo robbie yep she plays perfectly the one in a dozen movies actresses of that time short fame time out the new guy main character had never heard of him before but you can see he is a good actor music is great so in conclusion even though its not a star movie it is still a movie to watch but it can be a lot better with the right editing,POSITIVE,Comedy
298,7.0,7 May 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",its hard to evaluate babylon it has a lot of energy and fun sequences and its ambitious to boot its also very long and loaded with juvenile comedy that becomes grating after hours it has great performances and characters who perfectly represent the inspiration and heartache that go into a hollywood career it also doesnt distribute focus evenly among its main cast leading to some underdeveloped subplots it gets even more annoying when the interesting more subtle elements of the story are undernourished just so we can have more scenes of body fluid humor and other nonsense its not as bad as the critics made it out to be but i have a hard time seeing it as a classic in the making if anything is assured for this movies legacy its a cult following,POSITIVE,Comedy
299,9.0,22 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",i have been waiting for a long time for babylon to come out in the uk and unlike some i was very much not disappointing the movie was an emotional roller coaster and i sympathise with people who did not enjoy it or even somehow hate it everything about this movie was perfect the acting performances were phenomenal by every single actor on the screen with a stand out mention to the small but very impressive part by p j byrne and of course the main characters of whom unsurprisingly raked in award nominations the films music was another brilliant job performed by justin hurwitz who is yet to disappoint but i doubt he ever will the cinematography of the film was just as impressive the single long shot from the opening scene of the party as the camera makes its way around the whole place still baffles me i loved the theme as it covered the highs and lows of life in hollywood of the s which many of us are really not aware of what life looked like back in the roaring s as well as the messages and social issues that the film managed to cover during this chaotic and intense masterpiece the plot of the movie for me personally was easy to understand despite the complexity and messy nature of the movie when the movie got gross i felt sick where the movie got energetic i felt like partying with them when the scenes got deep i could relate and when the scenes got intense so did i but unfortunately where i think the movie lacked was in the connection with the characters although chazelle could argue that this was intentional but i feel like it didnt hit me enough during the sad scenes of the movie which i wont name in order to keep this spoiler free now this lack of connection is the only reason i am lowering this movie to a from a i believe this movie is not for everyone especially at the graphic nature of certain scenes although there was a warning before the movie started and it is a rrated movie i feel like this movie is really misunderstood as it is deep hilarious creative and it was truly the most entertained i have ever been during a film where the movie really hit for me was the ending i have heard very mixed opinions on the ending but for me it was magical really confirmed that this movie is chazelles attempt at a love letter to cinema and for me it was the homage to the many many legendary films and shots over the last century to get to where we are now was a very powerful ending to the movie for me,POSITIVE,Comedy
300,6.0,24 March 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",what to say about a hour movie its a parody of extremes in the industry of film making set back when it all began is it historically accurate not even close and its not trying to be this is a full tilt in your face dialed up to as high as it can be for every scene in this long movie its outrageously interesting all throughout if you never worked in this industry or have any idea how films are made then most of this will just go well over your head i could count the numerous little details that went into this that only an gaffer would know but with that said im sure there are many more things i missed could they have cut this down into a hour movie probably got to learn to kill your babies story is king and the story is not that strong the characters are playing a flamboyant version of some stereotypes throughout their short career not any one moment is so significant yet each moment is capturing something in tune to that of a skit for this parody movie i think they tried to put in so many insider moments that as a story its not really there and that is what your going to see so for those that know the inside you might appreciate this for everyone else it might be too much a time watch movie for me but i sure wont mind seeing the shorts on social media as a reminder oh how chaotic this industry really is,POSITIVE,Comedy
301,7.0,28 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",this movie is a distaster it starts off with a potential but quickly turns into a mess everything is chaotic in excess crazy boring the s are wrongly interpreted not only did people not dress like this they didnt speak like this the characters speak like in modern day america cmon at least research the time you are talking about the movie is popular just because of the director and the actors who do a great job btw i couldnt wait to get out of the cinema this movie was so boring it hurt the music that is in the movie lasts the entire movie and its so painful to hear i get what the director wanted to say at moments it was even promising however this is a huge flop dont waist your precious time,NEGATIVE,Comedy
302,5.0,19 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",love this movie its long but worth it the movie is wild and sad at some points probably because it does not sugarcoat the reality of the time the acting is superb brad pitt margot robbie definitely did a great job better than my favorite movie of all time once upon a time in hollywood the music score is fantastically cool and fast paced the way they used the brass instruments to make music that sounds like it could be both from and somewhat today is amazing the movie may have been a flop at the box office but that doesnt mean it was a bad movie i think the movie should definitely win some big awards when awards show season comes around,POSITIVE,Comedy
303,1.0,1 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",this was an epic tale of the roaring s of hollywood it has some dedicated performances gross out gags and pure depraved lunacy throughout its hour runtime its easy to see it was made by a filmmaker who has a genuine passion for the movies and i think that is its greatest asset there are some truly great moments in this film it is unapologetic in just about every aspect of its production from wild performances camera shots and editing to its flashy score it gets a because it is a very predictable epic anyone who has seen boogie nights or lengthy ensemble films with colorful characters similar to boogie nights has pretty much already watched most of what this film has to offer the plot is telegraphed to the point where even the chaotic moments seem a little too orchestrated other than that it was an entertaining film from a very talented director,NEGATIVE,Comedy
304,7.0,4 November 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",and even worse a waste anybodys time to try and watch this i hate to say it but this is truly garbage its very hard to understand the people that signed up for this movie and became a part of it i started watching it and im thinking to myself is brad pitt desperate its like somebody put money out on the table and a bunch of people got together and wanted to make the most disastrous wasteful movie of modern time its so bad that its hard for almost everyone who tries to watch it to even get to the halfway mark id rather be watching kids tv which most often i find pretty boring but then again ill take boring over gross for my taste it is so bad that you cant even focus on the actors or actresses its like being caught in a nightmare and wanting to find your way out without paying attention to where youre going or what youre doing,NEGATIVE,Comedy
305,1.0,30 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",i loved this film so much it inspired me to endure the mild administrative inconvenience of creating an imdb account in my opinion this film is an incredible artistic achievement and a wonderful experience there is an interview with composer justin hurwitz where he says people who love the film will feel like it was made for them this is true for me it has a particular style it is heightened and often hilarious but at the same time it is emotionally truthful and heartfelt it also evokes the feel of the period without being strictly historical or confined to its setting for me the elements of pastiche homage to many different genres and eras of film worked very well the cast are all brilliant in their roles hurwitzs score is exquisite it is clear from reading about his processes that so much work and care has gone into it from him and the other performers its a gift to the listener it is dispiriting to see so many negative reviews from critics who even if they didnt personally enjoy it should at least acknowledge its originality creativity and vision if the film is for you you will totally buy into it and during the final sequence you will not want it to end,POSITIVE,Comedy
306,6.0,20 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",at three hours babylon is a daunting watch and will be the main detraction of this epic piece of cinema although i wouldnt necessarily recommend the same approach i unintentionally watched it over three consecutive evenings manny who starts out as a determined young immigrant to the usa who then finds his way into showbiz seems like a supporting character alongside the charismatic pitt vivacious robbie and various other colourful parts however it is he who is the constant dependable thread the movie is made of multiple thematically unrelated vignettes which segue into one another to carry the story along some of these are chaotic spectacular even insane others drag on a bit the story isnt interesting enough at the time to carry the length in my opinion however the end was deeply poignant and you can see what the director was building toward it could be a story about the excesses of early hollywood it could be about the history of singing in the rain it could be about how some people prefer to burn out than fade away to manny i believe it was about the bittersweet realization of what you once had an experienced when you were younger overall a very colourful and at times fun epic with some amazing trumpet music and memorable characters,POSITIVE,Comedy
307,1.0,21 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",is exceptionally perfect it shows a true story of how some actors fell very hard when they went from silent movies to normal without their fault as they say in the movie its not your voice and its not the script its just not your moment i would divide it into parts the beginning shows the partying part of hollywood and all the actors at the top halfway through the movie you can see how their careers are gradually falling and then it is their total fall this movie has a very hard and exceptional ending at the same time great sequences great cinematography the characters are amazing all the actors are perfect but margott robie undoubtedly stands out great performances great beginning and great ending very good movie,POSITIVE,Comedy
308,1.0,1 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",first of all i will come out and say itthis film had some big spectacles and a great cast but failed in a way to use them however they really developed the charecters well in my view before the last minutes of the film i was feeling like this was way too morbid without any reason then i kind of got the meaning behind it although its my personal opinion which is sure to vary from person to person the film actually wanted to say how when you are involved in the making of a motion pictureyou are actually doing something larger than yourself or even your life you get to be part of something big which if executed properly will make you immortal the execution of this idea isnt flawless by any means still i loved watching it and brad pitt along with margot robbie gave sizzling performance,POSITIVE,Comedy
309,8.0,20 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",if you have a love for cinema this will be right up your alley i went into this knowing only from the trailer it would essentially be a party and a wild ride start to finish and boy was it just that chazelle proves once more how he can make another amazing movie i loved it the last or so minutes really had me feeling so damn inspired especially it will resonate for you if the film industry is the career path you want to take props also to the cast all their performances were truly amazing the aesthetics the music the costume and the showcasing of old hollywood and its chaotic nature and cut throat industry of actors careers was all just terrific,POSITIVE,Comedy
310,7.0,11 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",it is and very much was margot robbie movie though how much meaningless you may find the movie she ensured her strong presence with a very good performance once a song during oscars you need to flash to win and guess what margot robbie ensuring damien chazelle well not that much of fan and never like la la or blah blah land too and here is the director showing some darker side to fame a tricky business hard to get even harder to maintain in the beginning you will find the movie a bit odd bizarre even a bit weird watching a odd party the filth and disgust behind the screen but as you move on the movie shows all that glitters on screen have many horrors behind it lessor use of brad pitt in the movie like i said above its margot robbie in this one the director the writer happens to be one has given much more screen play to her comedy well i never can find this element in such movies comedy perhaps to me is a complete whole genre on scale of acting class on scale of direction class on scale of movie lessor,POSITIVE,Comedy
311,3.0,15 August 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",this movie did not make me smile a single time which is a great feat for a hour long movie i used to think margot robbie was an excellent actress turns out all she can do is scream and curse the movie includes nothing you havent seen before and it is way too similar to several other films especially singin in the rain if it had been made in the s i could have excused it but there is simply no reason that this movie should have been made in at one point i thought i could have watched the worst music video ever and enjoy it more than this movie actually three hours of justin biebers yummy on a loop would have been better than this,NEGATIVE,Comedy
312,1.0,20 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",the movie doesnt know whether its a social commentary or a love letter to hollywood which is why it kind of works firstly its over the top and fun like a big picture is supposed to be on the other hand sometimes its very banal and obvious however the actors did a great job even though brad pitt was just playing himself at times margot robbie samara weawing and tobey maguire went completely cuckoo bananas making the film actually entertaining and fun to watch shoutout to jovan adepo for phenomenal acting and giving the movie some depth the soundtrack is very good though and keeps you engaged throughout its not a must watch but if you are a movie lover youll see many nods to many famous movie scenes and sayings all in all youll be entertained,POSITIVE,Comedy
313,6.0,27 April 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",first of all i must say that this movie is more of a threehour documentary about how a movie is made and the reason i saw it has a bitter truth and that was the presence of brad pitt in this movie and i can say that i still dont regret choosing him as a talented actor if you are a fan of marvel movies heroism princesses and realistic movies you should watch it i had downloaded it before but i had not seen it until now this movie showed that other than old movies movies about my past can be meaningful showing the difficulty of creating an idea finding an idea when thousands of ideas have already been tried repeating a sequence over and over again by the actors and the difficulty of coordination between the film crew the importance of the filmmaker to feedback on his work the love he has in showing his work and behind the scenes the production of the film by its actors its actress margot robbie is the symbol of a very disappointed angry and isolated woman who others only pay attention to her appearance and gender or the class she comes from her place of residence her behavior but here i can see harley quinn who actually lived a tragedy but in my opinion his behavior is even civilized and appropriate to his position and therefore powerful the story is also about the impatience of people who have everything and thats why they look for occupation and new things and this deviation of taste and nature goes so far that they stop eating a live mouse is enjoyed and excited by a giant person it has a reference to the results of gambling and it is really effective and it is also very strong to the extent that one thinks that he is familiar with his whole personality and in my opinion the most beautiful part is that it is mentioned all these movies are recorded and stored somewhere for even the future and lonely people movies can be friends of lonely people,POSITIVE,Comedy
314,9.0,5 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",the settings were great i loved the first scene so i was interested but first i was sometimes disappointed with brad pitts acting i thought in some scenes supporting actors were more convincing then why was margot robbie cast in this part shes not a bad actress thats not the point but i dont find her at all the looks of an aspiring star in this period so i didnt get into the movie and got bored halfway through it and in the end i thought it was too long and the director didnt know how to finish it what were these last minutes about getting an oscar by quoting better movies so no sorry i dont buy it better watch singing in the rain again,NEGATIVE,Comedy

320,8.0,19 August 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",cut the chase and just watch singin in the rain hours of chaos with some fun scenes overall the movie is a dramatically fictional tale of hollywood of s it may inspire new generation to watch silent movies or early talkies it sure has the potential the music in a distorted version of la la land not as good though i am a fan of chazelles films hes a good director and it shows that hes inspiration comes from classic movies from around the world however babylon is not as impressive as i was excepting everything is exaggerated and stylized if you really want to explore s and s watch garbos movies or rudolph valentino or jean harlow or marlene dietrich go to the source,POSITIVE,Comedy

328,8.0,17 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",damien chazelles latest film is an enjoyable and sometimes intense ride through the early days of hollywood it packs a complex plot many fun characters and a fantastic production design that really adds to the immersion while also highlighting the foundations of modern cinema the film feels like a mix between the wolf of wall street and once upon a time in hollywood due to the hollywoodbased historical setting and some intense and explicit scenes it also feels like brad pitt and margot robbie are reprising their roles from once upon a time as the characters they play are somewhat similar the strength of the film in addition to its visuals and sets is a complex plot that provides both laughter tears and contemplation although i found most of the film funny there are certain scenes that add a serious and emotional tone to the film it does however go on for a little too long although it doesnt get boring i found myself expecting the film to end several times the runtime serves the plot but it also makes the film heavy to digest and sometimes tiring either way the film makes for a good and enjoyable experience if you have hours to spare,POSITIVE,Comedy

330,1.0,4 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",i liked this a lot some of the burbank filming scenes are frankly incredible chazelle is an auteur there is no doubt about that he knows his subject that all said there were aspects of this movie that really were disturbing ok i am a recovering addict so miss la rois behavior and descent into a complete batsht drug fiend is hard to take but there are other scenes that are just as haunting no spoilers a big shout out to tobey maguire that was some acting this entire sequence of descending into the bowels of hell was something else again hats off to the director writer in dreaming up this ken russell homage the film does fall apart somewhat at the end i know what chazelle was trying to do and say but it just seems rushed and doesnt do its subject justice jesus it must have been wild living in those times with that access the s were a gas,POSITIVE,Comedy
331,6.0,17 August 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",there have been quite a few movies about hollywood of the bygone era two which come to my mind are once upon a time in hollywood and mank this movie covers the period in hollywood and depicts the carefree life of movie makers and artists of that time with hours minutes run time the narrative gives us a picture of the life at that time the movie starts off with scenes of a loud party with live music with some excellent camera work to give you an idea of what will follow and the director does not disappoint as the scenes unravel we are then shown the ad hoc approach to film making at that time with crude technology available then there is a long and interesting scene to show the frustration of the crew as they shoot a scene without a sound proof set and finally get take number right another scene with the rattlesnake in the desert is done well brad pitt plays a top star who is not able to handle failure he has been there and done that earlier in once upon a time in hollywood margot robbie has a meaty role which gives her an opportunity to essay a range of emotions and she has done well diego caliva also has acted well as the rookie turned professional the director has a wide canvas to deal with hollywood transiting from silent to talkies but appears to have lost track and direction of the plot midway though individual scenes are impressively shot i however find that his la la land and whiplash are much superior movies the production design seems to have occupied centerstage the cinematography is excellent and so are the other production values,POSITIVE,Comedy
332,8.0,4 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",so much hate and negative reviews on this movie just sit back relax and enjoy that is the purpose of a movie i really believe this movie was great for what was intended to be turned out really great i believe it was a great effort to produce it and to capture all the details actors performed fantastic it really brought out some great feelings and reminded me the energy i had when i was younger the ambitions why does everyone get so mean and has so ridiculously high expectations i dont even want to think about the amount of research that has been done behind it it is so easy to criticize and throw out hate margot diego were fantastic so much unnecessary hate,POSITIVE,Comedy
333,2.0,30 January 2024,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",babylon is a movie that with its irony brings you inside the mechanics of the showbizit is a deep journey into a manipulating world that ruined several lives especially the ones of vulnerable and non experienced people such as nellie leroy it is a portrayal of the rise and the fall of the famous fictional actor jack conrad that knew his success during the s in the era of mute cinema but was not able to keep up with the times becoming irrelevant it is the sad representation of a successful studio executive that after all his efforts decided to throw it all away for a false promise and these are just a few elements that characterize this three hour piece damien chazelle told of a time where hollywood was experiencing big changes due to the big technological advancements between the s and the s with the introduction of microphone and sounds the first color cameras that completely changed the way to perceive the pictures it is a movie that manages to build a lot of tension on some instances that is relieved by effective comedy sequences that are so well placed and that made me genuinely laugh the director managed to keep a good rhythm for the entire length achieving a good balance between dynamic sequences and slow paced dialogues that deepened the different characters the cast conveyed so many different emotions but with big names such as margot robbie and brad pitt i was not expecting otherwise the photography is amazing and there are many shots that in my opinion will be iconic give it a few years the first minutes alone are memorable the intro set perfectly the mood of the film and it immediately put the audience in the middle of the action great filmmaking there the ending is truly a love letter to the cinema that in my perspective lasted way too long and it required some trims in order to reach perfection other than that this for me is a solid and i strongly recommend watching babylon if you are a movie goer this is definitely a movie that i wish i had watched at the cinema,POSITIVE,Comedy
334,9.0,18 August 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",greetings from lithuania babylon just might be have been one of the most uneven and mixed movies ive ever seen in its long runtime h min and you will feel every minute of it it had a lot to show its a highly ambitious movie that at the end of the day collapsed in my opinion babylon had a great idea but on paper it sounded better i think it had some great looking individual scenes but not a good movie overall it is expertly paced yet it took be more then a week to completed in small dozes it has great actors doing good work but no memorable characters it has good lines but not a good screenplay it has great scenery but at the same time it had a lot of scenes which are discusting to watching and most important babylon has a great and highly talented director who two previous films were instant classics doing his most convoluted and bizarre work yet overall babylon is a messy highly uneven movie with pretty bad and generic ending i think the t and avatar scenes at the end incorporated into this movie is telling you just how uneven and bizarre this movie really is it collapsed because of uneven screenplay and story yet individual scenes are so well done that its worth the watch maybe once just dont eat anything during the watch,NEGATIVE,Comedy
335,7.0,21 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",this film is highly vulgar and decadent it doesnt reveal anything about the roaring twenties at all some things for example magot robbies hair style and clothes do not even suit the times the pace of the film is extremely high definitely too high for my taste although i dont like margot robbie and brad pitt i have to admit that the acting is not so bad after all but it cannot save this film this film wants so hard to be great but it definitely is not it wants so hard to be hilarious and meaningful at the same time but its none of this at all the runtime of the film is an imposition it was very painful to watch this mess for more than three hours i hated la la land as well and whiplash was not more than mediocre so i definitely will avoid films directed by damien chazelle in the future if you prefer good movies you should do likewise,NEGATIVE,Comedy
336,3.0,28 June 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",margot robbie delivers a phenomenal new performance worthy of the supreme award brad pitt excels as usual and diego calva literally steals the show in his interpretation of manny torres a young mexican immigrant who witnesses the madness of silent cinema then the appearance of sound and finally the revolution of talking pictures in color which puts an end to prewar reigns and establishes hollywood as the universal capital of cinema it is useful to remember that babylon is a film that requires a welldeveloped maturity level therefore the film is not intended for younger audiences,POSITIVE,Comedy
337,8.0,14 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",so ive been hearing about this for months now and ive heard all kinds of things both good and bad and surprisingly there are still discussions going on about how this film works or if it works at all which is why my inquisitive mind has been waiting all this time for the opportunity to attend it firsthand and now that ive finally experienced this exotic ride i can confidently say that its absolutely oneofakind ive never seen anything like it before the visuals the drama the script well excuse me there isnt much of a typical script here nor does it follow the traditional ways it is designed to be an experience almost like an exotic theme park adventure that you must voluntarily undergo rather than critically evaluate i know that sounds strange given that im stating the same in a review of my own but some films do require you to be in a certain mood a specific mindset or else you wont get the gist this is one of such films where there is no middle ground you either like what you saw or you dont as simple as that,POSITIVE,Comedy
338,6.0,26 March 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",horrible meaningless farce of a movie filled with screeching unpleasant characters truly awful to watch margot robbies character has to be the worst human being ever committed to celluloid it started as it meant to go on with a disgusting elephant defecation and it all went downhill from there to think this is considered entertainment is troubling and its baffling that it has a high review brad pitt was the only decent thing in this whole mess i watched to the end and can honestly say its the worst thing ive ever voluntarily sat through there is so much shouting but no good dialogue,NEGATIVE,Comedy
339,9.0,3 February 2024,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",i will start with the fact that i absolutely loved watching babylon and emerging myself in the world that said i can see why the film can throw people away it is not perfect and it is not for everyone the story set in the early times of hollywood is fabulously chosen and presented however it does not really have a plot this is the bit where viewers are separated into either truly enjoying the art behind cinema or leaving confused the theatre you can defiantly appreciate how the picture was captured the story telling can be seen as influenced of tarantinos early movies the scenery was more than beautiful however the music and the sound directing were so perfectly placed and composed they were the true superstars of the movie making m robbie and b pitt with yet another performance worth oscar nomination it is hard to make a movie one without a real plot or strong story line and turn it in a masterpiece without great acting the main characters were not anything out of the ordinary however the actors made something beyond possible babylon is the pure cinema made for true enjoyers of the movies who appreciate the art behind the camera and sound work showcasing amazing acting and proving that you do not need a story to make something beautiful,POSITIVE,Comedy
340,7.0,9 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",many viewers will be surprised to discover how permissive the american film industry was in the s although most was in the making almost anything seemed to be possible to set the tone there is a wild scene of a party with loud music and anything which goes the audience is immediately drown into the story and to be such a long feature it is impressive how time flies following the dramas and successes of the protagonists something mainly to be attributed to the incredibly high standard of acting the characters and what happens to them take the audience into the plot and not the other way around there are elements and facts which have never been exposed so openly on the screen and even if the pace is fast with action there are amazingly funny scenes like the endless number of takes of a story which is so cleverly scripted acted and directed that the audience couldnt stop laughing perhaps some elements dont merge so well with the times like the dancing moves of the parties attendees which seem to be incredibly modern or the ending which is a bit too long but without any doubt the most impressive characteristic of babylon is to have presented a story on cinema which most people dont really know about,POSITIVE,Comedy

342,6.0,10 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",babylon babylon is chazelles contribution to the recent cinema movement of directors hiting back against modern amusement park films the film takes you on a three hour often incoherent journey thorugh multiple characters paths and experiences in early hollywood ultimately ending with the message that cinema is whatever you want cinema to be in chazelles case it would seem that cinema should be oppressively fast paced across a monalithic time scale with pulse raising sequences filled with debauchery perhaps the copius amount of cocaine on screen was a hint to audience that a line or two in the bathrooms before the film is how it was meant to be viewed despite the negative tone of the review so far painting a clear picture of my displeasure i couldnt help but enjoy some of the films madness the epic scale of scenes especially in the opening hour left me smilling wondering if maybe this is what i want cinema to be it is in the unremarkable characters and sheer length of the picture that this film lets itself down brad pitts character jack conrad was the only story thay held any interest for me its ozymandian nature reflecting the age of cinema the film is set was an enjoyable watch the overall reception of this film is reflecting in its lack of nominations we are left with a fairly average film with moments of excitement which quickly fade into memory as we pass through at the speed of light its like an all you can eat buffet a meal that you would never cook or order consisting of a random assortment of foods with no collective cohesion but somehow still enjoyable,POSITIVE,Comedy
343,1.0,26 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",i saw that american people on another website reviewed badly this movie and i can understand why this is by far damien chazelles most exaggerated direction its something that i could wait from baz luhrmann from the moulin rouge times it didnt bother me at all i like baz he goes too far sometimes true but at least for me to of the humour worked the soundtrack is spectacular spectacular i promise no moulin rouge references from now on the best of and by far the period reconstruction is perfect and the film sucessfully surpassed my worst fear that it could potentially be a once upon a time in hollywood ripoff quentin tarantino is my favourite director and an unpopular opinion here once upon a time in hollywood is his weakest film due to the production design the tone of the trailer especially one sentence and the presence of brad pitt and margot robbie in both productions the comparisons are inevitable the only one i can really do is the narrative structure the cast is excellent the sag nomination was fully deserved diego calva who i met here is one of the most charismatic protagonists of he has the biggest arc of the entire film margot robbie here is the complete opposite of her character in tarantinos movie she is the only actress who could do this character li jun li is great but she always remembered me of jessica rabbit but less femme fatale jovan adepo is cool even passing of the film only playing trumpet that trumpet was so hypnotizing maybe the most hypnotizing one for me since pinky dinky doo and brad pitt has the star power that no one else has in the entire hollywood i wont say anything but alongside the protagonist the best character is tobey maguire i hope chazelle do the same that tarantino did with once upon a time in hollywood take this script expand it and adapt it for a book i would be the first to buy despite having hours this film begs for more content and sometimes it can feel insufficient i would love to spend a lot more hours in this universe even not being a big fan of the old cinema the epilogue is undeniably oscarbait but i loved it it was an ode to cinema there are even some sentences that reminded me of another movies including some from this century i can bet that babylon will age extremely well even with its fouls,POSITIVE,Comedy
344,1.0,15 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",this movie was one of the most shocking films ive seen in a decade loving the director my mom and i went to see babylon but we went prepared id read it was over the top with sex and drugs but we had no idea we had been to see just about everything and anything together but this made us uneasy front the start it seemed chazelle was trying to push the envelope but it was unnecessary theres a scene involving large animal diarrhea that i pretty much had to look away from then it goes straight into the explicit sex and im talking nc levels instead of enjoying the movie we both found ourselves asking why a scene was done this way it truly rode the line between shock and entertainment for over hours there was a little bit of disorganization to story telling but nothing i couldnt overlook due to the genius level acting by robbie and pitt bottom line for me is that this was a vulgar adventure that wore me out and if chazelle would have toned it down the extremely shocking material to something more viewable then this would have been an enjoyable experience,POSITIVE,Comedy
345,6.0,23 July 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",the history obviously by the title seems cribbed from kenneth angers hollywood babylon books sensationalized fragments of certain events shown in the most lurid and unsubstantialized ways but thats the foundation of the mythology of this movie from the first sight of the first person you can see that any attempt to actually capture an authentic period appearance and ambiance are casual at best it was rare to see grossly overweight men with full beards in that locale and era throughout this movie multiple men sport full beards and where are the hats men and women rarely were seen in public without hats you hardly see any here and the hair where are the bobs and bangs the marcel wave the dances obviously dont reflect the realities of the time either the silent films usually had chamber music trios or classical ensembles accompanying filming not jazz obviously a compromise for one of the subplots but artificially forced so many other movies have done better recreating the look and feel of period pieces but that clearly wasnt considered important a subtle thing that subliminally adds a degree of immersion something that maybe younger audiences would be interested in rather than being afraid that they couldnt empathize beyond their own familiar expectations the main protagonists are exaggerated characterizations of real people with a few lines dropped for reference clara bow obviously as the lead actress with the most lewd stories referenced sex with the entire usc football team for instance the fact that she settled down with rex bell into a rural ranching life wasnt sensationalistic enough for the story arc jack was a synthesis though john gilbert seems most probable the real actor had an entirely different history his big romance was with greta garbo the polar opposite of clara bow personality wise and his downward spiral was largely a result of louis b mayer sabotaging his career my favorite character was elinor she was written as a hopper or parsons gossip columnist but her name was a combination of elinor glyn and adela rogers st john both were popular novelists and popular magazine writers appearance wise the look is totally based on glyn a flaming redhead with exotic taste in style she was a british best selling novelist of three weeks and other risque novels married into minor nobility she moved to hollywood in her mid fifties and reinvented herself as an expert on culture and etiquette she worked at mgm and elsewhere as an advisor and writer as her books were turned into films her magazine articles shaped opinion and were where she announced bow as the it girl and did become her personal advisor for a time but she moved back to england before talking pictures became dominant the best scene in the movie is her pontificating about fame and legacy with jack an actual serious subdued quiet scene maybe the only one the vignettes about film making were exaggerated but generally ok in the context of showing the changes over time from silent to sound a little more explicit reference to pre code issues might have added depth to the story the parties and debauchery were modern interpretations of hollywood babylons versions of history the excessive over the top pornographic ensemble scenes look like choreographed calisthenics rather than anything erotic the torture and vomiting scenes seem intended to evoke shock nothing more gratuitous the trumpeter saga as a subplot seems a concession to modern sensibilities rather integral to the world of old hollywood as it actually was popular mainstream music did not have thumping bass lines or the blaring tonality of this soundtrack more paul whiteman who actually was in early sound pictures a nice story for a different context irving thalberg begging an actor to star in an acknowledged crappy movie that really is a deviation from history thalberg fought for quality and prestige films a bit irreverent to gratuitously use his name for a cheap reaction the movie itself was far too long it should have been more about character development than imagery and cliches more focus and fewer subplots the stories about unknowns becoming stars and then fading have been around forever show people came out in what price hollywood and a star is born in the early thirties amongst so many more over the years the ending seems very artificial as if they realized that nothing was cohesive and tacking on historical clips somehow meant that babylon too was part of the cutting edge historical stream i was originally excited about the premise i bought the k video and watched it in my theater room with a big screen and sound quality look disappointing result but credit at least for actually trying to deal with an era many are unfamiliar with maybe it will get some to delve further into the actual sources,NEGATIVE,Comedy

376,7.0,7 September 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",damien chazelles babylon is an intimate look at what hollywood may have looked like in the late s during the transition from the end of the silent film era to the advent of the talkie starting with al jolsons the jazz singer the grand majority of the characters are fictional but are based on the lives of reallife personalities from this time period the movie is a love letter to movies themselves and showcases how painstaking of a process it was making them during this period a fun diverse unforgettable cast of both new and familiar faces plus a wellwritten plot makes this a fresh and exciting movie that achieves what it sets out to do the movie follows manuel torres diego calva a somewhat timid wellmannered mexican immigrant who starts out as a lackey of sorts for bigshot producers at mgm studios he falls in love with nellie laroy margot robbie a beautiful freespirited aspiring actress from new jersey they both have largerthanlife aspirations of making it big in hollywood and soon start climbing the ranks laroy as an actress and torres as a producer himself they both eventually find out the hard way that they may be in over their heads in the corruption of the behindthescenes world of the moviemaking industry brad pitt plays a much less interesting character named jack conrad an actor who enjoyed great success during the silent film era but struggles to find his footing in the world of talkies jack is your standard cookiecutter brad pitt character cocky a sharp dresser somewhat of a womanizer but ultimately insecure deep down while brad pitt is a good casting choice for this character i am getting kind of tired of seeing him in this same role all the time it is interesting to note he also starred in the movie babbel the multilinguistic masterpiece from mexican director alejandro g iñárritu that being said margot robbie makes up for brad pitts lackluster performance while this movie has several similarities to quintin tarantinos once upon a time in hollywood which both actors also starred in margot robbies character is much more fun and interesting in this movie she feels very authentic in this role and her depiction of natalie laroy has a lot more depth than her depiction of sharon tate from a writing perspective i feel chazelle gives robbie a lot more room to shine in this film than tarantino does in his another thing this movie really does an excellent job of when compared to once upon a time in hollywood is minority portrayal tarantino heavily marginalizes minority populations in his movie and seems to glorify the whole notion of the white male protagonist chazelle flips this upside down and instead marginalizes the white male protagonist pitt himself the cast diversity is really what makes this movie shine sexism and racism are major themes throughout the story chazelle tackles these sad but true aspects of hollywood history headon in a tasteful manner for example the character sidney palmer jovan adepo an africanamerican trumpet player who starts out as an orchestra musician finds himself in a tight spot for not being black enough in comparison to his bandmates after getting the chance to have his likeness projected on the silver screen speaking of which the soundtrack is a banger justin hurwitz deserves a special shoutout for his mostly eraaccurate academyawardnominated score it is everything one could want for a s period piece and feels authentic but is still highly enjoyable hurwitzs use of the baritone saxophone in particular is delectable there seems to be one word that comes up time after time with this movie debauchery the definition of which as per merriamwebster is extreme indulgence in bodily pleasures and especially sexual pleasures behavior involving sex drugs alcohol etc that is often considered immoral indeed certain scenes of this movie are reminiscent of painter hieronymus boschs famous oil painting the garden of earthly delights this is definitely not a movie for the kiddos but i honestly found it rather tame as far as nudity and sex scenes go these scenes give us an idea of where the modernday rave may have gotten its beginnings and are the very heart and soul of the movie overall babylon is a homerun it is a brutally honest take on the phrase be careful what you wish for watching these characters try to build a tower to the stars out of their careers only to have it come crashing down on them against the backdrop of a multicultural s hollywood makes for an exhilarating experience in addition it is wonderful to see a positive representation of the mexican community for once and the spanish sprinkled in makes it more believable and is a nice change in a historically englishcentered industry this is historical fiction at its best,POSITIVE,Comedy
377,8.0,21 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",first the positives brad pitt is great his role is predictable and has some terrible lines but he proves he can turn trash into gold okay thats it for positives the storyline is weak and ridiculously predictable you can guess the endings for every character really early on the sound design is appalling at times the music is so loud and discordant i had my fingers in my ears and i could see others in the sienna doing the same the tone veers all over the place slapstick comedy near pornographic excess dark emotional scenes all in the space of five minutes its also an hour too long at least,NEGATIVE,Comedy
378,1.0,5 January 2024,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",babylon is another great part of david chazelles expanding filmography there was so many magnificent sequences that celebrate the art of filmmaking one of my personal favourites was the absolute craziness present when the main characters get involved in shooting films within the silent film era building upon this the move to regular audio filming is expertly captured i love how you can see the frustration of the main characters when adapting to the changes in filming however i do feel that this film is best watched in two sittings despite being thoroughly invested i struggled to keep concentration at points additionally there was a sequence of the film that felt very bizarre and possibly outofplace on the whole though i would highly recommend this,POSITIVE,Comedy
379,1.0,25 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",this starts off at a great pace and doesnt really slow down the first half was the most enjoyable but that is deliberate the director is clearly portraying the fun and chaotic rawness of the early days of cinema followed by its downfall for better and worse so many memorable scenes excellent visuals great acting wonderful soundtrack shock laughter tears and fears this movie has it all so you certainly get your moneys worth for the price of a cinema ticket this movie isnt perfect but very few movies are in my opinion i would have happily done without most of the last half hour but enjoyed the rest of it so much i still want to give it must been seen at the cinema if possible though,POSITIVE,Comedy
380,8.0,30 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",if there were any doubts about what to expect from babylon chazelle immediately lets audiences know just what kind of film they have sat down for it opens with three characters having to drive an elephant up a hill in a truck designed to transport horses and resorting to pushing the truck to prevent it from tumbling downhill but what at first seems like a classic laurel hardy sketch quickly devolves into something more akin to a farrelly brothers gag with one of the men stuck in the line of fire of a defecating elephant following this in the next minutes of the film follows a massive party involving mountains of cocaine dead hookers and an orgy graphic enough to make the attendees of an eyes wide shut orgy blush needless to say if you feel like you may find this hard to sit through this may not be the film for you for those who do stick around the rest of the film offers a look into the rise and fall of several characters during hollywoods silent era and its transition into the talkies the first of these characters is manny played by diego calva hes a hard working immigrant who wants to be part of something bigger and is willing to do anything asked of him to be a part of the filmmaking process this includes detaching himself from his foreign roots and americainise himself as a means to climb hollywoods social ladder he quickly grows feelings for nellie laroy played by margot robbie bringing her strong physically comedic charms to the role unlike manny she is not content at playing some small role and instead believes that she was born to be a star and is just waiting for hollywood to realise alongside this duo we also have jack conrad played by brad pitt hes the aged silent star who is everything that nelie wants to be a name that everyone knows and spends his days between film shoots constant partying and several marriages that often struggle to outlive his film shoots but just like many other silent stars he inevitably has difficulties adapting to the new challenges of the talkies and being taken seriously by audiences its a great comedic but poignent performance that almost feels like we get a glimpse at what would have happened if brad pitt had switched roles with leonardo dicaprio in once upon a time in hollywood and there is also sidney palmer a jazz trumpeter played by jovan adepo out of all the characters he certainly gets the least amount of screen time leaving many of his story beats to feel rushed and many aspects of the difficulties of black performers in that era of filmmaking unexplored but it does still offer a different perspective on the limited and exploitative of black performers throughout classic hollywood just like his other ode to a different era of filmmaking with la la land its clear that damien chazelle has a strong lovehate relationship with hollywood he showcases the true magic of the industry where all the cards align and the crew get to celebrate that final beautiful shot to end the day but he will also let us know the full extent of pain that everyone had to go through to pull off that shot and that by its constantly evolving nature nobodys role is ever secure another place where the film strives is with its party sequences which are frantically shot with the same kinetic energy chazelle always brings to his films when you combine this with justin hurwitz jazz infused score these sequences are so intoxicating that just like our leads we feel we just want to keep this style of life going forever unfortunately these sequences do eventually end and the film does lose momentum towards the last hour of the film especially with the strange detour that the film takes to show us hollywoods underbelly in something that feels like a version of dantes inferno manny is led deeper and deeper into what can only be described as a strange sex dungeon filled with people that would be assembled for a p t barnum show the satire in this segment ends up feeling out of place to the rest of the film and other than a fun performance from tobey maguire as a creepy debt collector a lot of the humour in this segment really falls flat on top of this at times the film can feel like a clustered mess of ideas trying to tug our attention in too many ways and sometimes a bad gag just goes on for too long but when babylon comes together it can be hilarious tragic sentimental cynical and everything in between chazelle spends hours showing us the unbearable pressure that the film industry puts on people behind the scenes but still somehow showcases a true love of his art that makes it feel like maybe all that blood and sweat may have been worth it,POSITIVE,Comedy
381,1.0,25 December 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",if i know in advance that a movie is going to last hours im extremely skeptical that ill be able to sit through it its out of the question for me to split it up so i watch it in one go and take my time with babylon i waited a while and then treated myself to it with the result that i wasnt bored for a minute damien chazelle surprised me because i was expecting an acid trip à la baz luhrmann but that wasnt the case the scene with the elephant was a successful introduction to the films drastic humor which at the same time takes the absurdity of early hollywood to the extreme reaching its first climax in the battle scenes of the monumental film shot later and it doesnt really end there i cant agree with some of the things that have been written here about the sexual permissiveness but maybe thats because im european and im more upset by violence its there too but in sparing doses i see the movie much more as a loving homage to a crazy industry that holds nothing sacred and sometimes sacrifices people for the sake of success margot robbie at the center of it all is fantastic the rest of the cast does a good job too and the score is an absolute feast for the ears a bit too long all that yes half an hour less wouldnt have hurt but ultimately only the maudlin ending was completely superfluous,POSITIVE,Comedy
382,8.0,26 August 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",disjointed too long questionable choices and still pretty entertaining definitely skewed towards viewers with a real curiosity for the era if you dont care about the pre hays code era you will hate it if you are interested this is an enjoyable love letter and condemnation of the time i really wish this had been changed into a longer form miniseries where there couldve been more time spent developing the characters and digging a little deeper into an era that isnt known to so many of us even though three hours is long for the film theres so much more that could have been added,POSITIVE,Comedy
383,8.0,30 July 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",too many times the characters were overdramatic or there was more yelling talking than action this is nothing more than a bunch of intoxicated adults occasionally making bad choices it was like going to the bar scene watching people at closing time get silly the writers had decent ideas however someone should have ran them by other skilled writers before putting them in the final script to make it interesting to the viewer diego calva had very few lines in the first half of the movie which made it kind of weird he barely spoke i didnt understand it he did more staring than talking way too many scene fillers in this movie a lot of scenes started out great then drug on too long the last half of the movie showed margot robbies character nellie leroy falling apart from her coke and gambling addiction it was a pretty dumb script the whole movie seemed like they didnt even try to put pieces together to make it worth watching yeah there was a lot of excitement and fast action scenes however it all seemed random and pointless,NEGATIVE,Comedy
384,1.0,19 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",after reading the reviews for this movie i expected a quite tumortuous experience but what i encountered in the cinema was way worse than that the movie is crazy unpredictable and makes little to no sense at all after watching it you need to go to therapy i do not recommend watching this movie at all after reading the reviews for this movie i expected a quite tumortuous experience but what i encountered in the cinema was way worse than that the movie is crazy unpredictable and makes little to no sense at all after watching it you need to go to therapy i do not recommend watching this movie at all,NEGATIVE,Comedy

386,9.0,30 July 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",this film goes way over the top way too much it is not subtle and i really enjoyed it anyway there were moments when it tried too hard or my attention waned but i didnt expect this kind of slapstick energy from chazelleand the layers underneath were pretty surprising too i laughed a lot and i got sucked in when i least expected it no matter what i couldnt take my eyes off robbie or pitt or even calva and i couldnt unsee this version of preposttalkie hollywood ive seen plenty of stories from this moment in history but the energy here seemed different and palpable while the movie was often far from perfect it was never ever boring or complacent or average you could love or hate any given scene but babylon always forced you to make a choice and i did,POSITIVE,Comedy
387,1.0,15 June 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",wow this is definitely a show that feels like it jumps around a bit and you wonder what this all has to do with the plot i wasnt convinced i would like this movie watching the first half i did love the music and could hear the parts influenced by la la land the show is odd but i actually enjoyed the crazy montage at the end and overall movie everything made sense without the actor saying a word it portrayed the long history of hollywood with some very interesting twists and turns the reality of the kind of crap that goes into making a movie is fascinating its worth a watch even if you only watch it once,POSITIVE,Comedy
388,2.0,13 July 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",i just watched it accidentally on a lonely saturday movie blew me away the writing camera work music and performances of movie crew is nothing short to a masterpiece dont know how academy awards ignored this but i am sure this movie will be remembered as one of the classics one could relate this to tarantinos once upon a time in hollywood the theme is same but this movie is more lively and colourful the characters might sound little comical but that is how they supposed to look like the title is very apt considering rise and fall of hollywood during great depression however the way it bounced back to its original glory just explains how love passion never dies the dialogue of film critic in the movie summarized whole purpose of this movie,POSITIVE,Comedy
389,8.0,10 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",its a shame that a movie with such great names misses completely in terms of plot there is nothing coherent in the movie its actually boring and very loud sometimes theres really no point in the movie and usually movies about the movie industry are somewhat like this the action in the movie is also unbelievably slow paced and obviously the movie is wayyyy too longits a complete flop and only the general lack of quality movies in the last years could make this movie go to the oscars this year as one of the most nominatedtruly unbelievable if you ask me the actors are good but contrary to some critics here i think the movie is actually so bad that turns some of the actors less convincing,NEGATIVE,Comedy
390,1.0,18 June 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",forget what you heard this film reminds me of a dirty shame by john waters hilariously over the top the movies needed a film like this big loud and funnily sexy olivia hamilton is great as ruth adler the female director theres a helluva lot to look at and hear in this film especially if youre into film and listen and look closely watch it the film drops a lot of lines that pertain to other films film stars and the high society of the time its fascinating the correlations of the characters in the film to their real life actors of the time the new york times has a great article of the period referencing the book hollywood babylon,POSITIVE,Comedy

392,1.0,7 March 2024,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",im a sucker for any movie set in the s and s anywhere actually this was exaggerated and twisted the fiction in just the right way for me included a diverse cast in ways we wished happened just like that an homage to the changes in technology and artistic integrity just like weve been facing over and over again dont know why people would rate this lower but i just compare my rating to what mundane monstrous piles of crap that have been coming out as movies these days im partial to any historical fictional movie done right with good cinematography a good soundtrack and an art director who knows what theyre doing too many people whine about minor flaws of actors and story line so if thats you this review is not for you ive seen a lot of other historical fictions that pale in comparison to the atmosphere of this production,NEGATIVE,Comedy

394,4.0,2 May 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",yes i understand all the critical comments made about its length and debauchery but amongst all that litter are some real gems one scene in particular stands out among many jovan adepo when being asked ordered really to darken his face for reasons i still dont quite understand his mastery of emotions while contemplating how to react and then later watching the scene of him playing the trombone wow very powerful over all this a simple movie its about a star sensational brat pitt whos career is ending and his slow realization that his slip into irrelevance is unalterable and a talented if a little rough around the edges actress the amazing margo robbie who arrives in hollywood at the tail end of the silent era and who is ill equipped to handle the new talkies i must also mention diego calva and the ever reliable manny whos efforts to rehabilitate nellie robbie were never going to be enough to save her in the end dont judge this picture before youve seen it get past the first minutes and i think youll be rewarded with a surprising fun ride,POSITIVE,Comedy
395,8.0,29 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",no amount of nudity debauchery and loud music can elevate this film from being a tedious incoherent and selfindulgent train wreck of a film it is far too long and i genuinely didnt give a monkeys about any of the characters margot robbie can only do one american accent which is a hammy attempt at new jersey so every single film shes in has her coming from there i cant imagine what they left on the cutting room floor because it feels like absolutely everything they shot they put in the film my partner fell asleep twice which she has never done before i genuinley couldnt wait for it to end,NEGATIVE,Comedy

398,8.0,22 March 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",first things first this is damien chazelles masterpiece the mixed response for the film will be completely based on how much you love films and understand hollywood this was always going to touch a nerve with critics who believe that hollywood is lovely place there have been movies made about hollywood in the past like maps to the stars and the artist but this is the dark seedy side of hollywood and how it can make you a star and then spit you out the characters that the film follows played by brad pitt margot robbie and diego calva show their fall from grace over hours with the backdrop of the parties drinking and hard drugs that may or may not went on films sets and evenings in hollywood the film is dark funny crude dramatic sad disgusting in equal measure the first minutes is an extended party sequence of drugs drinking orgies and a large elephant unlike any opening to a film i have ever seen i have seen so many negative reviews for this over its hour run time i was never bored as the run time just flew by this is also a love letter to cinema that shows how quickly things can change when moved over from the silent era to talkies and this film did that part better than signing in the rain which is one of the most overrated films ever margot robbie should have won the oscar for this film she is absolutely captivating and cannot take your eyes off her one of the best films of the year by far insanely funny and massively entertaining,POSITIVE,Comedy
399,9.0,27 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",babylon is a big loud chaotic feature from damien chazelle it is over the top and full of excess it is also a true love letter to cinema margot robbie is great as the wild child nellie laroy and has some explosive scenes that a lot of actresses wouldnt dare touch brad pitt is also on form and has the best arc in the movie going from great movie star to washed up by movies end the movies biggest flaw appears to be the treatment of sidney palmer jovan adepo is wonderful as the musician and the scene with the boot polish is heartbreaking i wish the movie had given him more of an arc and showed us more from the band there are some fun cameos from the likes of flea tobey maguire samara weaving and even ethan suplee pops up the runtime is long and there may have been parts that could have been trimmed down for a more audience friendly runtime its clear that chazelle was allowed full reign and the vision is fully his the movie follows diego calva and his ascend in s hollywood i dont know if calva is a strong enough presence for the role never more so than at the end when he is crying in the cinema watching singin in the rain i think he may be the weakest link in a movie where everyone plays it so big he gets lost in the shuffle somewhat the end montage showing how cinema has evolved throughout the years is gorgeous and may make the devout weep it truly is a beautiful sight,POSITIVE,Comedy
400,2.0,7 October 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",how could anybody think this load of rubbish and nonsense was worth making much less watching babylon is nothing but garbage it reminded me of a computer game where some people mistakenly thought total excess of anything and everything was a hit maker ugh wrong as they learned and i use the word thought so loosely as to be nonexistent right out of the gate the fbombs try to be more frequent than any previous shows with excessive fbombs what a goal well in unimaginative fashion this is their only success and a pitiful success the writers directors producers and other nimrods involved in this disaster and waste of oxygen obviously were standing behind the door when quality or quantity was taught there is no point in going on because there is no point in further explaining why babylon is such a loser recommendation dont waste your time,NEGATIVE,Comedy
401,8.0,26 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",a nicely ambitious film about an interesting era of hollywood that was never visible in their films of that time its a film from a cinema lover to cinema lovers and while we had similar projects like this during the year the fabelmans the offer this one is the most different wildest and in many ways bravest there are unfortunately issues with it i wasnt fond of the direction by damien chazelle as his direction was all over the place the film never really knew what it wanted to be comedy drama thriller romance there were many segments that could have easily reduced the very long running time of hours and increased the quality of the film generally editing was another issue there are so many meaningless moments in the film when the camera films steady on a face or item without reason but there are many goods as well first of all the film had probably my favorite final scene of any movie this year very well done and surprising in a way too the acting was very solid margot robbie was great i think i would have loved emma stone the original choice even better but robbie added something very raw to it what stone probably wouldnt have been capable to do in a weaker year for female performance she could have easily stabbed an oscar nomination for this brad pitt was absolutely outstanding and gives one of his best and most nuanced performances he is very underrated for this turn as there are many ways this character could have been played and pitt chose the right one great performance funny and tragic jean smart was very good too i especially loved her monologue was not the biggest fan of tobey maguire as he overacted his role too much and last but certainly not least diego calva is a fantastic discovery and i am looking forward to see more of him he really carried a huge junk of the film on his own shoulders the music was great the cinematography fantastic the production design absolutely top notch so yeah if damien chazelle would have put more focus on it for example like the offer which was a brilliant example of a film well miniseries about filmmaking he would have made a masterpiece now its still a solid film worth to see expect the unexpected,POSITIVE,Comedy
402,9.0,26 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",wow babylon blew me away i genuinely wasnt sure whether i would like this movie let alone love it after catching wind of early reviews its a films for dreamers those wishing to obtain or hang on to them to explore this theme damien chazelle transports us to the s movie industry a place of excess deluge and rapid change this is the perfect setting to witness the rise and fall of stars and how things are make or break based on talent luck and other factors at play we meet nellie leroy margot robbie manny torres diego calva sidney palmer joavan adepo and jack conrad brad pitt and a massive cast of support characters over hour and minutes nellie is a wannabe actress who believes she is a star manny wants to work in movies which he sees as the ultimate destination as it can transport you to another place sidney palmer is someone who enjoys playing trumpet and jack conrad is the movie star in hollywood we witness the movie industry adapt from silent black and white to talkies to colour pictures and how this impacts the individuals that we follow although in some instances the more things change the more they stay the same to that end the movie industry is both the protagonist and the antagonist with the ability to thrust people into the limelight pull them out of it and treat support workers as faceless commodities required to do whatever it takes to reach the ultimate goal which is to developing a film that movie goers will enjoy viewers will see eerie similarities between treatment of individuals in s hollywood and what we see today with the rust incident and tight deadlines faced by vfxs artists its all backed by an amazing oscar nominated new school jazz score by justin hurwitz which propels every scene this shouldnt be surprising when you consider what justin hurwitz and damien chazelle achieved with whiplash la la land and first man babylon is a beautiful film which says its okay to dream but be careful what you ask for as its only a matter of time before change brings in new dreamers movers shakers those with the purest intentions are best set up to navigate the dangers of hollywood but there are no guarantees however regardless of your relationship with hollywood film will ensure that you are immortalised this movie has split audiences and i can see why not necessarily because of the excess in some scenes but because its a movie that focuses heavily on its themes therefore you dont get short sharp quickfire scenes that continuously pulls the plot forward instead you get poignant scenes which speak to the overall themes and if you arent on board or dont care for the themes the movie will turn into a boring drag this is the same with la la land once upon a time in hollywood and nope i have fallen of both sides of this fence over the years but im glad that i was able to enjoy every moment of babylon in the cinema,POSITIVE,Comedy

404,8.0,24 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",to judge this film by any other standards than its own is daft it is a crazy ride exploring hollywoods early crazy period where most drugs were freely available and booze was banned la was almost a frontier town and the movies and their makers were full of excess and excitement for their sheer newness its a black comedy tragedy yet ultimately if youre a film lover you cannot fail to appreciate the passion that also went into these early days of what was destined to become such a major art form watch if you dare criticise love or hate it but one thing cannot be overlooked this is an amazing achievement in in camera film making and has a visceral feel that gives it a sharp authenticity far beyond all the fx and cgi it also gave a lot of actors a job,POSITIVE,Comedy
405,2.0,1 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",i couldnt get through the whole thing i invested hours and finally called it quits it really seems to not have much in the way of plot other than meandering here and there aimlessly brad pitt has succumbed to these roles it seems and one would expect more of the roles he accepts to be near the top again instead it looks as if he is circling the drain scriptwise which is sad because i really like him as an actor from his roles past pre theres no way this is a movie it also appears to not even made over half the money spent on making it brad and others hold out for the good scripts,NEGATIVE,Comedy
406,1.0,15 June 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",babylon is a film that perfectly finds the middle point between comedy and drama this is a story about the history of cinema especially how cinema further developed after films with sound evolved and not gonna lie i didnt laughed this much in all of my eighteen years that scene where they make a sound film for the first time had me laughing so much i couldnt breath i thought about that scene for days this film has many various things that it does great the actors are doing there best the humor had me laughing the whole night after seeing it the score gave me goosebumps the whole s glamorous hollywood setting is incredibly grand and epic but most importantly is what this film is about its about passion the love for films people were going crazy during the filming of those movies they scream they laugh they cry in those moments you really feel that nothing else matters besides doing that film all things in their life suddenly doesnt matter only if the film will be worth it in the end that sunset scene of brad pitts character jack conrad is pure cinematic magic there a dialogue where a character summed up says that no matter what happens next in your life the films you did will be there forever a child in years could see that film and you could be his inspiration hell look up to your face even if you took your last breath way before he breathed his first that dialogue that is what ultimately cinema means to me and especially for me someone that maybe sometime wants to be an filmmaker it hits hard i love everything about this film during that final scene every film that ive ever saw flashed before my eyes hollywood is portrayed as a dirty and corrupted place but on the other hand also the most magical place for movies in the world it becomes a double sided sword that can be inspiring and magical but also cruel and dirty babylon is a portrayal of how great and magical cinema can be while the film itself is great and magical on its own its wonderful,POSITIVE,Comedy
407,8.0,14 May 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",not many films need to be three hours long but this one is epic in scale and ambition and cant be contained in less time its about the heaven and hell of giving up your life in pursuit of something bigger than you its about creativity fame approval money etc and it neither romanticises or demonises the process it just turns it into a wild ride everything in this film is intentionally overblown and relentless so that when someone does actually take a breather to be honest with themselves or with others it lands there are several compelling storylines to follow here but that of jack conrad a pitchperfect brad pitt probably captures the films tone best a movie star who realises his best days are behind him would in a lesser film be entirely bleak but in this one he understands how lucky he was however at the same time he also understands thats all he was and that without it theres nobody there in time this film will be recognised for the epic triumph that it is,POSITIVE,Comedy

410,1.0,29 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",right first off the opening scene in this film is phenomenal it is both about cinema whilst being great cinema i was captivated before the credits even came up the positives the film looks great and the performance by margot robbie is breathtaking it held so much promise and excitement from the beginning the negative hours what were you thinking of which at least were unnecessarily schmaltzy self indulgent and write honestly boring by the end i didnt care which the film was going to be wrapped up i just wanted it to end very disappointing i honestly feel that anyone who scored this film above must have seen a different film to me in trying to be nostalgic the whole film actually comes off as an overworked jumbled and very long mess far from making me enjoy the cinema it actually made me want to leave,NEGATIVE,Comedy

413,9.0,21 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",some like it when characters are used as dummies to prove some philosophical point or navigate through a certain periods turmoil this movie is not about an aspiring actress a mexican that wants to become a studio exec or a star that cannot find his place during the sound revolution it is about the futility of hollywood and of making movies or art in general it is about what drives us forward the desperate will to be remembered the anxiety that everybody forgets who we were and what we did once we die this point is made very explicitly in a scene toward the end of the film and well its a good point and its craftily enforced with the help of the dummy characters that populate the movie its not that the characters are too shallow its that they are typical like in balzacs works anyone could be nellie anyone could be manny the point is that life takes you in chews you and spits you out in hollywood it happens faster and more intensely than anywhere else so i gather the film is about the vanity of people wanting to become immortal just like when they set off to build the babylon tower and it shows how that happened in a particular time and place insinuating that it will happen again and again and thats all that there is to it take nellie for what she is and let her fade into the night,POSITIVE,Comedy

415,8.0,2 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",let me give you the keys to understand the movie right away this is a love story not between two people though a love story between a director and its art the cinema the movie is messy a lot is happening at the same time and it is filmed like a damien chazelle movie very fast camera moves i spent most of the movie trying to understand what was happening until the very end when i finally connected the dots the story has been done multiple times it is about how the cinema went from silent to the talkies but also about hollywoods drama and excesses with drugs and parties in the s the movie is funny heartfelt and sad if you have seen damien chazelle movies before you know that love is never the big winner as art is always higher in the eyes of the characters though id argue that this time the love story does win with chazelle showing us exactly what made him fall in love with the cinema and giving us all that we need to actually fall in love with it too the images are gorgeous over the top and colourful the actors were well directed and if you actually go through all the mess your patience will be rewarded with a cinematic sequence that will probably make you smile up until the very end of the movie it might give you an urge to watch another movie starring gene kelly debbie reynolds donald oconnor and jean hagen,POSITIVE,Comedy

418,4.0,8 March 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",full of grotesque and unnecessary nasty scenes that do not give any extra sense to the story dont waste hours of your life if you think that a good cast is a synonym of a good movie this film shows you that can be a big lie pitt and robbie can make this mess a little appealing you are wrong they can perform well but cannot save this horrible thing wheres the director it looks like theres none at least not a good one i wonder why this movie is not included for the razzies it would get many razzies maybe thats what the producers were looking for when they made babylon,NEGATIVE,Comedy

421,9.0,1 January 2024,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",the movie will leave a lasting impression despite its sometimes longer cuts and marauding plot this is not a feelgood theatrical production but its very much a cynical celebration of cinema and its dreamers with all the theatrical flair you can imagine crazy unexpected moments in the movie ranging from extreme ostentatious and depravity to extreme vulgarity and sentimentality it subtly turns a lense on the industry and exposes how it has dehumanised and objectified people by exploiting every persons vulnerabilities and how that in turn changes the people and that in turn changes cinema which in turn changes people again and what is particularly good is that the audience is also brought into the telling as well the cycle of emotions is felt throughout the film the promise of the american dream never fails to deliver on that emotional rollercoaster even if the dream results in failure my thinking is that many bad reviews may have been subconsciously annoyed that it essentially points a finger at every person,POSITIVE,Comedy

433,3.0,29 January 2024,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",i had high expectations for this film a three hour long big budget movie starring brad pitt it must be good or at least a decent movie unfortunately thats not the case here after i have been struggling to get through the film i wondered what was this film really about what was the story more than a depiction of the decadent s in hollywood the main character in the film is manny a mexican migrant who ends up in the hollywood party scene after transporting an elephant to a party in a hollywood mansion at the party he meets the wannabe star nellie brad pitts character is a director but his character plays a less prominent role in the plot most of the film is devoted to manny and nellie so there isnt much of a story things just happen in the film someone gets an overdose some bad guys wants to collect a gambling debt from nellie etc there isnt much story that gives depth to the events that takes place although there is certainly enough time for it there is also an overuse of shockvalue in the film such as in the beginning when mannys mexican partner gets pooped on by the elephant they are transporting or when nellie is bitten in the neck by a rattle snake that doesnt want to let go there is also an overuse of curse words particularly the f word which i wonder if its usage was so widespread at that time the acting is pretty poorly executed as well its more emphasis on screaming and cursing than to give a complexity to the characters in general this film doesnt give me a feeling of how life in hollywood was in the s it feels more like a contemporary setting that together with that film is really long and boring makes the experience to be just a waste of time,NEGATIVE,Comedy

436,8.0,6 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",a film that has been unfairly battered by critics and certainly deserves much more recognition than it has received on its way through movie screens damien chazelles new is an excessive ode to the hollywood of the s and the change it has undergone with the birth of talkies a powerful film that intentionally exaggerates him behind the scenes of a film industry that as a whole with all the good and bad that runs through its veins continues to entertain and dazzle us to this day damien chazelle allows himself to create his most ambitious film to date and the result can be divided into two parts a first hour and a half where what babylon gives us is a true work of art it is a film that takes us to the maximum excesses and a fabulous presentation of characters and world with the use of comedy as an initial kick and with two great very long sequences that place the film within almost absolute perfection and a second part where the drama and bad decisions are present to drop us abruptly to a second hour and a half where the decisions made by its director are a little more questionable that division that we can make with babylon in no way detracts from what a great movie it turns out to be it is rather the shock of sensations that can generate one as a spectator the reason is as simple as understanding that its director tries to cover too many aspects in which to count and nourish us with an evolution of cinema hand in hand with technology and the new generations now another big highlight is the casts interpretations of him margot robbie is amazing in the skin of nellie laroy and is the great center that has all this work created by chazelle a brad pitt who also overwhelms her accompanied by a diego calva who try to be the artistic triangle of the work of her director beyond the brilliant interpretations it is also to frame that these characters also suffer a bit from the excess placed on everything that babylon means at times the characters are very close to being great caricatures and lose the most natural authenticity of said characters we are in the presence of a film that gives us a clear message of what cinema means and what cinema is at its root with its excesses and its defects it is the most conquering art with which we are impregnated and that leaves it of course a script that transports us to remove those masks that an industry usually has that at times is very satisfactory for those who are inside it but it is also a very cruel journey due to the reality that everything happens and everything is renewed for both the big faces like the smaller ones that make up this industry technology and changes are the great villains that damien chazelle presents to us in an industry that gives you everything and also quickly leaves you empty if you dont know how to understand it wonderful is the dialogue that brad pitt has with jean smart and that perfectly synthesizes what babylon is in its central matter a film that paradoxically has suffered from the excesses that compose it but that makes me think that it is the great satisfaction of its director and perhaps what gives him a smile at the end of the day,POSITIVE,Comedy
437,2.0,18 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",babylon is an outrageously aimless film and field overlaps of different genres of cinema making it messy with inconclusive subplots it leaves one wondering and completely confused what exactly was the story supposed to be it felt like experiencing a nightmare and not quite knowing the meaning of that nightmare it is a pity that with such an ensemble cast and beautiful costuming that the film does not successfully execute the storytelling aspect of the film the being of the film is promising and almost sentiment in its aspiration to call chronological celebrate cinematic milestone but unfortunately it has too sub plot happening all at once and with slight comedy gags it is extremely long with a running hm absolutely a disappointing to have sat through that aimless mess,NEGATIVE,Comedy

441,4.0,11 September 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",i just saw the movie babylon on the flight to nyc its weird that hollywood would make yet another movie about the depravity of hollywood but this time by demonstrating that depravity on screen and it was a rehash of tired themes in many movies about hollywood maybe i was supposed to root for all the drugs rapes deaths and crimes because there wasnt a single character who saw anything wrong with thateach character was pretty despicable and a waste of some great acting talent plus any deep meaning was lost in the final minutes when the story takes a turn into some kind of bizarre torture porn,NEGATIVE,Comedy

446,9.0,25 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",to me babylon had to meet high expectations for me to leave the theater satisfied and it did mostly chazelle manages to combine charming as well as grotesque scenes into one big homage to early hollywood he does so by creating scenes one might call obscene the whole opening sequence but at the same time manages to include a vast amount of very slow and even intimate parts asking big questions about the importance of once legacy as well as life itself all of this is brought together by four characters which all are connected but at the same time tell their own stories be it nelly laroy margot robbie a young woman with the wish to become a big movie star manny torres diego calva a man trying to fit in and work his way up jack conrad brad pitt a movie star maybe at the top of his career yet not satisfied or sidney palmer jovan adepo a musician dreaming big they are all wellacted and have one thing in common they want to be famous and loved all of them are trying to achieve their dreams in different ways they are all differently successful at it but in the end they all share the same bittersweet insight the nothingness which we all must face and that happiness is to be found in the small simple things of life the movie is concluded with a wonderful voyage through cinema that reminds all of us why we love the movies and the big screen which is at its core what the movie is about the love for movies,POSITIVE,Comedy
447,1.0,17 September 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",stopped watching this film at about the minute mark and i think that was pretty generous considering there wasnt much going on the plot and much of the acting is rather flat and boring yes boring the film opens with a party sequence that is intended to titillate the audience but its literally just an attempt to titillate it doesnt actually work the camera does not get placed within the party but is pedestrian a camera that is just taken around to look at people and stuff rather than actually being engagedinvested in the scenes so boring so ordinary when the sequence is supposed to present a set of scenes out of the ordinary weird i guess the writerdirector has mistakenly assumed that his audience has never seen an out of the ordinary film before even margot robbie doesnt find the correct tone for her character even though shes taken on a role that affords her literally plenty of freedom did robbie actually consider her character is supposed to exist in the s i think not she plays the party scenes as if her character lived just last week,NEGATIVE,Comedy

449,1.0,5 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",i got first introduced to on of damien chazzles latest work and its called la la land thanks to my big sister anyways when i watched as a new audience to on of damien chazzles film i realised how unique his writing and directing point of view was and how he appreciated the old fashioned hollywood cinema you can really see how much work he puts on his fictional characters to make them as realistic as possible and even make them realable with chazzles passion of cinema which i understand have inspired me as a writer and understand whats the point of siting and looking at a movie on the big screen back in damien chazzle announced that he was going to start production on a new film called babylon he was set to direct it and even write the script since then i was on the edge of my seat every day of waiting for this film to come out because i have understood how great chazzle as a filmmaker is when it came out three years later it lived up to my expectations and once again damien chazzle does a excellent job with the movie especially with the characters babylon is set in early hollywood s where we can see a big evolution in cinema from film pictures to sound pictures that we have today the film is full of great actors such as margot robbie brad pitt and a newcomer called diego calva when you as an audience watch this movie its like watching wolf of wall street but on high steroids the movie was fast paced with bombastic and disgusting scenes but the film self centres in a romanticall aspects between two characters the two characters that the film focuses around is manny and nellie both played by diego calva and margot robbie these characters are much like mia and sebastian in la la land where their love clashes together at the wrong time i loved how damien chazzle implanted such a beautiful romantic story arc between manny and nellie and you can really understand and appreciate how much they love each other even in the wrong time and place brad pitts character is called jack conrad jack conrad was an interesting character in the story he was a belloved and famous actor in the progress we could slowly see his downfall as an actor because cinema evolves every decade and the audience grows ever larger his story arc is very similar to the actor himself brad pitt where he once was a belloved actor when he was young but as soon as he got older he has gotten a major downfall in his career which i love that damien chazzle adapt that in his own story of babylon to really understand what these old actors go through this whole movie was also very comedic most of the times and i havent laughed so hard on cinema in a long time because the writing in these comedic moments were amazing the ending was very unexpected as always with damien chazzles film and a great tribute to cinema the whole point of the movie is damien chazzles answer to the big question why is cinema so important in the movie we learnd that cinema is important to us because we feel no anxiety or feelings when we watch movie on the big screen we are living trough the screen at the credit it shows shots of different movies because the movie is trying to explain how the audience have evolved cinema ans even shows a breif shot of avatar the only negative about the movie is that some parts in the movie feels like they were miss placed and should switch order another masterpiece of my favourite director damien chazzle thanks for reading my thoughts on babylon,POSITIVE,Comedy

466,3.0,7 January 2024,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",babylon is an overlong film at hours plus with an identity crisis the only saving grace is the cast elevates the material as best as they can without this cast the film would have been an even bigger trainwreck the film focuses on multiple character storylines all in the backdrop of early s hollywood on paper it seems like an interesting concept but on screen its not as interesting margot robbie and brad pitt try their hardest to save this so called epic but in the end there is only so much screen prescence that they can bring i almost feel that if they director would have went in the musical direction with this film it would have been better the visuals are one of the better areas for this movie babylon is not the epic we were promised instead it ends up being one of the biggest bombs of babylon gets a very low stars out of from me,NEGATIVE,Comedy

481,9.0,11 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",it is kind of ironic that a movie which has to be seen on the big screen bombed at the box office dont be deterred by the seemingly long runtime itll pass by rather quickly but the picture simply must be seen at the cinema because there is so much going on in literally every other frame and this is a film that should be experienced within an audience as its quite funny and entertaining come join the party i havent had this much fun at the movies since knives out i like the way chazelle used an ensemble cast a lot of extras and long shots to tell a story about a period where excess was a norm there is so much of everything and it helps to drive the constant feeling of chaos and nonstop craziness but the biggest contributor to all this is an outstanding score by justin hurwitz which for me should be a clear oscar winner in addition i loved a lot of the frames and sequences and altogether it makes for a stunning viewing the director managed to incorporate a lot of good quality humor into the storytelling all the while following the arcs of several characters margot robbie steals the show embodying the role of wild child perfectly and sowing madness whenever she steps in the frame even though robbies performance was excellent pitts was even better brads act oozes class and elegance and its been a long time since i walked out of a movie theater wanting to be like a character i just saw his demeanor on screen as a star at that time was perfect diego calva might have announced himself to the wider film public with a strong performance however i felt that the ending could have been better and left a little to be desired but overall i would still recommend you to see it especially if you can catch it in theaters,POSITIVE,Comedy

495,9.0,13 July 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",babylon is a comedy drama film written and directed by damien chazelle whiplash la la land first man starring brad pitt margot robbie and diego calva it offers the viewer a no holds barred look at an important transitional era in classic hollywood in young mexican immigrant manny torres diego calva arrives in los angeles where he aspires to become part of the movie business as he works one night at a party held at a studio executives large mansion manny meets nellie laroy margot robbie an unapologetically brash upandcoming actress whose attitude causes him to become smitten with her later that night manny befriends silent film star jack conrad brad pitt who takes a liking to manny after he drives jacks drunken self home from the party to show his gratitude jack gives manny an assistant job at the studio which helps him rise through the ranks of the film industry meanwhile nellies popularity begins to soar with her brand of sassiness landing her many starring roles in silent films as the decade advances sound films start to phase out silent features and while manny manages to adapt to the changes both nellie and jack struggle to conform to these new creative demands one of the most pivotal eras in the history of cinema was the decade known colloquially as the roaring twenties it was early in this period that silent films reigned supreme with their visual storytelling leaving an impact on audiences worldwide however with the release of sound features like the jazz singer in silent movies were eventually phased out to allow for more open creativity in filmmaking during this transitional stage film studios were forced to adapt with the times and many silent film stars who didnt comply were quickly forgotten about by the public in damien chazelles babylon we are shown an overly extravagant and unrelenting chronicle of the hollywood system during this era in a film that does not let up on its depiction of debauchery the film wastes no time introducing its audience to the wild immorality that was rampant during this time period in only the first scene our main character manny is seen helping transport a large elephant to a party rife with orgies cocaine use and excessive drunkenness everywhere he steps upon arriving we notice that theres barely a place where manny can walk that isnt a graphic debaucherous experience for both him and the viewer since the films title alludes to babylon an ancient city infamous for its sin and depravity it makes sense for it to open with such shocking content as it is clearly intended to show the parallels between this era of hollywood and the titular biblical city no doubt the extent of what is going on at this party will be difficult to stomach for many unsuspecting audiences but for those who can appreciate this clever comparison in a creative context will understand its necessity in setting the tone for things to come something else that should prove challenging to some viewers is the films lengthy runtime of over three hours minutes to be precise although the film is never boring the sheer scale of its story means there is a lot of content to cover focusing primarily on the dire consequences of living a hedonistic lifestyle though i do appreciate the film for not holding back with its epic showcase of the degeneracy of that time even a seasoned viewer like myself found it hard to sit through many scenes that essentially serve the same purpose once youve witnessed hordes of people doing drugs during a mass orgy you tend to become desensitised to the other depraved scenes shown over the course of three hours by the time the film reaches the final act we are treated to even more disturbing scenes some of which i cannot even write here out of fear of being censored most of these parts felt like they were inserted for shock value and dont really contribute anything useful to the story with that in mind some of these moments appear to be played for macabre laughs so depending on how twisted your sense of humour is you could consider it the films attempt at comic relief through its three lead characters director damien chazelle shows us the different ways the shift from silent to sound films affected the various people employed in the industry for example manny is required to learn the importance of working on a quiet set as even the slightest noise can undo an entire days worth of setting up a scene due to the thenprimitive technology available at the time one otherwise simple scene can lead to several takes just to get it right in nellies case she is unable to properly speak her lines at an audible volume as she is not used to acting using her voice in addition to her appearance her frustrations reach a boiling point quite literally when she finds the temperature of the set is too hot because air conditioners cannot be used during filming due to noise being a veteran in the business jack assumes he can easily adjust to the times in sound films but audiences are unable to take him seriously due to his inability to act beyond his physical limitations as a result his popularity quickly fades causing him to sink into a deep depression what i enjoyed about this film was the clever way chazelle featured all three characters stories intertwining with each other at certain points sometimes incidentally and sometimes deliberately in doing so he gives us a wider scope of the changes going on during this period and how they necessitated everybodys acquiescence to this new style of filmmaking no matter how insignificant despite being billed lower than his better known costars i think diego calva was the true highlight of the film as manny the reason for this is that manny is the character with the most room to grow essentially starting out as a blank canvas with only his uncertain future in the film industry to paint it for him i really enjoyed watching how manny changes throughout the course of the story going from a mild mannered immigrant to a powerhouse figure in the business of filmmaking transitioning near seamlessly from silent to sound movies it isnt easy to upstage two alist actors but calva somehow managed to pull all of this off with flying colours margot robbie also shines as nellie a woman whose distinct personality helped make her a star in the world of motion pictures though her character arc isnt anything new she comes from a broken home like most of these starlets it is robbies performance that helps elevate nellie above what could have been another depiction of hollywood conditioning her diva behaviour coupled with her personal insecurities mirrors real life silent film star clara bow who notably struggled to keep up with the advent of sound pictures taking over the medium she was already so familiar with you cant help but feel a bit sorry for nellie even if half the time she brings her problems on herself throughout the story the most tragic character in the film has to be jack played in a sympathetic light by brad pitt at first i half expected pitt to play jack as a cocky womaniser but he is actually relatively goodnatured for the most part at least by famous celebrity standards here is a man who knows his star is fading often reduced to the butt of many jokes by gossip columnists and audiences alike all around him new and younger faces are emerging to take his place in the spotlight viewing him as nothing more than a product of a bygone era no matter how hard he tries to adjust to change jack just cannot seem to find a way to remain relevant in this new world of talking pictures like nellie he too is a victim of the hollywood system for those who take a particular interest in film history babylon provides an uncompromising view of how things really were during a crucial changeover period in the world of cinema it may not be easy for many to sit through but anyone brave enough to endure on can view it as an important parable about what hollywood has always done to those who have made it in their cutthroat industry the films limited appeal is perhaps its biggest downfall as i cannot really see anybody beyond a curious film buff taking an interest in wanting to watch it on that note i just so happen to be one of those viewers so i suppose there is a audience out there for it after all i rate it,POSITIVE,Comedy
496,1.0,28 March 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",honestly when the movie opened with a poop joke i was afraid i thought this was the humor we were going to get for the rest of the movie and i was right sort of there is an abundance of crude humor in this film which isnt necessarily a bad thing but a lot of it is the typical adult comedy gross out humor or excessive profanity defecating on people throwing up on people the usual stuff at this point that kind of humor is just really boring to me but the audience in my theater was having a blast with the jokes so who am i to say its not funny but there were a fair amount of good jokes for me too though they were more like side jokes rather than the longer gags the movie does but even though this movie is advertised mainly as a comedy first there is luckily so much more to this film this movie has a very long prologue but it is a blast the set and choreography at the party is extremely loud and chaotic but its entertaining and establishes our main characters perfectly the movie seems like director damien chazelle took the wolf of wall street and once upon a time in hollywood mashed them together and seasoned it with a touch of cinema paradiso and obviously singin in the rain except that ouatih and cinema paradiso are more of a love letter to classic cinema this movie does not shy away from showing how disgusting arrogant and shallow the film industry can be though it does ultimately end on a positive note in my interpretation the story follows an aspiring filmmaker an aspiring actress and a superstar at the end of his career all these characters are great and obviously played amazingly by this all star cast the standout for me being diego calva who i didnt even know before this movie but his character is super likeable and he does surprisingly hold his own against brad pitt and margot more than once the movie kind of leaves you hanging with its story it jumps from one crazy and over the top scene to the next but it doesnt lose focus of our protagonists and develops them alongside the mayhem going on around them somewhere around the middle part of the movie things almost slow to a halt and it makes you wonder where the heck they will go from here because it has a runtime of about hrs i knew there was more to come but surprisingly enough it picks up again with the introduction of tobey maguires character who is hilarious maybe im biased because ive never seen him in a role like this and it threw me off but from there on out it gets even crazier as you may be able to tell the movie does a lot of things and it does balance them well even though like mentioned before it does leave you hanging with where the movie is going more than once as usual in a damien chazelle film the soundtrack is amazing it underscores the craziness of this film perfectly and sometimes just goes all out with its speed and volume so thats babylon id say if the first part of my review didnt scare you away youre going to have a great time with this film there is so much here for film lovers and generally is just a really good time too bad that the marketing failed the movie because i do think it does have a wider appeal than what the box office shows,POSITIVE,Comedy

525,8.0,21 March 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",babylons over twenty years of fundamentally decadent culture compressed intoa little over hours seemed overthetop to me at first until i realized that the films depravity was not gratuitous it was essential to the real life facts that had to be condensed to fit the films time constraints the sexual excesses were also all of a piece with the absurd production faults depicted in the movies stories about movie making in that time and place contrapuntal accents in movie making vignettes expressing hope and humanity for example the audiences reaction to al jolsons the jazz singer and in the jovan adepo character sidney palmers glorious jazz artistry were accentuated that much more by the background of a maximally debauched culture having written these thoughts i am now getting a david lynchian read off of the mix of perfect flaws in babylons production design i see a selfreferential critique on the inevitable nuts and bolts of movie making similar to the obviously mechanical stuffed robin that is central to the closing frames of another thematic hybrid of cinema lynchs film blue velvet,NEGATIVE,Comedy
526,3.0,9 April 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",an extremely long extravagant movie with a huge budget a million actors but no lead role and no script four subplots four stories of four different people trying their luck in the industry four stories that have no end and no connection to each other and none of them is worth mentioning an absolute madness of how people party work succeed or fail on their lives but you have no connection to a main character as there isnt one and no one has an interesting story worth remembering or rewatching i rate movies that i would never rewatch lower than if you see it as a documentary of an erabyera cinema history maybe you should try watching it but if you like movies with a plot there isnt one,NEGATIVE,Comedy
527,9.0,12 June 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",if you ever felt like you were drowning in a celluloid stream of crap and just wanted to see a movie a great movie this movie is a life raft for movie buffs ive been waiting years for a movie like this i have critiques what in the hell were the producers thinking of green lighting this moviu but thank you it will be a classic film nd is im so tired of movies being to long babylon did not waste a second im fact it was understandably couldnt go any longer and i definitely dont need another television series however for the filmmakers editing this masterpiece must have felt like killing their family i cant imagine how rough it was to edit picture in a time that movies run to long this one cuts it to s short i could be on my death bed and it still wouldnt have been long enough no joke,POSITIVE,Comedy
528,1.0,22 March 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",we can all agree that both margot and brad were amazing in there acting so the stars only for their acting nontheless the movie was utter garbage i felt that the director was forcing the movie to be exactly three hours i was literally skipping the last minutes for the unneeded scenes plus the gross scenes were not needed at all i mean why im a person who doesnt get disgusted usually but this movie was over the limits with this i didnt understand the concept of tobey maguires scene im still shocked that this movie got this rating i would not recommend this movie for anyone to watch i advice you to skip this movie it aint worth it,NEGATIVE,Comedy
529,1.0,8 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",babylon is way better than i thought it would be but i supose that shouldnt be surprising as its made by damien chazelle who made the awesome whiplash and has a reliable cast even if the trailer didnt do the movie any favours its interesting because i never realised hollywood was so wild and messed up during the silent s era and you wouldnt think these days how much talkies changed everything back then after a gross opening which may put many off the movie gets alot better when the plot kicks in and shows the rise and fall of these characters its original funny shocking and even has a suspenceful bit like something out of a horror movie starring tobey maguire margot robbie is fantastic in the movie which really reminded me of wolf of wall street in that its about a horrible lifestyle thats successful for a while until its not a great movie about a time largely forgotten about,POSITIVE,Comedy
530,8.0,28 July 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",the first time i started watching babylon i gave up after an hour and a half i felt that it was needlessly overblown and could only appeal to anyone whod been a star in the s and was now crying in their whiskey over glories past by the grace of the movie gods i had the good fortune to sit down and fully watch it with a clear head what a brilliant brilliant film this was chizelle is essentially offering commentary not only on the nature of hollywood itself but on peaking and falling into obscurityirrelevance and how we deal with it your character will determine whether you retire gracefully or whether you will disappear into a maelstrom of disgrace and humiliation its divided into roughly three acts the first is excess and champagne vain glory whilst visually and technically dazzling this is by far the emptiest part and the one most likely to turn a viewer away thinking that this is some pretentious flop stay the course though and you will be rewarded by incredible second and third acts that truly reach for the heart of show business extra props for the virtuosic depiction of hell in los angeles and the kubrickinspired final montage a remarkable achievement this is a modern classic whose legacy will grow with time,POSITIVE,Comedy
531,1.0,17 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",obviously every film has a plot and this one has too the only thing is that the plot is so incredibly weak boring and just plain messy that i couldnt even watch it till the end i left min before the end because it just seemed to loop over and over again a total disappointment and an absolute waste of time the good things the acting very convincing the choreography and the photography at best this is more a fictitious documentary than an artistic film if you adjust your expectations and watch it with a mental cleanslate you might find it amusing but surely you will still feel the pain of hours passing by of your life which you ultimately can never reverse,NEGATIVE,Comedy
532,1.0,2 April 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",this is a movie for people who love movies and the cinema it has its flaws what movie doesnt but i spent a happy hours enthralled by the nods to cinematic history and to a lesser extent the story line dont get me wrong the story was a good one but it was a familiar one however in the past years or so there has been a dearth of original story telling and babylon felt fresh and vibrant and most importantly it will stay with me for quite a while the acting was fabulous especially diego calva who i hope to see more of in the future the music was superb and in fact so good that i downloaded the soundtrack as soon as the movie had finished there was a small montage right at the end of the movie that had me smiling it was a lot of clips from the history for cinema but i think that a lot of people will associate with it and with calvas reaction i understand that the movie seems to be a bit marmite as we say in the uk you either love it or hate it i loved it and so did my wife im years old and i only say this because the people who didnt like it might be used to the modern inferior way of story telling,POSITIVE,Comedy
533,1.0,22 March 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",im not an expert film critic so this will be a somewhat less detailed review than that of others but my advice would be not to waste your time on this film because in my opinion it is hugely overrated and not worth watching the general plot is weak messy and poorly executed even the debauchery and nude scenes that many are raving about are not enough to make this worth watching unless you enjoy sex and nudity that has a perversely twisted and completely abnormal theme to it certainly not my cup of tea but if its your kind of thing im sure there is plenty to watch for free on the internet,NEGATIVE,Comedy
534,1.0,26 October 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",a too honest for its own good story about movie making history it is not a story about it its a documentarie about it got me discusted got me on my edge of the seat got me hopeful and got my hopes destroyed too real and obviously fabricated just like the movies tells the story of fame the desire of it and how it doesnt really matter in the end or does it what is life if not the stories we have to tell or the stories that are told of us wouldnt reccomend for the faint of hearted would not reccomend for romantics would heartly reccomend for movie lovers would reccomend,POSITIVE,Comedy
535,1.0,9 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",but for those who can enjoy this kind of movie it is a glorious insane ride if you plan to see with this your parents or anyone with a self sense of decency that may be disgusted by animalistic behavior dont it will be too long for them and will probably not be able to see the point of the movie at all other than the excess and insanity going on which is fantastically honest in my opinion but some people dont like seeing ulgy truths is the movie perfect no but is certainly one of the most enjoyable films of and it easily makes top for me from that year though its obvious why it was not nominated for an oscar the film either critiques or promotes the hollywood insanity behind the scenes that existed since it was born and will continue to exist after we are all gone there are some very memorable dialogues that leave you thinking breathtaking cinematography the acting was on point for all actors the music was fantastic and the story is absolutely insane but surprisingly grounded with mostly believable consequences this is to some extent the raw truth of cinema history which is beautiful and terrible at the same time but it always will be larger than life i already want to watch it again specially the first half the second half gets a much slower pace but with some very interesting dramatic scenes i would recommend it only to people capable of seeing beyond the insanity and have a great sense of humor if you are not skip it,POSITIVE,Comedy
536,1.0,23 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",to be clear the first minutes involve feces urine other bodily fluids and anatomy and significant nudity and sexuality im not saying any of this as a reflection on the quality of the picture nor are these constants but only to say that this isnt necessarily what i was expecting and potential viewers should be aware of both this and the fact that the opening sequence prior to the appearance of the name of the movie on the screen is onesixth the total length this is in addition to or perhaps part and parcel of the picture being a hair over three hours long often frenetic pacing and the fact that for whatever discrete narrative or character arcs may present this is above all a bit of a freeform fictionalized portraiture of a time a place and a decadent dream of neverending splendor and cinematic wonder therewith there are also fragments of behindthescenes glimpses of moviemaking marketing and the private lives of major film figures dovetailing in with the press and public perception and all woven into the approximate setting of the advent of talkies and the nuances of how everything changed for everyone all this is to say that figuratively and literally babylon is a bit of a kaleidoscope and a cacophony whipping together the coen brothers hail caesar quentin tarantinos once upon a time in hollywood and michel hazanavicius the artist but with significantly more bombast even more selfindulgence and raucous almost vulgar flavors of sex language and comedy laid over top of sincere storytelling does all this sound like a lot it is especially as the vibe alternates irregularly between zesty and softspoken there is truly meaningful and impactful story here the telling of the rise and fall of various persons in hollywood at this moment in time along with everything that the picture is and entails some of the zip and bluster is overwhelming the opening sequence is a prime example some of the dramatic beats are extra ponderous the sequence in which a character films their first sound scene is monstrously tense sometimes the zip and bluster overwhelms what would be ponderous dramatic beats note a characters response when a director asks them how they achieve the desired effect in a scene and how nonchalantly the film moves on sometimes the earnest drama peeks through the inane grandiosity one figures ascendancy paired with others decline is almost a gut punch with all this having been said for everything here that goes so very right filmmaker damien chazelle struggles to maintain a consistent tone in either his screenplay or his direction there are so very many characters and dialogue of such wildly opposed flavors filling scenes that dance across so many ideas and story threads in a narrative that spans several years babylon is fabulously ambitious with expansive breadth yet the depths that it explores vary substantially from impressive to just right to insufficient some beats land like heavy blows others dont quite cut it such oscillation is not helped by additional garnishes of content throughout lgbtq themes and homophobia racism sexism classism haughtiness otherwise prejudice drugs and alcohol and still much more all feeding into the comedy or the drama in turn this minute feature is overfull selfindulgent overlong and in some ways uneven and inconsistent it is also however brilliant and superbly well made in all regards its an enormous and stellar cast assembled here and from the huge stars to the lesser known players everyone gives outstanding performances of range and nuance just glancing at the credits is a journey margot robbie samara weaving diego calva olivia hamilton li jun li jovan adepo ethan suplee jean smart brad pitt jeff garlin eric roberts katherine waterston and so many more all exceptional from one to the next while chazelle has difficulty attaining the exact perfect feel for his feature from a technical standpoint of orchestrating shot and scenes his direction is impeccable while sometimes overzealous as its employed tom cross editing is sharp and lively linus sandgrens cinematography is crisp vibrant and exquisite the production design art direction costume design and hair and makeup work are exemplary to say nothing of stunts effects and props all a tremendous feast for the eyes across the board and an immense credit to those behind the scenes and as if all this werent enough the sound design is pristine allowing justin hurwitzs rich dynamic grabbing electrifying phenomenal original score to ring through with utmost gratifying clarity while the music in a movie can sometimes help to set it apart and elevate scenes to new levels sometimes its extraordinary entirely on its own and i think this is absolutely true for hurwitz far be it from me to emphasize the point but voodoo mama is surely one of the best individual themes to appear in a movie in recent memory i understand why babylon crashed with audiences and met with mixed reception from critics from the moment the first trailer dropped it seemed like it was effectively being marketed as the next best picture winner and intended as such with assumption that it would be sights unseen it seemed full of itself and this is to say nothing of the considerably prohibitive threehour runtime i readily admit that while i was interested in the title in passing as it was set to open in theaters i took one look at its length and knew i couldnt sit through it without being able to pause factor in the nature of some of the content and its no wonder why the project didnt meet with the anticipated results having now watched for myself i can safely say that it unquestionably falls short to at least some measure personal experience will vary especially as the tone ranges so widely furthermore the third hour in particular goes in directions that seem excessive unnecessary superfluous and maybe even a tad detached from what the picture has otherwise been building and for all the strength that the various threads possessed earlier it feels as though they generally resolve with unequal results and still for whatever flaws and problems trouble the production at one point or another by and large this is far more than not an excellent movie at its worst its too much imbalanced and unsteady at its best the selfconfident musings that posited the upcoming release as worthy of awards was no mere jest as one last incredible example the ending is equal parts phenomenal and overdone its a bumpy ride and a long journey but ultimately i do firmly and heartily believe babylon is fine engrossing enjoyable and strongly satisfying would perhaps that its faults werent as evident as its advantages but one can only take the sweet with the sour and at towering length this is a marvelously delicious viewing experience,POSITIVE,Comedy
537,1.0,3 August 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",unlike what a lot of critics have said its not an escapade nor is it exhausting it is a rebellious look at the revelries of the silentera in hollywood countless stories run their course unhurried each with an end that stays with you and colours the dichromatic screens it is beautiful and haunting in equal measure pensive and celebratory too it is an ode to the love for cinema and the fleeting boats those that work on it are on an absolute classic that people will keep coming back to to be ensnared by its beauty to praise the work of damien brad margot calva and the team it is a tribute to all the conrads and nellies that had their meteoric highs and deathly lows but will always be remembered dining at the table of apparitions for eternity rajyavardhan s,POSITIVE,Comedy

540,1.0,30 March 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",this film was better than i was lead to believe i heard critics dumping on the way it displayed hollywood hedonistic values i think that most people already assumed that the movie industry was a constant display of debauchery and secret liaisons for power and control its always interesting to me to get a glimpse of the behind the scenes of movie making not the power brokers but the mechanics of what goes into making you believe what you see on the screen with all its faults i think babylon is a good picture for consenting adults who can sit through a feature as long as this one definitely not for the younger set,POSITIVE,Comedy

550,4.0,4 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",babylon is not only a disgrace to the film industry but to chazelle himself its honestly baffling how no one told him this was absolutely rubbish the overuse of vulgar scenes and headache inducing music attempts and fails to mask the complete lack of plot and yet another type casting for both margot and brad it seems to be more suited to a fetish site rather than a cinema screen the film was genuinely unpleasant to watch as you are subject to painfully cringeworthy scenes and a complete indecisiveness upon the overall narrative theme and to top it all off it even associated itself with the amazing singin in the rain,NEGATIVE,Comedy

615,1.0,5 March 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",babylon chazelles newest is very similar to la la land in that it transports the viewers to an era long forgotten and the film essentially delivers a retrospection of that era too this movie takes the viewers back by a century to the era of silent movies blossoming hollywood and the start of the sound movie era the characters are amazingly written and the story with its pacing music and cast takes you through the lives of actors beyond the screen the acts and pacing are very drama like and most of the time this is very enjoyable the movie also maintains a subtle humor throughout and shows what entertainment of the elite in that era meant a little too bitterly with all this being said the movie has its fair set of short comings too the pacing for one is so slow at a few instances that coupled with the background score being cut off lead one to think maybe somethings broken,POSITIVE,Comedy

635,8.0,24 July 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",i just saw babylon for the second time and i still liked it more than most people based on the imdb ratings in my opinion it is highly enjoyable and i caught myself smiling through entire scenes does it have its ups and downs yes definitely could the film have been even better by just editing some of the weaker segments down a little yes i think so in my opinion one of babylons strengths is that it leans fully into being entertaining rather than worrying about being realistic this is certainly more rare for period pieces than for fantasy or scifi movies beautiful sets fantastic cast smart quips and great dialogue and perhaps most importantly a few largerthanlife characters who are flawed enough to be likable almost relatable i may not be brad pitts biggest fan since he has had a tendency to mix great work with some fairly weak roles in babylon however he puts in a great performance his best since once upon a time in hollywood diego calva does a very good job and while margot robbie is solid throughout the film in some scenes she is nothing short of brilliant,POSITIVE,Comedy
636,5.0,3 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",for cinematography for the score for direction for acting for production design for costume design babylon does it for me because it ticks more of my good boxes rather than bad so ill give it to it for the effort that i cannot overlook and one also that no movie lover or anyone who truly knows a good movie can take away from the movie however it was a little too much at most times some scenes were so unnecessary for example the scene with the snake fight what was that for it did not need to be there and could have saved space for other meaningful scenes that could have added more depth to the story especially the characters the nellie leroy outburst scene at the industry party was overdramatized and too prolonged it could have ended better entirely the movie is too chaotic for me even though i recognize the directors effort at trying to do something different i appreciate that some of my favourite scenes are the ones where brad pitt jack conrad talks with anna may wong in the hotel lobby and walks up afterwards to his room that was pure perfection coupled with that stellar music accompanying it the second scene was where elinor st john tells him the hard truth overall id watch it again and perhaps again if you dont like fastpaced chaotic movies then dont watch,POSITIVE,Comedy
637,5.0,3 April 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",mr chazelle loves his set pieces and to be fair does them brilliantly he has come unstuck here though my main problem with this film is the plot its telling nothing particularly new a few reviewers have referenced a star is born and singing in the rain as similar in plot and i agree with that also some of the scenes in this film are so disgusting and so incredibly graphic and are utterly unnecessary and just cos you can include scenes like that in films these days doesnt mean you should a bit of self restraint would not have gone amiss here there is also a scene where margot robbies character visits her mother in the sanitarium a pointless scene that if hed wanted to could have been dealt with with one line of dialogue in the script this scene albeit short is symptomatic of this films biggest flaw the story doesnt flow and is too disjointed and tries to cover too much material and fails to draw you in hes a great filmmaker and theres great acting in this and there are a couple of belly ache laugh out load scenes but overall its a disappointment,NEGATIVE,Comedy

692,4.0,13 June 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",rating overall a chaotic mess from a talented director as he fails to direct his poorly constructed narrative cause he tries too hard to go for shock and humor that it goes for grotesque and unwatchable so much to the point that even the competent performances cannot even save the trainwreck that is over three hours long bad direction the whole movie just feels like a mess as everything is super chaotic and the narrative just gets very hard to follow as it goes on damien chazelle really does not get the most out of his actors as he tries to really go for more shock than trying to get powerful performances from them decent acting pretty good from brad pitt really pulls more from experience to help get through this as his character just feels like a more chaotic version of the one he played in once upon a time in hollywood but as it tries to get deeper it just misses the mark more pretty good to good from margot robbie uses the experience she has playing the socialites to help drive the performance as it just feels like she is playing a combination of characters she has played in the past pretty good to good from diego calva does a good job for the most part being the lens of the movie and really holds his own when working with more established actors pretty bad from jean smart decent from jovan adepo he is pent up to be a very important character but they just do not use him well enough to show what he can do decent from li jun li bad to pretty bad from the rest of the cast just chaotic overall and a lot of the performances feel like overacting pretty bad story the actual theme of the movie is somewhat interesting but the plot itself is just incredibly long and the elements really do not work well off of each other as it feels like the story is progressing but going backwards at the same time even though it could be argued this is intentional pretty bad screenplay the symbolism just feels very shallow and the foreshadowing is very predictable the dialogue is also very forced and superficial good score pretty good cinematography there were many shots from a grand scale that make the movie look very nice as it helped with establishing the big sets and scenes but the constant fast moving of the camera to help with making the movie chaotic really got nauseating at times as it felt very amateurish pretty good sound very bad editing it just tries to hard to be shock but ends up just being nauseating also the editing towards the end just feels like something a year old would do good visual effects good to very good production design does do a good job in helping establish the time period plot structure was very bad as it was just a chaotic mess of elements trying to movie the story forward with the resolution basically being unnecessary as the movie could have ended at the climax and still would have been the same movie pacing was very bad as the movie drags a lot after the halfway point of the movie as it tries to fit in so much plot that is very unnecessary to tell the story minutes of the movie could have been cut and it would have been the same movie climax was interesting but still has elements of shock that are really unnecessary the ending of the movie was completely unnecessary and the final scene felt really awkward and forced for no reason tone was really trying to be comedic with a mix of chaos and black comedy but there were many awkward silences that just made the movie feel more awkward and grotesque than what it was trying to go for,NEGATIVE,Comedy

696,5.0,7 April 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",for example the opening scene filled with wondrous and horrifying sights massively overstays its welcome the film has many pornographic scenes and that opening scene begins what i viewed as poisonpen letter to hollywoods silent era a threehourplus extravaganza of debauchery general misery and overflowing movie magic that sets the industry aflame and invites the audience to dance around the bonfire it is just so sad that the writer producer and director had to include the debauchery along with the magic and yes the misery of some just too much misery its a daring thing for a major studio to put out these days when big budgets tend to be lavished on superheroes and babylons caustic indulgence will likely put many theatergoers off they may have been trying to make a point with all the excess that the joy of cinema has always gone hand in hand with exploitation abuse and offscreen villainy but movie goers dont want to pay their hard earned dollars to view misery and pornography unfortunately those tones erase the really great parts of the movie it took me times to finally not turn the movie off within the first scenes could have been a big hit but instead it made a lot of movie goers sick to their stomach and depressed we want to spend our money for a little escape from all the problems of the present world to leave a film feeling good,NEGATIVE,Comedy

699,1.0,3 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",i was more disappointed than anything else with babylon as i was very much looking forward to seeing a film about hollywoods golden era it fell rather flat unfortunately and just ended up dragging on as most films made by hollywood about hollywood tend to do theyre incapable of being unbiased i suppose what irked me a little too was the disservice they did to some of the stars pitt hammed it up as he usually does now so well like his role in bullet train but set in the past robbie looked like shed stepped out of a s music video with dance moves not like a s starlet and calva spends most of the film looking gormless it felt more like a copy and paste job of some other films like the great gatsby in some places and nothing about it felt new in fact singing in the rain still tackles this period the best and that was made in,NEGATIVE,Comedy

723,4.0,27 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",i was very curious to see babylon since i liked a lot both of the previous three film by damien chazelle but unfortunately i was disappointed here the movie has a lot of great things about it first of all the score is phenomenal thank you again justin hurwitz the performances are strong the scenes are always well shot even though sometimes chazelle goes too far to show his abilities and the cinematography is also very good all these things results in a large number of memorable and funny scenes that i personally loved and i will remember for sure but so if i liked so much so many things why did i consider babylon disappointing well because once considering the movie as a whole and not just like a series of great scenes babylon feels unbalanced highly chaotic and unsubsequential first of all the ending is bad its too long to the point in which for the last minutes i kept saying to myself ok its finished oh yes now its totally finished thats the ending but it kept going on and the last five minutes are an insult to the viewers intelligence since it makes the message too explicit as if heshe couldnt get it by hisher own while the rest of the movie though packed with great things doesnt lead to almost anything characters dont develop two of the three protagonists are caricatures the one played by brad pitt is a poor mans rick daltonriggan thomson and his arc feels too fast in the second part of the movie other characters like the black trumpeter and the asian lady are abandoned for large parts of the movie and their potential is partially wasted not to mention the very intriguing gangsterhorror section in the final act that comes out from nowhere and its useful only to conclude in a rush the plot a perfect example to what i said earlier about liking the scenes but not how they fit in the plot is the initial party its outstanding and fun but its something like minutes long and it has the only scope to introduce to the tone and to have two characters to meet a lot of super enjoyable wasted time since some characters as mentioned are then forgotten for long portions of the movie babylon is about changing times and how some people reacted and failed to adapt to the newest evolutions the concepts and ideas are surely interesting but the chaos and its unbalanced nature are not able to properly convey them thematically it has something of both once upon a timein hollywood and the wolf of wall street but even with their excesses tarantino and scorsese were able not to lose control of their ambitious creatures unfortunately chazelle did im sure that with his next project he will come back on track because babylon showed once again all his potential and some flashes of his crystalline talent,NEGATIVE,Comedy

775,4.71,11 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",i am a huge fan of damien chazelle and i was really looking forward to this ode to hollywood especially after loving whiplash and la la land and first man and truly wondered if this was going to be a masterpiece or another flop like amsterdam which was yet another film that seems to fall into the same category as this one a bloated confusing script that requires loads of editing for some reason it seems like some of these star directors just dont have the ability to edit their scripts films in a cohesive manner that removes the messiness does not move the story forward in an entertaining and fulfilling manner to complete the message and journey of the film where are the producers to guide the captain in troubled waters when they miss their mark much like brad pitts character that gets laughed at in his last film instead we end up with this overindulgent narcissistic hour bloated film that instead of being a master piece it ends up being a missed opportunity and sadly enough a mediocre clumsy film i felt like the director tried to cover way too many characters and an epic amount of a timeline with a massive goal of trying to make a historical film about hollywood from the s to the s or modern day for that matter and it was way too much for the writerdirector to accomplish in one film the film boogie nights was initially a hour bloated film and it was turned into hour masterpiece thanks due to the producer providing proper guidance to reduce the directors vision to a tighter hours and it was much more effective and a masterpiece unfortunately this film requires similar direction yet somehow it was allowed to be released in its entirety which is commendable yet it fails in a painful manner where people in the theatre are looking at the time on their phones wondering when its going to move forward and end the misery of such pointless sloppiness the film has many wonderful elements and beautiful moments and the cinematography is fantastic and the acting is stellar and the music had some solid moments yet i felt it had too many elements similar to la la land that just did not work but still these are minor issues compared to so many bloated scenes that couldve been cut like the dungeon scene with tobey maguire was totally unnecessary sidney palmers role did not really add much flair to the whole story the opening scene was almost minutes long that couldve been cut down but overall the one part that really did carry the film was diego calvers manny torres character was the one surprising element that carries the film from beginning to end and the love story with him and nellie laroys character was reduced to the point that it was meaningless i really enjoyed jean smarts character eleanor saint john scene with brad pitt which pretty much depicted the whole film storyline and the ending was simply a botched attempt to somehow blend it all together yet by this time it feels so out of place with this lame self indulgent reference to the timeline of all hollywood films even modern ones which seems a bit farfetched for a film that is such a flop and missed opportunity that it doesnt deserve to even be in the caliber of the films its mentioning i give it stars because it was such a wonderful attempt to make a hollywood tribute film but unlike so many other films have done a better job this one just felt like an overbloated complex mess damien chazelle is a master director and storyteller so looking forward to his next film and maybe the director will learn lessons from this one and maybe his next film will be more realistic and within his grasp as this film couldve easily been three feature films or a shorter length masterpiece stars,NEGATIVE,Comedy
776,4.71,31 May 2024,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",i love hearing about old hollywood but this movie was a total waste of hours i only kept watching thinking it might get better it didnt it seemed to be put together by someone with adhd it was just all over the place disjointed it could have easily been a hour movie that was less random with a better story there were some characters that werent explained well or how they fit into the story once i read about them on imbd it made more sense i guess the screenwriters knew so they were and how they fit in they just didnt let us know somehow we were supposed to know watch only if you have hours to waste,NEGATIVE,Comedy
777,4.71,20 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",yes thats mark kermodes joke babylon isnt all bad if they cut out the bad bits wed be left with a minute film that was slightly above average as it is however we get a bloated and overindulgent mess we start with a hollywood party where the hedonism and grossness are at a level which would make caligula think things had gone a bit far this distasteful opening is partially redeemed by an extended scene on a film set which i found genuinely funny after that however things go downhill we get a twisted and perverted version of singin in the rain more hedonism a rattlesnake a ghastly parody of pygmalion with projectilevomiting more hedonism and then the film takes us into the sewers literally and metaphorically the final montage is absurd in its pretentiousness margot robbie is good even though all shes asked to do is harley quinn at mph brad pitt is on autopilot throughout diego calva is fine as a guy who breaks into hollywood by accident the cinematography and soundtrack are first rate jovan adepo is excellent as a jazz trumpeter even if his story arc seems awkwardly shoehorned into the film a smaller film centred round adepos character mightve been quite good but well never know if a film has a runtime over three hours it has to earn it babylon doesnt,NEGATIVE,Comedy
778,4.71,7 July 2024,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",going in to watching the movie first thought already was pfff more than hours and this for a dramedy do i really want this i decided to go for it seeing the line up in the cast could be amazing or at least good well there were actually some parts where you can actually laugh which was real refreshing most dramedy and darkcomedy pieces dont make it that far the settings and acting was pretty good i think the pacing was good for such a long movie but i still think it was way to long in the end the lesson hollywood is pushing on here that there are no new ideas anymore theyve probably seen alot of critique on all of the remakes thats happening all over the place these last years and decided to explain that its all been done before and before that if your short on time you could also watch the southpark episode where they come to the conclusion that simpsons did the runtime kills it for me otherwise it would have been out of then now it sticks at,POSITIVE,Comedy
779,4.71,21 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",i had high expectations for babylon at the beginning of i read that this film could be one of the big names at the oscar but i didnt imagine that today with twenty days left until the oscar ceremony i would be hating this film so much in the first half hour i could already see that babylon was a work full of histrionics exaggerations shouting scatologies and unnecessary things as it is my personal pleasure to watch all the oscar nominees i had to keep watching this film and as the little over three hours of the film slowly ebbed away i just had to agree more and more with my initial opinion of babylon my god what a terrible movie is this there is no clear protagonist there is no quality narrative there are no reasons for this film to have such an exaggerated duration there is no need for so much eschatology in a film that could indeed display the exaggerations of a hollywood in transition but not in the way that was done however it stands to reason that babylon shines in technicalities and its three oscar nominations are no less than fair now as far as narrative is concerned this film is far from good above all babylon is the epitome of pretentiousness alongside tár and all quiet on the western front babylon is one of the films i most dislike this awards season,NEGATIVE,Comedy
780,4.71,5 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",i dont even know what this show is about its just a hollywood movie about making hollywood movies famous actors portraying other famous actors its a waste of time and very self maturbatory they know this movie is nothing more than a look at me give me awards its not about anything more than a paycheck and dont try to sell it otherwise its honestly a slap in the face for moviegoers so disrespectful of us common folk i need more characters but ive made my point this movie is not good its going to be my litmus test for any potential suitors i mean wow this was not a good time,NEGATIVE,Comedy
781,4.71,25 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",babylon is a paean to the heady days of hollywood when it was wilder than the wild west before technicolour and talking got in the way it revels in the salacious parties and orgiastic lifestyles of the rich and famous for a good minutes before the titles come up and then takes us on a rather uneven journey through the history of early film our way in to the move is via manny a mexican factotum who gets his break when he falls in with brad pitt who is on luminous form as a dashing silent star and nellie a hopeful wannabe actress played by margot robbie we follow them as they rise and fall but the film is marred by an uneven tone and a frenetic but flabby script that tries to bring in too many storylines with properly serving any of them there are moments of slapstick comedy black humour tragedy and farce and even some glints of heart and painfully observed insight among the sleaze glamour it is a film with some great moments usually the quieter ones but overall it feels too self referential and inward looking to really engage with and for a film that celebrates the art of cinema as a way to connect with people it seems like a bit of a shame,NEGATIVE,Comedy
782,4.71,10 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",babylon is a captivating and visually stunning film set in the vibrant world of s hollywood the film takes us on a journey through the rise of manuel manny torres a mexican immigrant who finds himself caught up in the fastpaced and often dangerous world of filmmaking manny is a complex and charismatic character played with remarkable depth and nuance by a talented actor the film is a feast for the senses with stunning set design costume and cinematography that transport the audience to the glamorous and decadent world of s hollywood the films eclectic cast of characters is equally impressive each bringing their own unique flair and energy to the film one of the standout performances in the film is that of nellie laroy a brash and ambitious actress who becomes a star in her own right the relationship between manny and nellie is a highlight of the film with their dynamic and often tumultuous partnership driving the story forward as the film progresses we see manny navigate the changing landscape of filmmaking as sound begins to replace silent films the film does an excellent job of capturing the excitement and uncertainty of this era as well as the challenges faced by filmmakers as they try to keep up with the rapidly changing technology overall babylon is a rich and immersive film that offers a unique and captivating glimpse into the world of s hollywood the talented cast stunning visuals and engaging story make it a mustsee for fans of historical drama,POSITIVE,Comedy
783,4.71,5 March 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",consider this if film creators had to pitch the end of their production before they pitched the film id bet half of projects would not be made starting as babylon did there just wasnt the energy to see it to a bombastic end the minutes wasted in the last scenes in the theater we just that wasted images of weird watercolors to symbolize what although i was entertained by the first minutes the rest of the film plodded along it dished out plot lines like a gossip columnist just enough to make your curiosity pursue the rest of the film watch the trailer listen to the soundtrack and find something else to quench your thirst for the golden age of film,NEGATIVE,Comedy
784,4.71,4 April 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",i didnt think i would like this movie based on some of the publicity over the months however i found it to be a really good interesting movie if you can get past the decadence and pervasive foul language a couple of orgies with ample nudity some projectile vomiting plus a few murders and a couple of suicides i watched it at home on dvd from my public library in two sittings on successive days watched that way i did not find it to be too long there was no unnecessary filler babylon the city on the euphrates river in southern mesopotamia has a history dating back over years but in christianity babylon symbolizes worldliness and evil it is in this context that the movies title is meant the worldliness decadence and evil that has been part of hollywood the story starts in the s as most movies were still silent but the the jazz singer with al jolson was the beginning of the end of silent films another movie singing in the rain also has a prominent role so the speak as its story arc is analogous to a love relationship in this movie babylon the movie ends in as one of the characters from the earlier days visits the studio with his wife and young daughter outside just looking good movie i enjoyed it i will watch it again in maybe a year,POSITIVE,Comedy
785,4.71,31 January 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",im going to tell you exactly why his film bombed at the box office and why it got a rt score of top critic and verified audience i am an average movie goer i read the wiki on why it bombed and it blamed anything from covid to winter storm elliiot to even calling this a prestige film it is not these are called rationalization or lies we tell ourselves if paramount really believe that theyre going to lose more money making mil on an mil budget that required mil to break even ouch first nobody is really interested in movies from the ish time frame only genre that would work from those time must have incredible stories of human triumph over adversities hardship etc like titanic far and way etc and good values why because when we do think of those days we subconsciously compare them as the good old days of moral value character etc to the world today of total hedonism debauchery and well dystopia we think of those times as innocent times in comparison to todays depraved world so babylon is set in but it focused on these depravities people do not want to see that bc they can see them in the news the other thing is people are not really interested in hollywood this is besides the point of the antihollywood sentiment these days fact is times are hard and people look upon celebrities and elites living it up it is like lemon to a wound then there is the length nobody wants to watch a movie that is more than hours unless you can provide great scenery so they feel like theyre traveling from place to place this is why lord of the rings world bc they are so immersed into the world of middle earth that it didnt feel like a hour movie but a hour adventure now the subject matter of babylon is not compatible in this regard so instead people feel bored and the movie dragged with pointless drama and dialog even those who do enjoy the subject matter get worn out think about it a min to hour jerry springer may be entertaining but hours of it will make anyone sick finally the main point why this failed it combination of all that described above this film like most modern film now tries to force the message because well it is a film about the celebration of depravity hedonism etc of hollywood right in sense it comes off like hollywood boasting of itself completely out of touch with the average movie goers paramount needs to seriously reevaluate their command structure who is green lighting these scripts otherwise expect more box office bombs in the future you have one job to provide a movie that audience might actually enjoy not creating a hour long mess celebrating depravity of your own hollywood with an ensemble cast of big names and then blame the audience or other rationalizations when you made only mil in a mil even break,NEGATIVE,Comedy
786,4.71,2 February 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",i couldnt help but compare this to boogie nights it has the same frenetic kinetic energy but is lacking the coherent cohesive flow that could tie everything together seamlessly brad pitt should win every award for his performance he was the heart of the movie while diego calva was the soul i couldnt take my eyes off either of them while they were onscreen but i wish they had more to do with each other margot robbie could have easily stolen every scene but diego was right there with her i could watch her dance scene at the party over and over again i also thought some of the insider jokes were amusing margot and samara in the same scene or were they and a repeated scene of brad kissing an actress who was very reminiscent of angelina overall babylon is a somewhat rewarding watch but i have no desire to see the whole movie again any time soon while i wouldnt mind seeing boogie nights again especially after seeing babylon,NEGATIVE,Comedy
787,4.71,14 September 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",it is obviously a huge gigantic production very realistic i guess closer to the true movie industry of the silent era than any other film ever made about the silent films singin in the rain day of the locust inside daisy clover so this awesome movie is a pretty excellent document for moviegoers in search of some history maybe the young today audiences wont crave for it except for the disturbing and nasty erotic sequences which are galore here damien chazelle monitors everything here as usual it is so accurate so daring so outstanding jaw dropping and the performances overwhelming at a scale you wont even imagine anyway this masterpiece is not destined to any everyone and if you are a pier paolo pasolini fan youll literally fall for it entirely definitely,POSITIVE,Comedy
788,4.71,1 March 2023,"December 23, 2022 (United States)",this is definitely one to see in theatres if you can its an absolutely mad over the top journey through hollywood not realistically it uses clichés and exaggerated glamor and starts out feeling like a scene from the great gatsby but with more drugs and nudity films are supposed to take you out of reality as one of the characters mentions early on and babylon succeeds at that its fun and surprising and the music is great its meta at times like youre watching a film about a person watching a film thats about a film being made kind of meta but its a joy and its never dull there are moments that will make you laugh and gasp from the sheer absurdity in all the madness there are poignant moments like when a journalist is telling an old actor that although his time is up he will live on forever through his films they also squeeze in a love story if you can call it that its bittersweet and frustrating to watch as self destructive behaviours dominate and get in the way of success in love and career time and again although everything is exaggerated its easy to see how hollywood encourages the behaviour and i imagine many actors have experienced some things seen in the film it feels like a film for film makers that the general public can also enjoy it ends with a great montage and who doesnt love a good montage,POSITIVE,Comedy
789,8.0,5 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",so i was left a little disappointed after the last film something just seemed to be missing but this really hit the spot the central characters still have great chemistry but this felt a lot more like an ensemble piece with more fleshed out characters around them im just going say reggierocks some great cinematography with lots of fab camera and drone work zooming around all over the place the first person gun work at one point added a new dimension miami looks beautiful with the orange and teal tones action galore and a good protagonist in eric dane although his motive and why he is doing what he is was pretty rubbish but he still played it well and to be fair you dont come in to this sort of film hoping for shakespeare level story telling some fun cameos pop up which raise a smile the soundtrack is good and lorne balfe delivers on the orchestrated score it has all you would expect from a michael bay production definitely life still in the franchise,POSITIVE,Comedy

802,1.0,6 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",bad boys ride or die is a funfight entertainer with a predicted storyline it would be incorrect to categorize this film as awful lets talk about it using the key components of a movie direction not too awful it might have been better with more information regarding the character development scene continuity actor dialogue modulations and setting plot the plot of this film is weak there are no enhancements over any of the prior stories or materials and the plot itself is not new screenplay it appears that there is no need to rewrite the screenplay for this film it may have changed places attire and other equipment from the original script dialogue the dialogue in this film is informal and typical given the circumstances a portion of them are useless cinematography this film emphasizes the use of cameras particularly in the action scenes not that awful actually acting wills entertaining dialogues arent all that memorable and his acting is lifeless several times martin has overacted that could be the characterization i dont know however something is absent editing the hue and lighting arent very appealing vfx and blue screen are provided as usual for the huge screen some effects are quite unique its interesting to watch fight scenes with musical accompaniment stunt as long as there is minimal usage of blue screens the stunts in this film are good soundtrack its alright the stunt scenes background music is welldone attraction to put it simply the bad boys movies entertainment value is okay it is not a thrilling suspenseful action film a typical action movie nothing noteworthy to say,NEGATIVE,Comedy
803,1.0,6 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",thats not to say this franchise has overstayed its welcome no but this movie feels like it has exhausted its last bit of entertainment without coming across as unnecessary and thats a good thing out of the four bad boys movies so far this was probably the one i enjoyed the most it maybe also has to do with the fact that this was the first bad boys movie ive watched in the big screen naturally making the experience more exciting and memorable but i also feel like the movie has a lot to make it likeable be it the rather cliché but effective script the callbacks the action the excitement and most of all the amazing chemistry between will smith and martin lawrence overall the movie is pretty fun and while not all jokes land its still decently funny and entertaining at the same time,POSITIVE,Comedy
804,2.0,11 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",hollywood cant make movies anymore so they make pretend movies that is movies that just runs without any goal story entertainment value or respect for their audience this is one of those pretend movies so what do we get for our hard earned money no much to be honest we get a couple of bad actors that tries to be funna fail that try to be cool fail and that try to make talk about old age and at the same time doing the things they did in the former movies fail the problem is that even the camera work and directing are bad and why use shaky cameras that just make it even harder to watch this money grab well i guess someone is laughing all the way to the bank unfortunately its not the viewer give this one a pass,NEGATIVE,Comedy

806,3.0,8 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",im shocked people liked this i think its one of the most miserable things ive seen at the cinema in a good while bad boys ride or die tries to convince you its trying hard but i wasnt fooled its free of anything edgy radical daring or provocative even though it stylistically feels like its insisting it is those things a few blood spurts and some swearing not nearly as much as earlier movies from what i can tell cant fool me it feels like it goes out of its way to avoid racy humor has one scene with racists but feels afraid to make them genuinely racist and refuses to punch up or down with its humor i just wanted it to pick a direction even if it meant a film feeling lowbrow or meanspirited at least it would be something comedically this is so flat uninspired predictable and corny i laughed more at the film than i laughed with it and i barely ever laughed at it to begin with the film makes baffling decisions about where to take the two main characters and then never explores those things in interesting ways sudden panic attacks for one and a neardeath experience in the films opening moments for the other there are so many side characters and theyre all less interesting than smith and lawrence and those two are already going through the motions here there are crumbs of chemistry between the two still here and there but its slight the supporting cast just overwhelms in the back half once or twice to the point where i briefly forgot this was a bad boys film it doesnt live up to the title the way youd want or expect there is nothing bad in a good way here its just bad in a bad way theres nothing by way of attitude spark life or guts its a cowardly flat monotonous cynical ugly boring and woefully lacking film i hated it the only thing that saves it from a is the fact there were some explosions and brief moments of camerawork in the climax that looked kind of cool i guess smith and lawrence couldve been worse too theyre phoning it in but they phone it in better than anyone else in the film its abhorrent and soulsucking cinema,NEGATIVE,Comedy

808,8.0,23 July 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",bad boys ride or die oh dear i had hoped that at the end of the last banal movie we had seen the end of this excruciating franchise how much macho posturing can we the viewer be subjected to that literarily made me squirm from one scene to another not only was there a vestigial script nasty stereotyping preposterous scenarios and the most egregious and controlling relationships based upon fear and retribution this movie grandstands this mucho behaviour and promotes it in the most barefaced manner how can this still exist in it does not pass the minimum bar of six out loud laughs per movie i didnt laugh once lastly and perhaps most shockingly this movie was used as a vehicle for the cancelled actor will smith to reenter hollywood previously he presented himself as a black role model across the world a whole generation copied his supposed wholesome and nonjudgemental approach he then turned out to be nothing more that a violent misogynistic who had hoodwinked the public for years there is no coming back from that period i hated this reductive movie from start to finish im not sure who this was made for but whoever is lapping up this rubbish needs to take take a close look at what it is they are admiring for me this is a outta at best i enjoyed some of the stunts,NEGATIVE,Comedy
809,10.0,10 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",martin lawrence totally killed it here but i do believe will smith is still affected in his acting due to his slap incident or perhaps his charm is gone same old story good guys get setup by bad guys and they win in the end jokes were ok but i dont think i want to see will smith ever again on the screen he was once a favorite actor of mine supporting cast was lackluster as most people have said and some scenes were fun but the story overall was very predictable specially who the bad guy is which you can figure it out in the first minutes or so i love action films and comedy this used to be a great movie series but i think will smith should consider retiring and let his glory days be gone,NEGATIVE,Comedy
810,1.0,5 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",cinema can and sometimes must simply entertain its not about an elaborate or even new story character depictions that are more than just superficial outstanding action scenes great camera work or even exceptional actors its about fun and distracting the audience from the rest of the world for minutes bad boys ride or die has achieved just that admittedly mike lowrey and marcus burnett have been my favorites since and i dare say that bad boys was one of the mostwatched films of my youth and just as i dont feel really old almost thirty years later neither do will smith and especially martin lawrence who really gives it his all in the fourth installment of the series and provides plenty of laughs yes the film is no revelation and some camera angles were annoying because they were much too fast and hectic and when the camera switches to vertical format in the finale i know that perhaps i am indeed too old for this stuff however bad boys ride or die is also one of the most honest films of the year here nothing is taken seriously anymore and the goal is for everyone to have fun for me that was enough and the film works better than much of what else ive seen in the cinema this year if you havent liked the bad boys so far you wont be happy here either for everyone else go to the cinema and have fun,POSITIVE,Comedy

812,6.0,20 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",chaotic plot one must look quite hard to find the plot horrible script same ol same ol which hurts all of it and a waste of my time money which suggests that there will be another one i truly did not want to see this one but being in love we do things that defy logic as actors age they make choices that always come with consequences martin lawrence has made the choice to wear a lot of black but the jowls always give it away and that takes away from the whole experience in my eyes if youre going to throw it out there you better be able to support it and he cannot overall in my probably uncultured perspective this film isnt worth your time or money,NEGATIVE,Comedy

814,1.0,10 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",i looked forward to bad boys ride or die as i really enjoyed bad boys for life it retains a lot of the positive things which have made the past films fun such as impactful action r rated jokes and family dynamics that came with a bunch of side characters new and old and an okay plot but there is one thing that lets this movie down and its martin lawrences character marcus burnett unfortunately its becoming all too common in hollywood for a character to be so over the top for a movie that it just becomes distracting after surviving a near death experience at the beginning of the film marcus is high on life and he literally acts as if he is high for the rest of the film this went beyond fun and playful to the point where it was distracting and annoying it led to many frustrating scenes which felt like they belonged in a cartoon including one scene where the characters chose one of the worst possible moments to sing the bad boys theme in the end bad boys ride or die is a frustrating but okay film which could have been much better with different narrative choices although many people might enjoy the direction that the film went,NEGATIVE,Comedy
815,8.0,26 July 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",the movie continues the longrunning saga but this latest installment falls into the trap of delivering more of the same without much innovation the film lacks any fresh elements and largely recycles tropes seen in countless other action movies the action scenes while brief and sporadic feature our heavily battered yet inexplicably bulletproof heroes these sequences are interspersed with lengthy tiresome filler dialogue that does little to advance the plot or develop the characters the two hours in the theater felt more like a slog as the film struggled to maintain engagement with its audience bad boys at times resembles an egoshooter game a style that may appeal to fans of intense immersive violence however this aspect requires a particular taste for such content while the film manages to deliver solid entertainment and the dynamic chemistry between smith and lawrence remains a highlight it ultimately fails to rise to the level of a masterpiece one of the most glaring issues is the evident aging of the main actors smith and lawrence though charismatic often show their age and the series attempt to maintain the highenergy antics of its predecessors feels forced and out of touch the weariness is palpable in many scenes making it clear that the franchise is running on fumes a passable action film that relies heavily on the established rapport of its leading men it offers a familiar blend of action and humor but its lack of originality and overused clichés render it a largely forgettable experience while fans of the series might find some enjoyment its time for this franchise to finally rest acknowledging that its stars can no longer convincingly play the roles of youthful action heroes,NEGATIVE,Comedy
816,1.0,22 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",what can i say this movie was just horrible will smith for starters just isnt relevant anymore hes still acting like hes in his s or something but please hes well into his s a this point this has to be some of his worst work id say were all just tired of him at this point he cant keep play forever the camera work looked like something out of a horrible michael bay movie shaky camera movements loads of jump cuts way too much fancy and overused outdated camera work the story line was thin just something to hold the action segments together honestly its really not much different than the rd movie or the first two,NEGATIVE,Comedy
817,2.0,7 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",bad boys is one of the best buddy em cop action comedy franchise and with th part it looks like theyve run their course i enjoyed this movie but it offers nothing new it is just same as last film which i found amazing because rd one came after a very long time after nd one but this time magic and charm dont work chemistry between will smith and martin lawrence is the real soul of these movies their comedy timing is perfect and they can still kick some ass even after years story was same as many other movies weve seen before good guys gets framed for something which they didnt do they catch bad guys and defeat them the end there are some good action scenes in this movies mostly consists of shootouts i think nd one has the best action sequences because that was directed by michael bay who is known for making big scale action pieces after some time youll get bored seeing same action again and again but it was still very fun to see on big screen especially the fps gun scene during climax cinematography consisting of skylines shots of miami was cool to see soundtrack was good and acting of man leads was the best part of movie overall i enjoyed this movie as a summer popcorn flick if you love action comedies with some of the old famous actors of hollywood you should catch it on big screen you will enjoy it,POSITIVE,Comedy

819,4.0,10 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",having enjoyed the previous bad boys films i expected the latest installment to deliver the same blend of action and comedy that made its predecessors enjoyable unfortunately this film missed the mark on all counts the comedy that was a staple of the earlier films was notably absent will smith who was once effortlessly funny seemed to have lost his comedic touch the film felt more like watching someone play call of duty for an hour and minutes lacking any real engagement or entertainment value ultimately i found myself so uninterested that i decided to leave the theater with minutes left the music in the theater lobby proved to be more entertaining than the movie itself so i waited there for my family to finish watching if you enjoyed the previous bad boys movies i would not recommend this one it fails to capture the humor and excitement that made the earlier films enjoyable,NEGATIVE,Comedy
820,4.0,7 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",i really enjoyed the first three movies in this series the first two from michael bay truly raised the bar for gritty action movies the third from a few years ago with new directors was a surprisingly great followon that was just as thrilling and fun this movie however was a significant departure in quality story acting direction action and effects nostalgia factor what brought this desperate greedy cash grab of a production down was how lazy and derivative it was from start to end the amount of predictable core components of the story were only surpassed by the cheeseball dialogue and gags what made the other films enjoyable was a delicate balance of quality action believable stakes and wellplaced comedy this failed attempt was just cringey and pathetic while will smith did okay its evident why martin lawrence faded into obscurity decades ago bad boys shouldve ended with,NEGATIVE,Comedy
821,4.0,7 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",bad boys ride or die is the fourth film in the bad boy film series this fourth part is again directed by adil el arbi and bilall fallah who also directed the third bad boys films together when their former captain becomes involved in corrupt dealings mike lowrey will smith and marcus burnett martin lawrence are also seen as suspects now they have to prove the innocence of their old captain and themselves in their older age poorer health and panic attacks themselves with this fourth bad boys they realistically respond to the aging aspects of the main characters for example at their older age they still have to solve police cases because they are now seen as suspects themselves they receive little help from police allies so they now have to solve the problem themselves the directing duo once again provides entertaining creative action scenes many of these are entertainingly over the top but some are a bit too exaggerated this makes it almost look like scenes from superhero action films which means that the realistic aspects of the film are somewhat lost the mysterious aspects are also quickly lost in the film this way as a viewer you learn sooner than the main characters who is really behind all the criminal cases this can make the story a bit longwinded because the main characters are looking for answers that you as a viewer actually already know the only thing more fun than guessing which of the other agents can or cannot be trusted but unfortunately this is often a bit obvious what also makes the story a bit longwinded is that in addition to the main story the main characters also commit many other side stories that are more separate from the main story this sometimes makes it feel like you are watching moments from another film or possible elements from sequels if they had balanced everything a bit more they could have had a shorter and clearer one will smith and martin lawrence still have good chemistry together as police partners and friends but just like their characters they have also aged a bit together they each provide their own form of humor in the film they only switched their personalities a bit with this fourth film will smith often still makes appropriate jokes but his character is now also more concerned about things martin lawrences character thinks he can handle more of everything in this film and thus dares to take more risks this brings him into entertaining action moments which he then deals with in a more comical way there are also some wellknown cameos in the film from prominent characters from previous bad boys films or simply from famous people who are mainly known from social media,POSITIVE,Comedy
822,1.0,6 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",not as good as bad boys for life nowhere near as good as the one that came before yes it was very funny in places martin lawrence is a legend in comedy i just did not like the story it did not feel the same as bad boys for life it had a lot of action but thats what you would expect from a bad boys movie this movie is the worst out of all the bad boys movie in my opinion the two bad boys going on the run as fugitives thats not a bad boys movie and the lead bad guy now please they could have atleast picked an a list actor been reading some reviews and people are going on about the will smith slapwho cares unless he slapped you lol so if they do decide to make another bad boys movie please be alot better,NEGATIVE,Comedy
823,8.0,6 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",after the entertaining bad boys for life came out a few years ago it was guaranteed that we would be getting a fourth film in the franchise and here it is in bad boys ride or die and i saw it today with this being my review the premise of the film sees mike marcus on the run after their former captain is accused of working with the cartels main character will smith as mike lowry and martin lawrence as marcus burnett are what carries this film and the chemistry that they have together they both look like they are having a blast and their enthusiasm and energy is what i really enjoyed though i cant deny that both characters have story arcs and they both come out of nowhere and are a bit bizarre and hold the movie and these characters back supporting characters paola nunez makes her return as rita and i enjoyed her character she is an old ally of mikes and she has taken over the captains role and i thought she gave a pretty solid performance and i enjoyed watching her but the rest of the cast arent great jacob scipio is back as armando and this guy has very little charisma and intrigue about him this comes after a bland performance in the previous film and it just seems this guy cant live up to the hype of taking over from will smith which this film possibly wants vanessa hudgens as kelly and alexander ludwig as dorn return for this film in a clearly reduced role and they are pretty much given nothing to do except being some low level comic relief which doesnt really work when the main duo are way more entertaining the film really wastes the talent of ioan gruffudd and rhea seehorn with these generic characters when they are capable of so much better seehorn in particular is an amazing actress with her work as kim wexler in better call saul being emmy worthy hopefully she gets better roles then this in the future story the previous film tries to tell a more personal story and had some success but this film falls flat on its face there is one scene at the beginning of the film that takes away the whole intrigue for the film and i wish it never happened as it would make the film much better both main characters story arcs are dumb and the villains motivation is basically money which is super dull and made me not really care about anything that happened to anybody in this film as it was incredibly predictable script there is no denying that this film has some pretty chuckle worthy moments and i think i was doing this pretty consistently throughout the film which was nice to see but some repetitive jokes fall a bit flat and really arent as funny as the writers think they are also the drama is really not there as i said i never really cared about any of the characters towards the end and the weaker script doesnt help style the style of the film is pretty similar there are some good high octane action scenes that are a lot of fun and in particular i love the sound of the guns and loud they are it makes it feel like you are in the action scenes however there are other action scenes where the camera is shaking everywhere and i couldnt tell what was going on there is also one scene where for some reason they try to make it look like a video game and it looks incredibly cheap and tacky overall overall bad boys ride or die is a below average film that for me is the worst of the franchise it cant follow up from the previous film and this is probably the end of this franchise and that is probably a good thing if you are a fan of this franchise maybe wait until it goes on streaming if not then give it a miss rating,NEGATIVE,Comedy

825,1.0,5 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",i was curious about a new bad boys because i love the franchise and second because its made by some of my favorite belgian directors i didnt know what to expect after the th but this one really surprised me in the positive way funny didnt laugh with a movie like this one since a long time jokes the dialogues great action shots and the chemistry between will smith and martin lawrence is unmatched the are so great together i put this movie in my top above the previous one in my list of favorites can we now just forget what happend with will smith on the oscars and bring him back it was a mistake he apologised move on that besides this th part is the kind of movie you can go watch twice in theaters when you feel a little blue have a date alone or just want to have a great time choose this one the movie just released but secretly i hope theyre already thinking about a th movie something to complete the circle or so,POSITIVE,Comedy
826,1.0,7 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",in my life i have only watched holywood movies and english series for close to years the amount of progress the film industry has made is mind boggling and each of the movie has something different since they have invested lots of dollars in either special effects or soundtrack or storyline this movie has nothing even a kid will get bored and sleep watching this movie is like watching a hollywood movie of early s it doesnt even look like hollywood movie even our bollywood movie are times much better and you cant compare it to any hollywood movies because hollywood inspires entire planet earth to invent and think out of the box so the human race can progress this is not worth watching in theatres i was deeply shocked that how such a junk and low quality movie is getting released worldwide dont waste your time and hard earned money its worst movie of all time only helicopter and jail action scenes are okayish this movie is worthless and crap,NEGATIVE,Comedy
827,1.0,9 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",let me make it simple instead of exaggerating like most of reviewers here action that part is brilliant but greatly nodding the head the bullet flying around bomb booming there there flaming up like a blaze and yellingscreaming was the most exciting part joke most jokes are completely dried up with a lack of points and even adults here in the movie theater didnt laugh most of the time except for several teenagers who didnt know what those jokes meant let me be honest here we do laugh at some of it especially the alligator part story the point of this story was to clear up the names of those two cops who got pinned on after they got set up with falsely accused suspects they have to fight their way out i wish it was additional a bit more of a detective perspective so i could understand the step to step so the story was ok the worst part the trailer scene because it showed two white men defending their property which is what everyone in the united states should be doing but in this case this scene showed a confederate flag hanging down on the wall in the background and several shirts hanging on the rope about being proud of purebred as it was somehow a bad thing last time i checked it almost and antiwhite hate is unacceptable but the in the way this scene was put in and how it was made is the most unrealistic bigot and discriminate because it was painted as it was supposedly we all are alike which majority of us are not overall do better next time,NEGATIVE,Comedy
828,10.0,18 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",hey there buddy just finished watching bad boys and ive got quite a few things on my mind man im bummed out to say it was a sheer disappointment the movie seemed to have all the ingredients of being a classic hit but unfortunately it fell way short of my expectations first off the plot was super predictable there were hardly any twist or turns to keep me on edge and honestly the humor felt forced while i hoped for some ribtickling moments all i could manage was a few halfhearted chuckles i have to admit the chemistry between the leading men was still there but it just couldnt save the dull storyline the action sequences were okay but came off as over the top at times it seemed more like watching a video game rather than an actionpacked film also the dialogues lacked depth it felt like they were just trying to fill in the silence rather than contributing to the storyline and the overuse of cliches really got to me after a while overall i believe they simply tried too hard to recreate the magic of the previous movies without bringing any new elements a classic case of same old wine in a new bottle sorry for the long rant but these are just my two cents maybe some others enjoyed it more anyways hope to catch up soon stay safe p s let me know if you have any other movie recommendations but no more bad boys please,NEGATIVE,Comedy
829,1.0,13 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",i just watched this movie and it was an utter disappointment far worse than i had anticipated i knew going in that it wasnt going to be great but i didnt expect it to be this bad it felt as though the actors got together and said lets make a movie with a low budget and then proceeded to do it without any clear direction or purpose the story if you can even call it that was practically nonexistent it felt like a series of random events loosely strung together with no real plot or coherence the direction was shockingly weak scenes were poorly staged and edited making it hard to follow what little story there was the pacing was all over the place dragging in parts that should have been tense and rushing through moments that needed more development the cinematography was uninspired and the special effects where they existed looked cheap and unconvincing i kept holding out hope that the movie would redeem itself in the second half but it only got worse the plot holes became more glaring the dialogue more cringeworthy and the overall experience more frustrating by the end i was just counting down the minutes until it was over i strongly advise against watching this movie its a waste of time that youll never get back there are far better ways to spend your time than enduring this mess of a film,NEGATIVE,Comedy
830,1.0,9 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",think of but with old school s style michael bay goodness thats right they go back to their roots i prefer it to the third movie because it feels like i am watching the old camera shots and humour of old but hey thats just my opinion martin and will feel like they go to the old days only a little bit older and wiser spoiler we have a reggie fight which is amazing in fact it is so cool to see reggie back and working through that father and son angst with will this film has outstanding action and double crosses with the boys on the run from their own organisation we have a great bad guy intense and evil,POSITIVE,Comedy
831,10.0,17 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",i dont think anyone believed that will smith would stop making movies and here we are but do we need to see it or support it pro critics give this a thumbs down and so do i a rehash of themes and shtick from earlier films isnt something i ever sign up for regardless of the franchise and thats what this is rehash cutandpaste pick your analogy on a macro level where are we as a society when an actor can do what smith did and that person gets a pass woody allen roman polanski ezra miller and others commit crimes make poor personal choices and their invitation to the silver screen keeps on coming ill pass,NEGATIVE,Comedy

835,10.0,8 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",just got out of a dolby cinema screening of bad boys ride or die its the worst of the films elements i did like about the film much of the comedy didnt landmore on that later for me but theres belly laughing moments that i had was the martin lawrence walking backwards through traffic because i cant die and was directly after that when will smith catches up to him and pulls his gun out towards his face and says youre telling me i liked the surreal scenes when martin lawrence goes to the other side some of the action scenes were okmore on that later again i liked particular ones the were as follows armandos prison scene was impactful and brutal as hell you could feel the hits reggies action scene was awesome his movements were so swift will smith does this mma super fast wrestling type move on an enemy combatant in the rd act at the theme park was the very end shooting decision elements i didnt like about the film a the plotline was lackluster as hell killing captain howard in bad boys was an absolute disaster of a mistake it would of been far more effective if captain howard was actually alive on this adventure to clear his name in bad boys b that said we had an interesting premise of his daughter who was looking for armando to execute him and even that was lackluster they needed to build into that far more which they didnt it was barely built upon and then they just tacked it on at the end much of the other bits of comedy that werent funny this is mainly due to the fact that martin lawrence has terrible low energy awful line delivery the other action scenes that were not very good helicopter scene martin lawrence on top of the car on the road scene these particular scenes were not that good and the edits were terrible in these scenes too many damn edits theres a concept in here with martin lawrences character mentioned above that should have been used morewithin the action scenes and utilised far better than it actually was the villain not good enough he starts well and then its just nothing he was as cursory as it gets overall not good enough belly laughs great action scene good action scene just no thats not enough at all,NEGATIVE,Comedy
836,1.0,7 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",its been four years since we were allowed to see the last bad boys film to everyones delay will smith and martin lawrence returned as agents mike lowrey and marcus burnet of course the first mentioned was discredited at the oscar ceremony after he sold actor chris rock a bang for his head after making a joke by his wife because the whole world spoke of shame about this it became a bit quiet around smith and he has done little more this fourth bad boys film should give his career a big boost again and time will tell if the world has already forgiven will smith in my case i never blamed him for anything and i thought it was all very exaggerated how everyone reacted i have always found smith a good and above all nice actor and nothing has changed at all to date the third bad boys for life from is nice but didnt manage to hit the level of the first two films i expect the same from this fourth part and thats fine because this will be a lot of action and humor where entertainment is guaranteed and thats it bad boys ride or die gives exactly what you expect in advance and offers a tight two hours of pure popcorn entertainment the film opens with a bickering mike and marcus marcus has to live healthier for his health but when the two with screeching tires race across the highway marcus really wants to get something to drink he gets seconds where marcus seizes this moment to buy a hot dog and war skittels within that time but then the case is robbed when mike furiously walks into the case a gun is immediately pointed at him but mike immediately starts whining at marcus about his eating behavior bam opening film something that immediately leaves its mark on the rest of the film the gradient just fits perfectly with the predecessors and the directors on duty know how to make the course go as it should perhaps a point of criticism is the rather dynamic camera work you may not really realize this at the beginning of the movie but when the big action scenes come it sometimes works disturbingly especially in the big end fight where switching to a first person shooter mode it looks rather cheap shooting this was already shown in a making off in which smith controlled the image with his movements with a camera around his waist or on his arm the movie is really full of spectacular action and its impossible for you to get bored when mike and marcus try to purge the name of their deceased chief commissioner they are forced to work with the captured armando son of mike of course and bad guy in the previous film armando is the only one who can identify who is behind the plot unfortunately the shoe is a bit pinching there because although the writers may have tried to keep the story mysterious where the outcomes should amaze the viewer the course and the outcome is very predictable and that is a shame you will actually know quite quickly how or what in the trust no one catenmouse game where you eventually get stuck with a see feeling thats quite a shame because this could perhaps have been prevented with some better writing where you would still have a reasonable surprise to expect but none of that you actually see this very often in these kinds of films and of course you dont go there for a heavy plot twist where your mouth falls open but here a very easy way is chosen to stay honest does that affect the film a lot for the rest no because as indicated earlier you just get what you want and what you expect bad boys ride or die is already the fourth film in the series and gives you as a viewer exactly what you expect from it will smith and martin lawrence are the bickering police duo again and end up in an explosive situation again perhaps a little more attention should have been paid to the story itself because that is very predictable but well because you are constantly entertained a large part of the audience will be a concern however the camera work is sometimes just a little too dynamic making some things difficult to follow for the rest this is just popcorn entertainment from the top shelf and as mentioned you just get what you come for a lot of fun humor with action action and more action if the belgian directors bilall fallah and adil el arbi continue to do this they can still make a few films because this is just wonderful set your mind on blanc and just watch and enjoy without fuss or other difficult hassle,POSITIVE,Comedy
837,7.0,8 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",this movie was great very easy to digest not as vulgar or over the top cursing like the others so maybe people miss the edginess but it definitely deserves an out of good storyline and it reminds me of the s and early s movies that actually were enjoyable to go watch in theater with family the characters of course aging as well as the actors so the movie was a great adjustment for that i feel that he should have passed the torch to his son in movie so it could continue the franchise however who knows reggie ex military may be stepping up to the plate to be the next one in line,POSITIVE,Comedy

839,1.0,7 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",the storys nothing special with onedimensional villains damsels in distress and the attempts to tie it into previous films is pretty weak but the miami setting is wonderful and used very well with exotic nightclubs and an iconic culture the frequent and frantic action pieces are exciting and intense with enough explosions violence and good use of clever camera work constantly jumping between different views of the scenes the characters are funny with plenty of jokes and humour as they make fun of themselves and each other whilst accepting they have aged a couple of good cameos and an ok run time but the choppy editing is noticeable at times,POSITIVE,Comedy
840,10.0,7 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",will smith is back but martin steals the show now this isnt some masterpiece by any means but this may be the most consistently funny and most crowd pleasing of the whole franchise bad boys is my favorite and the level of that movies intensity is nearly matched with this new one crazy that a fourth bad boys would even be considered the best or most fun but here we are now i will say i miss the grittiness and even the aggression of the first two but i appreciate the homages to the og and love the new ideas and visuals the two directors bring to the franchise theres also a great action moment that gets the crowd hype youll know it and love it when you see it as much as i love what the directors bring i do kinda hope michael bay gets to direct the next one if the box office gods let that happen,POSITIVE,Comedy

859,9.0,23 July 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",the movie bad boys ride or die despite all its efforts to capture the audiences attention ultimately fails to meet expectations and offers a thoroughly boring and disappointing experience the storyline which seems to aim for appeal and variety comes across as extremely repetitive and lifeless the characters completely lack the necessary development and depth and their dialogues resemble tedious clichés rather than real and impactful conversations while the film tries to tackle some deep issues these attempts are quickly forgotten due to superficial treatment and lack of attention to detail overall bad boys ride or die is more a prime example of wasted time and energy than an enjoyable and impactful cinematic experience the film not only fails to deliver on its promises,NEGATIVE,Comedy
860,8.0,9 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",the film features epic action and comedy between will smith and martin lawrence i had a lot of fun with it thanks to the great chemistry between the leads the amazing action sequences and the excellent camera work however martins obsession with skittles and snacks felt a bit silly as did the mystery surrounding their chiefs cartel dealings the movie was shorter than expected but the side characters like reggie and armando were fantastic the plot was average reminiscent of an s action movie it included some tense moments such as a main character having a cardiac arrest and another experiencing a panic attack now about will smith theres been a lot of backlash against him following the infamous oscar slap while i dont condone his actions everyone makes mistakes we all have our moments of poor judgment and its part of being human we should focus on forgiveness after all were bad boys for life fist bump,POSITIVE,Comedy

866,4.0,8 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",nothing really new besides a few fun drone action scenes nothing really surprising besides a martin lawrence thinking he is invincible after having seen a vision but just another well made sequel the good guys goofing around we know the drill we know their chemistry and it still works especially martin lawrences dialogues are quite funny fans of the earlier versions will be getting what they wished for although dont expect fireworks its more of the same but executed rather well any bad the supporting actors are rather lame and not impressive at all its bmovie level acting kinda disappointing but a minor gripe all in all a nice sequel even better than some of the earlier sequels,POSITIVE,Comedy

868,4.0,6 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",this film stays true to the genre and delivers everything it should will smith plays his part well and the buddies play off each other in the way we have come to enjoy there is plenty of action and some good stunts with a good back story i was grateful that it did not have any of the romantic mush that so many films in this genre tend to include who for quality acting and a good pace means there is never a boring moment and the occasional light hearted moments stop this film from being overly dark or heavy in a season of childrens films this is a very welcome oasis i cannot see how others here can rate it so low it is all it sets out to be and does not disappoint,POSITIVE,Comedy
869,2.0,12 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",the best thing about this film is that michael bay has a cameo if that doesnt say it all bad boys are amazing number felt like a cheap video game adaptaion now is just flogging a dead horse its the same jokes from the previous films only very little of it lands because a its been done before and b they bad boys are older now they dont carry the same swagger it is constant references that make you go oh yeah thats like the shot in and thats the same line from having watched by the same directors i honestly think their love for video games shines through from the camera angles to the dialogue set pieces etc if this was a online multiplayer it might work it does not translate well to the big screen at all,NEGATIVE,Comedy
870,9.0,8 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",bad boys ride or die was action packed and was awesome loved every minute of it this is how a summer blockbuster is made great action great story and plot a great cast this was a thrill ride will smith and martin lawrence are so funny in this one they really bring their a game i enjoyed the action sequences they were very will done and put together i enjoyed the characters this time around i love how this one connets to bad boys we do see some flashbacks to both bad boys and bad boys for life that was cool i find this one better than bad boys if you are looking for a fun time at the movies with a great cast action sequences story and plot bad boys ride or die is it,POSITIVE,Comedy
871,5.0,22 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",so i went to the cinema with all these stars reviews expecting something really good the first of the film were so so bad i was about to get out the script was really forced and the jokes werent funny i think i had high expectations also the plot didnt make much sense at all the characters bonds were also really forced and it made me feel like if i was watching some tv b series at disney xd and im not that guy who is just boycotting will smith i love most of his films but this one isnt on that list the other guy idk his name had the unfunniest script i have ever seen and he was the funny one the forced faces and jokes were super cringie dont watch this please i think the other people must be trolling otherwise i had seen the wrong film or smth and i was also expecting epic action but idk in some parts it was like pegi and u didnt see nothing and in another parts i was like there was almost no melee combat all guns and not epic disappointed,NEGATIVE,Comedy
872,9.0,8 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",what a horrible movie i was twirling my thumbs did the producers actually read this script the direction and actors did a great job with a sorry plot they should go back and look at darth vader in star wars dont you want to be darth vader the villains in this script are supposed to be developed yet they come across his humanless cardboard cutouts you know even darth vader had a little bit of humanity something that drove the viewer to be intrigued by the villains plan if you wanted to make a slapstick movie about two cops you could have at least worked some good dialogue i cant remember one quote from the movie this is one of the most unrewatchable movies i have ever seen but what do i know everybody above the line got paid some big bucks the purpose of this movie was to pay people not entertain i imagine it will lose money and show up on streaming video with viewers forgetting it very soon great camera work on the florida city skyline facepalm even the scene with the local white guys was just horrible i was the only one in my theater for the showing on thursday and looks like the box office shows that no one trusts these guys to make a good movie jerry bruckheimer approved the script i simply dont believe it it was rushed i was bored,NEGATIVE,Comedy
873,2.0,8 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",oh heck yea what a return for the bad boys i was genuinely laughing my balls off the entire time every moment was filled with hilarious remarks and moments that blew me away the audience that was with me had a blast and recognized every nod to the previous films the dynamic between will and martin are brilliant held to together from this bond created by the love that is left from this franchise i honestly believe that adil el arbi bilall fallah were excellent choices to continue this series the cinematography felt unreal in some scenes it felt like i was watching a first person shooter and other scenes i felt like i was watching brutalities that would be in a john wick movie after this i would love to see where they take the story although for now this was a great place to end the ride,POSITIVE,Comedy
874,3.0,7 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",worth the theater idk wasnt anything special but ol reggie had a great part the other supporting characters were meh marcus and mike were typical selves and no matter how you feel about will smith after his shenanigans it was ok some over done explosions i wish hollywood would stop with that and keep effects more realistic cars exploding and flipping over after a bullet to the radiator type stuff or a frag grenade exploding into a huge fire ball i feel that action flick style from the s should be over and people should be shown a more realistic action sequence hollywood would save a lot of money and people wouldnt have a false idea of what a rifle does,NEGATIVE,Comedy
875,9.0,7 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",finally an awesome summer film no spoilers ive always enjoyed the comedic styles of martin laurence and will smith going back to the late s the chemistry between the two has always been great and they still have it in this fourth entry of the series this might have been my favorite role matin has ever played in fact he makes the movie the plot kept my interest and there are some fun callbacks spread around the film overall the film was fun you have action comedy music and quality dialogue for once lots of laughter in our theatre and i look forward to going to see it again before it gets released at home enjoy,POSITIVE,Comedy
876,9.0,10 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",despite the comedic misfires martin lawrence manages to salvage some moments his ability to wring humour out of even the most predictable jokes is commendable however these moments arent enough to salvage the film ride or die never elevates itself beyond a mediocre actioncomedy it plays it safe content to rehash old tropes rather than offering anything fresh or original who should see it bad boys ride or die caters to a specific audience if youre a devotee of the franchise with low expectations for plot or character development this might provide a mindless summer escape but for those seeking an intelligent wellwritten or emotionally engaging experience look elsewhere ride or die might rev the engine but it ultimately sputters out leaving viewers yearning for the inventive action and witty dialogue that defined the original bad boys,NEGATIVE,Comedy
877,1.0,9 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",to be honest i find it astonishing that they even made this how long ago was the first one it feels like a lifetime ago while the first one was very exciting the sequel was not so great thats where they should have stopped the third film was a surprise coming so long after the first two and lets face it was interminable it literally goes on far too long ive never managed to sit through in its entirety not even on television now we get this fourth film its amazing that they made and released it bad boys is a thing of the past i dont think that anyone was counting the days until another bad boys movie as for the movie itself meh youve seen it all before over the top stupid action and unfunny comedy that doesnt land dont waste your money seeing this on the big screen i dont really advise seeing it at all i will always love the first bad boys movie stop making rubbish sequels way too many years later,POSITIVE,Comedy
878,6.0,8 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",this movie had me and the friends i was with laughing out loud right from the start and throughout after seeing the fall guy we were primed to check out the stunts and they were amazing the acting was great smith and lawrence were quite funny and jacob scipio s a nice addition to the mix tiffany haddishs role was absurdly amusing the women were strong and the men were all over the place the plot had innovative twists that made a big difference we loved the alligator the villains were very bad and the bad boys were hilarious if you need pick me up this movie will do quite fine check it out,POSITIVE,Comedy
879,5.0,7 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",first and foremost its another great bad boys movie full of action and comedy yes yes they getting old but the movie stayed the same full of action full of comedy and general fun loved the twists that kept on happening in the movie rather predictable to someone whos watched a lot of movies but nevertheless great experience love the tiktok fellas cameo at a single scene and thank you for an obvious nod to john wick action at a certain scene by certain individual wasnt expecting that but it was great and unexpected overall i would definitely recommend this movie to every actioncomedy lover as this is just another banger that you must watch,POSITIVE,Comedy
880,9.0,26 July 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",loved the originals back in the day but super disappointed with this one everything about it from the script to the direction to the editing is so incredibly amateur its surprising smith allowed it there was a time i felt he managed to consistently output quite high caliber movies the directors are clearly no bay and in fact a lot of the movie comes off as madefortv quality with no scene really landing or immersing the viewer as it should not helped of course by a wafer thin plot awful dialogue and ott acting throughout especially by lawrence who simply wasnt funny here overacting doesnt make unfunny material funny so not totally his fault he tried at least its all a classic case of style over substance though even the style is woeful in the same way that overacting doesnt make unfunny dialogue funnier adding slowmo to badly shot overcgid scenes also doesnt make them better scenes the editing is frequently bad confusing the action as well as jarring the viewing experience i dont recall a film where the main components didnt gel quite as frequently as this one in several years its basically a string of comedic scenes that dont land at one point a crocodile model lands next to marcus during a shootout not even with rednecks and he yells oh st its a redneck jurassic park like jurassic park was about crocodiles and action scenes that so badly want to be stylish but fall flat there was one particular shootout at an abandoned theme park that reminded me of the waterworld show at universal studios complete with exploding barrels on boats and bad guys collapsing through broken balconies when shot id say dont waste your time but im sure some people will still enjoy this movie as dumb summer fun i cant help feel like theyve wasted the potential of the concept another franchise that should have been left in the past perhaps,NEGATIVE,Comedy
881,6.0,18 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",i need first to express here how much i hated bad boys for life i really thought that it was a terrible cheap tired rehash of old plots i say this here because against all odds i quite liked ride or die at mike lowreys will smith wedding his longterm partner and best friend marcus burnett martin lawrence suffers from a heart attack during his recovery they learn that their mentor and former captain the late conrad howard joe pantoliano has been accused of bribery and corruption related to cartel operations in miami despite orders not to unwilling to believe the evidence they start to investigate and this leads them back to armando jacob scipio mikes son howards assassin and former member of the cartel im not going to suggest for a moment that the film is great much of this again been done before and in better films martin lawrence remains more tedious than funny and his i cant die schtick has been done elsewhere tiffany haddish is surely being punished for something with this role a one scene cameo that could not be more annoying i hated the panic attack storyline particularly as its fixed with a man up moment also if the villain twist in this movie comes as any form of surprise for you then would you like to buy these magic beans i have for sale i say all that but again i quite enjoyed the film i liked most of the big action set piece at the end and the reggie scene is great i liked the return for vanessa hudgens and alexander ludwig and their interactions together i just felt that whilst not matching the ridiculous scale of bad boys this was a bigger and more interesting film than the last one do i need another one id probably go but equally the series has had a lot of repetition already so im not bothered if not crossover with fast and furious though yes please,POSITIVE,Comedy
882,1.0,8 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",i was a fan of the funny frenetic energy seen in bad boys i and ii but the funny has been missing in the last movies especially this one there are a lot of attempts at humor that are completely funny and fall flat the action and story are fairly undercooked as well the story is as predictable as an buddycop action thriller and the action scenes are mostly gunplay sequences which youve seen in every other movie thankfully will smith and martin lawrence are good as usual and hold the movie together its very mindless and occasionally boring but you may find some entertainment in the music and banter between the two leads,NEGATIVE,Comedy
883,10.0,8 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",with so much of social media spoiling movies and us having access to the movie before there is even a trailer then bad boys for life being not as great as it couldve been i didnt have my hopes up high for this one but it didnt disappoint i loved the chemistry between martin and will and its a testament of time from the s from when it all started when it comes to these movies both stars get to shine together and never seems like one has to the dim their light for the other to get their shine on the character development over the years has been great to watch from the supporting cast even though the original wife of marcus burnett didnt return it didnt take away the supporting cast roles in the small parts that they shared on screen together overall it was entertaining and is a must watch as it gets the summer blockbuster season started,POSITIVE,Comedy
884,10.0,29 July 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",yeah i can confirme that it was a nice movie and all the events also the story but the acting and action is like too much you cant feel the movie the directore make you fill watching a movie of teens not a movie with real action yeah i can confirme that it was a nice movie and all the events also the story but the acting and action is like too much you cant feel the movie the directore make you fill watching a movie of teens not a movie with real action yeah i can confirme that it was a nice movie and all the events also the story but the acting and action is like too much you cant feel the movie the directore make you fill watching a movie of teens not a movie with real action,NEGATIVE,Comedy
885,8.0,22 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",this is another instance of that old saying about hollywood its a place where a thousand people run to the place where lightning struck hoping that itll strike again bad boys ride or die is a boring retread of a tired story that wasnt interesting the first time but somehow the filmmakers thought lets try something completely new well do the same thing we did all those other times but this time well have the characters make references to how theyre really really old you know cuz thats what all the young movie goers think is really funny actingwise youd think by now will smith would try to change it up a little and not try to be the same character in a different role because im telling you that s shtick hes been doing for the last years is sooooo played out i couldnt make it all the way through because its just the same junk different day youll go watch it because nostalgia and you desperately want to give one of the stars a second chance at being relevant and i kinda get that when my uncle colin got out of h block my mom let him stay with us but that didnt work out and neither did this film its just not worth the boredom you watch this and youll wish you had taken my advice and ill say i told you so not that im one to say that but truthfully i did tell you,NEGATIVE,Comedy
886,4.0,9 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",this movie was a great addition to the franchise it was filled with more action than comedy but it was still a hit i appreciate how they connected all of the previous movies allowed most of the original cast to appear ignore all of the negative reviews they came from individuals who havent even seen the movie all they are going by is the infamous crap that happened at the oscars none of that has anything to do with this movie if you want an actionpacked adventure a feeling of nostalgia a sprinkle of comedic relief this is your movie this is quite arguably one of the greatest movies of the summeryear,POSITIVE,Comedy
887,7.0,9 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",fantastic movie action pack reggie is the standout in this film not as good as but its a very close second i will be going back again super funny great movie mcsteamy is still fine as ever and is getting finer with age this movie was so action packed and insanely funny i was yelling at the screen the whole time i saw bad boys in the movie theaters thirteen times and i think i will be going to see this one about the same many times because it was so good will smith is fine and so is that darn son in the movie it wasnt really that predictable like some movies do yourself a favor and go see it,POSITIVE,Comedy
888,3.0,6 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",its all in the family someone took fast furious notes so no pun intended if anything the bad boys have to apologize but lets keep it real this is a movie this is insane this does not make much sense it will either be carried by the charm or lack thereof from our main characters or it wont martin lawrence is being annoying always nagging away but is he because there is an inciting incident that kind of changes his demeanor will smith has his own issues of course and we still are dealing with the backlash from the third movie and i still feel they missed a great chance naming the third part life i mean come they could have called it ride or die and held on to the here good action sequences even the ones with the uwe boll technique as some are saying online they may look weird as behind the scenes looks but they do work in the movie very well edited and all that the question is are you ready to shut off your brain and enjoy this for what it is many things do not make sense otherwise like not taking one individual who proved to be quite useful to the well last missionending of the movie maybe in a different universe there are better plotlines but we do live here so lets make do with what we get and not overthink it good soundtrack almost makes you forget about the cliches,POSITIVE,Comedy
889,9.0,13 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",its been a long time since ive been this distracted by directingcinematography this tryhard and obnoxious every single frame of this movie reeks of desperation and insecurity in the written material if you thought the gray man had the most distracting use of drone shots ever be prepared for it to be blown out of the water by bad boys every shot was a new attempt at a different camera style or tracking shot it was like watching a hour music video good directors know when to let a scene breathe were not dealing with good directors here competent absolutely good nope all the performances are pretty bad except for martin lawrence whose character is now relegated to just straight up being a clown accentuated constantly by the directors aggressively unpleasant use of extreme close ups the dramatic bonding moments before the climactic action scene was shot like a comedy scene but it was meant to be heartwarming that being said he plays a good clown and lawrence is the only actor who seems to actually be able to let go of his ego will smith isnt at all believable in this role anymore he just isnt a good enough actor to convince you hes anything but a pampered movie star its funny how the writers have to make so many caveats and leaps to allow joey pants back into the franchise after his characters death in the last movie the chief in the first movies was just a regular guy who was friends with the leads but this movie retcons him to be this unflappable moral hero who is treated with so much reverence will smith just has to have this large picture of a dead man at his wedding apparently joey wasnt just some likeable schmuck but he was actually an unrelenting super cop that everyone saw as a messianic figure who was killed because of his genius skills uncovering drug organisations the joey pants from the first movies was the kind of guy who would throw his computer in a rage because he forgot how to log in now hes a genius who knows how to send complex encrypted messages there are about a dozen moments of unrelenting cringe throughout there are moments the filmmakers are thinking are either funny or dramatic but they just come off as phoney and pandering all the bad ass moments are just embarrassing the whole plot and resolution is a foregone conclusion you know exactly who the bad guy is gonna be revealed to be and how the plot will resolve within the first minutes they dont even have the guts to kill off useless side characters whose death could at least add a sense of consequence to the weightless action scenes in a staggering surprise the musical score and needles drops were actually pretty good and often restrained most modern action flicks have dreadful and annoying music choices but in this it was the least egregious aspect of a pretty bad hours the best part of this movie is the part where the villain is asked when did all this corruption start and i swear to god his answer starts with well after they did an arrested development joke but totally sincerely thats the most unaware thing ive seen a film do in years classic moment no notes one scene indicative of the lazy writing is when vanessa hudgens looks at an art piece sees a qr code and says thats strange and lo and behold the qr code is crucial to the plot and leads the to another message from the omniscient dead captain but qr codes are crazycommon in art exhibits posters and adverts just by some miracle she assumed the qr code had to do with the case this is equivalent to a detective movie where the lead cop sees a chewing gum wrapper on the street says boy thats strange proceeds to pick it up and sees it has crucial details of the murder suspect written on it thats how contrived this writing is oh and the first minutes is just nonstop of the worst exposition dialogue youve heard in the last decade the forced ambiguous dialogue leading up to this point is excruciating too also why is this huge art night club gig happening in the middle of the day its also funny that there are a tonne of returning characters from the previous film that no one cares about but the directors think you do i saw this movie with someone who loves the bad boys movies and he didnt know who most of the returning characters were the worst parts of this movie are when it tried to be heartfelt and dramatic i felt sick and angry that these filmmakers were trying to manipulate my emotions with the subtlety and nuance of a bad reasons why episode marcus facetimes with his wife in this movie and its a huge pet peeve of mine when a simple image of someone over facetime looks like it was shot with an k million dollar camera just use the real phone to make the call itll take way less time and look so much better and it wont take us out of the movie steven soderberghs kimi did this why spend more many to make your movie worse but i guess that these directors in a nutshell theres also a subplot where marcus is enlightened after a near death experience but it changes from scene to scene sometimes he wont care about anything and the next hes right back to his neurotic self and he just swings back and forth also amazing that in theres still a movie so dumb that someone having a panic attack is fixed by someone slapping you and telling you to man up legendary stuff right there so yeh not a great movie occasionally fun and wild but mostly overlong and annoying martin lawrence and the music was good the direction could have been good if they had any restraint and will smith and the plot are total flat lines oh yeh and the product placement is crazy little hint if the movie has a bunch of skittle product placement ala shazam then its probably a bad film,NEGATIVE,Comedy
890,3.0,8 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",always excited to see a simpson bruckheimer film im a huge will smith fan and love the bad boys series i absolutely loved the nod backs to the originalespecially the classic pose from when julie was kidnapped also loved the fact that the original mark mancina score made its way back action was great with outstanding special effects while i expected some of wills usual subtle humor i was let down as it didnt appear to be as many of his ad libs as i usually see in a will smith film while i dont feel it was as great as the first two it was still action packed and entertaining wasnt happy with the casing of theresa she just couldnt fill the shoes of theresa randle eric dane played a fantastic villain but i found it hard to really get into his character because he is mcsteamy afterall and saves lives still disappointed that my favorite phrase of all time woosah still hasnt made its way back into a sequel pay close attention and youll catch a couple fun cameos in the flick,POSITIVE,Comedy
891,3.0,26 July 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",bad boys ride or die is the latest in the longrunning screen franchise which essentially refigures the lethal weapon films for black audiences i was really disappointed by the quality of this one as a film its all over the place and a real drop in standards given that the last one bad boys for life was my favourite so far but no here we get a hastily scribbled together plot with generic villains and actors wasted in predictable roles ioan gruffudd im looking at you even worse the humour doesnt hit the mark anymore smith does very little and lawrence is required to pull silly faces and do nothing else i cant really think of anything positive to say,NEGATIVE,Comedy
892,1.0,9 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",anyone that knows me know i am not easily impressed with movies most movies ppl think is i think its this one did not disappoint i was thoroughly entertained from beginning to end i was so happy to see martin doing good and will smith still very much giving mike looooowery loved the reggie scene it was action packed and gave a suspense factor i was surprised that i was laughing quite often because i swear its hard to make me laugh in a move these days overall it was phenomenal i only gave a because no movie is perfect sooo happy it came out on my birthday bad boys for life,POSITIVE,Comedy
893,7.0,29 July 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",overall bad boys ride or die was a disappointment watching old mens antics for trivial reasons felt ridiculous yes will smith is still in good shape but everyone knows how old he is and he is certainly no tom cruise while there were moments where the jokes hit the mark they werent enough to salvage a shallow and boring storyline the film seems to have forgotten that its not like the original installment the plot feels outdated and fails to resonate with todays audience on a positive note i appreciated the absence of any forced agendas in the movie however this alone couldnt make up for the overall lackluster experience bad boys ride or die failed to live up to the legacy of its predecessors and left me longing for the charm and wit of the earlier films,NEGATIVE,Comedy
894,10.0,23 July 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",bad boys franchise followed me from my teen years all the way to now decades later ive noticed something recentley as i age myself that actors as they get older lose a lot of that charisma or that ja nes sais quoi they had when they were young and fearless their acting skills deminish their sense of selfevaluation or at least evaluting their work becomes blurred myopia or loss of ability to be critical of oneself becomes an issue for us all one day i think anyway this movie just as much as the rd one shines a light on that fact acting has gotten pretty bad and martin lawrence was hard to watch what happened to his head btw storyline and movie action sequences are all seen before and things turn from bad to worse in a hurry all kinds of cliches are put on rinse and repeat while the good ole racism jokes capture our attention once more overall a b grade movie with a big budget and big expectations that falls flat on its tummy hope they stop the franchise now and stop embarassing themselves moving on from this cereal box movie concept would be a great idea especially for will,NEGATIVE,Comedy
895,10.0,22 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",bad boys ride or die is the latest installment in the longrunning bad boys franchise but unfortunately it feels more like a cash grab than a genuine effort to entertain the movie reunites will smith and martin lawrence two actors who once brought a dynamic and humorous chemistry to the screen however this time around their performances fall flat and the comedic spark that once defined their partnership is noticeably absent the plot follows the usual formula of highoctane action sequences and overthetop stunts but it lacks the originality and charm that made the earlier films enjoyable the storyline feels recycled and the script is filled with clichéd dialogues and predictable twists the humor which was a cornerstone of the franchise now feels forced and uninspired failing to elicit more than a few chuckles the films pacing is uneven with action scenes that seem to drag on without purpose and dramatic moments that lack emotional depth the supporting cast does little to elevate the material often coming across as mere caricatures rather than fully fleshedout characters the direction and editing also leave much to be desired with some scenes feeling disjointed and poorly executed in essence bad boys ride or die struggles to capture the essence of what made the original films successful it leans heavily on nostalgia but fails to deliver a fresh and engaging experience for both old fans and new viewers the film serves as a reminder that sometimes its best to let beloved franchises rest rather than dragging them out for another round of mediocrity while there are moments of action and spectacle they are overshadowed by the lack of genuine humor and compelling storytelling overall bad boys ride or die is a disappointing addition to the franchise that fails to live up to its predecessors,NEGATIVE,Comedy
896,10.0,12 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",in bad boys ride or die there are things that deserve praise like the action and comedy scenes direction soundtrack performances of smith and lawrence cinematography and ending but at the same time there are things that are at least from my point of view inferior to the previous installment like the story and the screenplay regarding the story compared to bad boys for life it was of a lower level because it didnt have many surprises and twists like the previous one and regarding the screenplay the previous movie had a better screenplay than this one because the scenario and the order of events and how they are presented was a lot better and cought the attention of the person who is watching more but this does not mean that i didnt like bad boys ride or die i liked it and i am looking forward to see what more the franchise will have in the future that is why when it comes to the score i give bad boys ride or die out of,POSITIVE,Comedy
897,8.0,10 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",after purchasing this phone tracker to broadened my thought to the possibilities of having access to a device my new housemate had taken my car and had been gone for days and i needed to find him badly because he could sell my car and get away with it i tried to track his phone using phone tracker but i found sammy from mngpinvestigations gmail as the most worthy recommendation to a professional investigator ethical hacker and a tracking expert among the reviews i write to sammy and explain my situation to him with the hopes that my car gets found i gave him my housemates number that was switched off few hours later his phone number was tracked and it inevitably led hacking his phone his social media and texts were accessible and i was able to go through them and at the same time i was able to get accurate location immediately to bust any form of sale on my car he was so shook when i found him because i was able to go with the police to get him i monitored his calls i monitored his purchases made over transaction alerts and at the same time i was able to access his camera whenever he wasnt actively using the phone i am so elated and happy with the service it blew my mind contact sammy for any emergency regarding tracking thank you,POSITIVE,Comedy
898,4.0,10 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",this was the best bad boys out of all of them and its very hard to compete against bad boys but ride or die out best it action packed with a great comedy chemistry the new direction of the film has created an instant classic film dont let politics speak for this movie because this movie is greatly enjoyed by many i seen this more than twice and its better than all the movies playing now p s please continue making bad boys at least more and make the last one legendary do it for the culture if boring franchises like mission impossible and others can do it youll can as well,POSITIVE,Comedy
899,3.0,9 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",probably the most exciting movie out right now full of humor stunts decent fight scenes and just pure action although both guys have been bad boys since it might be time to retire i actually thought thats what martin lawrences character did in this time around theres a snake in the department involving the killing of their captain in the last movie that fat waste of space dj khaled makes a cameo but its safe to say he wont be back in the next movie thank goodness with his annoying self still the humor and action are why we come to these movies theres plenty to keep you interested and i actually got to say id see this again in theaters summer cinema is alive with this one,POSITIVE,Comedy
900,6.0,7 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",likes moves at a great pace funny acting on point decent character development movie theater elements kicking sound track action scenes return to glory mostly summary our bad boys have always been entertaining as the detectives dive into the heart of the miami underworld this film is stupid fun with an exhilarating and fast pace like the cars they drive holding little time to get into deep artistic dives it pulls from previous stories integrates fun references that many will remember and helps push our characters down familiar avenues the fourth installment offers some character development nothing too deep or poetic but enough to extend our characters to something more than bulletlaunching bad boys it fits into the themes well helps pick up from the better qualities of bad boys three and keeps their fingers on the pulse of just a fun and engaging period and much like the other films they are just fun with the same comedic splendor of the earlier films with the insults slapstick humor and the response to the stupid antics occurring its rated r for sure but that attitude blends so well and makes this movie another nostalgic trip worth taking one thing that has improved is the technology to bring the exciting elements to life loading this film with plenty of theaterworthy qualities to shake up the theater the action is fast frantic and has lots of the familiar elements with little deviation from the edgy goodness that comes with it in my showing my seat quaked from the sound assaults with visuals that were crazy busy but so exciting and filled with that attitude you expect in this film franchise load in the kicking soundtrack this franchise has including a few comedic songs to lighten the mood and you get so much of the original formula to just have a fun time at the movies dislikes some story elements feeling unfinished very fast wrap up the potential setup up aggressive language at times a better developed villain not that original summary no movie is perfect though and this film still struggles with some elements that continued additions can struggle with despite a decent story several elements felt unnecessary unfinished or perhaps very stupid and overdone that i had wished been left out and the time focused on another story a few of these moments involved the captains family which feels very bland and could have gone more while others are setups for what feels like not only a fifth movie but the next duo to join forces in the cartel wars these elements are okay and not the worst by far but they didnt do any favors to strengthen the story a betterdeveloped villain could have gone a long way one with more tricks and threats that werent so familiar or done before several of his associates were also holding potential but alas fell to mediocre levels that pale to some of the other auxiliary characters from the past more action would have been nice for me especially at the end where things seemed to wrap up faster than anticipated and could have done more a small thing for me but big for others the movies foul language gets a tad out of hand but there are far worse games in this field just be warned the verdict perhaps not the most original movie sequel bad boys fourth installment is familiar fun and feels fresh that they took a step back into their wheelhouse with a great buddy system in motion smith and lawrence bring the magic of the decades back and keep things fun and engaging while always edgy the story elements serve their purpose of developing their characters while the action gets major upgrades worthy of a theater visit to take full advantage i loved the comedy the pacing and just getting lost in another fun summer flick sure the movie needs some more originality trimming off some storylines reserved for whatever is to come and could have put some more time into making a better villain yet most arent going to care and just enjoy the fun experience for what its worth therefore i give this movie actionadventurecomedy movie overall,POSITIVE,Comedy
901,1.0,15 August 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",been a hardcore fan of the first bad boys and also enjoyed the second but this one lacks depth and the way the camera moves around all the time makes it really uncomfortable to watch and takes away a lot how you experience the story its like they try to cover the lack of depth with some spectacular filming but they made it worse quite disappointing dont get me wrong its still entertaining but its just not bad boys anymore as it used to be there just could have been worked more in depth around the characters and conversations instead of trying to focus only on the filming its like the directors want it just too much keep it simple and dont overdue it especially when you have good actors,NEGATIVE,Comedy
902,4.0,6 August 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",just cant since the chris rock slap tried my best but will has completely killed his career heres some more words to hit the word criteria what happened next was surreal smiths smile vanished replaced by a determined stride toward the stage barely seconds after rocks quip smith delivered an openhanded slap to the comedians face the audience collectively gaspedwas this a scripted bit but it wasnt rock still recovering from the shock exclaimed oh wow wow will smith just smacked the st out of me smith walked away not looking entirely furious but rather with an expression that said thats what happens when you mess with my woman,NEGATIVE,Comedy
903,10.0,26 July 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",lets start with the poor choice of movie title bad boys life was more suitable for the forth movie but that fact didnt harm this movie quality the rest did i had no expectations from this movie to do anything else different then it did at the other three movies so it is not that big disappointment this movie is a good time for all viewers that like an action humoristic movie it felt like the longest of them all but actually it was the shortest it just didnt have so much convincing or compelling plot when it comes to compering it to all other films that came before it the feeling is that now the fourth movie is the one that has to put a stop to the series i had the greatest times with both of first movies as a teenagers and then as young man but now it feels too generic and too worn out martin lawrence is the start of this feature like in the meaning that he is taking all the burden on his shoulders he is funny he is in control and his taking command of this thing while smith is falling behind the plot doesnt matter because though the tables are a little bit turned for both main characters the rhythm stays the same and everything is running in the same path without any surprises or new interesting new characters its like a meeting with an old friend you exactly know what to expect from and not see him for several years later probably it is better to watch it on the movie theater to give all action sequences an added value and maybe let the movie feel more impressive but nothing changes the fact that this movie is more of the same and probably will not be remembered by old or new fans to come because his lack of any element that would divide it from other movies of the genre that are running in parallel these days,NEGATIVE,Comedy
904,10.0,25 July 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",i wish michael bay wouldve directed this movie and they get different writers a lot of scenes they tried too hard to be funny and they were terrible such as marcus in the middle of a shootout trying to eat jelly beans then getting powers from drinking juice a moments this film is very predictable marcus character is annoying just stop trying to make him funny every scene theres a few things in here from the older films that is brought back thats honestly getting played out this is a comedy first then action second type movie when it should be the other way around conclusion its completely trash,NEGATIVE,Comedy
905,9.0,18 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",if you have a below average iq you might enjoy it i left the theatre and heard a group in their s quoting the funny lines in the movie but it felt like they only enjoyed it because they were white and liked the way black people talk why these filmmakers felt it to be organic to bring a witch a long lost song purgatory and soul mates into an already established brilliant series i will never know the directors need to be fired and sent to work on music videos they quite clearly want to steal styles from iconic more talented people from the s but have no clue how to do it the camera never stays still you cannot process the action neon lights reflecting off everything in every scene lense flare used as a stylish way in every internal scene not to mention they have zero clue how to create a cohesive story even with the most basic chatgpt script the story is just two dumb to even comment on and after hours i genuinely cannot remember this is a straight to dvd movie with an excellent lookalike cast what happened to just having an exciting detective story with a couple of side stories to keep things exciting you know like lying to a witness about who you are staying at your partners house with his wife accidentally popping x whilst conducting a investigation the humour is just not there i laughed at this monstrosity not with it theyve made martin as dumb as thor in love thunder far beyond a point where even martin cant save it they both felt like they didnt want to do it but were contracted and forced into it in an attempt to raise the stakes the film uses three characters that literally no one cares about the wife the son and the captains daughter youd have been smarter to bring back marcuss sister or at least make us like anyone in this film i quite honestly dont even know how to review this from the chats in purgatory to the unexplainable and unnecessary panic attacks and the constant stupid flashbacks to earlier on in the film i can rattle my brain to think of a comparable experience to this film truly the worst film ive seen in many years probably since the third its sad to say because i love the first two and find myself and my friends quoting them on a regular basis i wanted it to be so good and i was excited to see will and martin in anything let alone bad boys but terrible film should have never have happened i can only imagine all the money the studio is spending to make people think this is good,NEGATIVE,Comedy
906,8.0,11 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",really enjoyed the fourth movie for me better than third by a long way martin lawrence carried the comedy and great action sequences also really enjoyed how they brought reggies character into it a little bit more also with his own scene that was probably the best scene in the movie to be honest very fun movie to watch as they always are and if they were to do another one you always know that its gonna be worth the watch no matter how old they are like the little references from the first and second movie also making sure they dont forget the roots of where it came from great movie,POSITIVE,Comedy
907,7.0,10 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",will and martin did it again this movie did not disappoint i didnt expect the movie to be as good as it is this is my favorite out of the whole franchise will smith was his cool and smooth character as usual and martin brought back his funny goofy character in this one they both did a great job great acting and a great storyline this felt like the old days and the movie was very funny and action packed there was never a dull moment while watching this movie i really enjoyed this movie from beginning to end my husband dont really like any of the old bad boys movies and he said bad boys was actually really good dont listen to the negative comments i advise everyone to go see bad boys and judge for yourself,POSITIVE,Comedy
908,7.0,9 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",this movie gave me the fun night at the movies i havent had since before the pandemic i laughed out loud and applauded several scenes in this well timed movie will smith and martin lawrence switched roles as martin becomes the aggressive lead of the duo their chemistry is off the chain no matter who takes on the lead the expectation of fugitive son taking on a role in this movie and markuss son in law having a huge part was a pleasant surprise it is apparent he was a fan favorite and as he has literally grown up throughout all of the bad boy installment there were certainly a lot of f bombs throughout the movie but it is still great entertainment i recommend everyone go seen it i will again,POSITIVE,Comedy
909,1.0,8 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",bad boys ride or die is filled to the brim with energy and adrenalinefueled filmmaking to go with it martin lawrence steals the show in the funniest way possible and will smith has comebacks to last a lifetime creatively shot action sequences and crowdcheering moments make this a must see at a theater near you as soon as possible with added michael bayesque flair to the visual flavor pumped throughout the film this is yet another staple and arguably the best that the bad boys franchise has to offer more fun couldnt be had at the movies to start out the summer and i couldnt be more satisfied,POSITIVE,Comedy
910,1.0,7 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",bad boys is everything youd expect laughsbullets and bad boys its great to see smith and lawrence back together again after the whole slap incident the movie gives me a pretty basic but solid story and the action scenes are really good fun and entertaining the camera angles on the other hand are very peculiar and make you feel slightly motion sick this doesnt take away from the movie at all but its something worth mentioning seeing will smith back acting in some good old fashioned action movie was a delight the film is slightly more bloody than the previous entries also a solid entry into what is a pretty great franchise i highly recommend viewing this at the cinemas,POSITIVE,Comedy
911,10.0,7 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",id completely forgotten about bad boys for life but luckily there are were few flashbacks to remind me that mike will smith had been the target of a son he didnt know about armando jacob scipio and that both he and partner marcus martin lawrence risked life and limb to get him behind bars well now a few years later mike has just got married marcus has had a revelatory outofbody experience and their beloved capt howard joe pantoliano has been killed the authorities become increasingly convinced that he was on the take from the drugs cartels m in your bank account can arouse some suspicions though the porsche and beautiful waterside home of mike might have too anyway our duo are having none of these scurrilous allegations and decide to investigate howard expected some sort of disaster so has left the pair some breadcrumbs that lead them to suspect that there is someone close to them who is corrupt with the body count piling up they turn to the incarcerated armando who thinks he may be able to identify the ringleader that just makes him a target too so pretty soon its a nimble deadly and quite grumpy triumvirate who are on the trail of the murderers from now on we have a standard and predicable action adventure with loads of lively pyrotechnics car stunts and an hungry albino crocodile to accompany some quite witty repartee between the two men who are clearly very much at ease in each others company theres a bit of eye candy from alexander ludwig and the underused vanessa hudgens and the pace of the drama builds to a denouement that works well enough whilst screaming sequel at us loudly its nothing at all new but is an engaging exercise in onscreen charisma and i did quite enjoy it,POSITIVE,Comedy
912,4.0,3 August 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",looks like we live in a world where a film like this can make profit people would actually go and see this and this is rated above on imdb great after the ff series finally intrdocued demigod powers of family and went into space one would think that products like these wouldnt work any more but they do i have to give the producers credit for doing enough research to ensure that this film contains tiktok memes call of duty cutscenes action rgb lighting and absolutely nothing that would insult the intelligence of the target audience if you view this as a film and not a wellproduced moderately budgeted content there is nothing of value the story is nonsensical full of cliches and there is no way you can buy anything that is going on the ending is spoiled around the minute mark after that youre just curious how they will get there since the story wasnt a priority the plot just forces the characters to do whatever is necessary to ensure the ending scene happens motivations are goundlevel and even these get shifted and switched whenever necessary everybody talks in descriptions and exposition which again isnt a problem since there is no story to follow nothing to try to understand no reason to explore the motivations people just do stuff when the plot needs it the humor ranged between unfunny and obnoxious i watched this at home so i was able to skip the long marcus ramblings mostly i gave it a chance but quickly understood that i shouldnt have it really felt like i was an audience member in a comedy club where the joker from the film was performing the action was over the top which is expected from the bb series more so from the nd attempt after the exhumation of the franchise the problem was in that it was way too unrealistic not in terms of lethality but literally in terms of excessive cgi nothing felt real so if bright flashes and sound effects dont excite you there is nothing of value actionwise for example i can appreciate over the top action in the mission impossible franchise because i can see real things happening supported by cgi in this film nothing felt exciting probably because ive played videogames and seen lots of fps games trailers to get amazed the getting old for this and the one last time themes were done to death even before this film so at first they try to do something like this but quickly abandon it in favour of colorful videogame imagery and excruciating comedy so overall bad boys ride or die was the worst film i have seen in years if you even consider it one but i can only congratulate the people responsible for slapping it together since the numbers never lie this product was successful despite it being absolutely void of any emotional value p s since i live in ukraine the drone scenes left a mixed impression on me i wouldnt say those hurt my feelings but definitely sparked an emotion the producers probably didnt intend,NEGATIVE,Comedy
913,10.0,26 July 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",i totally get this was supposed to be pure entertainment bringing no deep insights into the nature of the universe but this is so shallow it protrudes a constant stream of clichéd oneliners impossible situations and emptiness its one of the worst films ive ever seen it has no redeeming qualities everything seems to have been done on the cheap its basically a moneygrab cashing in on past success but offering nothing new the action scenes were stupid the heroes were completely untouchable but never missed the story was onedimensional and utterly banal the humour was so staged it was predictable and frankly embarrassing and the characters were just too overthetop almost clownlike,NEGATIVE,Comedy
914,6.0,22 July 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",this movie was awesome i cant wait to watch again i laughed cried laughing and laughed some more great action comedy and outstanding performance from martin and will i enjoyed the action scenes they matched their natural progression in age and life martin was hilarious as usual and will was exceptional as always i loved the reference of including the captain that was one thing i was sad about him passsing away i also enjoyed the live action camera view shots making the movie dynamic relevant to technology enhancements today overall one of my favorite bad boys films bad boys fan for life,POSITIVE,Comedy
915,10.0,18 July 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",bad boys is one of those franchises that brought a lot of money yet is far away from being a cult property this movie basically brings nothing new to the table that previous three didnt have the chemistry of the two leads saves the film from being totally forgettable i wont say i hated the film or was bored with it but i didnt have much fan as i had with previous three films our duo here has to face with their own mortality and purpose of life all while looking to clear their late capn howards name the movie largely relies on previous movies in terms of jokes and vibe especially the first film in fact i dont know how much lorne balfe had to tinker with the score here but all i hear are tunes i heard already by mark mancina for the original the action scenes are your typical loud bang and flashy but without your michael bayhem style instead all action scenes rely on some really clever and inventive camerawork ofcourse mike and marcus still carry this movie though their basically married relationship but all jokes seem washed up and arent funny as for the plot its by the book and completely predictable i wish that more attention is given to eric dane who plays the antagonist and chews every scene hes in but he had to do very little here and basically was another cardboard onedimensional villain so there is that at least vanessa hudgens and paola nunez are hot as before,NEGATIVE,Comedy
916,10.0,15 July 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",if you are a fan of the second movie this is a true successor to that it is funny tearjerking and action packed the third movie missed some magic but this movie really kicked butt i enjoyed every minute of this movie i wont spoil this movie but it is worth a watch if you fans of the second movie i particularly liked the cinematography chemistry and plot this time round martin lawrence delivers and will smith complemented him to perfection if you enjoy action movies with comedic elements this is the best fun movie in a while i hope they continue making more movies bad boys bad boys,POSITIVE,Comedy

922,5.0,7 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",smith and lawrence havent lost a beat their comic chemistry is as strong as ever the movie has a slow start but when s gets real the action and suspense ramp up to a satisfying final showdown the supporting good guy characters and the antagonists in the film are strong and all have relevant roles to play in the story the the direction and style of the film is more dynamic than the last there is creative camerawork vibrant visuals some of the editing early in the film is a little janky but it improves throughout as chaotic as some of the action gets in the films biggest scenes its not hard to follow its a well made modern action film that shows that this franchise isnt ready to die anytime soon,POSITIVE,Comedy
923,10.0,10 August 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",will smith and martin lawrence continue to have great chemistry as the bad boys this entry does put a new spin on the franchise by having mike will smith be the scared one and marcus martin lawrence be the chilled calm one which makes for some great comedy and tension mike finally has a family and that means something to lose martin continues to deliver on the humour and many moments with him got a chuckle out of me unfortunately the plot is incredibly predictable the socalled twist is not even remotely surprising and every character arc is very generic the action scenes are fine but lack the octane energy of the first movies there is one great action set piece but it is not from will smith or martins character still it is fun popcorn entertainment and i had a good time with it,NEGATIVE,Comedy
924,9.0,29 July 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",i enjoyed this action comedy it had a lot of laugh out loud moments and some good action scenes what are people expecting from a light hearted action comedy its more meaningful than rush hour and less serious than lethal weapon the comedy mostly comes from marcus in this movie due to his outer body experience from a near death experience from the beginning it always delivers on action and it was good to see the reconnection of mike and his son this movie takes off from the last in a good way as not to let the audience know that it makes them look old like it did in the last movie enjoy the fun of it,POSITIVE,Comedy
925,7.0,24 July 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",of course the film still feels huge and like a million dollar movie but the writing just missed the mark for me the franchise never really had great villains but the ex military boogeyman dude this time just feels even more cliche than ever sure its still very weird seeing will smith and trying to pretend hes the character and not the walking slap meme is practically impossible but he still nails the cool guy role with ease so lets get to my biggest problem with the movie martin lawrence up until now hes been the comic relief the lovably weird guy who can still deliver when things go down this time hes just a bloated mess thats annoying at best and a cringeworthy cross between scoobydoo and peter griffin at worst hes not lovably weird in this movie he is just insufferable and stupid bordering on braindead he feels like a mad tv character that doesnt work but is still stretched out over hours the franchise was never overly sophisticated or clever it was always dumb fun this time it missed the crucial fun part,NEGATIVE,Comedy
926,10.0,23 July 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",i dont usually write reviews but i cant stop thinking about this movie without a doubt what i think is the absolute best of the bad boys movies martin is so good hilarious i am glad to see a movie that rehabilitates will smiths career this movie is i forgive him for that oscars debacle it has a lot of action comedy and heart the whole cast is a great ensemble however will smith and martin lawrence are still very much the stars of the show my biggest advice is to go see this movie i literally have not stopped thinking about this motion picture ever since i saw it a couple of days ago go see hit,POSITIVE,Comedy

930,8.0,12 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",to be fair i wasnt expecting a lot from this movie so i was quite relaxed about it just wanting to have some fun turns out i couldnt stop laughing for the way the movie makes fun of action movies in general a good movie to watch with friends and for me it did what i was looking forward to see a funny action movie congrats the whole trama is not really great but i think it was the best way to be able to put all those funny moments in the movie you cant have it all always the solution to the problem as well is a bit meh but it works with the whole friendship problematic thing they have so again quite funny,POSITIVE,Comedy
931,7.0,11 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",this is the fourth instalment of bad boys i think its about time they make this the last this sequel seemed a bit dragged and unnecessary its always great to watch mike lowrey marcus burnett cleansing the streets of miami from the bad boys but after years these guys too need to rest their batch as far as the plot is concerned this movie is the immediate sequel to the bad boys for life and involves the aftermath of captain howards death also with some connections to the second part in which the cartel was involved both lawrence smith are yet again inseparable indispensable but this time they have a new kind of enemy someone from the inside so what you gonna do when they come for you,POSITIVE,Comedy
932,6.0,9 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",i loved this movie it was so fun and easy to follow if you havent watched the others great performance by both will and martin hadnt had so much fun at the movie theatre in a while right amount of comedy and action and thrill went with absolutely no exceptions being that this is the fourth movie and usually sequels get worse with time but i was really impressed i had not seen action and comedy done like this in a long time would even say i would pay to re watch it on the big screen again sooooooooo much fun i loveeeeedddddddddddddddddddddddd thissssss movie soooooooooo muchhhhhhh,POSITIVE,Comedy
933,6.0,8 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",bad boys for life flirted with fast furious territory but bad boys ride or die fully commits to it its full of deep cut references drastic revisions to the franchise history and even completely redeems the previous films villain it all works because the film also doubles down on what made its predecessor a huge surprise whilst avoiding a bloated run time will smith and martin lawrence remain flawless together their opening scene makes it feel like its been mere moments since last time as opposed to the years it has been and none of the off screen events seep into this swapping their dynamics was a great idea cause lawrence being the daredevil and smith being more fearful ensures it stays fresh paola nuñez vanessa hudgens and alexander ludwig all return and prove why they deserve to stay plus joe pantoliano doesnt let his characters death stop him from bringing some welcome heart and humour the villains are kinda naff though especially with a surprise bad guy so obvious they shouldnt even have attempted to keep it a secret adil el arbi and billal fallah have only gotten more confident with their direction the inventive staging from last time has gotten more ambitious with drone shots that would make michael bay proud and a first person shooter style shootout which singlehandedly gets it another point their direction here is further proof that cancelling batgirl was a huge mistake,POSITIVE,Comedy
934,8.0,8 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",the duo is back for the th time in this action buddycop franchise bad boys ride or die explores too many plotlines or bolt between too many characters but brainsfree enjoyment reigns supreme these two actors with nothing matching but their goatees have a spiky bromantic chemistry they dont just ping off one anothers lines they lock and load each other the movie feels sccruffy and overstuffed at times but contagiously goodnatured although the franchise may not be at its strongest the bad boys are still providing innocent amusement to its fans with its bromance my rating,NEGATIVE,Comedy
935,6.0,24 July 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",mike lowrey will smith is getting married marcus burnett martin lawrence has a heartattack at the wedding and sees the late captain howard joe pantoliano the captain tells him that its not his time and he comes out believing that hes invincible meanwhile mcgrath eric dane is framing the captain as a corrupt cop the boys are back and they are still pretty good their banter is still quick the chemistry is still there i dont remember the stories from the previous movies i ended up accepting all the expositions and moving on its been so long ago that i forgot that joey pants was in this franchise i do have an issue with the premise i get the need to raise tension by making everybody believing in the fake evidence im fine with most of that except for judy that makes no sense are we supposed to believe that shes part of the conspiracy or she thinks that the boys are part of the conspiracy neither of which are that reasonable its really bad writing although that has never been this franchises strength,NEGATIVE,Comedy
936,9.0,23 July 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",directors adil bilall seem to have understood the assignment clearly ie to come up with an entry carrying the storyline sensibilities of a s throwback actioner but tailormade for audiences that enjoy buddy cop films in todays times the plot is fairly basic but well connected to the earlier instalments doing its job of making our lead duo move from point a to point b with instances of smartly staged action blended with martin lawrences frequently nonsensical yet hilarious oneliners not all emotional arcs leave a mark though the film doesnt aim for the skies in that department it shines in its execution of set pieces which includes some michael bay signatures too hello drones theyre frenetically edited and woven together not letting the pace dip even for a second this actually works for and against the film the stakes dont feel too high at any point however you wont find yourself reaching for your phone for a good couple of hours p s loved the endcredit donkey bit and marcus whole story around it also well done reggie,POSITIVE,Comedy
937,9.0,15 July 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",honestly ive always thought that the bad boys saga is very underrated because after all its a comedy film so you cant demand as much from it as you would from other films that are more about tension or fiction like interstellar this movie is very good in my opinion because it revolutionized the history of the ways of telling stories on the big screen usually a normal movie has quiet shots where when the characters talk the camera is still focusing on them and thats how cinema has always been but this movie is different we live in a world where applications like tik tok and instagram cause us high levels of topamine for everything that can be seen within them and the movie realized this because they know that at some point if they continue doing movies like this they are going to lose peoples attention so in this movie something is always happening even in the smallest conversations the camera is moving which makes you not lose focus of attention already looking more at what the plot is very good and tells an understandable and entertaining story it is totally enjoyable even if you have not seen the other so in my opinion it is a very good comeback that the saga could have totally recommended,POSITIVE,Comedy
938,8.0,21 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",bad boys ride or die delivered exactly what i expected of it a couple of hours of brainless blockbuster fun with martin lawrence and will smith doing their now very familiar schtick if youre a fan of the franchise the film will not disappoint i hadnt seen the previous bad boys film going into this one and i had to a bit of connecting the dots to make sense of the plot but ride or die isnt exactly taxing on the brain miami cops mike smith and marcus lawrence attempt to clear the name of the late captain howard joe pantoliano who has been framed for being in cahoots with a drugs cartel in doing so they themselves become suspected of foul play helping the guys to ensure that justice is served are mikes son armando jacob scipio and cops kelly vanessa hudgens rita paola núñez and dorn alexander ludwig the script is formulaic but allows for plenty of buddy humour between the leads some of which lands and some of which doesnt and plenty of action much of the comedy is derived from the fact that having survived a heart attack and had an out of body experience marcus now believes that he cannot be killed because its not his time yet which is amusing at first but becomes more laboured as the film progresses i cant remember where but im sure i have seen this done before the action however is a lot of fun with lots of shooting and explosions with the best saved for last as mike marcus and pals launch an assault on the bad guys lair a disused alligator park although noone told the alligators who are still in occupancy and very hungry its instantly forgettable popcorn nonsense but sometimes thats all i want,NEGATIVE,Comedy

955,8.0,8 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",bad boys ride or die is an ideal summer film the film includes humor action and chemistry necessary for a good buddycop film lawrence and smith reprise their roles as miami police partners marcus burnett and mike lowery as with each previous entry will smith is the more professional cop and martin lawrence is still the goofy partner their mission involves clearing capt howards name who is posthumously accused of being a dirty cop they can only trust a select few and their very small band must battle a much larger army of mercenaries street gangs and corrupt members of law enforcement and government the plot is no less ridiculous than previous films and just as fun my quibbles are relatively small but detract from the final product some for me the film makers are able to use the same guy dennis greene for reggie in all four movies but they cant get theresa randle back as burnetts wife both will smith and martin lawrence are obviously older but martin lawrence appears unhealthy every close up he has blood shot eyes as with the three previous films the finale is tedious because of all the ideas and resolutions crammed into the final act so much must happen to finish the story that seems to take forever to reach the end worth a look if youve enjoyed any of the previous entries but dont expect more than a good summer film,NEGATIVE,Comedy
956,8.0,19 August 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",i dont know what it is about bad boys but somehow they always deliver i was hesitant about the third part when it came out in but when i left the theater i was pleased and as if teleported back in when i watched the second installment this time i wasnt worried and it proved me right bad boys ride or die could just be the best sequel of them all its a perfect balance between comedy and action where everything is at its place jokes hit hard and at the right time and when the narrative needs to be serious they cling to it firmly i also liked the camera work a lot with tons of cool shots and camera angles never previously seen on bad boys it means the franchise is changing growing making it better probably not as big on explosive side from the bay era but just as furious and highly octane as any other the movie doesnt forget about the family too although the plot doesnt show anything extraordinary or unheard of its a comedy action flick after all and this is actually not what we came for looking in a bad boys movie will smith and martin lawrences fantastic duo is uncanny and so fun to watch they really made their roles their own by now even though sometimes you see their age written all over their faces as if saying that they are so tired and would rather lie down and rest than go through all that trouble shooting the movie they cant be bad boys forever you know but as long as they are they might just have some fun with it as well overall ride or die is just as great as the late sequel and is way better than any other worthless sequel that no one is asking for i didnt ask for this one either but at least they made an effort and an excellent one too if there ever would be a part five of bad boys ill know it would be great because these boys cannot make it bad,POSITIVE,Comedy
957,8.0,17 August 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",i love the chemistry between will smith and martin lawrence i hope they always continue with the franchise when they can will smith for me is one of the best actors when their late police captain gets linked to drug cartels wisecracking miami cops mike lowrey and marcus burnett embark on a dangerous mission to clear his name when their late police captain gets linked to drug cartels wisecracking miami cops mike lowrey and marcus burnett embark on a dangerous mission to clear his name when their late police captain gets linked to drug cartels wisecracking miami cops mike lowrey and marcus burnett embark on a dangerous mission to clear his name,POSITIVE,Comedy

968,7.0,13 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",go see this movie seriously go see it i have to say my anticipation was low for this movie i went simply because i had seen the others and was curious a bit of a nostalgic throwback i so thoroughly enjoyed myself the movie pace was excellent the throwbackcallback moments were beautiful i laughed so hard so many times i enjoyed the heartfelt moments the plot was solid true to all of the other films the action sequences were incredible interesting and different the directors did an amazing job bring a mew perspective to a shot out sequence because its the fourth film its easy to say its contrite but its because its the fourth film you enjoy the references to the other film you are along for the ride yet again with your old friends the bad boys,POSITIVE,Comedy
969,7.0,12 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",great movie action packed and fit in nicely with the franchise you start to worry when a franchise just goes on and onbut not with this one will and martin make it enjoyable to go to the movies each time they share the screen i was glad to see the writing wasnt forced and the script fit in nicely after the last installment i hope they continue to make a few more because we all know we need good laughs once again the action and special effects are great my only complaint would be to make sure they dont get too unrealistic like the fast and furious franchise did over the years bad boys is a must see for fans,POSITIVE,Comedy
970,7.0,10 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",will smith and martin lawrence are the box office magnets hollywood forgot about time and time again will smith has proven how he can appeal to the masses when he presents his talents on the silver screen but hollywood has chosen to narrow its focus on trash that no one is interested in seeing i could continue analyzing this failure to launch behavior but why waste the time energy and intelligence trying to convince hollywood that when you release trash at the box office the films fail to produce a profit will smith and many other talented actors and actresses are the ticket to reenergizing hollywood there are some extremely good writers and an equal amount of gifted directors and editors out there just waiting for hollywood to wake up and smell the coffee and that is the tip of the iceberg when it comes to producing a successful well acted movie it requires thousands of support staff and specialist to create the final product i am talking about wardrobe specialist special effects masters carpenters mechanics camera specialist etc and never forget the standins stunt doubles so while will smith and martin lawrence and company count the money and receive all the glory maybe some idiot in hollywood will have an epiphany and realize the public like guns justifiable violence some anger lots of good lines for the actors to recite and most importantly professional actors and actresses way to go smith and lawrence,NEGATIVE,Comedy
971,1.0,9 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",comedy gold a fun ride with bad boys i recently watched bad boys and absolutely loved the comedy aspect of the movie more than the action the performances by will smith and martin lawrence were excellent bringing a lot of energy and humor to their roles their chemistry on screen is undeniable and they deliver countless laughoutloud moments that make the film a joy to watch however i felt the supporting cast didnt quite measure up to the main duos level which slightly detracted from the overall experience the plot while somewhat predictable is carried by the strong performances and witty banter between the two leads the action scenes are wellexecuted but its the comedic moments that truly shine and set this movie apart my favorite part was the hilarious interactions between the two leads which kept me entertained from start to finish overall bad boys is a highly entertaining film especially for those who enjoy a good laugh its a perfect blend of comedy and action with a dynamic duo that makes the movie unforgettable definitely worth a watch if youre looking for a fun and engaging film,POSITIVE,Comedy
972,1.0,9 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",i sneaked out of family duty to watch this one no regrets total worth the guilt the dynamics between will and martin are so natural you feel they are like that in real life as a father i also related to wills fatherson scenes excellent play on both genx and genz audience would have given it a higher score but i was expecting a better soundtrack i feel like the generation balance the director managed to achieve with the new actors added to the cast didnt make it through to the soundtrack it felt scarce with a slight disappointment every time a track is played never the less good watch action filled fast paced and nostalgic loved it,POSITIVE,Comedy
973,6.0,8 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",bad boys ride or die is funny enough to give it a try marcus saves the movie with his comedy and a good script it gave me different times a good laugh furthermore there is enough action and a decent story line the co actors around the duo were decent and gave the movie some extra dialoge however i do think will smith is getting a little bit to old to act as the tough bad boy after the golden globes it seems he is trying to get some positive repution back thats maybe also why marcus is more in the lead character then will but if there is a th give him a more supervisior rol with comedy or something bad will smits son was he afraid to talk all by all still a out of mostly because of marcus who gave me some laughs,POSITIVE,Comedy
974,8.0,16 September 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",the last movie in this franchise was terrible and i never thought it could get any worse and believed the end was then so when they came out with this one the expectations were pretty low they should have ended this series after the second movie which was average at best this is a far cry from the first movie and has to be one of the worst movies ive ever seen and i have watched over four thousand movies at least i honestly cant even think of one good thing to say about this movie other than i hope they never make another one i cant believe as of right now its rated a anything below that and i dont even give it a shot so i watched this one dont wast your time,NEGATIVE,Comedy
975,5.0,1 September 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",the only thing more disappointing than this movie was the fact i watched the whole thing from the bizzare lsd type dream death rubbish to lawrences acting actually getting worse then the padding of the dialogue with the leads singing bad boys to each other and stupid pov shooter camera angles this film should never have been made or released the only thing it does is end the franchise for good will smith is not on many call sheets after the slap so youd think he would have taken better care of his existing franchise that he could fall back on can only think hell do another mib movie now,NEGATIVE,Comedy
976,8.0,3 August 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",i enjoyed this film but its starting to get a little fast and furiousy there is one scene which is the best scene of the movie and it involves reggie reggie earned a whole stars for this film otherwise the humour at times didnt land and the action while good just seemed pretty standard i like the direction they took with the story and the acting was good i feel like martin lawrence is about at the point where he cant keep up with his costars but i still liked him overall its nothing fantastic and you dont really miss much also theres an after credits scene that i hope no one stayed back for,POSITIVE,Comedy

978,7.0,30 July 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",bad boys for life was the biggest grossing film of mainly because all movie theatres closed down in march of that year because of the covid pandemic directors adil el arbi and bilall fallah return to the franchise in this noisy but empty movie mike lowery will smith and marcus burnett martin lawrence are now fifty something detectives at the miami police department mike has just got married and marcus has a heart attack where he has visions of their former boss the late captain howard joe pantoliano who gives marcus a cryptic warning soon concocted evidence emerges that captain howard was crooked only both mike and marcus find themselves on the run along with mikes convict son when they tried to clear the captains name it seems captain howard had uncovered police corruption and links to the cartels when he was alive there are some good action sequences some comedy but the plot is lame and forgettable even the casting of one performer gave the corrupt cop away,NEGATIVE,Comedy

1009,8.0,14 July 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",ride or die doesnt have the surprise the emotional authenticity or the genuine relationships of the third one but the franchise film no one was asking for is an electric reprise of the dumb fun buddy action comedy i dont want these movies to be so good because it means i have to keep seeing them the action is zippy and fun not great but never boring the directing homages bay but doesnt rely on his worse tendencies and the plot and story meanders and isnt incredible but it is simple and fun its a film that has two ageing badasses in it that isnt afraid to ride with realworld issues against them and a passing of the torch that feels very unfranchisey and more tongueincheek and human the real genius at the heart of ride or die after the will smith heavy for life is that martin lawrence is the star again he does so much in this movie moves through so many hilarious modes in his journey and the movie isnt afraid of being abjectly silly and wasting a lot of money on simple visual gags and moments designed to make people laugh,POSITIVE,Comedy

1013,7.0,23 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",rating overall a movie that does not feel necessary as it does not really provide anything new in the franchise and feels goofy and stupid by trying new types of shots and editing techiques direction pretty bad the direction on a macroscale tries to be unique for an action comedy but sounds better on paper than it does in practice as the movie just feels goofy and stupid the direction on a microscale feels very stiff and forced the storytelling is pretty generic to other actioncomedies they dont build tension well because the movie is pretty predictable story bad the concept is pretty forced and dumb the plot structure is formulaic the character writing is pretty bland and forced this might be one of the worst interpretations of panic attacksanxiety i have ever seen in a movie because it is so shallow screenplay pretty bad the dialogue is typical actioncomedy dialogue they try to be funny way too often and the hit rate is only the symbolism is so forced that it is laughable especially about the concept of fatherhood living and anxiety the foreshadowing is present but it only makes the movie more predictable acting decent to pretty good will smith good the real star of the show as he uses his natural charisma and experience playing this character to take over all his scenes martin lawrence pretty good has good chemistry with smith and plays the comedic relief character decently well but is a bit too overthetop at points vanessa hudgens decent feels like a cameo alexander ludwig decent feels like a cameo paola núñez decent pretty toneless performance but nothing overtly bad eric dane pretty good plays the villain role well and has good chemistry with will smith ioan gruffudd decent he barely has any screentime but is fine with what he is given jacob scipio decent joe pantoliano pretty bad feels like he is acting to nothing and is more of a cameo than an actual character rest of the cast pretty bad just a lot of typical actioncomedy overthetop performances score decent helps establish the tone and the miami vibe soundtrack decent helps give the movie miami vibes cinematography very bad they try to be unique with all new shots but these shots are so poorly executed that it makes the movie feel incredibly goofy and stupid editing very bad they tried to make this movie look so cool and seamless with its transitions but it ends up making the movie look tacky sound pretty good visual effects decent the practical effects are fine but the cgi is very noticeable pacing pacing is fine as there really isnt that much story climax the climax is executed decently well as it is a typical shootout it tries to do many new types of shots that are not executed well tone tone is very similar to the other movies in the franchise,NEGATIVE,Comedy
1014,8.0,21 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",ride or die would rank as number for me in the franchise behind bad boys ll which has the best villain by far i like it slightly more than the last one only because it has less of the young vs old attitude i think its fair to say we can all move on from the slap and just appreciate entertaining movies and will smith is generally in pretty entertaining movies and i watch movies to be entertained the back and forth banter remains hilarious between mike and marcus the heavy amount of action remains over the top and wildly entertaining michael bay in the first porsche was a nice cameo bad boys ride or die is a blast and what movie fans have been craving as of late and what the industry has been reluctant to deliver no bs no politics just a lot of fun,POSITIVE,Comedy
1015,8.0,16 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",this franchise got tiresome with the first instalment and now with yet another one this is a boring nonsense and mindless soulless turd most things cinematography is fine music is fine acting is fine which is why this movie is not horrible some decently innovative camera movements is kinda fun and we have all seen a lot worse movies sadly that is where the positives end because the writing is atrocious the story predictable and the constant nagging and banter between the two main is boring nothing is believable and in every corner awaits a cliche it is really time to let this string of movies die out once and for all i give this a because it is almost watchable and most thing about this is fine but i was yawning the whole time and i could see every scene play out long before it had such predictable meaningless nonsense if you liked the previous movies you will probably like this too but i am so over this and if they ever come out with more instalments i am not even going to bother,NEGATIVE,Comedy
1016,8.0,13 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",i never thought id actually go and see a bad boys movie in the cinema but online buzz made it hard to resist watching bad boys ride or die on the big screen its not like i especially dislike the franchise as a whole but the first and third entries are so easy to forget because theyre quite good but not good enough to be particularly noteworthy that the only thing i think of when i reflect on the series is the total travesty that is bad boys ii of course thats not particularly fair with this new entry the ratio of success to failure within the franchise is a totally respectable which is actually better than a lot of similarly longrunning series at any rate this fourth film is exactly what youd hope it is a fun energetic and enjoyable buddy cop actioncomedy with two likeable leads slap notwithstanding and several vital setpieces that elegantly capture all the chaos youd expect from something first started by michael bay unfortunately its also just as forgettable as most of its predecessors at the time of writing its only been four days since i saw this and it honestly could have been half a year that doesnt inherently make it bad though after all if you forget what youve had for lunch it doesnt mean you didnt enjoy the meal the two things that really save the movie from falling into mediocrity albeit the upper echelons of mediocrity are its stars and its directors martin lawrence and will smith have excellent chemistry as always and their dynamic keeps the ubergeneric plot feeling light on its feet there are plenty of genuinely funny moments peppered throughout the picture most if not all of which belong solely to lawrence and the tone is fairly upbeat throughout there is some dissonance that occurs due to the stark contrast between the movies typically carefree vibe and some of its meaner moments but the atmosphere is mostly consistent and the piece manages to balance its humour with its harsher elements fairly well adil el arbi and bilall fallahs direction is really bold and it elevates the action far beyond what you may expect often making use of sweeping long takes to dynamically frame its orchestrated mayhem the film grips you by the collar and doesnt let go until the bullets have stopped flying and the baddies are all crumpled on the ground everything is achieved with a striking balance between visual clarity and visceral disarray perfectly encapsulating the socalled bayhem that kicked off this series without succumbing to the confusion it so often carries with it the flick makes good use of practical and digital effects to bring its shootouts chases and crashes to life incorporating an appreciated sense of variety to stop things from ever feeling stale there is more than one sequence that really makes you sit up in your seat and thats more than can be said about any of its predecessors in that sense this is probably the best of its series to be fair thats a difficult claim to make considering how little i remember those movies still i was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this picture its genuinely good and it seems to have been made by people truly passionate about making the best version of it possible its not perfect of course the story is one of the most generic things i think ive ever seen failing to surprise at every turn and introduced characters who make you exclaim theyre the baddie within seconds of their arrival its a little bit too long for its own good lagging ever so slightly in its middle section as it struggles to breathe life into whats perhaps its most wellworn trope the flick includes a few somewhat distracting cameos that feel totally random although i cant say that this is a positive or a negative really plus it introduces a very ofthemoment theme but doesnt really know what to do with it opting to resolve it in an odd scene that totally undercuts what must have been the reason it was included in the first place whats worse is that this theme seems to overtake a more major and more entertaining one thats set up much earlier and feels much more natural to the story the filmmakers are trying to tell despite its problems though this is a really fun time its everything it needs to be and its clichéd nature is almost though not totally cancelled out by its vigorous and inventive action,POSITIVE,Comedy

1021,8.0,9 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",mike lowrey and marcus burnett are back and lets just say age aint nothin but a numberfor their everpresent immaturity that is bad boys ride or die throws our favourite foulmouthed cops back into the fire as they race to clear their late captains name from a corruption scandal prepare for explosions buddycop banter and an abundance of slowmotion that would cause michael bay to blush look theres no denying this movie is pure popcorn fun will smith and martin lawrence slip back into their iconic roles with easetheir comedic chemistry still crackles theres a car chase through a glitzy miami night market thats as thrillingly absurd as anything in the fast furious franchise the filmmakers clearly understand the heart of the series mindless action punctuated by wisecracks but therein lies the rub while the action sequences are undeniably impressivethink bullet ballets and physicsdefying stuntsthey start to feel repetitive after a while the jokes too often fall flat remember that hilarious bit from the trailer about marcuss medical woes yeah thats about the peak of the comedy here it feels like the writers strained a little too hard to recapture the magic of the previous films and some gags land with all the grace of a hippo on roller skates the plot itself is serviceable but unsurprising theres a new villain a fresh mystery but it never feels particularly inspired weve seen this copsontherun trope countless times before and ride or die doesnt offer anything particularly new or thoughtprovoking the movies saving grace is once again the central duo smith maintains his charisma as the evercool mike lowrey while lawrence brings the manic energy particularly when his character goes undercover think a highpitched falsetto that would make a chipmunk blush new additions to the cast like vanessa hudgens as mikes fiery captains daughter add some spark but their roles feel underdeveloped technically the film is solid the direction is slick the editing keeps the pace brisk and the miami setting is as vibrant and sundrenched as ever the soundtrack however is a forgettable mix of generic hiphop and forgettable score so is bad boys ride or die a worthy successor to the franchise hmm not quite its a fun albeit forgettable summer action flick diehard fans will likely find enough to enjoy but for newcomers there are better entries in the buddycop genre think jump street or rush hour this one might make you chuckle or wince but ultimately it wont leave a lasting impression its a perfectly serviceable threestar rideenjoyable in the moment but quickly fading from memory once its over,POSITIVE,Comedy
1022,6.0,9 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",this plot felt more organic and less forced than the last movie it was an interesting concept to have their former captain framed for corruption and having them clear his name while the story flowed much better than the last movie it was very predictable had it not been so predictable this would have been much better but even so this was absolutely entertaining to watch will smith and martin lawrence deliver once again their chemistry is undeniable they just make for a great combo and its no reason fans love these films martin was absolutely funny throughout the whole movie will had his moments but what i liked about him in this movie was the character development there was a sense of growth to his character that is evidently different from the mike lowrey from the first two movies there was a bit of that in the last movie but this movie opens up with him already at that level this film had so much more style than any of the other bad boys movies some chances were taken with the visuals and it worked out for the best the cinematography made this movie so much fun to watch there were so many different and unexpected angles the pacing never lets up making the two hours of this film a breeze to sit through the replacing of the actress that plays martins wife caught me off guard because i wasnt aware that a change had been made but it did not take away from the movie in anyway there are a couple of fun cameos and reggie has a very memorable moment there were also moments that call back to the previous films which tied everything nicely there was only one scene that stood out as being really unrealistic which involved the prevention of armando from falling out of a falling plane but even that wasnt enough to stop me from enjoying this movie if you are a fan of this franchise then it is likely youll enjoy what this film has to offer,POSITIVE,Comedy
1023,7.0,25 August 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",this film is made up of an old and dated formula that only belonged in the s didnt laugh once and martin lawrence did his usual over the top performance that ive always found irritating you dont expect acting in these kind of films to be oscar worthy but the acting was shocking i expected more from will as he is a great actor and even for an action like this i hoped for more even the action sequences were meh they only two guys that did the film any justice were the bastard son and reggie the first two bad boys films were great and lots of fun just leave it there and dont bother watching the last two films,NEGATIVE,Comedy
1024,5.0,21 August 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",i went in expecting nothing because i did not like the one before that bad boys felt like they tried too hard or was it something else honestly i dont remember why i was so bored out of my mind back then it was one of those movies you watch once and forget about as time goes by i just remember being annoyed and could not wait for the movie to end but bad boys was actually entertaining i started watching it with a mindset that i will not enjoy it but the more it went along there more i found myself closer to the screen figure of speech i had a good time watching bad boys ride or die,NEGATIVE,Comedy
1025,10.0,8 August 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",i am glad to see both will and martin back in action and i loved the comedy too the cgi could be better but it was just okay to me i have watched all bad boys films and the first one was and still is my favourite the comedy in the film is also rib cracking with all credits to martin lawrence i really hope this is the last installment of this franchise otherwise another release is doomed to fail just like fast and furious lost its credibility maybe they can do another when they are really old like in their s and early s this time as consultants to a new generation of bad boys but i liked the movie and i recommend you watch it too but it was not what i expected it to be,POSITIVE,Comedy
1026,1.0,28 July 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",overall the movie was not that good but it wasnt that bad i think when i doesnt watch the movie with one of my friends i think i wouldnt like it that much but if u want a solid movie with a shaky actioncamera here you go i really liked the action scene at the end of the movie it was good pached was gory and had one of the best movie action ideas of all time i think for bad boys fans this is the same as the others but if you are a person who wants to see a good movie this isnt your movie but overall a fun movie watch it with your friend s have some fun u can truly make a day better with that movie so i think it is a bretty deasent movie,POSITIVE,Comedy

1028,7.0,26 July 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",while the st is still the best this sequel is a very close nd for me i love the the dynamic between martin lawrence and will smith however for this film my favorite character was reggie who stepped up when marcus needed i love the fact thatthey kept the character i can actually see him as the next bad boy if they decide to reboot the franchise with new leads it is hard to believe that the first movie was relapsed back in i never understood why they waits so long between the sequels but i guess it took them that long to come up with a good enough script to make another one if they do make another i hope they use it as a short of passing the baton,POSITIVE,Comedy
1029,7.0,25 July 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",bad boys ride or die falls flat with its predictable storyline and lackluster execution the movie feels disappointingly scripted offering little surprise or excitement unlike the refreshing vibe of axel f this remake struggles to capture attention relying heavily on wornout tropes and clichés the characters seem to merely go through the motions lacking depth or genuine chemistry despite its attempts at action the sequences feel rehearsed and fail to ignite any real thrill overall bad boys ride or die pales in comparison to its recent counterpart leaving audiences yearning for more substance and originality,NEGATIVE,Comedy
1030,5.0,24 July 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",entertaining but disappointing at the same time in general the previous movie was more successful but this one had a few convincing scenes that lifted this one up khaby lames cameo was surprising now while writing this i am thinking when it is said that his cameo is intended for young people almost years old myself that at the same time i like his videos a lot as for the various scenes the beginning is brilliantly about the fragile digital system and human aging and the problems it brings about what might happen inside someones head as a result of things the execution of the helicopter scene was a bit too messy and the cgi was lame even though the camera work was flying and experimental in general the action of the latter half was entertaining and perhaps suitably overshooting dont forget to watch the post credits even though its a completely stupid joke even though there were many good points it is still not convincing enough i was still able to give it a,NEGATIVE,Comedy
1031,8.0,12 July 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",bad boys for life revives the beloved duo of mike lowrey and marcus burnett in a gripping tale of brotherhood redemption and actionpacked thrills the film follows the seasoned detectives as they face a new threat that puts their partnership to the ultimate test i really enjoyed the movie for its perfect mix of heart humor and adrenalinepumping sequences will smith and martin lawrence shine once again with their impeccable chemistry and witty banter the plot keeps you engaged from start to finish blending intense action with heartfelt moments that deepen the characters arcs i would highly recommend bad boys for life to fans of the previous movies as it stays true to the spirit of the franchise while bringing fresh twists and turns to the table its a mustwatch for anyone who enjoys a good buddy cop film with a lot of heart and a lot of laughs,POSITIVE,Comedy
1032,8.0,27 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",for a fourth outing bad boys ride or die still finds a way to produce the goods i enjoyed what i watched the previous installment remains the clear standout of the series comparatively speaking though i was pleased to see this one still deliver the nessacary entertainment its perhaps my second favourite from the franchise it does have flaws of course like id say its more serious than humourous and the more sincere stuff doesnt always hit as intended especially the bits about howard still theres enough positive humour in there will smith and martin lawrence continue to please in the lead roles they are a great match the rest of the cast are all decent enough ioan gruffudd plays what feels like a typical ioan gruffudd character well jacob scipio meanwhile is pretty solid i will say though that rhea seehorn is underused shes way too good for these sorta bit part roles there are also cameoesque appearances from tiffany haddish and dj khaled which sounds bad on paper but actually both of their scenes are actually quite amusing away from those onscreen camera work and editing are both pluses do we need a fifth bad boys film no would i watch a fifth bad boys film yes yes i would,POSITIVE,Comedy
1033,9.0,23 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",we all agree first movies in a franchise are generally best in the series it was authentic raw believable and fun i must admit second installment was also very good again a good makessense movie however at the end when they travel to cuba it started to dilute into obscurity already bad boys is a flop a crazy story supported by we got to bring attractive people in spandex to get more people in since this is what audiences gravitate to recently where are those spanish officers mike and marcus were always yapping with smart sharp jokes the latest one didnt add anything good either just a ripoff between john wick james bond and all other action movies helicopters now lol id expect bad boys to be like marvel superheroes are helping them now or something like that gimme a break,NEGATIVE,Comedy
1034,6.0,22 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",i really enjoyed this addition to the bad boys franchise per usual martin and will deliver amazing performances of their iconic characters and the stakes are set as high as possible with the two of them ending up on the wrong side of the law in the worst of ways but with quality investigation techniques and iron willpower they fight through serious badassery to uncover the truth and exonerate the innocent facts are this movie was a great kickoff to summer and i am so happy to see martin and will back in their stellar roles as the odd couple best friends theyve always been its a great movie and i laughed my head off,POSITIVE,Comedy
1035,8.0,21 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",i have been a bad boys fan since i went to see the original in i was at the time and didnt really expect all that much from it but after the opening scene where our heroes get car jacked i was hooked the second one came out some years later and i thought it was good but no where near how i felt about the original then years later the rd one came out and it felt more like the st because a lot of the humor was the same the action scenes were invigorating and the original score was brought back which i think anyone can agree makes you feel like its a bad boys movie bad boys ride or die picks up almost right where the rd left off finding our heroes facing something they never have before the action could be the best of the entire franchise its really funny and heartfelt at times the only problem i had with it is that they recast one of the original cast members which kinda bugged me because i liked the continuity having everyone you know and love from the originals coming back but thats the only negative i can say about the movie go watch it and have a blast,POSITIVE,Comedy
1036,8.0,16 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",love the action same vibes of bad boys need to come back with other then hostage rescue formula it its just to old formula jokes were great special combination of mike and marcus new action partners maybe next generation coming the boss was a big lost so they need to replace that character this is one of my favorite movies never get old good action just like tho old times personally the nd movie was fenomenal in action first was the base of the franchise and the follow the right path since then new generations of cops involved too so you need to se all movies from one to to fully understand it,POSITIVE,Comedy

1038,9.0,13 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",the bad boys are back and they do not disappoint action packed funny intense refreshing and fun bad boys ride or die is a solid addition to the bad boys franchise will smith and martin lawrence have always been a fantastic duo and apparently they always will their chemistry hasnt faded one bit the writing is great the acting is good the directing is on point and moment the opening scene starts you know your in for a treat kudos to everyone involved great job all around i tend to lean in the thought that most movies start to push there luck and ruin things when they hit the third film but when it comes to bad boys i feel there is room for more if they continue to stick to core of what these movies are like have up to this point id be excited to hear that there is more coming,POSITIVE,Comedy
1039,9.0,10 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",i have been a fan of the bad boy movies since the first movie came out in ive made an effort to see them all in the cinema i wasnt sure i was ready to live will smith again after the whole oscars thing i didnt think i could suspend belief and enjoy the movie without all the baggage that unfortunately comes with will these days i was wrong this was a great movie and i am glad i saw it at the cinema it is familiar but also has some new elements the original characters are as good as ever and some of the new characters from the last instalment are back this instalment was surprisingly deep as well it touches on themes the previous entries dont cover ill probably see it again at the cinema it was so good,POSITIVE,Comedy
1040,9.0,9 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",bad boys brings back the dynamic duo of will smith and martin lawrence in an actionpacked sequel that keeps the spirit of the franchise alive the film starts off a bit shaky with some plot points feeling a bit forced but it quickly finds its footing the chemistry between smith and lawrence is as strong as ever delivering both intense action sequences and hilarious comedic moments the storyline while having some questionable elements manages to be engaging and entertaining overall its a solid addition to the series and a fun watch for fans if youre looking for an actioncomedy that doesnt take itself too seriously bad boys is definitely worth your time,POSITIVE,Comedy
1041,7.0,8 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",this movie is truly a comedy sketch between martin lawrence and literally every member of the cast martin has a joke to fit every person in the worlds comedy preferences if you like dark humor physical comedy puns sarcasm anecodotal comedy sexual humor cringe deadpan insult comedy musical comedy one line jokes prop comedy wit and wordplay topical comedy or satire martin has a joke for that in this movie i literally dare you to go throughout the entire movie and not laugh his humor had me in stitches throughout the movie there also happens to be a high octane explosive secondary storyline about drug cartels police in a find who the crooked cop is storyline this movie was also a great comeback movie for will smith i appreciated that martin even took shots at will and they joked about will wanting to slap him i feel like that might be a consistent joke at wills expense for the rest of his time as an actor from alexander ludwigs appearance on vikings i have liked him as an actor and it was cool to see him stretch his acting prowess from bloodthirsty viking and broken child to nerdy tech support guy in this film i loved paolos nunez performance in this movie as well she plays the badass female cop very well finally there was another sweet storyline about family which i thought was exemplified beautifully by tasha smithmelanie liburd rhea seahorn joe pantoliano quinn hemphill and the actor who plays the marine they are the beautiful heart of this film and they made me cry one two occasions bad boys ride or die the best of the filled with a whole mix of emotions from laughing and crying to heart pounding wonderment of the crazy action sequences,POSITIVE,Comedy
1042,8.0,14 September 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",i just dont get the bad reviews on this movie if you like the other ones its sure worth watching this one i was unsure if i should watch it or not seeing some of the bad reviews but now after watching it i feel it was not a waste of time its an enjoyable movie just like the rest of them it is a bit predictable now and then but even so the story is good for this type of movie when you watch a movie like this one dont expect shawshanks redemption expect a bad boys movie with action comedy enjoyable characters and everything the other movies had just dont look at the bad comments relax and enjoy,POSITIVE,Comedy
1043,5.0,6 September 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",the movie delivers an entertaining experience striking a great balance between action and comedy while the plot might be predictable it doesnt detract much from the overall enjoyment what really stands out are the welltimed comedic moments not all that keep the mood light and engaging without taking away from the seriousness of the action scenes this mix keeps you hooked and ensures that youre never bogged down by overly intense moments making it a perfect casual watch one of the key strengths of the film lies in its cinematography the visual design is unique and innovative with several sequences that will make you sit up and think wow thats cool the camera work is meticulously crafted capturing action scenes with clarity and precision while maintaining a dynamic sense of movement that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats the cinematography team clearly put in a lot of effort to create a visually striking experience adding an extra layer of appeal the action scenes were well choreographed intense and filled with creative stunts that go beyond the usual formula the fight sequences feel raw and visceral yet theyre also punctuated with moments of humour that lighten the mood and make the film accessible to a wider audience its clear that a lot of attention was paid to crafting memorable action moments that can be both exciting and fun in conclusion despite its predictable plot the movie has enough going for it to be a highly enjoyable watch the combination of solid action great humor and outstanding visuals makes it a wellrounded film that doesnt disappoint its a film that delivers on what it promisesentertainment while it may not break new ground in terms of storytelling its execution makes it more than worth the time a good watch for anyone looking for a fun actionpacked experience with some stunning visuals thrown in,POSITIVE,Comedy
1044,7.0,8 August 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",so it seems like im one of the few people who think the previous one was a great film to revive the franchise but honestly i stand by it and i thought they would just miserably fail if they tried to make more movies to milk that cash cow so i went in skeptical and while i think again against popular opinion apparently that its not as great as the last one its still very entertaining sure it becomes a little predictable and the whole thing seems to be losing a bit of steam but i did enjoy it for what it is and if you dont overthink it too much youll probably have a good time as well,POSITIVE,Comedy
1045,5.0,7 August 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",bad boys are back honestly i could watch will smith and martin lawrence banter in these movies for infinity i love their chemistry together and i hope they never stop making these with or without michael bay this fourth one is a big improvement on the slightly underwhelming third capturing some of the berserkly irreverent shenanigans that made the second film the best theres a scene in the second where lawrences marcus accidentally takes ecstasy and spends a few scenes as a raving unhinged joker in this film he has a near death experience early on and wakes up from it an enlightened man and then becomes extremely effervescent so he basically gets to more or less spend the entire film in joker mode and its a genius move on the writers part because it lets lawrence truly off the chain and smith almost almost struggles to catch up theyre out to clear their former captains name against a frame up job of false corruption charges and while joe pantolianos earthly presence is sorely missed here he still gets a cameo from the great beyond to push the exposition ever onward the villainy is perpetrated by an ex dea agent eric dane gone spectacularly rogue and the film finds a strong threatening antagonist in him with added support from folks like alexander ludwig paola núñez ioan gruffudd and vanessa hudgens directors adil bilal keep the camera work exceptionally dynamic in the spirit of bay and even try some welcome experimental flourishes like a video game style first person shooter pov shot during action sequences smith and lawrence have perfected these two characters and are endlessly watchable hopefully in more sequels to come,POSITIVE,Comedy
1046,4.0,2 August 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",i loved part one it was very funny and serious when it needed to be part was disappointing but after watching i think part is good the problem they have made is they turned these movies into a comedy with over action scenes not a fast paced action movie with some funny comedy another words they have made these movies into dumb comedy flicks part plot was stupid and overrated specifically the son part part completely stupid over acting in almost every scene part very funny action good pace but could have left it alone with the overrated comedy part very serious movie with great comedy throughout the movie,NEGATIVE,Comedy

1048,5.0,27 July 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",when it was funny its was cool and light but then they seemed to get carried away with the funny for such a serious movie the funny parts were too funny and serious times were not enough there wasnt much of a story either how could they have trusted the two young cops they just appeared out of no where didnt fit and the killings too gruesome did we really need to see the bullet going thru his head why and the gators really thats gross way too much shooting way too much blood and you see the cuts and blood really gross u are on edge the whole time cause the camera is running this way and that way from shot to shot nah not an easy watch like the other bad boys previously,NEGATIVE,Comedy
1049,8.0,25 July 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",a big yaaawn with this one its clear that this script was written by chatgpt or some gen z writer because there was absolutely no depth to this story the story was just bland and unintelligent at all it had everything youd expect from a big budget movie soundtrack special fx camera works cinematography the whole shebang but it heavily underdelivered first off from the very beginning of the movie what sucked and ultimately messed it up for me was the annoying martin lawrences performance dude cant act to save his own skin his head looking like an inflated balloon ready to explode any second and they just kept shoving that face on the screen even smith wasnt laughing at any of his dry jokes secondly apart from it being extremely predictable there was so much borrowing from past movies dirty cops bounty hunters being setup on the run from authorities fight on a plane fight with a croc etc nothing new i wonder what people saw in this that made them like it that much at the end of the day its another forgettable action movie starring will smith who wouldnt watch even if it sucked i think will smith is at a place in his career where he simply can get away with any action movie he does and thats the case with this one unlike eddie murphys beverly hills cops that had us nostalgic and rolling on the floor this one did absolutely nothing,NEGATIVE,Comedy
1050,8.0,25 July 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",a well put together film completely destroyed by martin lawrence what an insufferable pointless character flows well characters and story line move well then martins character pops up every now and again to act stupid and say something stupid actually infuriating and would put me off any fuser films he added nothing but took lots away cliche black man role needs leaving in the s cinematically good the other characters and storyline play out well felt similar yo recent mission impossible films loots of action and links to previous films i havent seen previous but i felt the connection,NEGATIVE,Comedy
1051,10.0,24 July 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",i am going to go ahead and call this is really bad movie the jokes fell flat the action needed ten camera switches per scene to make them not look stupid the story was dumb but what really hurt is that the actors were either playing poorly or were completely underused will smith phoned it in martin lawrence was talking and moving slowly like he had dementia alexander ludwig and eric dane were completely underused even ioan gruffudd the same kind of people that thought a sequel to beverly hills cop was a good idea made this movie and it is worse at first i saw some kind of character development acknowledging the same two heroes cannot go through life behaving the same way at their age they stopped doing that in about ten minutes and proceeded to make something that absolutely no one seemed to be having fun in it was plain terrible bottom line avoid this film,NEGATIVE,Comedy
1052,8.0,29 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",when bad boys ride or die started i became nervous because the editing seemed to go right back to using the usual michael bay tricks even though he isnt directing thankfully this problem extends only to the opening as after the title appears the film calms down and is shot and edited in a way that isnt headache inducing theres actually some cool visuals used at one point without spoiling anything that may seem out of place in this series but services the plot fairly well and the action scenes are as fast paced and intense as ever with the choreography stakes and scenarios evoking comparisons to a certain other action series mainly in the second half in fact at one point a character you wouldnt expect to goes full on john wick on the baddies and it is awesome as to the plot its decent with a good mystery though theres a twist villain i predicted the second they were introduced and the comedy is still strong including a fantastic reference to the infamous oscar slap toward the end will smith and martin lawrence are still going strong and still have solid chemistry and while the arc lawrence goes through and his antics can get annoying they thankfully get a laugh as often as they get a groan theres a great intimidating villain played by eric dane though his motivation is a little muddled but hey who goes to a bad boys movie for that and the supporting cast is solid as ever both old and new even the members of ammo who were the worst part of the last movie are a lot better here overall if i were to rank the bad boys films from best to worst i would say for life ride or die the first and the second theyre all dumb popcorn movies luckily i enjoy dumb popcorn movies when theyre done right and these films are definitely done right,POSITIVE,Comedy
1053,7.0,25 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",prior to seeing this one ive seen and like years ago just rewatching and currently minutes into as we speak never seen which apparently was kind of crucial to get a lot of whats going on with this movie since as i remembered it and were kind of stand alone movies like a police procedural elements from carry over in but more as an easter egg rather than story crucial this was probably the biggest problem for me with this movie they constantly reference events from but theres enough new things that more intelligent people can get enough of an idea of what is going on and the flashback to are just the right length that they add needed context without feeling like we ran out of ideas by movie so well silent night deadly night it where well play half of the previous movie in this movie maybe and this is from memory is flashback which to me is perfectly fine this was more enjoyable than i was expecting and it was better thought out maybe not borne levels of cleverness but more thought out and fleshed out than say a transformers movie theres enough meat on this bone to feel like it was worth its ticket price good jokes decent villains that arent white or russian nice to see and really good action yeah it gets goofy at times to the point of cringe but overall probably will watch it again when it comes to streaming but isnt going into regular rotation like hot fuzz does in conclusion good jokes good action better than expected writing good acting fun characters and weirdly a movie you cant fully turn your brain off to enjoy well worth seeing glad i did now with that said i cant remember for the life of me what the spanish bad guy was doing just remember his hideout was an abandoned tourist trap seriously i think it might have been drugsi recall the majority of it was to clear their captains name but i think there was a secondary heist and crime at play oh and obvious heel turn is obvious as soon as that guy was on screen i knew he was a heel turn sigh though they do try to subvert that and are kind of successful and almost had me second guessing myself,POSITIVE,Comedy
1054,7.0,23 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",this was better than i expected i wasnt sure if they could have added anything different they put in a unexpected segment that i dont think anyone expected they have given us reason for a possible spin off and it would be extremely nice to see hopefully they see what could be a great spin off with a new twist son or sons of the bad boys will work rather well with the movie audience after seeing how capable they both are with handing out justice like their fathers so lets let them know we want to see more of the sons in action on a regular basis fans want more so lets have it very soon pin a script fellows hurry up,POSITIVE,Comedy
1055,8.0,23 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",an amazing feat of cinematography this movie was just mesmerising to watch with all of its unique and creative shots and angles the film was packed with action and surprisingly it didnt feel repetitive or boring it felt engaging and dynamic although i havent watched anything from the bad boys before i cant really judge the plot but it does a good job of explaining whats happening to the newer audience comedy is another aspect that was done well the movie had occasional jokes which were timed well and felt like they belonged in that moment overall a great film for people who havent or have watched the bad boys before,POSITIVE,Comedy
1056,5.0,22 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",this was a fun ride great actors great jokes little bit old schooled action fun equals great movie night unfortunately the camera work is poorly done there is way to much shaky cam and switches and unnecessary movements around the actors or scenes someone was inspired by michael bay and that isnt a good thing it puts a dampener on an otherwise pretty amazing movie without giving spoilers a few of the ideas implemented are great at the same time the movie does not try to subscribe to the bigger better more kind of sequel but keeps it simple good old school fun and thats great recommend to watch it wholeheartedly,POSITIVE,Comedy
1057,5.0,18 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",star rating brilliant very good okay poor awful smooth stylish mike lowery will smith and comic sidekick marcus burnett martin lawrence are each facing midlife obstacles with mike getting married before marcus suffers a health scare that forces him to reconsider his life choices but both the guys are forced back into action when renegade agent mcgraph eric dane sets a chain of events in motion where their late captain howard joe pantoliano is framed as a dirty cop as the only man who can identify who ordered howards death mikes estranged imprisoned son and howards killer armando jacob scipio is released to assist marcus and mike plunging them all into a deadly game of cat and mouse they say three is the magic number but movies are a commercial business and obviously the bad boys franchise despite incredibly stretching nearly thirty years despite only four films actually having been made has a massive following especially i would wager among the urban market at least this latest offering from directors adil el asbi and bilall fallah has arrived in comparatively recent succession from the last film unlike the over decade long wait between the last film and the one before it and certainly follows on accurately from the events last time around to be fair there is a fairly coherent plot and subplot to match all the noise and explosions of which there is much of its a capitalist product designed to target a market its fully aware of and its main objective is to deliver the goods but thankfully it doesnt treat its audience like complete morons the odd thing is how the most comedic elements of the earlier films have become the source of the heaviest drama this time around in the shape of marcuss health concerns and the spirit of captain howard visiting the boys to spur them on it is what it is it knows its market perfectly well and its almost certainly going to make a lot of money its ultimately nothing more than that but it delivers the goods and should satisfy its target audience like me i can see bad boys round the corner,POSITIVE,Comedy
1058,6.0,16 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",all bad boys movies have been a fun action filled popcorn flicks the previous movie was that and more and this movie expanded on the and more with emotional moments and questions on life surprising deep for a buddy cop movie deeply pleased to be able to see will smiths comeback tour in person just to find out will never went anymore great action scenes that keep me entertained throughout the whole movie especially the plane escape scene great comedy plenty of well timed jokes and perfectly executed moments between both leads got to see this opening weekend with some college friends and had a great time,POSITIVE,Comedy
1059,7.0,15 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",not a bad movie but not great either most of the comedy fell flat to me my theater was relatively quiet most the time martin lawrence acting too ridiculous too much even bad boys was funnier than this movie and is not super funny and at least bad boys had a better plot and pacing to make up for it ride or die plot is super cliche and not very engaging even for a bad boys movie bad boys s plot was better its no masterpiece of course but its story almost played like a soap opera but done surprisingly well for an action movie but bad boys plot i dont even know how to describe it just incohesive and all over the place feels like a bad mission impossible ripoff as for the action its just okay and nothing we havent seen before the action also sometimes tries to incorporate weird choppy camera tricks and gimmicks and they flat out just dont work for me and took me out of the movie i appreciate them trying to be more unique and experimental but still wasnt good and not needed bad boys still has by far the best action of the whole series why wont michael bay come back to the series after the movie i had this feeling that this movie was not needed at all im surprised a lot of people are saying this is better than bad boys i personally dont see it bad boys was much better in both plot pacing action and comedy bad boys has my favorite plot of the series but bad boys is just straight up the most fun to watch and never gets old and it fits perfectly for what bad boys should be an awesome amazing hardcore brainless action movie so bad boys is still the goat bad boys will still always be the best its hard to beat that classic high octane energy of classic michael bay and will smith and martin lawrence were funnier than ever back then,NEGATIVE,Comedy
1060,7.0,14 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",the concept of this film was actually really good the problem with the entire thing was the cinematography i felt like i was watching a dang video game and i dont play video games the casting was also really far off eric dane is just not a good protagonist i love all the bad boys movies but this one just made me dizzy from the camera angles i also very much missed the original teresa the plot was excellent again it felt like i was wearing beer goggles trying to watch this thing the ankle shots of the gun look like i was on my soninlaws playstation playing call of duty really could have been done a little bit better,NEGATIVE,Comedy
1061,8.0,10 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",bad boys ride or die is a wild ride from start to finish but not without its flaws the fourth installment in the franchise directed by adil el arbi and bilall fallah brings back the beloved duo of will smith and martin lawrence as miami detectives mike lowrey and marcus burnett their chemistry is still the highlight carrying the movie through its more contrived and chaotic moments the plot is admittedly a bit all over the place with mike and marcus framed and on the run after the late captain howard is implicated in drugrelated crimes they face off against a mysterious mercenary and deal with various personal dramas along the way while the storyline often feels convoluted and overly stuffed the action sequences are undeniably fun and engaging featuring impressive drone shots and explosive setpieces smith and lawrences banter remains sharp though some jokes fall flat and the character development sometimes feels shallow the movie leans heavily on nostalgia and the established dynamic between its leads which can be both a strength and a limitation overall bad boys ride or die is an entertaining summer blockbuster that delivers on action and humor even if its plot is a bit messy its worth watching for fans of the series especially to see smith and lawrence in action again id rate it a for its fun factor and the undeniable charm of its leading duo,POSITIVE,Comedy
1062,5.0,10 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",a couple of weeks ago the industry and moviegoers were on the verge of collapse and maximum uncertainty as they saw how the box office was moving away from the big blockbusters and hundreds of theories were beginning to be commented on however there was a fireproof couple that would come to everyones rescue to show that movie theaters are not dying they are simply waiting for their ideal candidate to visit so the bad guys have brought people back to the movie theaters and they do it with their own merits why again in their fourth installment they do it again with a fun entertaining epic exciting and meaningless show that catapults smith and lawrence as the eternal bad boys who simply continue to do their best to provide us with fun in the purest style of a couple with whom we have grown up over time with an undisputed chemistry and scriptwriters who know how to take advantage of that relationship where they once again get it right in the comic dialogues of an unmatched martin lawrence and a will smith as the faithful squire that lead us to have two characters that continue to give the best funny moments within of an action film like the bad boys saga they may be years older and will continue to generate the same empathy with the viewer thanks to the fact that characters and actors strengthen each other we also find a cast that is establishing itself within the universe and that contributes its degree of freshness i think of you jacob scipio an interesting villain like eric dane an ioan gruffudd who brings his simple touch and secondary characters who are full of sympathy like hudgens ludwig and nuñez the trick behind the saga is also knowing how to choose the heirs of michael bay where the belgian directors are the perfect replacement to give freshness to the saga where they do not try to match bay but rather make their own version of a direction that in this fourth installment works perfectly and where they once again demonstrate that they are directors who know how to take advantage of their available budget especially if we take into account that they only get million to make a delivery with much more action than in their previous work they are million more than in the previous one but they make it perform as if they were double great for the directors we have a script that is not complicated to a greater extent it once again gives us somewhat clichéd aspects to link stories and characters but it is not that they are a total disaster taking into account that it tries to include new generations and an audience that is looking for something more that the bad is bad and the good is good new generations that also prefer to have the context of certain things whether we like it or not these are the times and the script allows itself to please everyone and ultimately it doesnt look bad a strange but satisfying soundtrack by lorne balfe and a photography loaded with what bay accustomed us to by robrecht heyvaert join a direction by a duo of directors that manages to provide sequences and moments that one can remember and enjoy with complete satisfaction bad boys ride or die makes us have a fun and at times exciting show to continue consolidating a saga that never clashes that perhaps its two new installments do not come close to matching its two previous classics but without a doubt they are tremendous films to provide entertainment and moments to enjoy with a couple of police officers who were born to ride together die together and be rebels forever,POSITIVE,Comedy
1063,6.0,23 August 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",a movie that delivers as much as its predecessor whilst still managing to create great setups for humour and action if not too many the action is astoundingly innovative with many unique pov and drone shots used in shootout set pieces will smith and martin lawrence continue to deliver in their unmatched chemistry selling the chaotic moments they find themselves in the real highlights though ended up being dennis greene and jacob scipio as reggie and armando respectively they were able to independently entertain more than i thought and got some of the best sequences of the movie however the antagonists of this movie are very uninteresting feeling more like relics of a generic s cop movie rather than being on par with the eccentric craziness of the franchises previous villains joe pantoliano although in the film is noticeably absent also giving the movie a captainhowardsized hole thats unable to be filled some minor nitpicks include a few comedic moments that border on parody mikes character arc in this feels too briefly touched upon and resolved too quickly and the concept of the bad boys on the run feels somewhat like wasted potential with so many comedic possibilities left unexplored in conclusion a decent followup and really good action movie overall that delivers on enough to keep you entertained but misses enough to make you question whether it could have been better,POSITIVE,Comedy
1064,9.0,21 August 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",listen even if they make bad boys films id still watch them all mike lowrey and marcus are amazing characters and its great to see these actors still doing bits in their fifties reggie was the main fella in this one though him singlehandedly seeing off bad guys proper boss move and great that weve literally seen him grow up and become the man he is in this film very strange how theresas actress was replaced tasha smith taking over from theresa randle really enjoyed armando in this film i just wished the bond between him and mike was better but this may happen if there are to be any sequels,POSITIVE,Comedy
1065,7.0,11 August 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",okay first of im a huge fan of s buddy cop movies this one got really close but somehow it couldnt manage to give me the same vibe the abrupt cuts somewhat lazy writing and a cliche plot which is kind of what s movies offer anyway didnt quite cut it for me although i had a few chuckles for the comic timing of martin lawrence some jokes were bad but some worked for me somehow the side characters overshadowed the cops maybe it is done intentionally to drag the franchise further in future i honestly dont think id want to watch another slice of it for me bad boys kinda finished after the second one makers dont make it worse than it already is for old times sake,NEGATIVE,Comedy
1066,9.0,6 August 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",this is the type of movies we need a simple fun escapist romp i remember the first bad boys movie and years patter we got part the stories might not make much sence and the cast is too large but the movie is one fun ride start to finish the comedy was fine and non pc which is refreshing in some jokes landed better than others still i had some issues with the directing specially the action scenes while the long takes look interesting they also look fake and i hated the fpc shooter during the big action scenes making a movie look like a game and a game cut scene is not the flex the director thought it was overall a fun movie well worth the time investment especially if youre a fan of the previous movies this was a long rant but amazon needs to reduce this char limit,POSITIVE,Comedy

1068,8.0,1 July 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",in my professional opinion the bad boys franchise has achieved a level of success comparable to the fast and furious franchise while some may perceive this comparison as a criticism i intend it as a sincere compliment the escapades of mike and marcus continue to entertain audiences although marcuss character portrayed by martin lawrence occasionally exhibits repetitive tendencies similar to detective lowery played by will smith i believe the writers could dedicate more effort to developing marcuss backstory and providing him with more substantial screen time beyond his family dynamics nevertheless it is commendable that the film consistently emphasizes marcuss primary role as a devoted husband and father the writers also introduce a new element to mikes character albeit somewhat predictably and at a relatively late stage in the franchise considering his past experiences despite this i found it to be a welcome addition overall my companion and i thoroughly enjoyed the film experiencing both laughter and emotional moments in conclusion i consider it a successful cinematic experience,POSITIVE,Comedy
1069,8.0,26 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",martin lawrence is funny asf in the beginning lots of comedy and action more comedic than the third but still lots of action martin lawrence was slimmer which is good its great how they brought the captain back for those that cant over will smiths slap needs to know that he has made a mistake and it happened over years ago were over it will smith is a great actor and bad boys wouldnt be the same without him this movie made over million on its opening week which is good definitely more funny moments such as the reba scene those two gun men were hilarious and i like how reggie played a big role in the th film and hope to see more of him,POSITIVE,Comedy

1071,8.0,19 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",out of all the bad boys movies i really like the comedy on this one there are always moments that are hilarious with martin and will but the jokes on this one went a little extra i also love the mention of spirituality in this film of course in a very comedic fashion it shows that the writing was done in accordance with current pop culture it doesnt feel outdated or anything like that it was actionpacked of course but it appears that there was the use of new technologies as well in some scenes which made it all the more engaging this movie wins i really enjoyed it from all aspects,POSITIVE,Comedy

1076,7.0,10 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",the bad boys franchise is one that i have always found enjoyment in but only mildly with the first two movies i just found them to be style over substance but their chemistry always worked for me it wasnt until when bad boys for life came out that the franchise found its true footing in my opinion the characters story and action all felt more real and believable to me while also being ridiculous as always for that i was looking forward to bad boys ride or die and i must say i am a much bigger fan of these two new modern movies than the older movies here are my thoughts on the latest bad boys flick picking up after the events of the third movie bad boys ride or die follows an aging mike will smith and marcus martin lawrence as they find out that their former captain who is now deceased has been framed news gets out that he has been tied to drug cartels for years and with the help of captain rita secada paola núñez and a mayoral candidate adam lockwood ioan gruffudd they do everything they can to prove his innocence and protect the legacy of his name there are a couple of very obvious subplot twists that come and go so its far from perfect but the beating heart of why i liked the previous instalment so much is very much present here as well the surprising revelation in the last movie that mike has a son honestly added to the story in my opinion and im very happy he wasnt forgotten about he is just as prominent in this instalment and jacob scipios portrayal steals the movie multiple times i will also say that marcus soninlaw reggie dennis greene has a couple of great moments as well this is a movie that gives the fans what they want in terms of characters story and action even though its all just ridiculous and not meant to be taken overly seriously directors adil el arbi and bilall fallah once again direct and their sensibilities are felt once again they have a knack for making a good buddy cop movie and i would love to see an original one made by them overall bad boys ride or die isnt quite as good as its predecessor but thats okay because i still had a good time with it and the open ending hooked me for sure where i will say this movie suffers the most is in the editing there were numerous times when it felt either too choppy too slow or just off from a lot of fades to action scenes cutting between way too many different angles it did feel jumbled at times the action couldve used a bit more time to breathe and the dramatic moments hit a little too hard for the type of film that it is and it really does linger on those moments still aside from how the film was assembled i had a great time and i believe many others will too,POSITIVE,Comedy

1087,8.0,3 July 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",the previous entry fell a little flat our buddy cop duo return back to the blue skies of miami business as usual for our double act the plot was good rehashing previous movies that lead to a more palpable outcome marcus overweight and eating junk mike still driving the porsche with his small lens sunglasses with usual vest and fly away shirt but now in fast lane both put their comedy chops to good use and the pace picks up more than the previous entry with more guns blazing and action that feels like a playback to the action movies of the s but the thing with bay boys the actioncomedy format has become very diluted but the humour and fast pace action is still at large making it good watch,POSITIVE,Comedy
1088,7.0,29 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",bad boys ride or die is an enjoyable fourth installment with a fun script full of action the story is not very original but the way it is captured on the screen by the two directors turns out to be a joy the cast is good having characters of different races all working together and without prejudice will smith and martin lawrence are great as this comical police couple even to the point of black humor in some scenes with lawrence being the one who brings the film afloat in addition to an explosive performance by the mexican paola núñez and an outstanding performance by the british jacob scipio the cinematography is typical it is not bad but it is not excellent either for its part the sound design has quality and the special effects achieve their mission without being completely realistic bad boys ride or die is explosively entertaining,POSITIVE,Comedy

1091,8.0,26 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",bad boys ride or die is pure popcorn entertainment adil bilall really come into their own with this one not as imitators of michael bay but as successors this is s bayhem without the bay acrobatic drones wild kinetics and maximalist glee in their own flavor the visuals are wild and creative the action is ridiculous and the comedy hits its a perfect summer tonic martin lawrence and will smith still have it they are such dynamically fun double acts their comedic timing and chemistry set this franchise apart from others though it feels like its becoming more fast furiousesque the film starts off rough but adil bilalls exhilarating direction and some topnotch action sequences ensure that it quickly gets better as it goes at the end of the day its a popcorn movie a real audience pleaser it is an entertaining movie with a solid cast that doesnt do anything special but is still super fun,POSITIVE,Comedy
1092,8.0,24 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",as with so many movies that have came out lately common complaints are they are too long and too much cgi bad boys ride or die has a good running time and is very practical beyond that it has its fun and knows what the audience wants out of it its not without its problems but these can be mostly ignored since youll spend most of the time laughing and enjoying these characters yet again i dont think any movie needs to prove why its the fourth in a series that has spanned years at the minimum it should be simply good if it jumps the shark then it could teeter towards being not good if it doesnt have anything to strongly counter balance some wackiness bad boys does have some wackiness but it falls in line with the three previous movies really well while some of the first act shenanigans might be on the brink of being over the top for some the movie does settle down to become a well done action film as previously mentioned its the comedy that stands toe to toe with the action a great example of this is a scene where our two main actors are trying to get out of a situation where they are stealing a vehicle and clothes from some characters that might be a little racist instead of stopping to preach to the audience we get a very funny scene that reverses the comedic expectations the movie is never boring the tight script keeps things moving along and interesting throughout so any negatives are quickly forgotten while you watch it sure theyll weigh appropriately on my review but they dont take away from the positive experience rather than trying to appeal to everyone im so glad bad boys appealed to fans of action movies with a healthy dose of laugh out loud comedy,POSITIVE,Comedy
1093,6.0,22 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",so bad boys ride or die came out this week i have some mixed feelings about this entry into the series so lets break it down lets start out with the good the movie is exactly what you would expect coming from a bad boys movie theres plenty of action comedy and the chemistry between will smiths mike and martin lawrences marcus is still there the story is enough to keep you engaged for the hr and minute runtime the writers once again add the family elements and emotional tones carry over from bad boys for life there are some big changes going on in mikes life as well as marcus but just like the characters themselves mike takes it seriously while marcus makes fun with it some of the action sequences are outstanding with great camera work specifically the helicopter sequence one area of bad boys for life i felt fell flat was the end cgi fx luckily this movie may have learned from that for the better one action highlight that was completely unexpected comes from reggie also keep an eye out for the michael bay cameo lets move on to the aspects of the movie i really didnt care for the single aspect of the movies story i didnt care for revolves around marcus his character is and always will be the comedic element to keep the movie light but there are some instances in this movie that seem to go too stupid there is one action sequence taking place in a club and marcus makes a point to drink punch and attempt to eat jelly beans during the shootout it just didnt fit the mood of the scene and breaks the flow of this otherwise great action sequence the other issue with the movie i had was with the overused up the barrel of the gun first person view it was great in the final fight but the sporadic use of it elsewhere in the film didnt have a great impact on those scenes overall the movie continues to keep you engaged with the characters weve loved for almost years now there is plenty of action and fun sony has put out a behind the scenes video of how some of the camera work was done and it shows how much went into it to deliver an action sequence i dont recall ever seeing before,POSITIVE,Comedy
1094,5.0,18 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",action sequences are well made cops trying to shoulder a cop is nice to see the special thing about the action sequence is that it is funny too marcus is really funny he does guide mike though mike is smarter there is a thin line of righteousness seen all along the movie the plot that the mayor is the culprit cant be guessed easily the final action sequence where mike handles the villain is a classy one the movie ends with a comedy which brings smiles to the people when they leave the cinema hall overall the movie is a good cop movie to watch bad bays did ride and will ride in the box office too,POSITIVE,Comedy
1095,7.0,17 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",after getting married mike lowreys celebration is cut short when he learns that the late captain howard is being framed for making deals with the cartel he and marcus burnett go on the case to prove his innocence but soon they are framed with the help of mikes son armando the two detectives have to go on the run as fugitives while proving their innocence and their late captains innocence bad boys ride or die is the biggest surprise of the year so far i already thought it looked good but it is now my favorite movie from the bad boys series as it lets loose from the last film despite being a comedy bad boys ride or die has a very engaging story the movie has the two detectives on the run alongside armando which creates some spicy stakes for several reasons one they have to go out of their way to prove that captain conrad howard did nothing wrong to people in power they are dead set on howard being guilty so that makes it difficult to even build a case to prove his innocence two nearly every character has a vulnerable moment not only are mike and marcus involved but so is armando howards family their allies from the last film marcus family and mikes wife this is a movie that puts everyone in danger at least once making it important for everyone to stay on their toes three mike and marcus have very few people who they can trust with a bounty on them they have to watch their own backs the only person they can trust while on the run is a convicted murderer who has the details on who set howard up ride or die shows that just because a movie is a comedy it does not have to be without tension or intrigue the tone does a great job balancing out the humor and the dramatic scenes speaking of which this movie is just as funny as the other films if not funnier this is the first time in a while that i have been laughing hard in an auditorium the comedic timing with gags is gold especially the banter between mike and marcus there is one moment in the climax that cracked me up hard the script is really strong here with a tone that allows the stars to revel in comedic moments more than the last film but still keep their dramatic chops the performances are great too will smith is a great straight man who keeps martin lawrence in check he handles most of the dramatic moments beautifully which also makes his comedic lines more impeccably timed martin lawrence on the other hand is a riot here the last movie had him take a more dramatic turn with his character marcus as a concerned partner to mike in this movie he goes fully comedic and he is glorious to watch his banter with mike and reactions to everything are a joy lawrence has the best lines and delivery he and smith are the perfect duo as their chemistry is at a high with this film their dynamic never gets old the supporting cast is pretty good too the standout is jacob scipio as armando who is very authentic and committed he brings a level of heart and sincerity to a film full of comedy especially during his scenes with mike scipio has chops to be a great action star especially with how handles the prison scene dennis greene as reggie is great in this movie as he gets his time to shine big time here which made me happy mike and marcus allies from the last film return and while they are not deep characters they are very likable and they contribute to the story and action paola nunez as rita has a moment here that made me cheer on the inside because it subverts a really annoying trope about love eric dane as the villain james mcgrath could have been given a little more to do but his presence and line delivery help make him an effective villain also there are some twists with this character that tie him with the conflicts of the last two films the one disappointing part in this cast is how they wasted rhea seehorn as judy howard judy is a character that had potential to be a big part of the story having a vendetta against armando and being the daughter of howard but she gets very few scenes and leaves hardly impact on the story honestly if you take her out not much changes in the story that is my only major flaw with the movie as the rest of the cast is great productionwise this movie sticks with the colorful style of the last film but turns it up a notch there are several scenes filled to the brim with colorful lights and objects making the cinematography and lighting quite eyecatching however it is the action scenes that truly make this movie standout visually the sequences here are amazing they are beautifully shot and choreographed with inventive camerawork fights that get violent and intense and creative settings for the set pieces just a couple of highlights include armando taking down a gang of prisoners in a prison yard reggies whole action scene at the burnett house and most importantly the firstperson sequence in the climax that has to be one of the coolest action scenes i have seen on the big screen beating a lot of flashier films adil el arbi and billah fallah cranked up the craziness in this movie with their direction and they did a great job on making a film more comedic but keeping the dramatic scenes and ramping up the action the soundtrack is pretty good and it i really enjoyed listening to the bad boys score in theaters i enjoyed bad boys ride or die a lot more than i thought i would i was already looking forward to it but this is one of the most entertaining and intense movies of the year there is not a single dull moment in this film the fact that adil el arbi and billah fallah directed a film with such energy creativity and hilarity makes me believe that their batgirl film would have been great too i cannot wait to see what they do next after this actionpacked joyride,POSITIVE,Comedy
1096,7.0,15 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",i watched bad boys and i can say that it was fresh and ok for the most part they did much better compared to last time although they had overdone it with marcuss jokes the first half in particular got me worked up especially with the weird camerawork and closeups of the puffy face of the nolongerprimeyoung martin lawrence making him look too cartoonish at times otherwise i admit the movie has hits especially how the iconic reggie is developed i also really liked marcus whole arc and how it changes the course of the movie smith and lawrence still have chemistry although i dont know if its because of age at times it was already noticeable that will was struggling a bit with the role somehow it didnt come as naturally as it used to while lawrence just covered up his age and speaking difficulty with grimaces and cartoonish overacting i liked that they dont take themselves too seriously although thats also largely a minus the movie is quite predictable with standard classic tropes for such an actioncomedy in the spirit of the s and early s in fact it looked like a tv show at times and honestly the strongest part are the final minutes contrary to the previous film where the still new directors bilal and adil tried to end with some kind of epic shootout but it was kind of a sham here the ending is the strongest part it looks like they have developed a lot but its still obvious at times that theyre trying to emulate bay and even though theyve thrown in a lot more original camera movements and filming ideas this time around there are issues with both editing and pacing the music was also quite disappointing and with a lot of repetitive elements in general a commendable experience a fresh film in the spirit of oldschool action comedies hit or miss humor but a little more effort is evident in the action despite the problems much better than the previous one which was just some amateurish attempt at a copy of michael bay rating,POSITIVE,Comedy
1097,1.0,15 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",i realised while watching bad boys ride or die that i dont actually remember the other movies all that well so maybe im missing something but as a casual viewer it still made for an ok movie these movies are action comedies and the action here is old school and has some cool moments which i do remember all the previous movies having but you might be waiting a while for them as majority of the film is a comedy and this is more of a mixed bag some of the banter between will smith and martin lawrence works but just as much of it doesnt the whole film feels like all those related michael bay movies which i always thought had alot of ups and downs turns out they still do,POSITIVE,Comedy
1098,1.0,13 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",what are you going to do when the bad boys come for you this question has been asked since and there still seems to be no answer luckily for you im here to tell you that you dont need to worry about it because the bad boys arent coming for you yet in bad boys ride or die mike will smith and marcus martin lawrence are back with mike getting married and marcus having a neardeath experience making him believe he cant die warning upcoming spoilers from the previously released bad boys for life the deceased captain howard is being framed for corruption and the bad boys are the only ones trying to clear his name and preserve his posthumous legacy this installment is just as good as the last one i like how they brought the elements that made the last one a hit into this new one after all this time smith and lawrences onscreen chemistry is still amazing and is still the heart of this franchise the humor is still silly but it mostly hits the plot is simple the antagonist very villainoftheweek also there are a few cameos that were a bit strange i didnt really care about that though you dont see a bad boys movie for the compelling story you go for the fun overthetop action scenes of which there are plenty i especially enjoyed some unique camera movements that look like drone shots also a firstperson shooter angle that made the gamer in me happy if you enjoyed bad boys for life i believe you will definitely enjoy ride or die,POSITIVE,Comedy

1100,7.0,10 October 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",after the last horrific movie we decided not to see this in a theatre extremely wise choice this is the worst movie ive seen in years probably since the last one its starts off with a cop racing unsafely through the streets because hes late for something and goes downhill from there i knew immediately who the betrayer was and how most scenes would go down because thats just how unimaginative the filmmakers were terribly directed and acted and i didnt even a crack a smile once the action scenes might have been halfway decent if it didnt look like the cameraman was having seizures while filming it im a huge smith fan but my patience was sorely tested here martin as always continues to be one of the most unlikabke actors of all time and here he takes it to another level we were pulling for the gator to eat him the two saving graces were my city miami looked stunning and dane made a good villain the utter pits of moviemaking lets hope this is the last one,NEGATIVE,Comedy

1103,5.0,25 September 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",i honestly didnt expect to have a good time with this movie considering the disaster that was bad boys for life in and its welldeserved but this film is indeed entertaining fastpaced dizzying and always favoring the overall spectacle adil bilall bring out their best skills in their action sequences because the best facet of ride or die is simply the action they manage to entertain and amaze the audience with drone shots fast camera movements and angles that help idealize the protagonists despite their bad makeup and bad hair the performances are decent for an action comedy the story is not exactly original but it works to continue the plot thread of the previous film the comedy part unfortunately remains lacking its still absurd in the bad sense of the word boring jokes situations with a weak punchline and dialogues too cliché to be funny recommended for those looking for action and comedy bullets and blood crocodiles and donkeys in a movie,NEGATIVE,Comedy
1104,6.0,19 September 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",greetings from lithuania bad boys ride or die is th film in the series and it does what all previous films did it entertains for one evening and then you forget it and never rewatch it ride or die isnt a great action movie but it is a pretty good one i liked most of the film pacing was good acting is solid for this type of film action scenes were descent with particularly one in the house that clearly took inspiration from john wick movies and i will leave it at that at its running time h min it does its job for one evening it entertains overall bad boys ride or die is a pretty good movie to recommend it to see if you have seen previous ones and at least mildly enjoyed them its well paced and has funny moments action scenes are descent and its entertaining,POSITIVE,Comedy

1107,6.0,13 August 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",unacquainted with the bad boys franchise prior to bad boysride or die my primary motivation for viewing the film was the presence of will smith while the film undoubtedly caters to established fans its overtly dramatic inclinations detracted from my overall enjoyment a conventional action spectacle featuring a singular antagonist the film follows the established formula of the series the narrative revolves around the exoneration of the late captain conrad a plot device that serves as a catalyst for the central dynamic between mike lowrey and marcus burnett the introduction of mikes incarcerated son armando adds a familial layer to the established partnership providing a tangential exploration of paternal responsibilities and familial bonds the triumvirate ultimately confronts the primary antagonist mcgrath in a climactic showdown the films exploration of mikes complex personal life balancing his current familial obligations with the demands of his past offers a fleeting glimpse into the characters depth moreover the dynamic between the two protagonists characterized by a blend of camaraderie and comedic interplay remains a cornerstone of the series while certain comedic moments were effective others felt contrived and predictable overall bad boys ride or die is a competent entry in the franchise delivering the expected blend of action and humor however its adherence to familiar tropes limits its capacity to innovate or surprise,POSITIVE,Comedy
1108,6.0,11 August 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",though enjoyable bad boys ride or die does very little to offer anything fresh the movie does boast some decent action set pieces and some great stunt work but the comedy just fails to hit that sweet spot and feels a little forced will smiths performance shines through as he drags martin lawrence through this retread of tired storytelling i love martin but he just feels off in this movie they need to stop riding this franchise and let it go before it descends into just another over the top cgi fest that the fast and furious has become as much as i like will and martin i think its time to let the bad boys retire,NEGATIVE,Comedy
1109,6.0,30 July 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",a noteworthy addition to the franchise this film seamlessly blends modern filmmaking techniques with classic cinematography the directors strike a perfect balance the movie feels fresh while retaining the franchises nostalgic charm the transitions shifting perspectives povs and the hazy gradient yellow skies perfectly capture the essence of miami and its finest will smith and martin lawrences onscreen bromance and comedic timing remain a delight their chemistry is the heart of the film even amidst explosive action sequences with plane crashes and alligators while the side characters were effective a little more screen time for them could have further enriched the story overall the film maintains a steady pace that keeps you engaged dennis greenes reggie was a force to be reckoned with he grabbed the opportunity with open arms and left the audience speechless with his action sequence jacob scipio also impressed as armando armas bringing a crispness to his character sum up the films success lies in its masterful blend of hilarious humor and cuttingedge filmmaking techniques,POSITIVE,Comedy
1110,5.0,24 July 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",this franchise has gone only slowly downhill from the first one but this attempt is still pretty good martin lawrence has bounced back from his stoke like a champ and is still one of the funniest guys in the business it was good to see him and also good to see these two together again the pair seemed more intense than in past films even during the comedic parts and that kind of distracted from the humor bujt it still came through enough for the audience to get a laugh too bad a lot of folks are still holding the slap against will smith yes the dudes had and still has problems but hes an actorforget it and enjoy the ride i wouldnt have anything to do with him in real life but movies arent real life,POSITIVE,Comedy

1112,8.0,26 June 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",bad boys ride or die the addition to the iconic franchise delivers the expected blend of highoctane action and humor though it doesnt quite reach the heights of its predecessors will smith and martin lawrence reprise their roles as detectives mike lowrey and marcus burnett bringing their signature chemistry and banter to the screen once again the plot centers around a new threat that tests their partnership and pushes them to their limits the film is packed with explosive sequences car chases and shootouts maintaining a breakneck pace that keeps viewers entertained the visual effects and stunts are impressive showcasing the franchises commitment to delivering thrilling action however ride or die falls short in terms of originality the storyline feels predictable relying heavily on established tropes and lacking the fresh twists that could have elevated it the humor while effective at times occasionally feels forced and repetitive overall bad boys ride or die is an enjoyable ride for fans of the series but it doesnt bring much new to the table its a solid action movie with familiar faces and explosive fun making it a decent though not exceptional addition to the franchise,POSITIVE,Comedy
1113,8.0,9 October 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",bad boys ride or die is about what i expected it has some pretty good action sequences and the chemistry between lawrence and smith is still there i just never really understood what the movie was about all that much i didnt get into the plot and none of the other characters registered all that much especially the villain im not even sure who the villain was there was another character who kind of looked like him and it was hard to tell them apart there is a weird plot point where martin lawrences character has a near death experience and wanders through the movie like a seer will smiths character is sceptical this new agey stuff made lawrences character a little annoying though maybe thats the point will smith seemed curiously muted you cant help but view his performance here as connected to his infamous oscar slap he seems like hes not too sure what hes doing so hes just going to put his head down and do what hes told the charisma and humour isnt there so much the movie tries a few gimmicks that seem to be typical for netflix its like they know youre probably watching their movie in one tab with a bunch of different tabs open so theyre trying to make you stay on theirs for example in one scene the angle changes to behind the gun like in a first person shooter video game then will smith tosses the gun to martin lawrence and the camera follows it as though mounted on it the movie really needed more of this it needed more attention grabbing tricks in general the script particularly barely has any,NEGATIVE,Comedy

1123,7.0,11 October 2024,"June 7, 2024 (United States)",first off im a big will smith fan and i wanted to like this one but i made it about th of the way and bailed the only time the movie had real soul was when smith was standing up against the fbi insulting his former captain i thought it was really going to get its legs after that but sadly it just returned to a collection of ordered scenes that were primarily rehash eyestunt candy but did nothing to pull you more deeply into the characters or the story its average when compared to stuff out there today but i think the bar is naturally higher for a smith movie and a classic like bad boys the story needed to engage more in a way that more honestly reflects where those characters might find themselves years down the line while still giving the flavor of a bad boys movie its tricky with an aged followup but not impossible and they should have really held out for a script that gave something new while maintaing the bad boys feel lastly the story should have demanded a bit more updated and experienced comedy from the legends smith and martin instead of once again rehashing same old stuff like they are still in their s s they needed to reach a little deeper considering the age of the this franchise their own ages and the fans that have come along and aged with them it just seemed they phoned it in by hitting replay on their normal schtick i know thats not the case but what can i say i expected more,NEGATIVE,Comedy

1148,10.0,7 May 2010,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",to this day the worldwide success of friends is still a bit of a mystery to me sure the show has its moments but nothing that groundbreaking or laughingoutloud funny that would have justified all the accolades friends was a very ambivalent show it had the pretense of being believable while still relying and heavily so on the same old sticom material the characters were supposed to be oh so modern and new but in the end they all fell into a stereotype as the show was devolving into a comedysoap whatever development the characters had it was either shortlived flimsy or a flanderization ie comical and unrealistic exaggeration of a specific trait that wasnt so dominant earlier on the core of the show the infamous rossrachel love story stopped being interesting after the equally infamous we were on a break debacle both changed their mind and heart at the drop of a hat which seriously harmed the empathy long drawnout relationships work only if at least one half of the couple is genuinely suffering about the breakup or about being turned down both ross and rachel instead acted like th graders all along being over each other and not over each other with no rhyme or reason it almost felt like them getting back together was the writers haily mary pass were out of ideas lets get ross and rachel share a kiss or have a baby the happy ending feels more like a token sendoff to tie some loose ends but its really just another kneejerk reaction of two adults who clearly cant put their act together the same lack of development hits joey as well despite him being the least objectionable human being of the lot if youre willing to gloss over his tactless approach to dating he goes from being a suave ladies man to a childlike moron whos more or less his married friends baby his aborted love story with rachel could have been a much better finale given he was indeed showing a softer side but alas it had to be rossrachel monica and chandler shared a tragicomically traumatic childhood that left them scarred so them finding each other made sense and with all the exaggerated personality quirks monica is a control freak chandler is socially inept theyre the most believable characters in the end phoebe can be fun on small doses but shes clearly having mental issues so shoehorning her into married life albeit while still retaining her outthere personality felt forced thats the most annoying side of the show for all the hype and all the great reviews friends was just another sitcom with plenty of forced drama the innovative love story between a cute girl and a dork is still sold as a top feature but i maintain it wasnt that great oh well at least the show has aged horribly so the chances of it still being perceived as one of the best of all time are getting smaller nostalgia will still keep it going strong but to those who loved it so much back then i ask watch it again and see if it was worth all the praise,NEGATIVE,Comedy
1149,8.0,5 February 2015,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i have given this show plenty of chances but i always find myself wanting to commit suicide by the end this show is just not funny the characters are just so annoying and say and do just stupid things not stupid funny but just so dumb people always compare this to seinfeld there is not comparison seinfeld will always be one of the most creative and funny shows out there and not to mention the intro so so corny i just dont get the hypei really gave it my all to watch but it just doesnt make any sense how its so popular lisa kudrow and david schwimmer are also two of the most annoying people there voices faces and antics,NEGATIVE,Comedy
1150,10.0,18 January 2003,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",people are saying that friends is running out of ideas and that the humour is getting dull running out of ideas possibly humour getting feeble absolutely not in fact its getting better ok so perhaps theyre beginning to pair up the six of them but so what chandlers sarcasm is still as funny as ever monicas quirkiness still works phoebes goofiness still brings about a smile and joeyrachel and ross are still as funny as they always were so stop being a bunch of cynics and enjoy the show while its still on,POSITIVE,Comedy
1151,10.0,31 October 2023,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i believe friends has been the only tv show that i have watched over and over many times and still never got bored of and all of this was because of one man mathew perrychandler he was too funny with his jokes and sarcasm whenever am stress i just turn to friends and watch mathew crack his jokes then i feel alright is so sad that you left us and i hope you are in a better place deep inside you brought joy to me especially in times of stress and i know you are a good person rest in perfect peace mathew we will miss you very much and i hope god has send you to a much better place much love,POSITIVE,Comedy

1172,9.0,14 April 2005,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",after seeing every episode of this much loved sitcom i much say that the writers and cast have succeeded in making something that is not only humorous but also forces you to care about the characters and what happens to them in the future all six of the friends bring characteristics to the show that make the viewer feel like they know them each one of the characters is funny in their own way and due to the shows fast pace there is never a boring episode i will say however that towards the end friends did start to lose what it had but never the less was still very good i started watching the show at series five but from then on i was hooked i recommend this sitcom to anyone and everyone,POSITIVE,Comedy

1176,7.0,16 August 2022,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i started watching this show for the first time in which is years after the final season aired on tv never could buy into shows that used laughter tracks found it repulsive but somehow the hype for this show always kept growing louder and louder around me and after failed attempts i tried one more time and voila season took time to get into but once past it seasons were just freakingly amazing the best seasons of the show by the end of s you develop deep attachments towards the cast and the remaining seasons though not as great still have a lot of good stuff the acting in this show is truly exceptional and the comedy is priceless and its also beautifully complimented with family drama to keep it well rounded will always be a fan favorite ive finished possibly reruns of this by now,POSITIVE,Comedy
1177,5.0,1 October 2023,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",in my view two reasons were effective in making this series popular and loved firstly the script and dialogues which were written with great detail and secondly the unique acting of the six main characters who played very well although the atmosphere of the series usually takes place between a cafe and an apartment the series itself is so great that this point is not important at all each part can be seen separately and all the parts can be linked together it is impossible to say which character was better because all six characters were complementary the comedy of the situation of the series and the laughs also helped to make the series funnier unpleasant events discomforts and problems were also seen in the series and sometimes there was a balance between laughter and crying and it was very touching,POSITIVE,Comedy
1178,10.0,24 May 2010,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i have nothing against sitcoms in general as long as they are funny in america there is frasier and will grace in britain there is only fools and horses and last of the summer wine they are great sitcoms there was a time when i didnt like friends very much then again it was also at a time when i wasnt into sitcoms my brother and sister who absolutely adore the show suggested i should try the show again so i did well my initial reaction of the show was wrong this show is great it is funny and smart with appealing characters it is by far one of the better american sitcoms and i do think it is better than everybody loves raymond first and foremost i love the theme song it may get on some peoples nerves but i find it irresistibly catchy memorable and fun with a simple melody and nice lyrics that are relevant i also love how funny and smart friends is some of the episode titles alone are hilarious and clever that reminds me when i see and review when harry met sally maybe the title of the review should be the one with the scene in the diner along with this the writing is consistently funny with some wit and intelligence and very rarely becomes clichéd and cringe worthy i even like the plot lines i dont find them boring predictable perhaps occasionally but the funny situations that the characters get into make them absorbing and worthwhile the direction is also really solid and the photography and scenery are striking i love the characters they are unique and engaging even with their flaws they manage to be likable rachel does have moments when she is spoilt but she is also the epitome of sweetness i know there are people who have problems with jennifer aniston the thing is i dont and i find her at her prettiest and most appealing here monica is another strong character not the funniest by all means but because she is almost like a maternal figure to the other characters with her caring and sympathetic attitude i loved how courtney cox portrayed her phoebe is my favourite female character she is hilarious i especially love her songs they are the sort of songs that are so bad they are great lisa kudrow couldnt have been the more perfect choice for her she pulls off phoebes personality to perfection joey is stupid admittedly but i love him anyway because he is also cool i am not a huge fan of matt leblanc but he is really good as joey matthew perry is great as chandler who is like a clownish and sarcastic sort of character who makes jokes that are almost as bad as phoebes songs but he is still a likable character in his own right ross is deliciously neurotic i constantly love his priceless facial expressions and david schwimmers delivery is absolutely perfect there have also been some wonderful guest stars elliot gould as jack geller gary oldmanwho i really like in films like dracula and immortal beloved as richard crosby michael mckean and danny devito as a stripper who arrives at a party in a policemans outfit all but to name a few overall i love this show not only for the writing but for the characters bethany cox,POSITIVE,Comedy

1182,10.0,1 December 2008,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",to these days i cant figure out what made this average sitcom to be so especial for people the best conclusion i could reach is that this show served for escapism to the real issues that american people where suffering in those days perhaps by seeing that those characters could overcome topics such as divorce infidelity sexual inclinations obsession etc with a smile on their faces real people in a way could deal with that issues in that way however friends was a fictional show much of what it happened albeit taken from reality was dealt in a lighthearted way to sum up although the premise was interesting six friends living together in new york the development of the plot and characters could have been a bit more realistic,POSITIVE,Comedy

1192,10.0,7 May 2017,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is probably one of the most overrated television shows in history i noted a recent imdb poll about the most overrated tv show resulted in friends nearing the top of the list its mundane dull and silly brand of humor is simply painful to watch a bunch of something year olds peddle out some stupid story lines and sometimes poorly attempt physical comedy these imbeciles are unimpressive characters that make you cringe rather than laugh a never ending list of superior shows can be listed that will surpass this show friends is a poor mans seinfeld seinfeld is the greatest comedy in tv history it is an insult to put friends in the same sentence as seinfeld seinfeld had sky high ratings and one of the most watched finales in history friends on the other hand is a rock bottom show which doesnt compare the only redeemable aspect of this show is its theme song which is quite good whenever i listen to it i pretend it is not associated with this atrocity of a show,NEGATIVE,Comedy
1193,10.0,9 February 2004,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is an excellent tv show all of the actors are excellent people are saying they dont understand it which confuses me its great entertainment friends are talking and living their life and you see what goes on its going to be hell when it is finally over the writers are the best i have seen how could it be a horrible show when actresses such as jennifer aniston have won golden globes because of her work in it no one who has watched this show once can say they did not laugh their ass off at least once during the minute period,POSITIVE,Comedy

1201,9.0,16 February 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",the show is iconic but the episodes seem to be to repetitive in which i mean they seem to have the same feel to the plot of each episode,POSITIVE,Comedy
1202,6.0,23 March 2004,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",easily in my top five category of funniest and best shows in prime time history everyone on this show is so witty and delivers their lines superbly that its hard not to like all of them equally however i do have my favorite charactersactorsactresses as im sure everyone who has watched the show even once or twice to those who are avid fans of it well start from least favorite to best characteractor matt le blancjoey tribbiani although some might say because of his boyish good looks his cute jokes that he delivers now and then very well mind you and his ability to make you feel sweet and sorry for him at the same time he is a great actor and plays his part as joey tribbiani really well hes probably my least favorite on the show i love him dont get me wrong but i just appreciate everyone elses talents on the show much more jennifer anistonrachel green rachel green is a funloving cute little waitress who seems to always have trouble finding mr right who is plainly right in front of her who is that you ask well obviously ross gellar her roommate monicas brother rachel is undoubtedly most everyones favorite character who watches this show just not mine sometimes her personality can get a little annoying and although i like her better than joey not very much more but that doesnt go without saying that i dont love her in movies because well i do courtney coxmonica gellar its hard to put monica gellar so far down the list but if i have to make room for the other three than so be it as much as i love her on this show shes just not as good as she is in the scream trilogy but she certainly does a good job convincing you that she hates to be wrong has to have everything her way and is a real trooper with most all of her challenges on the show that the writers give her lisa kudrowpheobe buffey now i love lisa kudrow she is definitely one of the funniest woman comedians which is why i classify her as my favorite female on the show she outdid herself in romy and micheles high school reunion but shes extraordinary on this show shes so ingenious with her comedy which is no doubt why shes won several awards for her role on the program david schwimmerross gellar its so funny to me that i like him so much hes not the best actor in my opinion but he was really good in kissing a fool and really just ok in the pallbearer but my second favorite on the show hes so funny and he cracks me up with all of his facial expressions and the excellent way he delivers his lines he is definitely my second favorite character and actor on the show matthew perrychandler bing they should have a shrine dedicated to this man he is so outstandingly funny in every single project that he works on he is so hysterical and a true actor in everything that he does it is amazing that someone can be so talented i wish that he were given more roles than just the few comedies hes been in including friends but he is such a great character on the show its hard to picture the program without him with that being said i would also like to add that he is not only the best actor on the show and one of my personal favorites but i also believe that he would be such a great dramatic actor if given the chance if youve seen him in shes out of control youll know what im talking about so with that i give this show a definite its one of the best shows to come out within the last ten years and definitely on my top five best shows of all time list and thats my review,POSITIVE,Comedy
1203,1.0,22 April 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this is the show i come back to time after time when im either not sure what to watch next or just want to relax with something familiar ive lost count of how many times ive watched this wonderful show from start to finish over the years at this point i can recite certain episodes verbatimas can many other fans im sure if somehow you havent sat down and given this show a fair shake yet i implore you wait until you have a considerable amount of time on your hands the hours will fly by without much notice,POSITIVE,Comedy
1204,10.0,2 October 2010,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",suffice it to say that friends is a classic comic treatment of what i have always called the postcollege adolescent phase of life which is roughly the ten years immediately following college graduation as you strike out on your own and try to find your place in life it is the time in life when you are likely to have the best health the most freedom the most disposable income if not necessarily the most total income and the most fun if you are fortunate enough to have people to share it all with this phase ends when you settle down both careerwise and familywise and i always found friends to track this time in life quite accurately and with both drama and great humor it follows the life of six young people living in new york city from to so even now a few of the cultural references will be stale but the relationship truths never will be ross is the nerdy guy who grew up to be a little uncomfortable in his skin but still very good looking ross sister monica is an aspiring chef who is now thin but was obese up until the middle of high school rachel has been monicas friend since high school and is adjusting to life without daddys credit card when the series begins and is looking for a career in fashion chandler ross friend since college is successful in his budding career in business rounding out the group is joey not the brightest bulb in the room who wants to be an actor and as a result works a series of odd jobs and stars in a series of odder commercials and the occasional appearance on a tv show finally there is phoebe her history with the group doesnt go much past the beginning of the series as shes had a rather bohemian upbringing that has led to a bohemian adulthood complicating factor as the series begins ross wife has just declared she is gay and left him for another woman ross now and always has had a crush on rachel who doesnt know hes alive and ross wife discovers she is pregnant by ross shortly after the separation one of the best shows on tv with the most heart and the most laughs highly recommended,POSITIVE,Comedy

1206,10.0,16 October 2018,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",even though i didnt live and wasnt born in the s i still find this one of the best sitcoms ever the characters are just great and the chemistry between them is just amazing its so hard choosing who my favourite character is because they are all amazing what i also like about this sitcom that it isnt always sexualized most of the episodes are pretty much pg which makes it watchable for younger audiences or people who are not comfortable with watching sexual activities or references on a sitcom,POSITIVE,Comedy
1207,10.0,22 January 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i strongly believe i am the biggest fan and viewer of friends i even feel like one of them at times when i am watching i know all the words the facial expressions of an even tell what each actor was thinking at the time we all feel apart of it for our own personal reasons thats half the reason we watched it but the worst feeling was when they stopped making them and all actors broke character in the last episode a really sad moment more like traumatic moment its hard to pick a favourite as i could compare myself to any of them at times you could say the show wouldnt be the same without joey he made things more fun yet some would say hes stupid you could say rachel was the best but she was easy annoying stuck up and spoilt honestly jennifer is the sole reason friends actually stopped saying she didnt want to do it then ross with his geeky but mature and sophisticated dialogue i dont think anyone can ever beat matthew perry though i believe that his performance was the best on screen ive ever seen on a show truthful answer is all of them in their own way were the best the chemistry bond fun wit well this wont ever be beaten big bang theory will and grace the office how inlet your mother must all of them awful shows have no baring on friends at all ive heard plenty of people say friends was another boring sit down comedy i hate them people friends comforted people in their hours of need on the death bed break ups hardship all through life it meant so much yes there were too many episodes fixated on dating too many oh my gods some of the jokes werent funny or proportioned so generally this could have been better but still its friends unbeatable in every way to this day it wont die this show came at a time before social media was taking off this was so real people spoke to each other girls were happy being flirted with in person not hiding behind snap chat filters for likes the world of friends was the best show but also the best thing ever to be seen on screen and went worldwide,POSITIVE,Comedy
1208,10.0,3 February 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",unfortunately friends is not my favorite show anymore i started watching it recently after years of not even seeing a single episode and i just didnt find it as funny from the beginning my favorite shows of all time right now are seinfeld the office brooklyn ninenine barry and curb your enthusiasm these shoes have made me laugh so hard and the writing just seems incredible at times but then i watched friends because i had an hbo max subscription recently and decided to watch one of my favorite seasons which is season five i dont know how to explain it but it just didnt seem very comical i still love the characters and i dont think any of them are a bad actors in anyway and i dont even think that the writing is badthere was just something about the type of humor that im just not used to anymore i try to think that back in the day when friends was on live television i definitely would have been a fan who waited for the next episode to air and got ready to watch it with excitement and thats pretty much the only thing i can imagine to try and keep myself from disliking the show for now im just going to say its just not the best anymore sorry i will still have this show up there in maybe the top just because it really did have great entertainment for viewers at the time of watching it while airing anyways thank you friends for what you have done in the entertainment industry but there are new shows out there that are better thanks for reading sina,POSITIVE,Comedy

1218,6.0,19 November 2011,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",after forcefeeding myself a halfdozen episodes of friends i was reminded of hl menckens observation that no one ever went broke underestimating the taste of the american public this is one of the most contrived shows ever produced i have to assume that the people who find this series so riveting only do so to live vicariously through the lives of the characters either that or they are immature yuppie wannabees whose sensibilities have been compromised by gamma rays the effusiveness of most of the positive reviews made me want to throw up friends reeks of nauseating sexual innuendos that are spat out like projectiles from a tennis ball machine when it comes to dealing with sex cheers frasier and seinfeld were far more clever witty and intelligent seinfeld cocreator larry david wanted his shows humor to be based largely on real experiences the show broke one barrier after another and either originated or popularized numerous expressions seinfelds sexual humor was clever and original on friends it was on the same level as smut on cheers ted danson as babe hound sam malone was far more endearing than any of the male characters on friends the show never ran out of hilarious oneliners which was quite a feat considering that the show didnt often venture outside the confines of a bar frasier was both cerebral and jocular how many tv shows make references to the algonquin round table kelsey grammars frasier crane was sidesplitting as he pursued one failed relationship after another but he never descended to the lowlevel sexual innuendos that were characteristic of friends unlike evergreens such as the dick van dyke show years from now friends will have been consigned to the dustbin of forgotten tv shows alongside meet millie and hey jeannie well see,POSITIVE,Comedy

1228,1.0,10 December 2007,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this show is awful i dont understand what is wrong with everybody the only reasonable conclusion that i can come to is that there was some sort of mass hypnosis whereby everyone was convinced this show was funny friends never took any risks tried anything new or even attempted to expand the norm every week it was the same plot with some wacky jokes by phoebe some moronic jokes by joey some boring jokes by ross and rachel some anal retentive jokes by monica and some mildly charming jokes by chandler i realize that this inherently is not a bad thing not every show is meant to push the boundaries of television however if youre going to rest on your laurels and bring nothing new to the table you should at least do a damn good job of it rarely was any joke a surprise or was there ever a truly laugh out loud moment it was not funny this show does not deserve an average rating,NEGATIVE,Comedy

1276,10.0,13 October 2010,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is one of my favourite tv shows i have to admit that i hardly watched it at all when it first aired that maybe because i was still going to elementary school and high school then after that i began to watch the reruns and found it to be very appealing i was looking for some comedy and got plenty of it from friends i guess the big reason why i didnt want to watch the show at first was because its so popular the leads are famous too the series was very successful in the ratings consistently ranking in the top ten in the final primetime ratings the shows biggest appeal is the humor you can always count that each episode will have at least a decent amount of humor most episodes are just hilarious after i watched the entire first season i began to care about the characters the series revolves around a group of friends in the area of manhattan new york city who live together and share living expenses im not going to go into which of the six leads i like the most because i like them all they all get a chance to shine throughout the show however matthew perry and david schwimmer are definite standouts theyre good in their roles and are often very funny friends also has a memorable cast of supporting characters i especially liked monicas and rosss parents rachels father richard janice rachels sister amy mike hannigan and phoebes boyfriend david the series starts off strong in the first few seasons the main relationships form and theres a good bit of drama too the middle is probably my favourite part mostly because its the funniest and although the show does become a bit repetitive and goofy by the end i still found it to be very entertaining in all there were seasons with episodes the finale was watched by about million american viewers making it the fourth most watched series finale in tv history friends has made a large cultural impact and the central perk coffee house has inspired various imitations worldwide repeats of the series continue to air worldwide throughout its run the series won many awards and was nominated for primetime emmy awards one of the most important things that makes any story great is the characters and friends has six good ones by the end i liked the show so much that i didnt want it to end i now have the dvds so i can watch it anytime and often do rumours have surfaced of a film most of the lead actors expressed interest in starring in the film but for now the film is just a rumour because nothings final yet if you havent seen friends yet then dont hesitate to do so the series has almost universal appeal there are good reasons why it was so popular,POSITIVE,Comedy
1277,6.0,24 July 2010,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",greatest sitcom and just tv series in the universe pure and simple friends had the best cast the best writers and the best fans the cast is the greatest ever matthew perry courtney cox jennifer anniston lisa kudrow matt le blanc and david schwimmer could you ask for a better cast of course we cant forget about gunther the acting was always solid brilliant and hilarious over seasons of material shows and i cant find one bad performance from anyone in the main cast or the extras thats because friends was a quality show who did nothing half way they always gave the audience of them selfs and thats why friends is the greatest show on earth most of the time the comedy was smart and edgy often crude and immature everyone loved friends because there was something for everyone show about nothing just six friends hanging around going through life together slipping up making mistakes and finding their purpose the writers david crane and martha kauffman are my heroes for creating the greatest sitcom ever made and its going to be a long time until a sitcom is made who had as much effect on as many people like friends did and is still doing,POSITIVE,Comedy
1278,4.0,27 December 2005,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",im not going to waste my time or yours writing a plot summary to open my review of this series because everyone knows how it began and the convoluted paths it has taken within the group of characters is too hard to capture in a few sentences friends made millionaires of the cast each week saved channel from having to find something to fill about hours of air time each week and will continue to be sold in slightly different dvd box sets for decades to come for reasons i dont totally understand doesnt every fan have it now however i must admit that i dont like it and never really got what made it stand out from all the other undemanding american cute twentysomethings sitcoms that clutter the schedules the relationships are the key to holding the stories together and it bothered me that i was never really convinced by any of them the various romances come and go with about as much comic confusion as a whale could barely stomach while everyone cracks jokes and oneliners all the time many of these are quite funny but only by sitcom standards some television shows break moulds and explore new ground successfully or not whereas some shows are just very polished and professional genre machines friends is the latter and just because it does it well doesnt mean it is somehow a television event the undemanding predictability of the whole thing is probably one reason it was successful the way it gives people a warm sense of being part of a group of friends may have been another but for me one of the biggest reasons it work was just how straight an arrow it fired very safe very white very clean very warm very american the coffee shop is a fine example of what i mean despite living upstairs the friends all like to get together in this comfy welllit place drinking big cups of coffee and laughing together sometimes they have jobs sometimes they dont but if money troubles are experienced then they are temporary and comical the problems they experience in life are less about loss and pain brought about by their own character failings and more about leaving their laundry somewhere amusing etc of course it is a sitcom and you want all this stuff so like i said it is very clean very safe and so on personally i tend to prefer dramas when it comes to television just because i enjoy depth i enjoy complexity and i do not think for one minute that life is like friends for anybody although i can see why viewers clung to its ideal the cast are pretty and perform their undemanding stuff well enough to produce bland characters that hopefully all the viewers will like none of them are actually that good but they are good enough for the genre and the product aniston inspired a haircut but not me she is pretty if you are attracted to safe bland women which i suppose a lot of people are i always found cox prettier and more able to get a bit of personality into her role and she was better for it kudrow was just annoying and was normally on the edge of the group time and some well chosen projects has shown her to actually move past friends looking best schwimmers neurotic jew was never going to be original and it wasnt he works it well but his rather wet bland performance only works when aniston matches it perry i liked but only because his humour is closer to mine than the others of course his stuff does get annoying quickly and the fact that he seems unable to do anything else just adds to it leblanc suits sitcom world and at least has had the sense to just stay there although the idea that his dumb spinoff was ever going to be frasier is a bit rich dont get me wrong though overall this is a fine bit of american sitcom why it has done so well i dont really know but if i did id be copying it and chasing every dollar i could get personally the bland mix of inoffensive humour and unconvincing relationship drama just didnt appeal to me but it goes without saying that fans of the genre will love this and hey should probably buy yet another box set just to shut people like me up,POSITIVE,Comedy
1279,10.0,4 February 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends has the best comedys of all time ill be sad for this programme to end next year in because the whole team did such a fantastic effort to put everthing into this series it was such a great programme and i think it will always will be after seasons the programme comes to its end each character played by each members were so adorable and fun,POSITIVE,Comedy

1283,10.0,29 March 2008,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i have a severe problem with this show several actually a simple list will suffice for now ill go into more depth later on superficial characters a laughtrack and boring humour if you dont wish to look at the rest of this review and are only reading it so you can feel superior as if you see anything in this show i didnt to a frequently irked teen from canada ill summarize friends sucks not only because it is unfunny but because it destroyed the tv audiences for new good shows arrested development dexter etc friends is as much to blame for reality tv two and a half men and the king of queens as the television executives now then on with the review these characters have no soul they are exactly the same in every way outside of gender and hair colour they react the same way in boring situations and are completely secure in their own bodies where is the conflict and the humour that comes with it why isnt rachel storming out on monica after monica starts hanging out with rachels enemy why doesnt joey contemplate suicide because nobody seems to take him seriously oh right cause hes the dumb one and hes comfortable with that this is the curse of having perfect characters lasting conflict and god forbid personality becomes an impossibility the laughtrack is the one thing that should have died out right after it was born any show that has one is almost certainly the opposite of funny how can i make such a broad generalization when a show that claims to be comedy requires laughter from someone besides the audience it must mean that the audience would not laugh without it laughtracks destroy humour by preventing quick comebacks humour becomes a construct rather than a free flowing entity see the office arrested development this leads to my next point the humour is boring there is no way to make a perfect character anything more than slightly humorous without a laughtrack apparently simply because our everyday humour comes from recognition of our flaws so what if monica dated a year old she immediately recognizes that what she is doing isnt right and breaks up with him there has to be some sort of conflict rather than an immediate solution maybe her mother finds out or one of her friends tries to get rid of him and ends up seducing him that would be great it would be like a custody battle so now ive provided evidence for my position many of my friends love this show because they havent heard of curb your enthusiasm or arrested development many of my friends hate this show because they recently started watching curb your enthusiasm or arrested development i have watched very little of friends in my life but i have watched enough to spot huge flaws that make the show in my opinion completely unwatchable if youve read this far thank you and i hope you at least start watching some of the shows i have mentioned,NEGATIVE,Comedy

1293,10.0,11 November 2019,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",to me friends will always be a show about dishonest people one that would be completely without drama or intrigue if there wasnt always some sort of conspiracy or unnecessary lie keeping them from making any real progress and yet the constant sabotage keeps you interested waiting to find out what happens next this show and i have always wrestled with each other its not particularly well written or even well shot with all kinds of strange camera audiosync and editing errors that are frankly impressive for a show of this caliber i fall in love with the characters and then they totally violate my understanding of them its intriguing yet infuriating this show was groundbreaking and its beloved worldwide but i just cant quite get there i respect this show and i often enjoy it but the tugofwar is ongoing therefore good but only passing,NEGATIVE,Comedy
1294,10.0,25 June 2007,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i am stunned to discover the amount of fans this show has havent said that friends was at best an average sitcom and not as great as others have made out lets face it if it wasnt for the casting of courtney cox arquette david schwimmer matthew perry lisa kudrow jennifer aniston and matt le blanc then who knows whether this show wouldve lasted as long as it has done i very much doubt that although as the series progressed friends got more progressively predictable lame and boring that i couldnt care less about the characters of whom are the most overrated in tv history or of their plight nor of who was sleeping with whom and it went from being funny in the first four seasons to occasionally funny and even when it had all these alist hollywood actors from the movie world i still didnt bother to tune in the writing in friends became stale that i lost interest in this show from the sixth season onwards and as for the ending well it was predictable to say the least what was annoying though was that this lasted for ten seasons whilst some of my favourite shows lasted for only three four seasons for instance and were eventually cancelled and taken off the air for good the show shouldve came to an immediate halt by the time the cast wanted bigger salaries in truth as much as the series waned it was the show that was bigger than the actors themselves not the other way round when it ended in i was so relieved to see the back of this sitcom now there is talk of a friends reunion show coming to our tv screens very soon and yet i for one will not be looking forward to it whatsoever,NEGATIVE,Comedy
1295,10.0,18 February 2019,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",should you even be looking up a review d this show is my absolute favourite one which i watch every day a story of friends who in their early s are trying to make it on the outskirts of new york city all of these friends have different personality traits and even so they are the thickest of friends they have different family backgrounds and with their stash of insecurities they manage to live a life around it sometimes with the help of their friends they can be vulnerable and open with each other which makes them family they grow over the years with experience and the show has moments where some characters think in retrospect feeling fulfilled but at the same time new challenges erupt and they draw hope from seeing how far they have come i have listened to some people claiming how friends is just a bunch of losers who sit over at the coffee shop and whine about life but i disagree and say that its much more than that they do not always whine and complain they support and cheer on each other help each other with their shortcoming and fears they are genuinely happy when their friend is happy and sad when their friend is sad one would be lucky to have one good friend in this age and time all in all its a wonderful series and all the best when you reach the last episode in the past season its going to break your heart as you will have loved it very much,POSITIVE,Comedy
1296,7.0,27 July 2019,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",im writing this in july years after since friends had ended and i can say without any hesitation it is the greatest sitcom and tv show of all time up untill now the six characters made people around the world relate to them in a unique and emotional way that had never been done before theyre still loved and remembered and will always be like that years of comedy laughing and crying david crane and marta kaufman made a masterpiece im on my third time now watching the series and every time i go back and see it it makes me feel like its my first time i rate it and truly it deserves rami,POSITIVE,Comedy

1302,10.0,12 October 2003,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",im sorry but what is that man on about friends is not about whining twentysomethings if you actually take the time to look you can see that when they have no love life no job and have nowhere to go their friends will always be there for them i do have to say the program has gone down over the years because they ran out of things to say and they should have finished it sooner but friends has been and always will be a master piece i grew up watching friends learning from it and stealing the oneliners the point is this program is more than just a sucess full show its about finding good friends falling in love and never drifting apart simply uplifling funny and a damn good watch ps they should not be making a show just for joey that is the most stupid idea ive ever heard of,POSITIVE,Comedy
1303,10.0,1 June 2017,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",ive been reading a lot of these comments some people dont like the showclaiming it to be unrealistic or that the plot lines get boring i didnt discover friends until a year or two ago thanks to my friends but i adore the show in syndication and i hope to own the dvds its damn funny and no one can deny it except for stiffs and whats best about friends is that its real ross and rachel getting old how could it do relationships get old in real life no theyre ongoing sometimes stagnating sometimes changing thats real this show is about people who love each other like familywhich i must say as an year old is very real once you hit your late teens early twentiesthings begin to change you grow both closer to and further from your biological family and as you reach more independence you adopt another family of your own your friends we may not all sit in coffee shops but we all love our friends like they were blood thats what this show is about makes you all warm and fuzzy and sore from laughing inside and as a show friends will always be a part of my family,POSITIVE,Comedy
1304,9.0,27 September 2022,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",ive never been able to understand why the succes for this series these days this series is still rated on imdb thats some higher then a lot of classic comedyseries that do manage to provide some comedy from time to time for me this series mainly delivers lame jokes about relationships and sex and thats it really just mainly cringe and unfunny jokes and situations that are related to sex and relationships but it had huge succes in a way this series helped pave the way for garbage tv like big brother mtv series like jersey shore or even the fame and succes of kim kardashian the series fits in a trend where its all about superficial appearance but the actual quality of the content doesnt seem to matter anymore but it sells so all is good,NEGATIVE,Comedy
1305,10.0,5 May 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",now i personally dont see an exciting story to this show although i guarantee you that when watching this i felt as if i was at home you get this feeling as if you and the characters are family knowing their every move and thought living their lives with them sharing the happy and sad times relating to them experiencing a certain type of warmth many people desire and hardly find the warmth of friendship i advise you to watch it unless you got some work to do then dont because youll need all the free time you got,POSITIVE,Comedy
1306,6.0,27 July 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",no series has touched my heart like friends you easily feel connected to the characters because they just struggle with the same things we do but still have this beautiful and unique friendship everyone wishes to have a friendship like these people had the the whole crew did an amazing job no series will ever be better for me friends is not a just series its way more thank you for this safe place you created for me and many more people ive felt all possible emotions over this season journey but at the end im not sad because its over im smiling because it happened,POSITIVE,Comedy
1307,1.0,12 August 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",just finished it cant stop crying its so painful to say goodbye to this show i just freaking love these six guys i have finished almost tv show and i will say this is best one among them,POSITIVE,Comedy
1308,10.0,28 October 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i used to watch this show all the time and i thought it was great but then i started watching other sitcoms which i think are much better however i still enjoy friends and watch the occasional episode when there is nothing else to watch a good show which is still very popular today,POSITIVE,Comedy
1309,8.0,31 May 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",one of the best tv show of all time great cast and you will really laugh every time you watch it you can watch it over and over again the series soundtrack never gets old as a s kid this brings back great memories,POSITIVE,Comedy
1310,10.0,12 October 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",yrs on and my wife and i can still watch any episode at any time and always have a chuckle there isnt a bad episode this show defies time and never seems to age what is unique is that i often change who my favourite character is as they are all played so well but if i had to pick one it would be ross favourite scene is the one with the cheesecake with rachel and chandler unbelievable how the writers can make something so simple so funny,POSITIVE,Comedy
1311,10.0,12 July 2010,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",there surely can be no doubt that friends will go down in history as one of the best sitcoms ever sure it perhaps went on a little too long and the series gradually became more and more like a soap opera but it is important to remember why this show was such a hit and why people watch it again and again and laugh equally hard each time from the on and off again ross and rachel relationship to the buddy love of joey and chandler the stories flow effortlessly from episode one until episode two hundred and thirty six the cast are on top form through thick and thin and regardless of what they have done since or will do in the future they will always be remembered for friends,POSITIVE,Comedy
1312,10.0,13 August 2002,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",its an abysmal show ive never ever got the popularity of this especially outside of america in each of the last houses ive lived in over the last years at least one person in each house has been an avid friends fan so i am fully exposed to it and have seen many episodes its also on tele every day where do i start the title is as good a place as any i can imagine the producers discussing that right weve got a comedy about a group of friends we need a name how about friends if thats the imagination it doesnt leave much hope for the story lines i know its a lighthearted sit com but come on how old are they supposed to be they were too old for that sort of lifestyle in series here we are ten years later nothings changed theyre all approaching the big yet theyre still living the lives of year olds and how the hell do they afford those penthouses they change their jobs like i change my underpants monica worked in a kitchen joey cant get any acting work the rent would be thousands friends is nothing more than the equally benal tedious saved by the bell but for grownups its the old floggedtodeath three guys three girls all stunningly gorgeous occasionally fancy or sleep with each other with no friends whatsoever outside of their little group the only thing funny about about friends is unintentionally funny those parties they occasionally have in their flat penthouse the so called guests they invite who stand in the background desperately trying to fit in pass themselves off as close companions of the characters when its clear to the entire watching world that theyve met for the first time at the start of the shot its a combination of many little things that contribute to the problem its the most unrealistic portrayal of new york in history no black people chinese or anyone ethnic for that matter even with minor parts its new york one of the most multi cultural cities on the planet admittedly there is one funny aspect i have omitted chandler the guy is enormously talented makes the entire show and seems solely responsible for what laughs or comedy there is rachel monica are likable characters not annoying but nor are they funny but the past stories of either of them not being able to get a man come on please dont treat the viewer as a two year old joey is likable but is given no script to work with too many comedies think that by putting a thick character in they will automatically be amusing wrong trigger is only fools horses was thick but funny with it because of the timing hes comments were made at exactly the right time joeys are not unfortunately for a good actor potentially very good character he comes over more as irritating than anything else but the real problem with friends are in ross phoebe the only applicable description of ross is that he needs a good kick up the backside to put some oomf into the bloke hes a drip he just drones on on in that slow dull manner series after series in any real life situation a ross a rachel would just not be a couple a rachel a brad pitt would be a couple somewhat appropriately but even he cant beat phoebe for irritation its not the actress at all thats the problem its the character i just dont get her the floor manager must hold up the laugh now board for the audience after every line she says for the life of me i just dont know what she says that is funny and in the equally irritating coffee lounge why are the sofas always empty never once have they had to sit somewhere else or wait for some other people to move those scenes where she plays her guitar ive been to funerals funnier than them all she does is sing in coherent songs that dont rhyme or make any sense whatsoever anyone could write a sketch like that i also cannot sit through any show where people walk into other people houses without knocking on the door noone i know would put up with that even from their grandparents nor people who say hey instead of hello but thats getting as tedious as the show now,NEGATIVE,Comedy
1313,10.0,20 May 2008,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is about friends who live in new york and have to solve all of lifes problems to sex to relationships to well basically thats what its all about the idea contains the same old friendships relationship babies love marriage job and materialism nothing to contribute to society never once i see the characters face real problems of debt psychological torture or identity crisis like chandler experiencing what being gay feels like for a day or rachel hanging with the poor or even phoebe living in an asylum and about the racial cultures usually i never see them date anyone else other than a few colors to liven the space oh the token black person that comes out one or two episodes is not helping either seeing as new york is full of culture they made it look like the other races are not important their lifestyle is perfect they crapped money out of their really lowpaying jobs and spend most of their time well sipping their coffee stalking about that hot guy or girl and plans to bang them later to the episode ending with a breakup for the dumbest of reasons aside from chandler their jobs are almost impossible to ask why their apartments costs more than what they earn well monica has rent control but hey no one tried to kick her out yet ross is still controlling his money after all the divorces he has been in joey rachel and phoebe gave a speech on not taking charity but hey they suck the living breeches of the first three and claiming paying them back was almost impossible okay off with the plots lets go to the characters character analysis chandler he is apparently one of the more humorous characters he is a sample of a realistic person who we can hang out in the office or sip some coffee or something i dont have problems with him and monica together to the dismay of all the trueblue frendsian fans phoebe i like her for being a bit different in the first few seasons but then after a while she started being horny annoying and kind of a hypocrite okay so she has a hard life but people like her in real life struggle to be as normal as possible she just left that philosophy behind because of it its not even trying until the tenth season or so monica she isnt a funny character but she has been a person who actually is believable in ways that she is right and she is apparently the mature one sadly she is usually looked down upon because her other friends think that her style is annoying sadly her babyfreak i can be like anyone else philosophy threw me off after like season one i always wondered why she wasnt kicked out of the circle rachel i hate her she hasnt changed ever since day one to be honest her personality is this mememe spoiled brat who went to the city and a few jobs and a million boyfriends later its still all about me the relationship with her and ross was somewhat annoying for and a mood killer for almost forever and almost in the last episode of the series bang theyre together again can ross just leave or slap rachel for all the horrible things she has done to him oh noooo because ross is too in loooove with rachel reasons were almost to no idea having sexual thoughts with chandler and almost having a short useless hitoff with joey was also not helping ross i pitied his first season philosophy and hey i liked him for being at least sympathetic there just that he had two additional divorces that he became a screaming yelling irritating person who is smart and intelligent yet acts dumb and immature for his age the whole rachel thing is lost of chemistry and yeah they were on a break rachel is apparently responsible for all of the things that happened to them and then claiming after the whole fiasco that the writers make it say that its ross fault anyway for rachels doing ross would be better off on a suicide for being with a devil woman joey dumb actor who doesnt do anything to contribute to society oh yeah his spin off may be the worst thing anyone has ever made even if i can feel things from the characters he is a handsome guy thats a contribution right and him having sex with girls is considered a real good thing in general actors have to research their roles and joey he just swoops in shakespeare because hey hes an actor to conclude i have been annoyed by the show and i get why people love it so much its the art of escapism of them in a fantasy world that makes everyone love them so but sadly i have watched shows that actually make use of real life as a humor tool that makes friends forgettable for me for ten years nothing truly ever happened and parodies like furends are apparently more of a short version of the whole rant a out of ten just because i cant give negative number rankings,NEGATIVE,Comedy

1325,10.0,27 April 2003,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is a fantastic way to get away from it all for a bit there are times when you dont like one character for something heshe has done or the way the writers chose to go with the ongoing story but the friends cast of characters are always close to your heart there hasnt been a cast so large that compliments each other so well in the history of tv serials if by some strange act of god you havent viewed a few friends shows do so youll want to see them all the show is addictive you see the characters go thru many things in theirs lives that can be sad but you also see that they do survive it with the help of their friends,POSITIVE,Comedy
1326,10.0,10 May 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",the one major reason for me to give friends a solid is that there has never been a series which i can watch over and over again and laugh my ass off every time i watch it its a series that never bores so well written and utterly funny it lifts me up when i am down ive watched when it aired and maybe times since then or more,POSITIVE,Comedy
1327,10.0,17 May 2010,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is one of those television shows that you just cant define and not because its so great and original that words dont exist to capture it but rather because its so ordinary and it succeeded twentysomething friends trying to navigate life jobs and romance sure doesnt sound original and its not its not groundbreaking in any way except for the fact that it basically united and defined a generation for almost no explicable reason almost every single person who grew up with the friends can now relate every daily occurrence in their lives to an episode of the show the show wasnt even that realistic but all of the actors added a warmth and accessibility to each of their characters that we hung on to every word found comfort in their flaws and craved that they found what they wanted the characters werent even that well written in every episode you can find a contradiction to something they said or did in an earlier episode and sure that will bother you for awhile but then the next week the friends made you fall in love with them again because the actors had that gift of connecting you to them theres a good chance that a new show like friends will not be able to find the same success so i say to the new twenty yearolds out there to start watching friends because it just may capture your generation the way it did mine,POSITIVE,Comedy

1353,1.0,24 December 2003,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i invite you to sit down in front of your television set when your station goes on the airand keep your eyes glued to that set until the station signs off i can assure uou that you will observe a great wasteland newton n minow chairman of the federal communications commission speech before the national association of broadcasters washington dc may we were warned friends may be the worst thing ive ever seen on televsion and ive been sitting in front of the tube observing the great wasteland since obviously there are those who love the show because it was a hit for a decade its happened before there are wildly successful and formulaic tv series that just dont seemed to die despite their lack of merit murder she wrote charlies angels providence friends simply does not stack up well to other contemporary series it lacks the smartness of seinfeld and the wonderful selfridicule of pomposity that is the hallmark of frasier the characters in friends seem designed to make them repellant dullards this incestuous group of neighbors makes my flesh crawl the unintelligent show is completely without an edge of any sort the characters are caricatures of caricatures and the writing is sophomoric though intentionally so it might be interesting to observe a writing session since the writers may have to slave to aim lower than their capabilities so as not to confuse the loyal friends of friends this shallow unfunny tedious predictable moneymaker seems to be designed for a certain demographic slice which might be those folks born around if this seems to be a backhanded whack at the x generation that finds itself equally mesmerized by computer games im sorry however if the shoe fits the entertainment industry is smart and delicately finetuned to the acquisition of a dollar which is why producers live and die by weekly ratings they will craftily provide specific segments of the public precisely what they want the industry understood that this banal gruel would fare well and it has the only defense for this series i believe is that its calculated to be bad by providing a mirror to people who are as lacking in depth and humor as the characters in friends water like people seeks its own level thank goodness even the actors are now tired of performing in this repulsive show if upon the demise of the series the time slot were filled with a cooking show it would nonetheless be a great improvement,NEGATIVE,Comedy
1354,10.0,30 August 2023,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this was a fun and goof series to watch although i was not a fan some particular parts those parts could have been created better viewers and fans of this series learn so much from watching this series this whole series reveals the true nature what really happens in the lives of everyone there was a great cast selection throughout the whole series i saw that the crew put too much effort when it came to the characteristics and personalities of some characters the crew could have improved on that viewers and fans of this series would have learned many things to live life by watching this series there was room of improvement to make this series better,POSITIVE,Comedy
1355,10.0,17 June 2023,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",the show is just extremely overrated and they overuse the laugh track you can get past the fact that its a total unrealistic premise of living in new york in these huge apartments and having very little to no work but the show in itself is just not funny the jokes rarely land theres or episodes in the entire series that are pretty funny outside of that its very bland the jokes are jokes your grandmother would tell add a church function i dont think this was funny really past it should have been seasons and done how they went this long is beyond me and i dont think they will hold up over the next years,NEGATIVE,Comedy

1364,10.0,27 November 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",compitative surroundings and rush towards financial stability leaves a major portion of teen and twenty population unoccupied with general gestures or events of friends and friendship in order to fulfill those acts into their own lives this series remains outstanding the documentaion is not so uniform this being a television series directors made up the plot as and when required some of the plots and scenes are thick and unique but rest are just simple jokes rather bloopers are quiet funny values gained with respect to time spent in watching the series is not a better ratio to sum up atleast a season worth of time could be reduced altogether rest assured the characters are unique in every material aspects and story is good enough being entertainment purpose,NEGATIVE,Comedy

1372,10.0,16 September 2018,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i watched friends for the st time back in didnt found it that interesting but that was probably because i couldnt relate to the topics of each episodes but along the way i started to watch it more and more and almost years later i still do thats why i rated it a the reason why it was one of the most succesful sitcom in its genre and is still being broadcasted in countries around the world is that everybody can relate to it one way or the other the topics of each episodes is all about life during your s and s boyfriendsgirlfriends career family issues money bills ups downs it is all being discussed in friends and whether you watched it years ago or you just started to watch it the topics will always be relevant no matter what,POSITIVE,Comedy
1373,10.0,20 November 2002,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends seems to be one of those movies and shows that just divide people in two those who love it and those who hate it i for one love it i have no problem with people who do not like the show as there are many popular things i do not like opinions are a funny thing however i do not like people screaming that friends is stupid and for stupid people and other outright idiotic statements such as that compared to many many blockbuster comedies or other sitcoms also listed by those who dislike friends the humor in friends can be even somewhat brilliant and while certainly there are badidiotic jokes in the show tell me one show or comedy that doesnt have them in addition i just have to mention that in my opinion matthew perry is far above all other actors in this series his way of acting and his great ability to be sarcastic in an extremely funny way make him a character who rarely leaves me without good laughs out of stars on my sitcom scale,POSITIVE,Comedy
1374,10.0,30 December 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",when friends started ross and rachel was the couple you rooted for but as the seasons went by they became the two most insufferable people you want to be friends with rachel is a self absorbed bitch who thinks the world revolves around her as for ross he is the most whining manipulative nerd you would have the displeasure to meet chandler monica phoebe and joey are great but they are saddled with those two from hell,NEGATIVE,Comedy
1375,10.0,5 August 2010,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",to me friends is the most overrated show the humor is weak and unintelligent and the characters try too hard to be funny and act like everything is lala land other than these major flaws the show is just missing something else that many other comedys have and i think its the lack of a good or serious plot along with humor other shows like weeds and the united states of tara are comical but also have a strong plot and theme i think the comedy in those shows makes it light in some ways and watchable but also these shows are brilliant by highlighting individual people and societys problems even shows like arrested development and grounded for life apply more to the good comedy but strong plot and theme and if the writer or directors goal was not to have a dramatic plot then they should have some warm meaning to the show for example full house the nanny and golden girls had a lot of the humor but gave great messages the importance of family support in full house how true friends will always help you in golden girls and how a fulltime care take for children can really help a family and bring out the best in children whose parents are absent such as the nanny i think friends tries too much to be like a seinfeld for teens and young adults however seinfeld has much better writing and humor every time i watched this show it always ended up boring me i really dont understand why people like this show so much where there is so much better comedy television out there,NEGATIVE,Comedy

1384,10.0,14 June 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",but is it worth a watch yes presuming that laugh tracks dont suffocate you i watched this show in and enjoyed it i have since tried rewatching the show several times only to find the laugh tracks so undeniably annoying that i cant stand more than a few minutes however some credit has to be given to matthew perry for playing the most iconic character chandler the only reason friends gets a seven star for me is because of chandlerhis dialogue delivery and his romantic endeavors especially kathy monica contrary to popular belief aniston was not the star of the show she wasin my opinionthe least talented of the lot id recommend the show to someone who is just moving on from disney shows to adult sitcom similar shows that s show,POSITIVE,Comedy
1385,10.0,10 March 2008,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",having caught the odd episode ive always considered this unwatchable drivel and avoided it however a friend whos opinion i trust recently told me that the early seasons were much better and since series was available free on demand i decided to give it a go i managed episode one and will never watch this again there was absolutely nothing funny or even vaguely amusing and the laughter track just added to my irritation the characters are stupid petty and vindictive in one scene one of the women destroys a watch belonging to a man who persuaded her to sleep with him by telling her he hadnt been able to make love since his last relationship ended some years before i fail to see the humour so many people seem to love this i just wish i could understand why,NEGATIVE,Comedy

1412,10.0,27 June 2005,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i dont care what anyone says friends is without a doubt the best sitcom the world has ever seen i meancome on a wisecracking sarcastic transpontransponster turned advertising agenta neurotic completely overthetop chefa formerly spoilt now downtoearth hilarious fashion experta daft but funny largely unsuccessful actora crazy weird kooky massage therapista paleontologist so geeky that hes gone full circle into sweet and adorablewhat more can u want over ten yes say it with me ten years the writers and the actors of this show have wowed us all with their sharp oneliners their gestures and facial expressions that only they can pull off simply their amazing talent i dont know where they got these guys from but this is the best ensemble i have ever seen you know usually when you watch a show its like theres always at least one character you cant stand and you wonder why theyre even there with friends you cant help but love every single character you cant take any of these actorscharacters outthe piece would be incomplete and what about their voices and facial expressions i meanwho comes up with this stuff you cant watch friends without laughing out loud often for hours on end there are so many sitcoms i watch that im lucky if i barely crack a smile but friends is a guaranteed laugh every single time the lines they deliver and wow do they deliver are lines i will forever remember and not just because im a complete friends freak i mean i can identify guest stars and extras in the background name particular episodes recite all the lines but because these people are just brilliant simply brilliant i say bring back friends or at least let us know whats going with the characters or something bring some back in joeymaybe that will help the show a biti love friends,POSITIVE,Comedy
1413,9.0,22 June 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",the series got better and better as the time went by but ross was a very annoying and childish character last seasons were better and funnier with better jokes too many stereotypical jokes and characters but overall a very funny series a decent popular classic comedy although i prefer seinfeld more,POSITIVE,Comedy
1414,10.0,30 December 2006,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this is the worst show buntch of grown up acting like kids no humor nothing even sesame street has better humor and more adult than friends friends may be the worst thing ive ever seen on television and ive been sitting in front of the tube observing friends simply does not stack up well to other contemporary series it lacks the smartness of seinfeld and the wonderful selfridicule of pomposity that is the hallmark of frasier the characters in friends seem designed to make them repellant dullards this incestuous group of neighbors makes my flesh crawl the unintelligent show is completely without an edge of any sort the characters are caricatures of caricatures and the writing is sophomoric though intentionally so it might be interesting to observe a writing session since the writers may have to slave to aim lower than their capabilities so as not to confuse the loyal friends of friends,NEGATIVE,Comedy
1415,7.0,1 February 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is the the best show i have seen so far when it comes to comedy there are many these days but no one has any comparison to this show ive watched all seasons times,POSITIVE,Comedy

1420,10.0,28 November 2019,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",my mom liked this show when i grew up in the s and so i never cared to watch it but now being in my mid s i finally did just to see if it held up to the hype and its actually really funny i see few low ratings on here by people who either dont have a sense of humor or just dont like sitcoms so if you actually have a sense of humor then id recommend this show if youre a dull person who doesnt get comedy and probably gets mad at comedians for offense jokes even though theyre jokes and youre just a big pos hypocrite because you only get upset when it offends you then yea dont recommend,POSITIVE,Comedy

1423,9.0,5 February 2000,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i think this is one of the most overrated series on tv the storylines are just silliness for the most part and the actors annoy me i am so tired of hearing about how great it is i just do not get it at all maybe you have to be,NEGATIVE,Comedy
1424,10.0,21 May 2006,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",lets be blunt friends is hardly the most challenging comedy out there or the most enthralling drama the thing it has got going for it however is its ability to draw people in its essentially comfort tv watching it doesnt require any effort at all you just sit back and enjoy with the best comedies the office for example theres the idea that you have to work a little to get some of the jokes you have to be able to extract the joke for the full effect with friends they simply present it to you and you simply take it in no thought or effort required its easy to relate to on some levels but sometimes their problems are simply comedy situations rather than ones you would come across in life the wit isnt groundbreaking but is reliable to keep you going without annoying you while its neither the ideal comedy or ideal drama it is a perfect example of comfort tv if you want to be challenged by your tv then go elsewhere otherwise just settle in switch off and enjoy,POSITIVE,Comedy
1425,7.0,23 May 2007,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",no really i dont get it why people love friends its one of the most childish show i ve ever had the mischance to watch it i lied here i watch it because i wanted to i want to see what others found funny first of all the annoying laughter in the background every time an actor says a line is just stupid and annoyingin every line and spoils everything even if it were an actual clever line that means they point out the funny part so the viewer knows where is the joke and laugh like a programmed robot it is moronic to laugh when someone hint the funny part think about it secondly every character behave like a little child i cant see any adult behavior here have you ever see a woman with a decent amount of iq in her head to try catch the flu because they told her that she sing better with a gruff voice and not just that the director loved that part and decided to repeat it scene after scene stupid exaggerated pointless jokes every two seconds by people who cant really act and make childish comments and grimaces all the time maybe people like it because its cool to memorize the funny i wince every time i write that word here phrases but if they repeat it few times in their head and actual think what they are saying they could easily understand thats just plain moronic but the laughter in the background make them laugh like idiots because they told to do so i will never understand it and i dont want to,NEGATIVE,Comedy
1426,1.0,21 October 2018,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is just so easy to enjoy definitely the comedy of this era likeable characters easy to understand stories silly yet intelligent comedy itll be hard to top,POSITIVE,Comedy

1435,6.0,24 September 2007,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",how do i hate friends let me count the ways firstly it rated an f with the test audience dont believe me check the smoking gun secondly it ran years without being remotely funny once beating the record held by the completely laughfree year run of full house which like this crap was produced by a division of the time warner media empire had three males and three females in a completely unrealistic version of a major american city blandlooking guy of mediterranean descent trying to get into show business and a dumb guy named joey third that horrible theme makes nsync sound like the beatles fourth the cast couldnt act its way out of a paper bag i thank one of the other posters for pointing out that jennifer im not a star i just sleep with them aniston is telly savalass goddaughter her father is also on days of our lives can you say nepotism boys and girls fifth the writers would eat up clichés like that last one i wrote as if they were brand new and not only did they steal from the superiorbydefault seinfeld they stole from mr bean and even punky brewster when soleil moon frye who really must have needed the money by that point punched chandler in the face even that felt like a retread of a punky episode where she punched chad allen in the face sixth how can they afford an apartment like that in new york they hold menial jobs yet they look like they could be living at southfork on other superior actually funny roommate shows like the odd couple threes company kate allie and the grand dame of them all the golden girls they seem to look they are either living with their means or cutting back to afford to pay rent ive seen fewer logical leaps on gilligans island whats worse is all the emmies it got truly great shows like bob newharts two classic sitcoms never won a single thing yet this wins best comedy series this show and seinfeld not a terrible show but an extremely overrated one as well are the reason sitcoms are dead right now and will probably remain dead the last time sitcoms were declared dead in the early s was a golden age in comparison to today as long as there continue to be reruns and dvd releases of classic pres sitcoms such as i love lucy the dick van dyke show bewitched the mary tyler moore show all in the family the jeffersons soap cheers family ties newhart the cosby show the golden girls married with children roseanne pre simpsons and countless others like it then i say let it die this is truly the most vile trite unfunny obnoxious television series of all time i jumped for joy the day it was canceled and i hope that future generations will see it for the garbage it truly is because this one has been taken in by the snow job perpetrated by these hacks,NEGATIVE,Comedy

1443,10.0,2 April 1999,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is definitely my favourite tv show together with that s show it is about the lives of childish grownups that are very funny my favourite character is joey because he is the funniest and stupidest one what i dont like about these season is that ross is whining all the time because he got divorced again these leads to the first season when he finds out that his wife was a lesbian friends is the show with the best cast ever they are all professional actors that weve all seen in many successful movies i heard the rumor that rachel jennifer anniston might quit friends next season and i hope she doesnt because they wouldnt have a show without her the thing is that rachel might quit because she wants to spend more time with brad pitt supposedly friends takes a lot of her time hey get real brad pitt will be also very busy doing about a million movies if she quits they should hire mira sorvino because they look alike anyway i hope this show lasts for a long long time,POSITIVE,Comedy
1444,6.0,22 August 2015,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is a funny and witty sitcom with some intelligent humour and a couple well written plot sequences unfortunately the show is bogged down by one of the most irritating characters in any show in recent memory rachel played by jennifer aniston is constantly whining and complaining about the smallest of things im aware her character is meant to be spoiled but there is a point where it ceases to be funny and is purely frustrating but other characters are flawed as well phoebe is forgettable and rosss illogical eagerness to simply put up with all of rachels whininess is foolish chandler is easily the most deep and funny character although his depth is still nothing significant compared to other more modern sitcoms like how i met your mother in the end friends is a very funny show that stays consistently amusing throughout its episodes but falls short of greatness,NEGATIVE,Comedy
1445,2.0,1 April 2018,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i have seen like episodes through reruns and i do watch these only if they happen to come on just to try to figure out how the pilot of this show was ever picked up how it ever became the most popular show or how it is still my sisters favorite it is the the same phenomenon that propels the series twilight first and foremost friends should be listed as fantasy and nothing else no comedy or romance in the description for any reason it attempts to portray what being like a grown up is to young girls which according to friends is a clumsy and unsure of themselves girl that has no career or any set goals and will decide when she is ready and who cares in which women from eat it up like candy the series is set in manhattan well a sound stage in la because they are only ever shown in rooms on the set the apartments shown if they were in greenwich village we would have to add up all the income of each of them without a single expense and even that would not pay monicas rent each month you cant live in lower manhattan just starting out even with a roommate unless you have a real career or a trust fund cashiering at central perk she would have to live with her parents and take the train from jersey it is not even trying to be believable but yet the demographic believes it with phoebe she has no job randomly plays a guitar in a coffee shop and yet has her own apartment in the same building which is ridiculous all the men in this are beyond emasculated they basically all just play like a big dumb confused dope all the time which the demographic loves men do not really act like this men dont act like they are wrong all the time and that they are that unsure of themselves they do not approach any dating situation like a year old boy would gee i wonder if i can even kiss her will i get lucky and finally make it to first base today please stop grown men do not act like this there is nothing realistic amount any of this essentially all roles are written based on a female perspective and essentially all characters are females they have decided to include the term boobies or something else silly from time to time and did instill of a man into each of the male characters or it would be like watching straight girls and lesbians men do not act like this do boys act like this yes but not men everyone in this show is white if anyone has been to greenwich village while whiter than many places in nyc everything is very mixed there in a real coffee shop a white would be a minority every moment of the day seinfeld gets criticized because it is a show about nothing has the same issue everyone is white making it look like it should be set in a suburb of minneapolis and not anywhere near manhattan but seinfeld is really funny i have never ever laughed at a single thing in friends and i love comedies i am surprised they have not capitalized on making another show like this again because it is golden as far as ratings the female demographic will watch it and think that real life actually works likes this the only thing is i would hate is to be the one when they grow up that tells them the actual real truth,POSITIVE,Comedy
1446,10.0,1 September 2018,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",probably the best sitcom i have watched so far each and every character has a special role to play in the story line the chemistry between the cast is great most importantly i still find it funny years after it has aired,POSITIVE,Comedy

1452,10.0,2 July 2024,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i started watching friends while i was a university student after a hard day id reward myself with a few episodes each night the characters became my friends and helped me through tough times ive rewatched it at various points in my life such as after surgery or during covid the show provided comfort and laughter and at different times i could relate to different characters i love it so much friends is a mustwatch series that everyone should have on their list before i started watching the show i thought the background laughter would be annoying but when i watched it i forgot about the sound i initially watched friends to help improve my english but now i love it and want to rewatch it again and again i love chandlers character because i understand him the friendship between joey and chandler is the most beautiful thing in the show,POSITIVE,Comedy
1453,10.0,16 September 2018,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i never do reviews never but i feel like i should review this awesome show i started watching it for the first time not a while ago as im i havent watched it before i must say it impressed me as i was expecting something different even though it first aired over years ago it is still a really modern show if you love comedies this is for you this is the best series ive ever seen in my life great story great actors great romances extremely funny more,POSITIVE,Comedy

1455,1.0,30 July 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i have been watching this show again for the third time because of the constant reruns and to better see the details back then when i was in my earliest s i didnt pay attention to everything because the first time you watch something you are focused mainly on the plot has anyone noticed that theres never music in the background in the central perk is there a bar in real life that doesnt play music i wished the bar bellow my flat is like central perk that way i could have my peace central perk only had occasional live performances mostly by untalented phoebe also the characters are walking and rolling and sitting in their shoes all over the places whether it is a couch in central perk sofas and beds in their apartments etc in movies we see americans do that by default obviously but in friends it is more than ever i think they even sleep in their shoes phoebe gets annoying with all her awkward gesticulation rachel with clapping the spoil girl behaviour actually that is all the real aniston and chandler isnt actually funny the black actress that played charlie in season and was such a bad choice both fiscally and in acting that ruined imo the two seasons,NEGATIVE,Comedy
1456,10.0,7 August 2004,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",well where do i start this television series wont call it comedy is the sorriest pile of rubbish i have ever seen the funniest thing about this series is that it somehow is called a comedy i can never see anything funny about it at all the jokes are like those cheap ones you get out of christmas crackers i dont know if its the american humour but i know there are other american comedies out there that are a lot better than friends theyve taken a perfectly good song and ruined that too when it plays up on the radio i feel physically sick the acting is soooo cheap and tacky the attempted jokes are basic and flat i think the writers need a good lesson in comedy heres a good list only fools horses fawlty towers keeping up appearances the office alan partirdge and the list goes on i think friends is as enjoyable as having acid thrown into your face or maybe being strapped to a firework and sent miles up into the sky,NEGATIVE,Comedy

1467,10.0,17 September 2019,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this was one interesting show essentially it defined comedy for the millenial generation three men three women typical of young people as they like to see themselves decide to room together in new york city rents being what they are the women were lisa kudrow jennifer anistonand courtney cox the guys are david schwimmer matthew perry and matt leblanc with six characters from different backgrounds there was a chance to bring in girlfriends boyfriends relations of all kinds in a whole range of plot situations for episodes one of the reasons the show clicked the bigger reasons was however the chemistry between the six you can never tell you just hope you make the right casting and the audience likes the ensemble thats sheer luck at times i know my nieces of the younger generation really dug this show as they entered their teen years i kind of liked it myself,POSITIVE,Comedy

1471,10.0,11 January 2006,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i cant believe that it isnt commonly recognized that this show is a ripoff of living singlewhich also followed the lives and loves of six urban twentysomethings oh they were black so it must not count friends is a terribly written show yet somehow managed to be funny on occasion w very likable characters a tribute to the acting abilities of the castbecause the writers were terrible and got worse every year i wouldnt waste much time w friends the predictable gags just arent worth it cheers seinfeld and its like you know are far funnier heck love american style was funnier,NEGATIVE,Comedy
1472,9.0,27 April 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends has some undoubtedly funny moments and was well cast the guest appearances were fun and the storylines mostly worked i found ross to be an unbearably annoying character not very funny and whiny monica and phoebe were hilarious and loved their characters,POSITIVE,Comedy
1473,10.0,6 January 2015,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",perhaps if you find shows like everybody loves raymond and two and a half men amusing you may want to add this dribble to your watchlist on the other hand if arrested development and seinfeld rock and similar shows tickle your funny bone stay far away from friends it is truly a thoughtless bore unfortunately i was subjected to his show through a particularly hot girlfriend and i can honestly say that in the episodes i waded through i only laughed once i cant remember the instance but it was something physical that joey did the girlfriend although smitten with the show rarely laughed more than once an episode i gather it was more of a fairy tale that she could escape into than the comedy that drew her in popular rarely means good see mcdonalds,NEGATIVE,Comedy
1474,10.0,15 June 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is a sitcom created by david crane and marta kauffman that ran from to and stars jennifer aniston courteney cox lisa kudrow matt leblanc matthew perry and david schwimmer as it almost has become some sort of tradition in the recent years i always begin the new year with some long running tv show that is supposed to be the highlight of the year while it has been buffy in and breaking bad in i decided to make this new york city based sitcom the highlight of this year to be honest i didnt know what to expect because it is one of those iconic shows that apparently everyone has watched and liked but i feared that i could belong to the minority of people that actually dislikes what everyone else praises fortunately i dont belong to those few people from the first episode on i fell in love with the show especially with all the characters and the overall premise and the humour as a teenager i grew up with himym and thought it was the non plus ultra but it turns out that it is this show that deserves this title actually several plot lines were blatantly copied from friends you know you found a show for you when you feel comfortable every time you watch an episode and can shut off the brain just for once yes this show definitely felt like home to me and made the last few months something special what i admire about it is how the six lead characters are equally weighted and equally important to the story each and everyone have a masterfully elaborated personality what makes them all so tremendously likable while i find some of my own character traits in each of them my favourite character has got to be chandler bing calling him my favourite character feels like an understatement he has become my spirit animal with his awkwardness and psychological issues but also the others had something to them that made me love them so much the adventures they experienced together were all uniquely funny and hilarious and there were only a few episodes and storylines that i disliked flashback episodes and the relationship of joey and rachel to name a few but there was never an episode that didnt make me laugh at least once it also worth to mention that the quality of the seasons never decreased immensely and were always highly entertaining even if i think that the earlier seasons are better than the last if there is one thing i cannot tell what my favourite episode is there were so many great and outstanding i just cant decide all in all this show has brought me a lot of joy in the last few months it made me laugh it made me cry and filled me with joy and made me feel like home they have been there for me when the rain started to pour and made so many rainy days feel like sunshine after finishing the last episode i felt empty and only good shows make feel this in other words thank you rachel monica phoebe joey chandler and ross for being there for me cant even express enough how much this show means to me central perk became a second home and this is all i can probably say iconic and brilliant,POSITIVE,Comedy
1475,10.0,7 November 2022,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",an amazing array of friends populated the most popular sitcom of its day and the reruns remind me of mash and cheers theyre on all the time so quickly the audience was invested in these characters and how these characters came to life the reunion show gave us light into how the cast was formed and as so often with great shows and characters we simply cannot imagine anyone else playing the roles of the lead characters while many of the plots and character development was predictable it did not take away from the sheer joy of how these characters came together from their insecure beginnings to their ultimate growth and maturity well let me not exaggerate here by implying maturity came upon all the characters lest we forget their consistent innocence while coming to the point where they find themselves as true adults embarking on real adult lives all in all youll laugh youll certainly get teary eyed but youll find yourself attached along the way to chandler joey ross monica phoebe and rachel,POSITIVE,Comedy

1482,10.0,13 December 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",where do i even begin one of the very worst highprofile tv sitcoms which is saying a lot why do you really need to ask if you do then you wont understand anything below so who am i explaining this to only to the converted who else a cheap ripoff in many ways of seinfeld which is ironically one of the best sitcoms of all time an awful cast out of which only leblanc is a decent actor more about the toxic six later whenever the writers ran out of gags ie ideas which was very often theyd throw in some rather ridiculous schmaltz into the proceedings just to fill up space to make things even more appealing to housewives and teenyboppers there is nothing dumber than having any kind of sentimentality in a sitcom that should be a big nono rule no in sitcoms should be keep things funny always or quasifunny as the case may be with fiends you keep hearing that idiotic laughtrack and then out of the blue were supposed to be touched by something or someone and the whole thing actually gets weepy not to mention how utterly impossible it is to take any of these onedimensional cardboard cutouts even remotely seriously given how bad the acting is and how overly cute the ultracorny humour is the series often went for cheap read easy gags such as having cute animals be part of the plot if you think animals are cute and funny and they are watch a random catonthepiano clip on youtube and you are guaranteed to find it times funnier than this drivel what an annoying title song typical mainstream american pop rubbish from the s horrendous tune that could be used as a laxative if only songs could be packaged as anoospills the humour which is always predictable and formulaic is cheap cringingly unfunny and ultraclichéd it was awful to see the guest stars even the good actors embarrass themselves in the typically frendsianfiendishian dumb situations as bad as the writing is its the casting however that is the biggest reason why this hunka junk is so garbagebinny the main culprits are by far the totally talentfree and very plainlooking jennifer aniston and the worst clownactor of all time david schwimmer who btw had some extensive corrective surgery before getting his undeserved free card to fame check out the preinfamy photos its a hoot as much as half of the six fiends are nepotists kids who needed generous help from their parents to get their lousy careers going otherwise whod hire them nobody out of fiends are purebred nepotists quite high even for generally very low showbiz standards therein lies the key reason why this badly conceived sitcom was destined to be trash hardly anyone has charisma and the acting is just as poor schwimmer is the son of a very powerful hollywood lawyer his mother has had famous actors directors and producers as her clients so obviously when david cried out mommy i wanna be a famous and rich movie star he got his wish just like all the other schwimmers of this world peter fonda david arquette drew barrymore christian slater and and and i have an extensive list of them schwimmer is incredibly unfunny highcringe level unfunny facepalm changethechanneloratleastmutethevolume unfunny even will farrell doing millennial humour in an awful ben stiller flick is like monty python compared to him i consider swimmer the worst comedian of the last years even more pathetic than jason schwartzman a coppolaclan nepotist jennifer anistons godfather is none other than telly savalas a star actor from the ss her father is a producer she cant act she is wooden her face never changes in that sense she is worse than david mccallum who is also a nepotist hence its no wonder she is about as funny as will farrells wigs she has zero charisma and the laughable hype perpetrated by the sycophantic lying hollywood press that shes one of the most beautiful women in the world is the kind of bad joke that will stay legendary for many decades well after this cheesy sitcom is longforgotten because that is real humour one of the greatest jokes of recent years were it not for her connections shed probably be working in mcdonalds matthew perry also skipped various casting couches through some very strong family connections his story that he was a tennis coach who accidentally made it into films is utter baloney gwyn paltrow for example invented a facepalm story about being a struggling waitress working at an airport when in fact both her parents are verywell connected successful hollywood types in hollywood biographies have been routinely manufactured from the very beginning of cinema to be fair though perry is nowhere nearly as bad as aniston or schwimmer but thats like saying that tito wasnt nearly as savage a dictator as stalin that he slayedimprisoned far less people at least he tries hard perry i mean not stalin perry tries hard to make up for the total lack of natural comedic ability which cannot be said of aniston for example who should be in the wood industry she makes zero effort to do anything she cant even grimace a bit she is like a lowtier robot hired to do standup the fact that jenny later made a career out of romantic comedies speaks volumes about how bad she is and just how low hollywoods criteria had sunk still its not as though perry is better than mediocre i am merely pointing out how even a mediocrity can be elevated somewhat when he is surrounded by zerotalents far worse even than him lisa kudrow just like swimmer needed surgery before she was confident enough to try her luck with showbiz even though she isnt a nepotist she did use a different card as a means of getting her foot in the door hint hint i dont need to spell out what she does have a semilikable ditsy quality isnt bland like aniston but what she also fails at is that little thing she was hired to do act her entire career is based on her goofy dumb blonde shtick which i believe isnt acted but real she is the antonym of versatility having the ability to play just one character throughout her career semiconvincingly check out my profile page where you will find several nepotism lists,NEGATIVE,Comedy
1483,10.0,24 December 2019,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",with respect to the other great shows out there how can people give this was the first tv show i watched and i have to admit i really liked it but after watching the office trailer park boys its always sunny etc this show looks like a soap opera with forced laughter,POSITIVE,Comedy

1485,10.0,6 August 2018,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",so i recently saw friends for the third time and i must say that this series is still perfect for me its best sitcom ive ever seen imagine that you came home after really tough day at work or at school you just sit on your couch and turn on the tv then you start to watch friends and your day is way more better i dont know exactly what it is maybe its some kind of the magic the series is pretty funny jokes are simple and great scriptwriters did awesome job and the whole crew made unforgettable show in the end i want to say that everyone needs friends in their life and that ross monica chandler rachel phoebe and joey will be in my heart forever thanks thanks for this special show and of course chick and duck will be in my heart too,POSITIVE,Comedy
1486,10.0,4 June 2018,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this is honestly one of the best sitcons ever its the kind of show that you could binge watch in like a week and after youre done with it youll want to rewatch all the episodes again the show itself is just great and i highly recommend,POSITIVE,Comedy
1487,6.0,1 November 2022,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",one line summary if you like sitcoms this show is a mustwatch its been almost years since it first aired and it is still hands down the best sitcom ever unless you have been living under a rock you probably would know many references from friends already the show is laughoutloud funny as the name suggests the show is a comedy which revolves around six friends three guys and three girls living in new york city in their mid to late s it shows the struggles fun and relationships of each character everything from relationships breakups finances living with friends professional choices and everything in the middle as i said before the show is laughoutloud funny with each character being so relatable having their own unique quirks and personalities so no one told you life was gonna be this way,POSITIVE,Comedy

1490,8.0,28 May 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",well friends is like all to me im mentally in friends apartment this seris is very good it always make me laugh,POSITIVE,Comedy
1491,10.0,8 July 2001,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i still fail to understand why people are so fascinated by this awful show what happens when you take a talentless cast a bunch of braindead directors and retarded writers shake them up and serve you get friends or fiends as i like to call it even the earliest episodes do not stand up to repeat viewings at all as i learned a few months ago when i found a very hazy system cassette with three hours worth of the show on it thats another atrocity of this show in this age of digital television and the struggle to make the public wake up and realise that films and television screens are not the same shape warner television elect to film this programme using methods that the bbc would turn its nose up at you can see in the early episodes that every episode is shot on videotape or a lower resolution film than mm and while that might not sound bad to the same dullards out there who are trying to convince the dvd consortium to release cut and shut versions of films those of us who take a little pride in photography and home cinema presentations know the picture resulting from methods like these looks godawful the blackout episode in season one is a perfect example of this when all the lights go out there is no detail whatsoever discernable in any scene contrast this with any recent feature film that was captured properly using anamorphic lenses and mm or better film xmen being my favourite example and you can see why i hope programming like this doesnt survive the move to hdtv poor cinematography aside the characters are developmentally malnourished from day one too there is no way a character like pheobe would go through all the things she claims and remain so bright and bubbly nor would she try to express herself through such underdeveloped musical skills indeed the only character who comes close to resembling a fully developed human being with a brain is chandler who tells us a few reasons why he is the way he is unfortunately therein lies another problem with the storytelling in friends we are told too much and shown too little doctor who experienced this problem once with a companion character and when new editors and writers came in that valued the intelligence of the earlier serials she was out faster than you can say boring staid character none of the characters shown in fiends show any difference personalitywise in the current season to how they were in the pilot guest stars are often written into any given episode and this originally provided some relief from the monotony of seeing the same motions repeated endlessly but that all fell apart with the recent episode featuring denise richards watch her in wild things and youll soon notice she could have had a lot more to do than give several characters something to ogle at this is not say nothing of the fact that ross behaviour in this episode is completely inconsistent with his behaviour in every single previous episode as a last example a recentlyseen episode here in sydney which features rachel recalling the time she made out with a fellow student of the female variety had so much potential to take the character off in a new direction it was also one of the few times when we were shown some of the behaviour described in the past alluded to rather than expected to just take it as read however as fast as the character was introduced she left and that was the end of a tangent that could have sustained a little viewing interest the show is full of threads like this that blossom for a couple of minutes then are cut off with a meat cleaver in a nutshell this series is seriously overrated poorly photographed underdeveloped in story terms and not that far removed from other asinine drivel such as the brady bunch when characters show no signs of change in seven years it is never a good thing,NEGATIVE,Comedy
1492,10.0,21 June 2005,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i just dont understand why everybody makes such a fuss over this sit com sure its funny sometimes but its all bad we can start with the cast and the acting its lame did those boys and girls ever take acting lessons if so they must have had some pretty lousy teachers because non of them can act its just constant waving and hysterical screaming and yelling the producers should have hired clowns instead and the actors got payed for that and so many awards such a waste of time and money and the plot does it say something well yes one thing friends are very important and its good to have them and i totally agree sure the atmosphere is warm and friendly but there is nothing else they can tell its just sex dating and stupid skeletons coming out of monicas stuffed closet just lame,NEGATIVE,Comedy
1493,10.0,15 August 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",its been more than a decade since this show is over but still makes me laugh out loud more than any other shows that are socalled on the same category ive watched it over and over again and never get bored of the show the jokes still make sense today,POSITIVE,Comedy

1498,10.0,24 February 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i dont even find the premise important because it stands by itself even beyond it after various other attempts from roughly the same team other sitcoms they hit the jackpot with friends once seen you cannot imagine the tv world without it the characters became institutions the actors forever fused with their roles here the stories remain do you remember the time when stories for almost all who watched the series friends is the common meeting point for quite a few generations of viewers also stands the trial of time because it made personal stories and quirks into myths and so the s particularities are just a far background thing just say what is your favourite episode i know you have one also even if you know the lines by heart you still laugh out loud at many of them is there a friends museum somewhere i wonder there should be as they are a part of many peoples lives much more than some dusty historical dude that changed the world at some point,POSITIVE,Comedy

1500,10.0,16 May 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i thought i always hated comedy series and movies almost all new comedy series only offer jokes that make me feel ashamed i had watched all the series on netflix i was interested in and thought i could try to watch some popular comedy to see what was really fascinating about them after a few very bad comedy series i started watching the friends the beginning didnt convince me right away i hated laughter tracks live audience after a few episodes the audience laughter no longer disturbed at all i decided to give this series a chance the first season is the worst the characters still seek their places and are slightly different compared to later seasons but after the first season everything starts working there is all kinds of humor something for everybody for me the best humor in the series isnt the numerous jokes but the expressions and gestures of the actors the acting in this series is awesome for example voices and facial expressions bhoebes drum solo ross dinosaur tie ross dino soldier and gi joe voices accidents joeys power saw chandlers handcuffs ross learher pants and many other ingenious scenes even though its a comedy friends is the first series to make me tear up it has beautiful love stories and also annoying relationships friends makes you use the full emotional scale before watching the series i would never have thought i would say this friends is the best series ive ever watched its not full of action and excitement but every episode makes me in a good mood and smile to myself just when i think of some hilarious scene if you have never watched it watch it now and if you arent sure after the first episodes you like it then keep watching if at the end of the series you can say you hate it you are lying because this series is true masterpiece,POSITIVE,Comedy

1503,10.0,18 March 2010,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",throughout this shows tenure and being in the age category that this show was supposed to appeal to i could never understand why it was so popular rewatching one or two episodes in syndication years later my opinion hasnt changed unfunny and forced humor weak dialogueawful acting annoying characters inane story lines this show literally had it all how did this unfunny drivel find an audience this is probably the worst attempt at comedy i have ever seen and thats saying something also the suspension of disbelief needed for the premise of this show to work is amazing these people have jobs that would pay an average salary at best yet they can afford to live in a plush manhattan apartment give me a break and notice the lack of africanamericans and other minorities on this show in a multicultural melting point like new york youd think they were living in the segregated south during the s rather than a modern vibrant culturally diverse city to be fair ill give david schwimmer credit where its due because he seems to have been the sole castcrew member who actually realized the stupidity of all this and to that extent he actually lobbied for the inclusion of an africanamerican character leading to the casting of aisha tyler for at least a few episodes but its sad to think that hes the only one out of the whole cast and crew who didnt just blindly accept the absurd premise on which this show was based during its whole decade of existence ughto think this was on for almost a decade defies belief,NEGATIVE,Comedy
1504,10.0,24 August 2022,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is an excellent tv show all of the actors are excellent people are saying they dont understand it which confuses me yes it could have been more diverse its great entertainment friends are talking and living their life and you see what goes on its going to be hell when it is finally over the writers are the best i have seen how could it be a horrible show when actresses such as jennifer aniston have won golden globes because of her work in it no one who has watched this show once can say they did not laugh their ass off at least once during the minute period,POSITIVE,Comedy
1505,10.0,23 August 2019,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",the following are few reasons why this is so great the viewers relate to all of the characters in some way as each character has their own funny moments that are unforgettable ask someone who their favorite character was on the show and i guarantee they will go back and forth a couple times each episode focused on some sort of drama between the friends or drama that the friends had got into i remember being able to watch the show and translate their problems into my own and figure out how to properly fix it the story line never gets old i can still watch episodes and laugh as the situations are still relevant with story lines like trying to find your calling in life finding the right kind of love falling in love with a friend how living with a friend can tear you apart and so on these stories are still happening to a lot of us the characters life seemed so real and progressed on a very natural note i feel like i grew with rachel pheobe joey ross chandler and monica as i watched all seasons over and over the fact that love is found between the best friends was always a thought that i had for the show and really felt natural,POSITIVE,Comedy

television and seemed unprepared for the task from beginning to its predictable end this show is pretty much the definition of an assemblyline networkcontrived sitcom the characters are vapid filled in with the simplest dimensional traits among the men he have neurotic chandler matthew perry wouldbe actor joey matt leblanc and nerd ross david schwimmer on the female side we have the neurotic monica courtney coxarquette the ditzy phoebe lisa kudrow and selfabsorbed star rachael jennifer aniston the quintessential postfeminist fantasy character whose big problems include clothes great jobs and her sex life aniston doesnt have nearly the acting chops to pull it off though in fact the entire cast is generic theater school caliber given a salary strike high enough you could have found new friends on a street corner anywhere in the country people feel they can relate to the characters because drum roll they are all so widely drawn and broadly played that of course everybody knows someone like them thats the point like a politician that poles his every move nothing about the show feels natural the dialog is a phony construction of obvious setups and punchlines one person says something and then another person makes a joke out of a word the first person said thats right on friends knockknock jokes are what passes for high comedy the show is lit and paced like a soap opera dragging at minutes each week it operates on a rockbottom level of the comedy that is consistently as timely and witty as a joke in a bazooka joe wrapper hows that for timely for me it is like watching paint dry it never pulsates or comes alive but sits on the screen in labored attempts to please ever whim of its audience the running story lines herein are a mangled train wreck of breakups love confessions secret crushes obnoxious boyfriends quirky girlfriends pregnancies and wedding cliffhangers ross in particular becomes an increasingly pathetic disaster entangled in a dysfunctional web of marriages and childrenthe series was built by committee based on demos fads and ratings it bends and shifts character focus with the prevailing wind if the point of it all was to convince a generation that the only way to succeed is to just go with the flow and never challenge conventional wisdom mission accomplished life to this show is a dull repetitive and predictable cycle in which meeting someone having sex getting married and having kids although not exactly in that order are inevitabilities and that one cannot achieve happiness until all are met my theory regarding tv and the corresponding ratings is that given time quality almost always rises to the top but friend began as pure mediocrity and it rose to the top with just that the shows slavish following is an utter mystery to me i can see the need for the kind of escapist fluff the stories are light breezy somewhat cute on paper and the show plays somewhat like a female seinfeld in its intentionally childish inanity on principal im all for it but execution is another story ill even forgive the opening title sequence which is so upbeat and zany that it masks how ridiculous it actually is i dont know just get in the fountain and dance around a little bit it seems that the show provides an outlet in which the viewers can gossip about people without consequence the show is a true product of the celebrity tabloid culture we are supposed to talk about rachaels hair wonder who will get together with who next and then woo ah like pavlovian dogs when it happens it is jampacked with enough incestuous bedhopping to qualify it as the ultimate relationship sitcom the show might have gotten by as pure fluff but the real nail in the coffin are its attempts to give us something of substance its in these instances where friends turns into a sappy soap operaish melodrama that the show becomes such an insufferable bore these moments swing wildly out of tone from the broad and childish nature of everything else going on friends is just about as dull witless and unimaginative as it comes it might make a good starter sitcom for someone who has never watched tv before as bad as this was its even worse to image the shockwaves resulting from this show and what it will inspire from future slacker sitcoms we arent going to know the full extent of the damage this show has done to the sitcom for years to come,NEGATIVE,Comedy
1513,10.0,28 May 2016,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i feel like the only person ever who just doesnt like friends but i honestly think its the most overrated show ever its not that funny at all yeah an occasional smile but nothing hilariously funny and none of the stories are funny either of the main story lines are about whos dating who which is more like a soap opera than a sitcom and the small single episode story lines are just not funny think of seinfelds genius singleepisode story lines compared to friends and its like comparing wine and tap water its just not funny the male actors arent all that great actors and this is evident by their lack of success after friends cheesy and not funny with lame repetitive story lines about whos dating who the only redeeming quality is that it is still exponentially better than the sitcoms that followed and the ones that are currently on today none of them are funny including some other modern classics like full house and that s show are intensely overrated and just not funny seinfeld and cheers reign supreme while current sitcoms continue to flop with the exception of a few like the middle hilarious and perfect but lost steam in the past couple seasons arrested development and maybe modern family maybe big bangs early seasons,NEGATIVE,Comedy
1514,10.0,3 June 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",the strength of this series is in its characters the actors and writing inject a lot of personality into them we feel like we know them personally and we follow them across the course of the episodes and their overall arcs,POSITIVE,Comedy
1515,6.0,29 July 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",ive been watching friends over and over since i was in school first on tv then random snippets on youtube and more recently on netflix it is really relatable and never fails to uplift your mood its a light easy watch and will always bring a smile to your face,POSITIVE,Comedy
1516,5.0,3 December 2023,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",in the words of a great gentleman friends was a magical thing and no ones going to ever have anything like that again what i personally liked about this series is that it shows that new yorkers are just normal people like you and me being one of the most successful comedies of all time which was received very well for year in the entire world my review of this masterpiece will probably not do it justice but as americans say nothing ventured nothing gained first off all i think the makeup and hair stylists did a great job with the entire cast even though they overdid it a bit with rachel i think just stick with the bun honey that suits you the best and its a timeless classic just like friends i also would like to commend the creators of the series for promoting new age and psychic stuff even though our great new age guru phoebe buffay was portrayed a bit as an airhead in fact i was pretty close to a girl like that once myself when i was active at the rosicrucian order amorc but it did not work out so i went over to mi me and my girl lucy tapping into incredible inner resources to manifest world peace ps but im still a mystic so i also have the skill to connect to dead souls sometimes at least on a good day so here is a message from somebody from the other side hello everybody this is chandler speaking i just want everybody to know that i made it into heaven i repeat heaven not hell even though some of my critics thought that i was more of a devil than an angel but they were wrong i may have been an alcoholic but i was always an angel especially with the ladies as god is my witness in fact god is standing right here beside me yes god does exist and he asked me to help mark manifest world peace so joking time is over my dear friends its time now to get serious and make the dream of world peace a reality so even though im now in heaven and recovering for my next revival i will always be with you and my favorite six words still are trust god clean house and help others,POSITIVE,Comedy

1522,10.0,7 October 2002,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i am surprised to see so many bad reviews of this show will let me ask you this knowitalls why is it the top rated show in all of america and dont say its not because it was the number one show in television this last week a show in its th season and still number one im sorry but millions of viewers arent stupid like youre saying they are the show is just for pure fun and entertainment and truthfully gets me through the day sometimes i have purchased all the dvd sets and watch them over and over not many other things can make me laugh and smile after repeated viewings people that are analyzing things such as why no one else sits in the chairscouches at the coffee house not knocking on doors before walking in so on and so on have obviously never seen a tv show in their life all tv is like that we like friends because of the familiar setting imagine how uncomfortable and timewaisting it would be if they always knocked and waited to be let in the apartments or sitting at different spots at central perk well whether or not friends ends this year we will always have great seasons that are priceless and sorry to the cynics but friends will more than likely never disappear like you desperately claim you want it to such popular shows get shown in reruns and friends already has top marks on tbs and other channels,POSITIVE,Comedy
1523,10.0,29 July 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",the most baseline of its kind and some of the best chemestry ive seen some timeless comedy but some jokes are rehashed a little too much i cant really care too much about the drama so there is not much that keeps me interested watched s and feel like ive seen enough pretty good but not really for me,NEGATIVE,Comedy
1524,10.0,16 September 2006,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is neither so unfunny that i switch channel yet nor is it funny enough to ever make me laugh out loud at best ill chuckle but thats as far as it goes the dialogue consists of exchanges that with almost clockwork precision result in one of several quirky expressions most commonly the much copied shuh right from the infinitely funnier waynes world its that or its phoebes expression of disgust yeugh you get the idea the comedy is built around this predictable exchange with the audience no doubt cattle prodded into laughing or paid over the years that the comedy has run attempts have been made to develop the characters and i believe this was directly in response to the masterful writing in frasier which managed to combine complex character and relationship development with laughoutloud humour but friends failed to succeed in developing either the characters or their relationships rather what we were presented with were teenagers in adult bodies playing at being adults and in a sense for people who love this comedy it perhaps represents a minute opportunity to identify with this and its opposite namely being but living the life of a year old or being a year old and remembering back to when they were fantasising about being in the latter sense comfort can be found in knowing that they arent the idiots that the friends are but at the same time they have achieved a comparable lifestyle whilst being able to fantasise that they too have achieved that lifestyle with the same level of ease as the friends conversely people in their s can fantasise that they too will be able to attain a comparable lifestyle with the same level of ease herein lies its success but simultaneiously its weakness that contributes to the general lack of substance that characterises this show life especially in the city is often about struggling and indeed it is in the struggle from which much comedy is born the struggle to find love the struggle to find work or in my case the struggle to find friends funny friends is a hugely but inexplicably successful seriesi hesitate to call it a comedy because this would be to imply that it is funny it is not put it this way i can watch friends and effortlessly hold a straight face it simply is not funny the paradox however is that aside from matt leblanc the cast have proved themselves elsewhere to be excellent dramatic and comic actors but you would never guess it from watching friends i was glad that friends finished only to realise that there would be in eternity of repeats to avoid i can only hope that arrested development is given a new lease of life on hbo that kelsey grammar and gang return to a new series based around frasier krane and that the new seasons of curb your enthusiasm and rescue me start soon these are shows against which friends is eclipsed and soon forgotten,NEGATIVE,Comedy
1525,6.0,28 May 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i very much liked the show my favourite characters were chandler and joey i dont know why but i hated the character of monika i started irritation when i see her overall it was a good show worth watching,POSITIVE,Comedy
1526,2.0,28 November 2023,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",are you kidding this show deserves ratings overall its a life saver it saves anyone from anxiety depression stress i literally forget the problems in my life ofcourse temporarily i must say that those who felt it boring try once giv it a chance and go through it till season once you connect with the character theres no looking back i watch it daily before sleeping i cannot imagine a day without seeing them they are my friends and family i got connected to them so much so that if i dont watch it anyday i will miss them all its like not seeing a family member such a classic romcom series hats off to the creater and the actors however the acting is so natural that it doesnt seem like acting i must thank each and everyone who worked for this great series thank you all,POSITIVE,Comedy

1530,9.0,2 July 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",at first i didnt want to watch it i thought it would be oldfashioned or dramatic since its s my liking started when i saw the first or episodes of it and now that ive finished the whole thing i wish if i could delete the whole thing from my memory and see it again without knowing what was going to happen next it feels like i know each and every character of this show in real life they are now a part of my life i love the show i love all of them,POSITIVE,Comedy

1533,10.0,13 February 2005,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",not in the same league as seinfeld frasier or simspons but its a solid niche filler for age group its not written extremely well but it makes up for this weakness with a goodlooking cast and keepsyouwatching season long story lines of rebounding relationships lisa kudrow and matt leblanc are extremely talented although they are generally let down by the rest of the cast nothing groundbreaking friends success was on the back of a gaping hole in sitcoms waiting to be filled while it is a quality show and raked in a huge amount of money its doesnt have the same sting of some other sitcoms of its day,NEGATIVE,Comedy
1534,10.0,15 January 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this movie is one of the most interesting tv show i have ever watch and i would watch it again and again,POSITIVE,Comedy
1535,7.0,2 August 2008,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this show is just getting so irritating and predictable all the jokes are based on only few facts such as joeys unrealistic stupidity the weird part is that he wasnt that stupid in the first few seasons and then out of the blue he becomes dumber than a dodo monicas cleanliness habits chandlers sarcasm rarely any other jokes are based on something else this show also contains a lot of drama and unneeded angst created by the dreaded and irritating duo of ross and rachel in conclusion the show is cheesy cliché and predictable accompanied by witless humor but on the good side if you have not watched any episodes of this show the first few seasons would be enjoyable also it a good pass time show i give it,NEGATIVE,Comedy
1536,2.0,18 August 2019,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",even after so many years since the last episode was in air i think they are number every episode i watched i simply enjoyed laughing almost all the time simply the best,POSITIVE,Comedy

1544,6.0,19 May 2005,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i dont know whether i should admit this but ive always had a bit of an obsession with friends from the moment it came out i couldnt stop watching it and i would love to have the whole friends collection on dvd although the whole ross n rachel ballad was an excellent plot and i was happy when they finally got together ive always been more of a chandler n monica supporter the fifth series being my favourite everything is extremely amazing about this sitcom including every joeychandler moment phoebes flaky behaviour monicas obsession with cleaning rachels tendency to cry at a drop of a hat and although ive never really been a big fan of ross he too has provided many memorable moments i was very sad when this series came to an end it seems that all the programs i like have come to an end at the same time never mind there are always reruns if youre having a bad day this is the perfect sitcom to watch friends always cheers me up and hey even if youre not having a bad day its still the perfect sitcom,POSITIVE,Comedy
1545,1.0,5 July 2022,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",after watching the show in for the first time i changed my mind growing up i always caught this show on tv and had a rather bad feeling about it obviously me being a child i couldnt relate to the lives of somethings i was always under the impression its a lame show and couldnt understand why people like it now after i gave it a chance i agree its a nice and fun comedy very easy to watch and enjoyable i wouldnt say its amazing but its always a safe choice when i cant find something interesting to watch,POSITIVE,Comedy
1546,10.0,27 January 2013,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this show is very easy to grasp i remember being years old on a plane to england from australia and laughing at joey acting whilst acting in a hospital bed i thought friends especially joey were so funny at the age of and beyond now friends became increasingly predictable and dull whenever i see it and its formulaic plot all the characters are stereotypes who in reality wouldnt get on at all well i dont buy pheobe as a friend of the girls why would someone so laid back prefer to hang with materialistic anxiety ridden workobsessed over other like minded boho people each episode falls ass backwards into the old jokes and only dumb people or children will miss this they are the audience for the show just look at education statistics in the usa and it will be explained why this show is so popular there pheobe singing on her guitar with stupid lyrics and a simple melody littlestar hello there furry and kittens love your blonde hair or something stupidly simple ross and rachel playing hard to get whining joey making an italian joke by talking about food eating lots of food saying im an italian so i eat lots of food cue the laugh track chandler and monica being anxious and acting more like brother and sister than lovers jennifer aniston wearing fake nipples under white jumpers again and again why would she be made to wear see through tops with those plastic nipples isnt that kind of distracting and inappropriate even seinfeld make jokes about women who do that same with sex and the city really it was pathetic and made me disrespect aniston more for just being a bimbo on tv and off she cant act so they had to make you forget that fact joey being a male bimbomimbo seinfeld word and doing a silly acting job this show is outdated sentimental mix of soap opera and a sit com as oppose to seinfeld and curb your enthusiasm which are strictly sitcoms and had a no hugging policy they also didnt care about making the seinfeld characters look sexy just funny whereas on friends the actresses would have hair dressers on call between takes to brush their hair perfectly before the cameras were allowed to role while pheobe and monica were quite comedic jennifer aniston the vainest woman on the planet cared more about being pretty than being funny if you want love stories and drama with comedy watch sex and the city its insightful and far more intelligent than friends besides the product placement its fantastic if you want pure laughs that never date characters to relate to and a show that makes you feel happy about your life in a ce la vie fashion watch seinfeld,NEGATIVE,Comedy

1548,10.0,19 October 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",the fact i am a year old reviewing a show that started years before i was born shows just how legendary friends is the characters are relatable but all different and all have their own development throughout chandler and monica works well which was surprising rachel is the worst character and continuously shows she is an awful person however this doesnt take away from the greatness and is why ive watched it over times,POSITIVE,Comedy

1552,10.0,31 May 2019,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",for me this is the best american sitcom hands down from episode one you can see the camaraderie between the characters and it remains strong right until the series end and beyond unlike many other shows friends manages to find the perfect ending to the series despite the writers actually intending to end the show several times prior the show is still reaching new generations of people and will stand the test of time for the foreseeable future,POSITIVE,Comedy

1556,10.0,25 April 2007,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i started watching friends as a teenager and i thoroughly enjoyed it however my opinion changed as i grew older friends is entertaining when youre bored and need a quick fix of comedy one liner after one liner and the funny chandler bing by far the best character but the adolescent ways of the show made it hard to bare as i got older suddenly and somethings were still acting like teenagers when wed all grown upand everything was so superficial always about dating hair and this perfect group friendship that rarely exists in real life the character phoebe is unfunny and its annoying that we have to suffer such dumb characters over and over again ross was a well drawn character joey wasnt and monica and rachel were ok but shout and squeal just a little too much after about series five or six i stopped watching as plots involving monica baking cakes got tedious and the onoff relationship between ross and rachel grew extremely boring watch this if you like a quick laugh but go for the early good series when the characters had not all slept with each other yet,NEGATIVE,Comedy

1588,10.0,18 September 2023,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",after watching and reviewing several parallel sitcoms i recommend all future directors and writers for tv comedy study and watch friends this show is the model of how it is done later mirrored by modern family ok this is the bare bones of what made this sitcom tick there was a lot of high energy and the writers and actors kept all of the scenes no matter what the subject matter funny they never bogged down into slowly delivered lines said with pathos and drama there was no time for slowly delivered lines with stories that left viewers feeling sad they had watched no one majored in reminding viewers of the moments of their lives that they almost put a gun to their heads comedy is comedy tragedy is tragedy in a piece of short literature like the sitcom never the twain should meet i think the execs and the producers always kept an eye on funny and light heartedness one of the reasons it succeeded so magnificently through the years and has become a classic is pardon my insult to the general masses the characters were young good looking and portraying life situations where they were on the rise good things happening and better things coming doomed sitcoms will feature people who are visually challenging middle aged and older and portraying tragedy and bad times that pluck at the bad memories in the viewing audience crossing any of these lines is a major disaster for writers and producers the main female characters were extremely attractive never a bad thing with the male audience it keeps them coming back to be sure the males were not unattractive guys the balanced cast who could each take part of the load of keeping ratings up worked its a winning formula the same way james bond was popular as a movie franchise because bond always won he always came out ahead won the fight got the girl and defeated the villain nobody wants to see a movie or tv show about losing and going through hell to a winless ending if they wanted to do that all they have to do is live their own harrowing lives why use your fantasy time or money to view something that could have been pulled from your own life the point is good looking characters light hearted scripts actors who knew how to deliver comedy lines and positive futures and endings will keep em coming back for more ok now why did i not give it a ten star rating ten stars denotes perfection woody allen movies are not ten stars in my book not because they are not genius but because there are flaws and weak areas in all of his movies to be sure friends has its weak spots and faults seinfeld had weak spots and faults sometimes the episodes were written with unlikeable characters or drawn out into drama even though they were funny rachel and ross are not believable in how long it took for them to get together sometimes the characters did or said things that are not credible to human beings with an iq over its okay all sitcoms do it its known as filler but even with flaws damn it was a great series the proof of a classic is can you watch it over and over again and still enjoy it almost like a new hit song if your sitcom is not watchable more than once it aint a classic friends is definitely a classic,POSITIVE,Comedy
1589,10.0,9 September 2006,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i love this show i have every single episode and watch as often is i can much to the annoyance of my family now i know loads of people think that friends is the biggest pile of garbage on tv these people say that acting is horrendous which its not maybe the story lines arent very realistic but the characters are not so overdone in the situations nor do the act as though nothing big is happening is rather large situations they act more or less like regular people would and then they target the jokes when theres nothing to target ill give in to the fact that its not polished sophisticated humor and its just slapstick comedy about sex you know jokes that you dont have to work to get but all comedys dont have to be like that to be good i mean face it people if every single comedy out there was a the office were not going to have all that much fun sometimes you just need to turn your brain off and enjoy some television in any case i dont care if noone agrees with me because i think this show rocks,POSITIVE,Comedy
1590,10.0,23 November 2015,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",considering that i was allowed to watch the show growing up and have really only watched episodes sporadically i decided to watch the entire series in order it was really great not surprised it lasted as long as it did the chemistry of the entire cast was something a lot of shows lack and their ability to ease into any scene or joke was admirable my absolute favorite actor was matthew perrychandler bing being my favorite character as well he was relatable with his wit charm and allaround cluelessness he almost made everyone else great in all reality its a really great show i just cannot get over matt leblancs character joey they overexaggerated his stupidity even as a comedic relief i realize this is a comedy show but it was highly irritating even courtney coxs character monica was a little neurotic sometimes but considering she plays a character like that on her most recent show cant remember the name of it its a little more understandable that she may only know how to play one character both characters were made more tolerable with chandler by their side overall recommend it to anyone looking for a good honest laugh,POSITIVE,Comedy
1591,10.0,28 July 2022,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i personally did not watch friends in the original run i saw maybe part of an episode here and there but thats about it i finally decided to watch every episode from the beginning to end it took me a few months but i recently finished and now i felt it was worth posting my review overall i found the sitcom to be average did some things age well yes and no thats typical with most comedies because society changes over time hopefully for the better there were funny parts and notsofunny parts for me especially themes that ive seen before in other comedies i think what i found funny depended on the character actor andor the writers my character breakdown phoebe probably my favorite character she said and did ridiculous things that was in line with my style of humor sometime i felt like lisa kudrow was laughing at herself and they just didnt redo the scene or didnt edit it out but it was not common so it didnt take away from my enjoyment monica i really like courtney cox in this role i felt bad she was never nominated for an emmy for her work i think she deserved a nomination at the very least rachel the earlier seasons i was ok with jennifer and this character but i feel like she got better in the last couple seasons i will admit the ross breakup travesty did kind of irritate me but thats typical i guess between women and men ross i really liked ross in the earlier seasons but my like for the character waned in the later years not sure if it was the writing or the delivery but i still think david was a good actor in this role joey joey was a male phoebe only less funny and less savvy the laughs from this role for me were spotty at best so i found him to be near the lower end of enjoyable for the series chandler by far my least favorite of the bunch rarely funny if ever was it the writing that wasnt my style of humor did i simply dislike matthew perry so much in this role that i couldnt see past it was the character itself just simply annoying awkward and unfunny im not sure but i almost never laughed at his lines or portrayal of this character i personally think it drags down the series i know others think hes hilarious but i just never found him to be that for me so thats it my review of friends all in all i think as a general sitcom its worth watching i think its popularity in history should be noted and remembered for what it was worth i dont know that i would mark it as one of the funniest or greatest sitcoms ever but it definitely has its place in pop culture history,POSITIVE,Comedy
1592,10.0,11 April 2017,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i dont know why millions of people say that this is the best sitcom ever ive repeatedly tried to get into it but just cant i only laugh slightly a couple of times per episode the main six characters are a bunch of ordinary narcissists with the possible exception of phoebe how is the audience supposed to like them or care about them its ridiculously unbelievable that ross a funnylooking old acting geek with an annoying voice gets several hot girls many fans have said of friends that all young adults are similar to one of the main characters ive never been similar to any of them nor are any of the people whom i personally know i dont understand rachel having been revered and admired as a sex symbol she isnt glamorous doesnt have a seductive voice or sexy personality and isnt particularly goodlooking ive seen many sitcoms which are much better than friends including coupling the original uk series not the dreadful us remake coupling is a much funnier sexier and more intelligent version of friends coupling is betterwritten betteracted and has much stronger and diverse characters friends is a mediocre sitcom full of ordinary people who are rarely entertaining i guess that all of the people who dislike my review havent seen any episodes of coupling,NEGATIVE,Comedy

1629,6.0,6 April 2017,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i never really followed this show but ive watched episodes off and on and though its pretty funny in the first few seasons it just gets stupid and extremely shallow as it goes on the fat jokes are unbearable as are the jokes about not fitting in and not being popular monica is annoying and extremely high maintenance which is fun in a quirky way and up to a point but suddenly the show becomes all about her and it makes no sense rachel is the only female character thats relatable and likable most of the time so why all the focus on the most annoying character in the whole show fun enough sure but shallow and somewhat empty in a weird way,NEGATIVE,Comedy

1639,6.0,15 September 2019,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",season is flawless the writing is witty and intelligent the chemistry is always there no matter who is on screen the secondary characters add great amounts of comedy and backstory the acting in the first season is also great nobody goes too overthetop the jokes arent dulled down and they dont compromise each characters intelligence id give season a or as far as sitcoms go it just feels like a real group of goodlooking friends who each battle their own demons and console each other when times arent so happy unfortunately as the show continues over the years the only thing that remains is the chemistry and the funny writing the shows romantic tension is almost non existent after monica and chandler get together joey suffers so much as a believable character when the witty writing is dumbed down to get cheaper laughs by seasons and hes perhaps the most inconsistent and pathetic character in the show ross becomes an obnoxious creep instead of a charming and sensible friend monica shouts way too much aswell as phoebe and so their character traits that were so enjoyable in the earlier seasons such as their innocence and maturity no longer exist chandler goes from being this incredibly charming and sharp individual whos seen as more of a guys guy with joey in seasons to this introverted traumatised weak man with virtually zero charisma or confidence in conclusion the show suffers as the writers push the characters from the earlier seasons aside to get more laughs and because of this the shows quality suffers its still okay and the writing is still very funny but the characters have to be stupid for the jokes to work and you often find yourself realising that joey or ross in the earlier seasons would not have acted in such a way the show is by no means bad but its definetly more enjoyable and witty in the earlier seasons,POSITIVE,Comedy
1640,1.0,22 June 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i really dont understand the cast really cant act good ja is one of the most overrated actresses ever its not clever at all just stupid and full of forced and unfunny jokes that get shoved down our throats it also has no story at all it depends on characters being stupid and idiotic just for fun joey is one of the most horrible written characters ever sadly the actor is super hot chandler is the only standout character on the show the rest are pretty mediocre to really bad its also really silly and not realistic the laugh track is literally played every second of the episodes and its the most annoying thing ever this show is the perfect example for brainwashing theres no denial it has some good moments but overall it really really doesnt satisfy me and ross is trash,NEGATIVE,Comedy

1646,10.0,8 April 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",after ten years of remarkable consistency friends takes its rightful place as one of the alltime great comedy shows the first season has a distinctly different feel to the rest with unmistakeable influences from various popular eighties and nineties tv shows most notably seinfeld as the show gradually finds its feet seasons and however are when friends really comes to life and hits its peak the blend of laughoutloud comedy and engrossing storylines is perfectly balanced during these episodes the comedic acting of matthew perry is glorious and complemented wonderfully by matt le blanc the ross and rachel love story is the highlight of the entire show in my opinion beautifully written and perfectly executed david schwimmer and jennifer aniston produce a level of authenticity not often seen in this kind of show and anyone who thinks friends is just mindless trash needs to watch season episode and see what these two are capable of the show tapers off slightly from season onwards but remains very strong right to the end perry gradually becomes less humorous once chandler and monica get together but schwimmer picks up the slack morphing into a slapstick god in the later seasons while retaining his ability to create moving scenes when necessary the finale is excellent and provides a satisfactory ending for all the characters something that so many longrunning shows fail to do i have probably seen every episode a minimum of times and i dont regret a second of it,POSITIVE,Comedy
1647,10.0,28 January 2023,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",a very funny entertaining sitcom with very memorable characters the show is undoubtedly a great show the jokes are vry funny and each character is very memorable for their own insanity from season the jokes were good episodes were good very enjoyable since season there is a change due to an event from the seriesspoiler one of the lovable pair of joey and chandler gets lesser screentime together then as the seasons went on the show started showing a slight dull face but still kept its charisma of jokes and entertainment at season the series becomes awkard and viewers may dislike it season happened like the usual had jokes funny moments and the final goodbye season didnt have much of the fun factor as first five seasons did but the season wasnt bad just dull,POSITIVE,Comedy
1648,9.0,7 December 2013,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",dear all what should i say about this show the writers directors composers every cast and crew members of this sow deserves a standing ovation the best comedy yet cultural show i have ever encountered i am from india and i never used to watch engish shows but i started from big bang himym roe the middle seinfeld to name some of the best in comedy in my opinion but when i saw friends this stands out what a dynamic and natural talents these actors had i literally yes literally fall from my bed laughing my ass off the best sarcastic person in comedy i ever seen is david schwimmer matthew perry i cannot separate who is the best these people were soul of this episodes but still if someone insist i will say jennifer aniston phoebe happy go lucky cutiepie thanks to directors and all the members actors actress to make us laugh,POSITIVE,Comedy

1650,5.0,15 August 2003,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",the current promo for the upcoming season almost brought me to tears already publicizing this as the last season as if we all hadnt already heard the net is creating nostalgia that will guarantee strong viewership throughout the season it will be a sadder day than the time we lost seinfeld or mad about you for the earlier seasons not the last one its rare that a sitcom can have this kind of longevity without ever losing its audience especially when everyone assumed that the baby curse would be the signal of the shows demise friends has reinvented and reinvigorated itself numerous times and thursdays will never be the same,POSITIVE,Comedy

1652,8.0,2 August 2004,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i must have managed to sit through three out of five episodes of friends why only three out of five well simply my stomach couldnt take more then that but if id really hated myself i would have tried harder friends is an overrated and typical modernday american sitcom about six roommates living in a flat in surprise new york they got into stupid situations thinking they were funny the whole way through but funny they werent the script was unintelligent the acting was amateurish and the stories were such bores the whole show seemed so useless and i will never understand how anyone could have such lack of brain as to watch this contemptible excuse for tv entertainment but i guess most people are too sheepish to think for themselves just as they have been when it comes to the craze over such shows as sex in the city will and grace and frasier friends is simply a bad show for a country that has lost its sense of humor,NEGATIVE,Comedy

1655,9.0,8 January 2024,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is a tried and true classic with a cast of relatable characters for every audience member friends is the gold standard of television sitcoms each character has a unique personality with their own strengths and weaknesses the show covers various difficult topics and moments while still holding the spot for americas top comedy the plot flow is consistent through each season and the show does not feel as though it is dragged out too long each episode is entertaining and you never feel bored watching its the perfect way to make the time fly by even though the show is hilarious various themes and messages that make the audience think appear throughout the show the actors and actresses portray the characters perfectly the side characters add to the story and never feel forced the dialogue is hilarious and given great thought and detail by the writers the settings are iconic and easily identifiable even for those not franchise fans the laugh track can be overused sometimes however the main soundtrack is used in ways that add to the story and the theme song has aged perfectly there is no show quite like friends,POSITIVE,Comedy

1660,9.0,14 April 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",one thing about friends that is better than most other series is that it is very consistent episode after episode it provides funny plots acted out by wellwritten characters a few downsides are the laugh track especially when some jokes arent that funny the poorly aged jokes and the fact that its quite basic and doesnt really provide anything new to the sitcom genre,POSITIVE,Comedy

1669,10.0,19 November 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",actually i was started to watch the show just one month ago because my friends are talk about a show nowdays also off course you know that show was ended years ago but people are still love the show so im kinda curious about it and started to watch the show i just play the first episode of the show and i m kinda falling in love with the show and there characters all off them and i m very happy to say the show is my favorite i love the show and i always will,POSITIVE,Comedy
1670,10.0,18 September 2019,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",the premise of the show is rather mundane when you consider that the idea is simply about six generation xers lives after college but before marriage yes we all experience an interesting time when in some sense our family consists of the people we interact with from about age to before we create a family the people down the hall of our apartment the people at our work or regulars at bars its both an exciting and also an exasperating time because we still dont know the direction of our lives a lot of it is about sewing wild oats and thats basically what the characters of friends do and they seem to have the most idyllic time doing it i concede the writing and casting of friends was certainly on the higher end of the television sitcom spectrum most of the cast became stars in their own right however my issue with the show is that its about six young people having a thoroughly fantastic time the question is more about the sensibility of the american television viewing public particularly among generation xers than the creators of friends some of the hardcore fans may dispute my assertions because as we know when loyal fans espouse an entertainment institution its taken as an affront i once criticized the brady bunch in another review for somewhat similar reasons and hardcore fans lambasted me for my troubles i watched a few episodes of friends early in its first season before i began a masters degree program and didnt have time to watch television then i watched a few episodes towards its end i felt the same about the first episodes as i did the last why am i watching other people in my age group having an extraordinarily good time in fact a better time than me just watching this show sure okay the characters have ups and downs but ultimately thats also part of the human condition i think its a mark of generation x culture that fans would be so enamored with a group of television friends that they would deny themselves actually doing the things portrayed on the show i had friends who wouldnt go anywhere on thursday nights because they might miss an episode of friends television viewers would rather watch other people having fun than having fun themselves when i watch a film or television show i want to see something which is removed from myself i was more of a magnum pi type of viewer than a friends viewer i have heard people even in the television and entertainment industries say things like i want to see myself up there meaning they want to see representations of themselves and their lives why in the world would you want to see what youre already experiencing unless your own life is so banal that you need to see others living the life you desperately desire so my assessment of the series is more about gen xers who arent having the time of their lives but instead watch a series which shows how idyllic life can be the late leo buscaglia used to mention this phenomenon of watching other people having a good time my fellow gen xers turn off friends and have a good time yourselves you deserve it and keep in mind that rachel monica pheobe chandler joey and ross are all fictional characters in fact the cast members of jennifer aniston courteney cox lisa kudrow matthew perry matt le blanc and david schwimmer were not the friends you saw on screen yes i believe they respected each other as professional actors but didnt hang out after hours very few of the cast members actually attended the weddings of the other cast members you may be wondering what happened to their characters and the answer is nothing they never existed except as flickering images on a screen,POSITIVE,Comedy
1671,10.0,3 January 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",it is just painful to watch maybe if you have lived on another planet for the last years and had no access to sitcoms you could find this funny there are hundreds of better ones,NEGATIVE,Comedy

1676,6.0,29 September 2006,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i have to tell you internet movie database the earths largest movie database that friends got me through some really rough times i wont go in to that that may be one of the reasons i love it but i really think it is because friends is the best show every on tvin my opinion chandler this is the guy that jokes are his defensive mechanism and man are they funny i love every thing chandler says he is the main attraction for this show which is funny cause the producers have been quoted to say they intended for him and phoebe to be supporting characters phoebe speaking of phoebe lisa kudrow is a comedic genius and deserves every single award she has won you cant stop laughing at her you go through moments in the show almost every episodewhere after she says something you emotions are as follows what and then oh my word that is so funny ross i rank ross the highest on my list because he is the best actor of the bunch when the show was first airing on tv it was hard to catch because he was just that good everything he did especially the physical stuff was just hilarious people tend to think chandler or phoebe are the funniest but rosshe is the actor he has the most training of the group rachel rachel is on the show cause she is gorgeous hip and adorable but i dont think it was for her comedic skills sure she is funny some but when you watch the show over and over like i dorachels jokes are not funny for the second timeand definitely not the th chanders phoebes joeys and ross always are rachel also grows up on friends so it is a coming of age story for her it is interesting to watch her grow monica oh monica i would say monica is the most complex actor on the show she has a lot of trails as the series progresses and many are mirrored after her personal life which just makes it more real i would say she has to be the most generic on the show after rachel till about season she is the straight man but after season she really becomes hilarious joey i have saved joey for last because he is also a fave of mine he is just so dumb really like it makes me laugh so hard when phoebe and joey try to talk to each other they are both just dumb and that is their attraction many find joey very good looking and i do not my attraction is just how dumb and what a slut he is overall this is the best show of all time for me you cant ever top it it revolutionized sex and made the new everyone could relate to this show and syndication has only made people love it more but it really is much more than that it is the funniest show the funniest i love it basically if you havent seen friends you really need to,POSITIVE,Comedy
1677,10.0,4 June 2016,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",six friends who struggling in new yorkfind comfortsupport and love among each other yeah that is itthere is nothing more to the story the fact that the story is so simpleyet the sitcom was groundbreaking is what makes friends one of the best sitcoms of all time the dialoguethe charactersthe chemistry between the cast is what makes this one of the best tv shows this isnt a show you watchwe literally live with the six friends laughing at their situations and crying at their emotions the dialogues are the real heroes as each and every dialogue will have you laughing and gasping for breadth the chemistry between the cast is electrifying the characters start of one dimensional and slowly and beautifully develop the performances are really goodparticularly the performance of lisa kudrow and matthew perry are impressive overall i would give it a,POSITIVE,Comedy

1680,10.0,14 October 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",dont get me wrong i like this show but then it most certainly is not the best show ever there are some equally good if not better sitcoms out there who dont get enough recognition although the comedy is quite funny overall there is no storyline and the episodes get monotoned unrealistic and quite frankly boring again its a great show i agree but there are definitely way better shows ou there ike himym or the office and to all those who say that himym is a rip off of friends friends is not the first of its kind either but again this is one show that everyone has to watch sometime in their life so go ahead,POSITIVE,Comedy
1681,10.0,30 August 2013,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this show lasted years i didnt actually watch it until it was in reruns and even then it took me a few times to get past the opening theme song without vomiting which is a flat out rip off of black sabbaths after forever surprised there wasnt a law suit over it first ill start with the one positive and the only positive i can find is that jennifer aniston is good looking and has nice hair other than that theres nothing else positive i can say about this show the three main male characters are carbon copies of each other its often difficult to distinguish them from each other except for how they comb their hair theres the guy who combs his hair forward the guy whos exactly the same but combs his hair side ways and the other guy who combs his hair sideways with oil and spikes it a little this show is not only painfully boring its completely annoying from the opening theme to the duplicate male characters and the poorly written scripts its a steaming pile of garbage the fact it lasted for years is a testament to the american publics poor taste and stupidity,NEGATIVE,Comedy
1682,10.0,10 July 1999,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this is my favorite show of all time i started watching in the beginning of the fourth season i instantly fell in love with it and for some weird reason i worried id never memorize their names and soon caught up on all the episodes id missed seasons i think its kinda depressing the way the writers wrote for ross rachel she seemed to only want him when he was with someone else and it always ended in heartbreak lets hope that they wont get a divorce remember ross nyeve resolution as for chandler monica all i can say is i love these two theyve had a couple of fights but they made up right away and i thank the writers for that i sincerely hope that the show will enjoy many more seasons and that season wont be the last,POSITIVE,Comedy

1685,10.0,2 February 2018,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i think friends is the best sitcom ever its cast its scenario its humor it is just so perfect i cant even count how many times i have watched the whole series there are six friends have completely different personalities from each other in series rachel is the sensitive and a bit avaricious one monica who is an old friend of rachel is rigorous and stingy phoebe a guitarist incredibly talented is the weirdest person in the series and also she is very helpful chandler is the one who always makes jokes as monica said joke joke joke joke and i should say i still dont know what is chandlers job joey or ken adams is a little stupid he loves food and women so much that he cant choose one of them to other and the final one is ross divorce man he is a jewish man and he is very obsessive about his turkey sandwiches as you see characters are so original and the actors make these characters alive there are some specific parts that i remember about friends janice marcel rachels cat although it is not a cat joey and chandlers chairs and foosball table central perk science boy geller cup hugsy rachels dessert how you doin and we were on a break lines crap bag ross armadillo costume lobsters unagi duck and chicken smelly cat song ugly naked guy city of gunthers phalange and more friends shows us that life can be surprising it teaches a lot to us but first it teaches us to love im so thankful that they make me laugh and happy everytime i watch this series,POSITIVE,Comedy

1689,10.0,4 July 1999,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",one very commendable thing about this sitcom is that it has really distinctive characters after watching just a few episodes you get the feel of each and every of the six characters so well the way they talk how theyd react to stuff etc you could mention a line and its easy to imagine how any one of them would say it with whatever expressions or actions thats pretty cool and i like the stories of their lives sometimes it actually is kinda meaningful yet it never stops being funny,POSITIVE,Comedy
1690,7.0,30 June 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this series is so simple i watched bunch of series like bb got and if i compare the story line its so simple than them the ending is also simple but it made me cry anyway friends is an emotion i didnt watch this series for years because i thought it was so big and comedy isnt my thing but after watching this i just wish if i could have friends like them i am just but i am going to make sure that i am going to rewatch this series with my future husband kids and you wanna know whats the best feeling the best feelingthemi feel i was there with them the whole time it feels so them,POSITIVE,Comedy

1694,10.0,30 December 2018,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i dont know which stupid guys are giving this guys star they obviously either dont have friends or they cant understand what it feels about this show is all about emotions humour romance drama theres no other show i love more than friends some people have watched it completely know about each and every character knows what they do and then giving it one star if you dont like the series dont watch after episodes,POSITIVE,Comedy

1696,10.0,4 December 2023,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i have watched this series as my first sitcom and then i immediately rewatched it i have laughed a lot with this hilarious series i like how the characters have developed and almost all of the friends groups we are involved in have the identical or a slightly different version of the six main characters my favourite characters are chandler and monica because i fell sympathy with them and i think i have a very close relation with these two characters although this series is one of the most famous series in the world i believe that it is not the funniest and and an irreplaceable series if you watch the newer sitcoms and compare them with friends you will recognize that the newer sitcoms are getting better and better and maybe friends is a little bit overrated,POSITIVE,Comedy
1697,10.0,22 January 2016,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",yeah friends was an good comedy plus a little romantic tv series specially joey phoebe ross and chandler were the best characters in the show but monica rachel wasnt that good as rest of them in character wise they over act make stupid faces every time screwed something i dont know but i just dont like them monica rachel no offense though i guess thats what their character was i feel a big disappointment and sad and a bit anger whenever i looked at them in the show but on the other hand i loved joey the way he talks were have the most funniest thing ever on this show and the rosss expressions theyre the true artist and have done something so great that no one couldnt ever think of forget them and yeah the weirdness overload of phoebe love it it could become a great show without those monica rachels expressions,POSITIVE,Comedy
1698,10.0,5 February 2011,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",ross is for the most great and genuinely funny as exemplified in the fake tan episode when he gets into meaningful and deep hearttohearts or intrigues with rachel though he is insufferable chandler is superfunny throughout monica is excellent particularly in the scenes depicting her obsessive and bossy behavior phoebe is ok although sometimes her quirkiness gets a bit tiresome joey is dumb and lascivious he occasionally comes up with a funny quip but mostly its about his love of junk food and humping everything that is remotely female his iq is unlikely to be above whats his purpose on the show rachel sigh a duplicitous useless imbecile she brings nothing to the show except perhaps a pretty face she is not funny and she is not a convincing actress that per se is bad but spending so much time on her and ross relationship makes her positively annoying in the latter episodes i found myself fastforwarding through all the sequences of her and ross but and here is piece de resistance what makes her unbearably irritating are the values she represents and stands for throughout the series she chases after ross employing sometimes despicable means such as sabotaging his existing relationships when she gets him she drives him away but the minute he then tries to form a new relationship with someone else out come her old guerilla tactics to ensure that relationship fails people like that used to be called female dogs if you know what i mean a dishonorable mention the various guest stars eg bruce willis or jeff goldblum they overdramatize and behave totally unnaturally its like hey im a bigshot star on this bigshot sitcom so i have to leave my mark and the only way to do that is through affectation and by being outrageous willis in particular was unwatchable elle macpherson too was bleak and nondescript what greatly exacerbated this were the cheap hysterical canned laughs played after every line uttered by the guest star oh yeah and the apoplectic canned screams played at the entrance scenes of the guest stars bottom line if the series had been cut down to five instead of ten seasons and if rachel and joey had been left out or at most limited to intermittent guest appearances this would have been an outstanding show this way it got jaded predictable tired and annoying halfway through,NEGATIVE,Comedy
1699,7.0,4 May 1999,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",what can beat six great actors and the best tvseries screenplay ever even better than seinfeld well friends is the best six excellent characters the youth friendship theme the perfect role for each actor representatives of ourselves the comfortable scenarios the amazing creativity of the screenplayers the laughable history of the six and the emotional atmosphere were are putted in are only some of the points i can describe here friends dont deserve to be commended it deserves to be watched thats all life is about its what friends is about i never thought a tvseries could do this to me,POSITIVE,Comedy

1701,10.0,7 November 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",title says it all and since there are thousands of detailed well written reviews am not going to bother typing one myself just make sure to watch it in order without commercials the first seasons are the best but it gets progressively worse from there unfortunately still even just the first seasons is a lot of episodes the main criticisms of it are that its not realistic and not exceptionally funny both are true but not really important the appeal of the show is the characters and their light hearted interactions episodic stories and longer ongoing stories if youre looking for realistic portrayals of nyc and hard laughter this isnt the show seinfeld is more the show for that from that time period but by todays standards it too would not be considered that realistic in its portrayal of nyc life,NEGATIVE,Comedy

1707,10.0,11 January 2016,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",before watching the show i was very fascinated about friends at least when you see the title making room in imdb top tv by why shouldnt one watch it but it finally turned out to be a very lame series the thing that surprised me much how why in the hell it has so much popularity i stick with the series till the very last episode depicting lives of a friend circle of mid ninetys living in ny there is no particular story anyway most of the goofy shots which are actually meant to be humorous are too lame and too forced only few episodes were funny in the whole series but that cant save the trip to tell you the truth its overhyped overrated show if you are planning to watch it after a few times later you will understand how worthless this series is usually i am not intended to write negative reviews but in this case i just cant avoid the fact that its a botheration,NEGATIVE,Comedy

1715,10.0,14 December 2017,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",personally i dont think characters in any other show could connect to the mainstream audience as well as friends has done sadly i wasnt a fan when the show was actually aired prime time but once i got the hang of it how well has it served me with immense emotion humor and the moral sense of living on your own terms independent on anyone or anything its influence on the india urban youth is downright grand as everyone slips in chandlers one liners or joeys how ya doin or monicas unnecessary extravagant attraction to hygiene it has so many run of emotions and having said that it can still be watched exclusively for its humor i can easily entitle this as one of the funniest shows on planet earth i remember watching it in my college days on the bed since my parent slept in the hall and even if i watched it with my headphones my laughter would screw up my parents sleep there are so many layers to every character theres rachel who is a poster child glamour doll who wants to make a mark on her own and be selfsustained so starts working as a waitress theres monica who is a cleanliness fanatic and also a chef by profession there is the latters older brother ross who has phd and is a paleontologist having his own dinosaur fantasies theres joey who is the cool and funny guy of the lot who is really popular among the girls and also a professional actor who isnt really doing well theres sweet and very unorthodox phoebe who likes to sing pretty offbeat songs with her guitar and is a masseuse by profession and finally my personal favorite chandler who throws in cringy remarks in conversations that have so much subtle sarcasm and wit and his partnership with joey brings up some of the best bachelor comedy there is to offer on the silver screen on a serious note the important content displayed is that the lives of these individuals are far from perfect in fact there are run of events that are outright sad and depressing but eventually someone is always there for someone else and they hold on to each other in tough timesits one show that will resonate through your life in various forms and the echoes will last your lifetime,POSITIVE,Comedy

1720,9.0,11 March 2024,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is and always will be my favorite television show of all time it takes a simple concept of six twentythirty something year olds and is developed beautifully it covers the hilariously ridiculous things that happen in every day life as well as the stresses and negative things as well i also think that there is a quality to each of the main six that you can find in yourself i personally find myself smart like ross sarcastic like chandler a chef foodie like monica an eating foodie like joey a weirdo like phoebe and kind of a snob like rachel and like the six friends i prefer a close group of friends that are my chosen family rather than large groups of people that i talk to occasionally,POSITIVE,Comedy

1726,1.0,21 June 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this show is so overrated i dont get how it is as popular as it is the humour is just lazy most of the time and it relies too much on the audience laughter to help the jokes land a perfect example of what doesnt work about this show is in an episode where joey is looking for a stage name chandler suggests he makes it joseph stalin and joey doesnt pick up on the joke if this was a clever show like modern family or the office joey would go to the audition and make a fool of himself there would be clever writing he would probably say something that would be interpreted wrong because of his name however since this is friends he comes home to the apartment and says something like apparently there already is someone called joseph stalin and murdered a bunch of people that is the whole joke thats not clever thats not even that funny it is just lazy comedy writing,NEGATIVE,Comedy

1731,10.0,13 January 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",previously i only heard about friends and did not plan to watch it but at one point when i heard it again mentioned on youtube as one of the best tv series i wanted to know why is there so much talk about him starting from the first episode i was drawn into it i saw that the series tells about the life of ordinary people each one is different in character and hobbies but at the same time they are good friends who help each other out in different situations they find themselves in different adventures that are shown quite amusingly it is interesting to watch them everyone can see themselves in them and laugh at it the series can cause a variety of emotions laughter crying hatred surprise etc i watched one episode after another and did not notice how the time goes by i like being in this world and watching the characters mature when i moved on to the last season i was sad to know that the series was coming to an end while watching the series it was as if i myself were a part of this series the ending of the series makes you cry you realize what happened during all this time how the characters have changed and what path they have come the series has passed the test of time you want to watch it again and again in order to reexperience the whole range of emotions and see the details that you might not have noticed about watching the first time,POSITIVE,Comedy

1735,6.0,11 August 2019,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",so i recently finished watching friends and i gotta say i really liked it especially for a sitcom i liked all the dynamics between characters and how subversive the plot could be at times i think the characterization was phenomenal for the most part mostly because of the cast being really talented and i think the overall writing was pretty good the show starts off with a very familiar feel to it this is mostly due to the fact that this show inspired every sitcom to come out since and if youve watched any of those before this youll probably feel the same the first season is pretty good although i think its one of the weaker seasons i like everything to do with rachel and ross especially more so than most seasons and i think matthew perry is at his best comedic wise here where this season falls short for me is in all the other characters i never found monica joey or phoebe to be particularly interesting and they felt more like characters that where created just to fill an empty gap this season had more of a slow sort of feel to it than later seasons which i can really appreciate and overall id say it was a pretty good start now from this point on the show has a lot of ups and downs for me i found some seasons to be good and some to be pretty bad actually season picks up the pace from season nicely and is a great improvement over the already solid ground work left by season i found most character problems i had go away fairly quickly here and it surprisingly got me invested in characters like joey monica and phoebe very quickly on i think the comedy is at its best in this season and i can safely say that everything done with the rachel and ross relationship was handled pretty perfectly with one surprisingly touching scene that you dont see done this well in other sitcoms now season as it stands is my favourite season by this point the writers seemed to fully understand what was working and what wasnt working and they manage to perfectly balance the drama and comedic aspects of the show with one episode especially showing just how well adjusted the writers have become to these characters so up to this point the show has managed to improve upon each season and its pretty great to watch when the writers sat down to write the next season it seemed as though they had studied what the fans liked and didnt like about their last season and it was pretty great but then for whatever reason all of that seems to be lost after that with the show having some seriously high notes and some seriously low notes with a pretty inconsistent feel to it all i think the pacing for the show took a huge drop after season and characters like ross and rachel were written pretty poorly what was once the heart of the show and its main contrast now started to feel like an anchor weighing down the show bit by bit from season on wards it seems the show has found its new heart monica and chandler and for the most part its extremely good courtney and matthew have seriously great charm and charisma together on screen and their relationship felt earned and right for the show but then for whatever reason the show still chooses to have ross and rachel be a big player in everything i found everything the show did with their relationship after season too just be annoying or unfunny even in well written heartwarming moments between the two it just became impossible for me to become engaged because of how much the show chooses to drag the story out for so long the show is consistent in other aspects though matt le blanc is never not funny and matthew perry is the same both actors are given some of the greatest writing comedic wise and drama wise i think some of the moments with matthew are especially great i think phoebe who is actually really funny throughout the show wasnt given the best story lines to work with as a single character but i think they later improved massively on this during later seasons and i think monica is an exceptionally funny character throughout most of the show overall i love it its very far from perfect but it does more than enough right to be a great sitcom it does defiantly feel like a product of its time and thats fine honestly also i love how it becomes a psychological horrordrama movie from the s when you remove ross thoughts from his close up shots lmao,POSITIVE,Comedy

1745,7.0,31 December 2011,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",contrary to my summary it did not make me cry when i was watching it but when i watched the last episode of the show this show is truly one of the best things that you can witness on tv the actors are all hilarious in their own way and that just makes you love each of them for their uniqueness this show has been going for years strong and i enjoyed it a lot i managed to watch all seasons in a bit more than a month unlike many shows they quit while on top and that is a very bold move and one that i respect so what did i do after i finished watching it well i rewatched all the ten seasons again of course d,POSITIVE,Comedy

1747,10.0,21 March 2001,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is one of the most amazing sitcoms in television history while half hour comedies come and go friends remains a top rated series for almost seven seasonswhy you may ask well first lets look at the cast all six actors are not only extremely talented but work well as an ensamble they the cast have often admitted that they liked and cared about each other this makes for flawless performances the series true star courteney cox shines in each episode by always reaching and holding on to new comedic highs and powerful dramatic moments the entire cast show a vast range of talent the only problem that i can see with the series is the constant intrusions by guest stars what nbc fails to understand is that this series needs no hollywood celebs to get high ratings behind the scenes are the shows un spoken heros the writers television is like a shark it eats material it takes the most wonderfully gifted writers to crank out episodes with the quality that this series has alas after next season the show must end friends television at its best,POSITIVE,Comedy

1756,10.0,3 January 2024,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",chandlers humor is the only thing that still makes this show feel fresh his sarcasm revealed truths in a humorous way it was not mean phoebe despite her foibles was kind i hated ross he is a toxic narcissistic character he expected raysh to abstain from men while he continued to pursue women he tried to portray himself as the lovable goofball by using a fish face but reveals his true nature when he flashes his mean eyes and even tries to control rayshs work environment i liked the tanning episode because he got his comeuppance with his knowitall attitude he acted as if he knew more about tanning than the people who work there rachel and monica were good characters and the best fountain dancers joey was fine but sometimes made me cringe unlike others this show feels dated to me but it is watchable,NEGATIVE,Comedy

1765,10.0,6 March 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is no doubt the first step to the obese habit of binge watching the show is both fine and overhyped but if you are a newbie and have developed no taste in good tv shows you are going to absolutely love it everyone wants to be a part of a group that stays together no matter what happens us media seems to know the potential of this fact as they bring together the apex of friendship goals in friends the show is about a group of friends living in new york and their codependent tangled lives with their screw ups the characters may not seem relatable but you end up with an ache for wanting such friends the one who can cook the one who is dumber than you the one who is dorkier but caring the on who is weirder than you the one who diffuses the tension with forced jokes which are sometimes funny and the one who raises the hotness bar of the group the dialogues are meh and the jokes are forced by the magic of laughter tracks although the actors have done their part well you may want to stay clear of youtube videos on friends without laughter track if you want to continue to think chandler is funny and not lame and pathetic the show is one of the most bingeable shows ever made which makes it the first show everyone should watch if they want to get in the habit of sitting in their rooms watching episode after episode instead of going out and having a life the first time you watch this show would be great the jokes are funny the plots are amazing and the female actors are the hottest in the all of american sitcoms but the second and more consequent times you watch it you may think its just some friends talking and not even joking around which in all honesty it is and you end up thinking okay i need another weeks on the couch binge watching another show about a group of friends living in new york and their intertwined lives and voila youre a part of the community now to sum up this is the first show you must watch if you want to start watching tv shows it gets you in the habit of binge watching and finishing long seasons but if you have seen breaking bad game of thrones or peaky blinders youre going to judge everyone who still watches friends,POSITIVE,Comedy

1777,9.0,14 January 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",the theme song for this is catchy and musically top notch which alone makes this worth more than other than that its a dull series apparently about three perfect men and three perfect women which the writers are quite inept at making look imperfect theyre also incredibly dull and impossible to relate to it is one of those series that is impossible for a non drug abuser to stay awake through for more than seconds so it could be a good insomnia cure but more than likely will just irritate you if you try to watch it the situations and relationships are impossible to relate to,NEGATIVE,Comedy

1813,10.0,12 March 2023,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",more a show for caucasians but still a good show despite living upstairs the caucasian friends all like to get together in this comfy welllit place drinking big cups of coffee and laughing together sometimes they have jobs sometimes they dont but if money troubles are experienced then they are temporary and comical the problems they experience in life are less about loss and pain brought about by their own character failings and more about leaving their laundry somewhere amusing etc of course it is a sitcom and you want all this stuff so like i said it is very clean very safe and so on personally i tend to prefer dramas when it comes to television just because i enjoy depth i enjoy complexity and i do not think for one minute that life is like friends for anybody although i can see why viewers clung to its ideal the cast are pretty and perform their undemanding stuff well enough to produce bland characters that hopefully all the viewers will like,POSITIVE,Comedy
1814,10.0,19 August 2019,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",a friend of mine told me years ago that he had a simple test when dating a girl if shes into frasier then shes a keeper if shes into friends then steer the k away having tried to sit through a single episode of friends for the umpteenth time i now know why ive yet to see the one that actually made me laugh overacted juvenile and shallow friends is probably only funny to people who still laugh at farts and to top it off none of the characters are likeable theyre either self centred neurotic air headed manipulative selfish douches or a combination of the above whos default mode of communication is putdownsarcasm friends may be rated highly right now but over the years im sure the ratings will gradually drop as new viewers see this show for the outdated embarassment that it is,NEGATIVE,Comedy

1816,10.0,29 November 2023,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends turned out to be far more than most shows for me i started watching for the funny moments but stayed for the characters i have watched fiends from start to finish more than times and yet some of the better moments just keeps my attention no matter how may times i watch it when i read for for an exam for more than two weeks i had this run in the background and only looked up when something especially funny happened it really helped me zone out and when i finally finished my exams i just started the show over from the start this show has honestly helped me in my life and ill be forever grateful chandler and joey have given me some of the best laughs of any show i have seen if you somehow never watched firends its still worth it today,POSITIVE,Comedy
1817,10.0,11 October 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",im on the last season but im giving this a its such a nice comedy jokes are mostly funny so bad that it ended so fast for me u just start to watch it and u already watched season in one go i suggest this to everyone,NEGATIVE,Comedy
1818,10.0,30 August 2024,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",recently i read some of the reviews of friends which in my opinion is one of the greatest television shows ever made some of them had very low scores and since im one of the fans having rated this show a i thought id give some insight as to why i rated it so high i saw it back when it first came out at which point it was something completely new and unseen this show was amazing the punch lines were perfectly timed it was fun moving and i loved the characters admitted chandler was my favorite mainly because he and i shared the same sense of humor ross meh he has his moments but most of the time i didnt care much for him i dont think it was realistic how he and rachel ended up together break or no break she was way too hot for him she like ross had her funny moments but wasnt my favorite either except that she was the hottest of them all joey felt like a lovable guy right from the beginning a bit clumsy but lovable none the less phoebe was a bit of a wack job but still occasionally fun monica was probably my least favorite character she was nice looking nothing over the top but her part became tiresome in the long run despite not everything being top notch the combination of these characters still managed to create the most amazing show a show im still rewatching to this day and never get tired of if someone produced something similar today it probably wouldnt hit as perfectly as this did back then so would i rate it a if i saw it today for the first time most likely not the jokes are old and the world has changed a lot since then but thats one of the reasons why the show is amazing if you saw it back when it aired its like a pocket in time it lets you relive life when everything was simpler and not everyone was so politically correct,POSITIVE,Comedy

1822,10.0,10 April 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this sitcom is one of my top for sure it is amazing i watched it to times but still skipped a lot of scenes that i hated which are a lot btw im pretty sure that after i finished this show for the first time and decided to watch it again i skipped everything that had ross and phoebe before i list those things i also have to say that there are stupid but yet confusing scenes like they could do it way better and we would have things much smoother see a vid on youtube by watch mojo titled confusing friends moments things i dislike in the show ross is the definition of cringe awkward and stupid,POSITIVE,Comedy
1823,9.0,8 October 2019,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",years after the show ended it still haunts tv stations on endless loop as a tweenteen i used to enjoy it but having been able to revisit it in my s ive realised just how irritating it is for a start each episode is exactly the same essentially the story arc never really ventured far from one episode to the next the only variables being whatever improbable circumstances surrounded them or the various guest stars in reality each of the characters is a loathsome person in their various ways how anyone of them succeeded in their various pursuits is beyond me the only silver lining is that the fact that various ones paired up in the end was factually accurate because they were insufferable to all but each other please let this show die,NEGATIVE,Comedy
1824,10.0,13 August 1999,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",a brilliant series that combines laughter and drama its a story about rachel greenjennifer aniston monica gellarcourteney cox phoebe bouffantlisa kudrow joey tribbianimatt le blanc chandler bingmatthew perry and ross gellardavid schwimmer friends is superbly funny it also has plenty of guest stars every episode to keep you involved they include robin williams helen hunt giovanni ribisi teri garr tom selleckhank azaria charlton heston and isabelli rosellini to name a few watch friends because you will be automatically entranced by its quick wit and clever scripting that appeals to all of the family rating,POSITIVE,Comedy

1831,10.0,8 March 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i first saw this show on facebook and i kept seeing it all over social media and so i decided to watch it and now i understand why the setting of the show is in the late s and transitions to early and the tone of that transition literally changed as time went on so props to the production team for that the actors who played the main characters monica geller phoebe buffay rachel green ross geller joey tribbiani and chandler bing fitted the description of their characters perfectly each scene and line were delivered so naturally that it doesnt even seem like theyre acting anymore i cannot imagine any other person to play their roles because it was a perfect match i love how the show also depicts diversity in race social status civil statusetc and they cooperated some life lessons in some episodes that you wont really expect to see like how change is okay doing something in an unusual way is okay etc this show is great for people who are approaching adulthood experiencing anxiety when it comes to being different ive watched each episode of this show more than times and i still cant get enough how i wish they could do more episodes but i guess i can only hope i follow the actors on their social media accounts though and i admire how they kept their friendships solid even after the show overall the wittiness lessons characters production team and the whole show gets for me i can always count on the show to make me laugh whenever im down definitely an amazing recommendation to anyone,POSITIVE,Comedy
1832,10.0,10 May 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this sitcom is terrible there were a lot of comedies much much better than this to name a few the office how i met your mother and i am not saying they dont have their downsides either but this one would passed as a horrible headache and cancelled if it was made in recent times the jokes and the situations the plot is based on are immature childish and unrealistic respectively and esp the characters like phoebe would have passed as mentally disabled in real life,NEGATIVE,Comedy

1948,10.0,18 March 2002,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",it is really sad that this show gets as mush praise as it does i actually read a user comment that this show was the best sitcom ever guess if that comment came from a male or female are there any women out there who find this show boring and totally sucky i think it would take the common idiot minutes to write an episode of this show how long would it take to write an episode of simpsons seinfeld wings this show is about as clever and predictable as a jennifer aniston movie oh wait shes in this miserable excuse for a sitcom the talent of these actors rank up there with the uncanny ability of julia roberts to play such a wide variety of roles i perdict that the next pile of garbage called friends will contain the following leblanc being an idiot and saying how you doin aniston being so worked up about something so low and thoughless it makes anyone with an education higher than the third grade more stupid perry saying something sarcastic as i know you are but what am i schwimmer saying awww rach i guess cox and phoebe just run around like morons i cant wait till the day this show is gone from my life forever i would rather watch mariah careys glitter eight times captain ron and weekend at bernie twice than sit through one ad for must see tv everytime i hear a girl say that friends is the best i feel sorry for all the women out there who seek intelligent comedy that must put up with listening to their peers babble about this show and how they hope that rachie and ross get back together this show singlehandedly sets the womens rights movement back two and a half decades,NEGATIVE,Comedy

1958,8.0,29 March 2004,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",the over extended story of six young people looking for love with the right guy or gal was funny for a while but eventually ran out of steam it boasted many memorable moments but also plenty of groaners to go with it usually in the form of various guest stars whos guest spots were pretty badly exploited and under utilized like bruce willis ben stiller alec baldwin jon lovitz etc billy crystal robin williams had a fun bit once though but tom selleck was the only guest star to have actually had a respectable character when they came up with the joeyrachael storyline coupled with rachael getting pregnant and giving birth to baby emma the wheels had most definitely fallen off the wagon but then again that should have been obvious from the season finale in las vegas the only real highlight of that finale was watching the rachael disrobes and walks around naked in her apartment sequence allowing everyone a look at the then going on jennifer aniston bear her figure in the dark lit sets of warner brothers the staff clearly spent the last of their talent writing that scene and rachaels embarrassment at disrobing herself even though there was no one around to see her naked and her quick adjustment to being naked in her home and the forbidden joy of it stars out of,NEGATIVE,Comedy

1965,10.0,28 June 2016,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i cannot even begin to say how much i adore this show i never stop rewatching it because honestly whats the point in starting a new tv show when you already know youve found the best one so many people say that seinfield is the best but could that be anymore wrong seinfield does not have the emotion that is in friends the characters are not even close to being as close as rachel joey monica chandler phoebe and ross as a matter of fact no one can be as close as that i admire how the show always makes me smile the entire time my friends all say i look like an idiot when im watching friends because im always laughing out loud and grinning from ear to ear and honestly i couldnt care less this show has changed my life literally i love looking at joey because oh my god he is so hot his kindness towards his friends and his sense of humor always makes me so happy joey is hands down my favorite rachel and her growth throughout the show is so strong and amazing i loved how she went from the person who used her daddys credit card to someone who works at ralph lauren monica and her cleanness always reminded me of some people i know and a little bit of me too also she was so gorgeous too and chandler of course his sarcasm and awkwardness made it impossible not to like him ross who always manages to make me laugh because of his three failed marriages and his love for dinosaurs hes so cute and last but definitely not least phoebe the spiritual quirky one out of them the creator of smelly cat so if you have not watched this show what are you doing go watch it right now oh and by the way ross and rachel were on a break,POSITIVE,Comedy

2024,10.0,8 July 2015,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",best sitcom ever i watch it at least once a year from start to end i somehow feel there is lot that can be related to from this series and the fun they have which in turn viewer has is of the highest level ten year long uninterrupted coverage and successful telecast covers it anyway friends was a historic tv chapter it had every thing for every type of audience the cinematography improved with time and direction improved too the story line kept on audiences glued to this series the connection between the cast characters was not parallel to any other sitcom hope it never ended or had little more to watch of it so again friends is the best sitcom ever,POSITIVE,Comedy
2025,1.0,23 August 2008,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is the tv show of a generation having rewatched all the episodes recently i was pleasantly taken back to my youth in hindsight its quite obvious why this show was such a success aside from the fact that all the main actors had an undeniable chemistry going on the writers understood perfectly which fears and sorrows occupied young people at the time and incorporated them into the shows fighting for independence from your parents and struggling to stand on your own two feet rachel having to deal with your shyness and working in a job that you hate chandler coming to terms with indifferent parents monica or a troubled youth phoebe or having to accept that your early attempts at starting a family already failed ross of course friends was not a downer these troubles where dealt with but in a light way the friends always had each other and their youth they had trendy haircuts and made hanging out at the coffee house the cool thing for a new generation the stories were charming the jokes funny if harmless maybe the show was a bit too clean cut at times im referring to stuff like the inclusion of hootie the blowfish but then there were some naughty sexual references too especially in the early seasons cleverly the story lines were always adjusted to the age of the characters so audiences could grow with chandler monica ross phoebe rachel and joey friends was always something the dedicated fan could identify him or herself with thats also why the show maintained its high quality for most of its run with the exception of the tenth and final season where the actors wanted to move on pushing writers to wrap up the rossrachelstoryline quicker than it could have been wrapped up anyway friends has become a tv classic it managed to capture the attitude to life of a whole generation the final episode is very touching because when the friends part its like saying goodbye to a part of your own youth still all things must pass and im glad friends ended on a very high level every generation has its tv show this one is mine,POSITIVE,Comedy
2026,9.0,9 January 2016,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this the best tv show ever made i really love it i can watch it over and over again and it never becomes boring the jokes are universal and never get old this show has made me laugh even in the most difficult moments ive watched it through very hard times and maybe it helped me cheer up at some level i remember back then when they begun to air it on tv in bulgaria i hated it didnt want to watch it at all but after some time i couldnt stop watching more and more its like a drug i wish they could make another show that can beat friends but i dont see it yet definitely recommend it to everyone who has not seen it yet and to those whove seen it a couple of times too,POSITIVE,Comedy
2027,10.0,29 April 2022,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",am not a big fan of rewatching stuff ive already seenbut for friends id probably consider it chandler is hands down the best character joey and the tall blonde chic can be annoying sometimesbut its nothing serious very good,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2028,10.0,30 October 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",seriously this is the worst sitcom ever jokes are horrible writing is horrible acting leaves a lot to be desired flat one dimensional characters cheesy snd awful catchphrases only a few episodes are actually memorable the rest is just utter trash every time i was forced to watch this show i lost brain cells written by a group of year old girls clearly horrible show i cant stress this enough if you like good writing good acting good jokes good story characters with depth and range this is not the show for you,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2029,8.0,18 July 2005,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",if you are a male and you are in doubt of your sexual preference i have a surefire way to determine your life style its really simple look through your dvd collection and if you find a copy of friends season onei think you know where this is going this show is obviously directed toward an audience of year old girls who spent most of their time in school passing notes about johnys dimples dont believe me just listen to the dialogue look at the cast and view the plots and scenery i am proud to say that none of my friends personalities resemble any of the characters in this show to any guys that had the misfortune of watching this show forcibly by your girlfriends i hope i sympathize for you and if she went as far as buying you the box set return the favor with a hooters calender on her birthday,POSITIVE,Comedy
2030,10.0,6 April 2014,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i just finished watching friends i can not believe that it has ended one of the best shows i have ever scene and perhaps will remain the best ever i have learned many things from this show the most important one is cherish each and every moment with your friends they will always be there for yousurewhere lol okay so the ending was very unexpected and i must say it was very emotional too i felt like crying but was laughing my ass off as well i simply can not stop myself from praising the show every now and then the plot characters story line etc was just perfect i miss the show already i hope that they make new seasons,POSITIVE,Comedy
2031,10.0,21 April 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",all the characters played their roles perfectly i have seen each episode many times and i still laugh like i just saw it for the first time literally one of the best shows ever,POSITIVE,Comedy
2032,10.0,15 April 2014,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",absolutely brilliant i love this show i must have seen every episode at least times and it never fails to make me laugh the characters are brilliant lovable and funny it there own ways my personal favourite is phoebe because she is crazy and funny she reminds me a bit of myself this show is brilliantly written and will still be hilarious in years it is also a show that knew when to stop too many tv shows go on too long and arent funny anymore with friends every series is funny and perfectly written,POSITIVE,Comedy
2033,10.0,21 September 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",if you have not seen friends your life is just incomplete and once you watch it you will watch it again and again until you become a part of friends this show has been with me in pain in joy in sorrow in happiness this has been a part of me getting out of my depression this stupid old cranky cliché tv show made me cry so many times made me laugh in my sleep i cannot imagine my life without this show as i am writing this review i am getting tears in my eye that i will not see another series of friends again the magic happened only once in the entire history of humankind i cannot even watch the last episode these days i just cannot i know it is not very manly but i am going to cry a year old adult man is going to stay very sad for some time if i watch that episode if you have never watched it it doesnt matter who you are how old you are you can be or please watch this show this will heal you and help you in ways you cannot imagine i mean i have friends who says slangs and abuses with each sentence they pronounce but even they come to my house to watch this this is just the best thing,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2034,9.0,8 October 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends had great and not so great moments mainly everything after season eight finale i still cant believe how it lost its spark so close to the finish line writers were desperately trying to give characters closure but did they really needed any as far as im concerned the show worked best by not overthinking things and the best episodes involved a contest a feud a random basketball game or a secret discovered the show worked best without a safety net to me it is the most iconic s series and has such a brilliant aura it simply lifts your spirit up whenever you need it the most the theme song is corny and repetitive but you wouldnt dare imagining the episodes without it i dont get some of the hate these characters get especially today but i definitely remember that joey got on my nerves very often and its no secret the worst plot of the series involved him and another hated main character things were at their best for the show through seasons to then it slowly declined to reach its full potential by season season is good but still leaves me more or less satisfied each time and season has storylines i dont like season and however are my favorite and most watched years of them all im not going to list my favorite moments and episodes though it would take forever and im sure i would still not be satisfied with it as they tend to change a lot over the years but people can keep whatever show they think is best to me this one is it for its effectiveness ensemble cast and the era it represents,POSITIVE,Comedy
2035,10.0,22 September 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",the show may is released in the s but it has elements of humour which you are going to laugh at its a show that even if you have a bad day then it will cheer you up i am sure the upcoming generations will also be glued to this show i would just recommend to not go into the details of the scene goof ups just enjoy the show having said that there are certain jokes related to indians which certainly we can forgive but cant ignore,POSITIVE,Comedy
2036,9.0,21 January 2016,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",one of the best comedies and characters out there which keeps me alive during stressful days its an addiction as well as memory u will never forget for your whole life a must must watch for everyone the stars include courteney cox david schwimmer lisa kudrow matt leblanc and matthew perry at its best friends operates like a firstrate broadway farce complete with slamming doors twisty plots and intricately strung together jokes and even when its not at its best the crack acting and piquant punchlines give friends a momentum and charm that win you over even if youre not laughing and finally leblanc is a rarity a hunk with a gift for deadpan comedy,POSITIVE,Comedy
2037,8.0,26 March 2024,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",do you ever have something everyone seems to love but you just cant figure out the draw thats friends for me though over the years ive learned to feign enjoyment for the show for the sake of social cohesion its simply not very funny especially years later except for a couple of chandlers jokes the acting is poor and the show is boring as the six friends sit in their apartment talking to each other the season bylines are who will date who i know it was the s but the show is just so bland ive seen every episode of every season and tried rewatching a few after matthew perry tragically died i really wanted to change my mindbut its still bad there is so much better television out there it was bad then and it is bad now the best thing about this show back in the day was we were closer to watching seinfeld,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2038,8.0,6 June 1999,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this show is certainly funny but it doesnt as the viewer above indicated portray my friends i love my friends and i love this show but these people are tv people fine for fantasybut it is not a realistic portrayal of life im not complaining just responding to a previous comment here are some facts there is no way an unemployed singer phoebe an unemployed fashion platewaitress rachel and a chef could live in a multibedroom apt with a fabulous view in nyc it would cost month are you telling me that one person is paying for it all across the hall the rarely employed actor and the statistician are going to foot the rent on that place not do you know a lot of people that carry their brothers child and that have the same name as their mother if they are all vaguely employed some more than others how do they have time to constantly be sitting around drinking coffee listening to phoebe sing chilling at the girls apt etc people work im sure i have more but i have to go do real things now anyway my point is only that this is not a realistic picture of life in a major metropolitan us city it costs too much to have that much leisure time realism aside i like the show i watch it its great etc im not busting the show just the statement that it in any way reflects reality,POSITIVE,Comedy
2039,9.0,23 September 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",indeed one of the shows that lightens up and rejuvenates you even a slightest sad moment gets taken away if you happen to watch one episode of friends i have seen all seasons thrice and every time i see it it just doesnt disappoint kudos to the entire team wish this would never end,POSITIVE,Comedy
2040,10.0,24 August 2006,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",should be more episodesnot enough i think they should go on like joey did so after a year of being at deferent places they would understand that they should be together and keep going with more adventures and wild situations i know is hard to do this after years but if you consider that there are people like me that are watching the show for the third or fourth time you can be sure of the success ask for ideas from the fans of the series by mail and make a summary in order to help you up with the creation of the storythat would help a bit although i am sure that you dont need it as you have done an excellent jobbut i am sure it could be a motivation to be occupied with for the fans of friends john,POSITIVE,Comedy
2041,4.0,31 December 2018,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i love it its so good i love itnejsjsjeejnjnjenddjjsdnnejnxejxne,POSITIVE,Comedy

2043,10.0,14 November 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",the ending made me crying so much friends will always be my favourite sitcom cool and funny friends so full of life and joy and also with sad moments thank you friends for making my childhood happy and i will never stop watching it over and over,POSITIVE,Comedy
2044,10.0,21 May 2015,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i didnt watch friends when i was growing up but due to its huge popularity i obviously had to check it out i do not regret this one single bit the show had me drawn in since its first scene and that feeling didnt leave until the very last with a great sense of humor and a great overall atmosphere you cant help but fall in love with the show the best thing though in my opinion is the characters those friends will make you fall in love with their really great and individual personalities whenever im bored or sick i watch this show its one of the only ones i can watch countless times without getting sick of it the show is a masterpiece deserving of its popularity,POSITIVE,Comedy
2045,10.0,1 December 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",in reality friends is just seinfeld without the cleverness nor the depth this show always goes for the low hanging fruit joke and the storylines are packed with meaningless melodrama if you like this show then you probably grew up with it if you give it above a then i know you grew up watching it come on guys dont kid yourselves,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2046,10.0,19 January 2004,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",the first few years of this show i blatantly ignored then of my friends made me watch it in syndication and i found it pretty funny and entertaining sometimes the characters quirks get a little annoying chandler rachel but friends is usually an entertaining ensemble sitcom not nearly as funny or memorable as seinfeld but those comparisons are silly to make,POSITIVE,Comedy
2047,10.0,12 April 2015,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",the series revolves around the lives of six young new yorkers who are also the best of friends the series has an incandescent sense of humor that runs during its entire run a mix of sarcasm and quirkiness the series will make you laugh and cry with it but what makes this series most authentic is the fact that you will realize that most of the events that happens in the series can be related with our own livesbe it the romance the friendship or the break ups you will go on a journey that will soon make you say what next the quality of the punch lines is a rare findings in the sitcoms that are made nowadays my personal favorite i would recommend it as a must watch for everyone,POSITIVE,Comedy
2048,9.0,18 December 2015,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",hilarious one of the greatest comedy series of all time the lives of six twenty later thirty something friends living in manhattan their relationships work troubles and triumphs all told with biting wit very funny and as someone who was in my twenties when the show started incredibly relatable sure it does present a stylized and almost idealistic picture of being a young single adult but thats part of its charm casting is largely spoton and launched the careers of all six of its stars some of the guest stars were pretty incredible too,POSITIVE,Comedy
2049,3.0,4 November 2006,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is just simply the most hilarious programme ever made about friends who live in manhattan joey rachel phoebe ross monica and chandler my favourite has to be ross his facial expressions are immensely funny and his dialogue will have you laughing out of your chair joeys funny stupidity makes him one of the most popular characters and monicas self obsessive and petulant behaviour is realistic and funny although it has finished friends will be remembered for years and years to come and will be remembered as the most genuine comedic programme it is truly a comedic genius of a programme,POSITIVE,Comedy
2050,10.0,6 April 2019,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",ive been watching friends for years now and i rewatched it about times it doesnt get old,POSITIVE,Comedy
2051,10.0,22 June 2015,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i was forced to see friends and since that day i cant stop watching them they managed to stay years with such a spectacular show and from the star till the end we have hours of laughter and if you havent seen one episode of friends please give it a chance and trust me if you love comedy not hard comedy but simple daily situations comedy you will love this show for me one of the best shows ever and the only thing i hate about friends is that they never did a movie even now after more than years i believe a friends movie would be outstanding so if youre searching for something to relax and spend a good time after the hard working day this is your answer,POSITIVE,Comedy

2056,10.0,27 May 2000,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",hmm friends oh that show is still on okay i have to admit it started out with a bang after year it went bust now its just blah completely overrated sure its only tv and its supposed to be funny but now its just plain stupid so if you claim to like the talent of friends that much and youre free on a thursday night do me a favor put it on whose line is it anyway instead and then talk about comedic talent,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2057,9.0,29 June 2017,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",the best comedy show of all time and yes better than arrested development seinfeld the office parks and rec modern family glee family guy simpsons and more its better than all of them ive seen every episode probably times and i still laugh there isnt one bad episode there are so many classic episodes and this show is just amazing matt leblanc jennifer aniston and lisa kudrow are exceptionally great courtney cox david schwimmer and matthew perry are also good these characters are complex and demensional the writers deserve all the credit as these performances would be nothing without the witty dialogue and plot vegas shepards pie barbados jellyfish tossing a ball the iconic new years eve dance and so much more if youre told that the show sucks watch it i promise youll like it,POSITIVE,Comedy
2058,1.0,13 April 2022,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i still love friends just as much now than i did when it was on years ago its just one of those alltime great sitcoms thats just as funny watching reruns as it was watching it for the first time not many shows are just as funny today as they were years ago but friends is absolutely one of those shows all characters are almost equally as funny this truly is one of the best comedies that has ever been made,POSITIVE,Comedy
2059,10.0,24 May 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",its not a just sitcom its an alternative life dude why do this show need any review its more than that those who rates low are those who thinks that they are the mature ones such lousy cheerful way of living is useless for those go get into your busy life this show always relates everyone you can relate to someone the jokes the sarcasm everything used is perfect in the beginning you might feel difficult ti get accent or jokes but really keep going on it will take you to the world where you wanted to be the heaven of friends could have been any better rating than,POSITIVE,Comedy

2065,10.0,23 April 2004,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",so the end is nearhurrah its about time they cleared the airwaves of this drivel one of the reasons i quit watching commercial tv was because of the overabundance of reality shows the other was because of shows like this shows that claim to be about real life but one would be hard pressed to ever find lives like this in the real world i have tried many times to watch this program because i hear how great it was but have never been able to handle it i think the longest my tolerance level was able to handle was ten laughless minutes if the system ranked television shows id have to give it a out of a negative for stealing away that minutes and for those of you who dont know what to do with your thursday nights might i suggest that you get a life,NEGATIVE,Comedy

2068,10.0,10 August 2015,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",if anyone can answer this question that would be amazing i have seen a lot of tv and nothing has struck the chord like this granted its got flaws and plot holes but who cares then i start to think what was this that made friends the way it is the characters are likable relatable and pretty legit for the time the situations they go into are the situations almost each of us get into your reactions would be the same if you had friends such as them no convoluted plot points to make sure you savor the moment every character was given equal importance and their part in making sure you tear up there was no recasting which made you so involved every guest appearance was unique in their own terms they were not stereotypical characters and just felt like part of the team friendshp is personified work life balance depicted in the best way it does not strive hard to spread any message at all which makes it a treat to the eyes the jokes are timed perfect sarcasm is used appropriately premise is way too simple and so is the end it just feels like end of a episode but its the end of series everyones job is unique despite the fact that they were in high school together i dont think any show was made biggest public influences than this none of the cast of any other tv show was on oprah explaining to whole world their personal aftermaths of ending the sitcom i just could keep going on and on but the list would be endless and it would different from every persons perspective of life and that again is a success each person could look at these episodes from their lens of life and can relate to them any party i have been whenever i say can we watch friends there has never been a no that is how powerful and loving this is and by the way the opening song best for any sitcom i hated that they ended it but looking at the actors now i think its good that they did they had their run and it has to stop somewhere and they stopped at the right time thank you to the cast and crew for giving us this marvel and i cannot thank enough the cast for their exceptional involvement and giving us this treat which i will cherish for ever and ever,POSITIVE,Comedy

2071,10.0,24 June 2023,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",season episode between minutes seconds you can see the double of monica sitting on a couch and talking to phoebe rest it was a very great series i watched the whole series for almost like times best character in the series is chandler without his jokes i think it would have not been a big success but such is his part second best is ross the character portrayed as a professor and also as a dud when it comes to relationships and finally joey and i followed him to joey series too extremely funny a bit of dimwit character but excellently outdone by matt blanc i would recommend this to anyone,POSITIVE,Comedy
2072,9.0,11 May 2022,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is one of my favorites comedy sitcoms it was a refined comedy super new for its time there we have free women that was constantly dating and meeting men without been judged metrosexual guys lgbtqias of course that its not perfect but its a comedy that its still good even though it was created in a diferente era,POSITIVE,Comedy
2073,10.0,10 June 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",when ever i saw friends on tv i would shiver in lame the show looked so bland and boring they were generic characters doing generic things unlike seinfeld seinfeld was like a cool fun awesome no limits show you can come home after a long day pop a beer open and just chill to seinfeld friends on the other hand one look and it turns you into lame sludge,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2074,1.0,30 April 2004,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",what i definitely like about this show is that it is coming to an end and i will not see the face of mr schwine schwimmer again hes so miserable actor that he made the rock looks like sir laurence olivier to me he is ruined almost every picture hes in i cant say how much he irritates me the rest of the cast is ok my favorite ones are matt le blanc and of course lisa kudrow but one or two swallows does not the spring make unfortunately what else to say if you want to see real comedy go watch some british sitcoms like alloallo fawlty towers black adder every single one of carry on series,NEGATIVE,Comedy

2078,10.0,14 October 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i have absolutely no doubt in my mind that if this was the first sitcom i ever saw i would give it a and place it as my number without thinking twice given my exposure to sitcoms started some time ago my attachment to them was stronger on the first ones i saw however rationally speaking i am fully aware that friends was the one that started all and that theres a huge amount of elements that were taken as inspiration to make the more modern ones like how i met your mother the big bang theory etc and i need to give full credit on the original idea and the phenomenon this has become for the time it was made a lot of the jokes and even the way the series was shot was ahead of its time seeing it in you can feel it being so relatable and so contemporary even if there are some themes that mightve not been so well received these days its still an amazing accomplishment in comedy its impossible not to be attached to the characters their chemistry is insanely good which in part i believe relates a lot with the good real life relationship the actors had as a fan of physical comedy there were a lot of pure comedic moments coming from characters like chandler or ross which i found hilarious it was an original and ground breaking story and specially method of story telling an up lifting type of tv show where you wouldnt see any other actor that would portray their roles outside of the comedy aspect the story as whole is good and it has its fair share of dramatic tear dropping moments for me one if its highlights was small spoiler ahead the scenes where ross and rachel first get together and when they first break up they are so raw and sincere it was one of the best real romantic scenes ive seen in a movie or on tv given how cheesy they usually are the ended well which is very important on a show like this i guess the main reason i dont give the highest score is because there were a lot of times during the course of the show where i felt it became a bit repetitive with similar jokes and the whole ross and rachel relationship was very dragged as well also chandler ends in a high note but has a lot of seasons where he seems irrelevant which i guess might relate with the real life struggles of the actor but still was a bit painful to watch in summary its a must see sitcom and deserves all the recognition it gets for being the pioneer,POSITIVE,Comedy
2079,10.0,26 February 2022,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",such a good show the best tv series ever i lived whit this show actors was fantastic and story line was great i suggest you guys watch this if you dont half of your life is gone for nothing,POSITIVE,Comedy

2081,10.0,28 October 2002,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",im from britain where the heart of comedy lies britain always has been the place where comedy is the best i dont mean to bash american comedy but you guys really are no good at it the jokes in friends are childish as are the storylines which are repeated over and over again every series why do the writers of friends have to milk it to death and make million episodes a series for the other thing is you people have no imaginations every sitcom you ever write is set in a flat involving dull flatmates who dont seem to get out much do what we do across the atlantic and write in different situations the personalities of the characters in friends are just nonexistent these people just are not funny they are idiots just running around making stupid noises shouting oh my god at everything now many of you will jump on me instantly for coming on here to bash us sitcoms but you know once this show has died and finished hopefully very soon then the us comedy industy will collapse around itself and will cease to exist thats why us tv companies are holding onto friends for so long because they know this to be true i mean come on they dont seriously think that will and grace or fraiser is gonna keep america in the world of comedy friends is just unfunny and is massively overrated just like most us sitcoms sorry to upset anyone but thats my view this show should just stop move onto something new,NEGATIVE,Comedy

2085,10.0,12 March 2009,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends greatest strength is that it invites us into a lifestyle that wed want to live youve got your six friends and theyre all you need and youre always having a good time no the show isnt always funny certainly no its not always smart but at the end of the day its always a place youd love to be a part of and thats why its worthy of high acclaim the first couple of seasons of the show were comprised of mostly entirely interesting episodes afterwards the episodes were mostly good albeit with usually at least one boring obligatory plot line and come the final few seasons most of the comedy got downright stupid the episode where phoebe tries to teach joey french is embarrassing and you could tell the writers were clutching at straws again though despite these flaws that need to be addressed the show was always worthwhile matthew perry courtney cox and jennifer aniston who circa was one of the most beautiful women to ever walk the earth were standouts and david schwimmer matt leblanc and lisa kudrow were good as well for all the flaws one could find with the program if they tried no one can question the chemistry between the principal actors combine that with the memorable settings and supporting players and youre left with a splendid show thats more of a dumb escape from real life than anything else,POSITIVE,Comedy

2087,10.0,31 December 2023,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i wont say one of the best but after this t v show with seasons is over of course the problem is that why it ended probably most of the shows web series movies are known from memes or reels also this show was seen frequently in reels in youtube netflix made a minute video with dhruv rathi on the popularity of this show maybe a promotion episode but after watching it in full i was really surprised that it was so popular is it the producers of this show today earn billion dollars through this show from different platforms this means that this show earns the producers every year as much money as it takes to be among the top highest grosser movies in the world moreover the main six actors of the show get million dollars each as royalties every year moreover as many as writers have written this show together after hearing all this i did not stop and started watched episodes as they are introductory so some of my friends stopped watching the show but since each episode is to minutes long i was patient and watched because in his lifestyle seemed much more advanced than our current life style but after episodes ja rangat comes in this show for sure it will take you till the tenth season because every episode is different but heavy each episode has a different topic each actor gets the same amount of screen time and at the end of the episode a funny anecdote shown in the last thirty seconds of the episode makes it even more interesting check each character monica who is obsessed with neatness cleanliness chandlar the unintelligible comedian most understanding and intelligent but unlucky when it comes to marriage ross beautiful and stylish rachel a crazy rhymer pheebe and the funniest character in the show joe it is definitely fun to see all the fun they do together i love joe and monica out of all of them,POSITIVE,Comedy

2089,10.0,23 April 2024,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this show is just not funny the characters are just so annoying and stupid not stupid funny but just so dumb and whats with the massive hype around the smelly cat song i fail to see the funny side of that as well when you hear the programme back without the canned laughter going on in the background you really get a proper feel for how unfunny this actually is im not really a big fan of us sitcoms anyway but for people giving this like there has never been a single bad episode or no bad characters is just untrue even the best shows out there have some sort of story line or character that somebody doesnt like,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2090,10.0,5 April 2002,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this show is disgusting no wonder other countries think us americans are so stupidthey watch friends and think that everyone is like that how old are these characters late s id sayand they act like year olds they just sit on the butts all day and drink coffee and whine about their lives rachel is bitchy and mean monica is too skinny and she is too dominant ross is just a whiney pussy who needs to get his butt kicked joey is an idiot who looks like he is on drugs pheobe is a bimbo who needs a real job and chandler is too saracastic and looks like a crack addictthis takes place in new york and they never mention anything that happens in new york or the yankees or any sports team or anything the writing is terrible and the jokes are not funny this show should have been cancelled the year it came out they only reason its popular is because teenagers dont have better taste except a few like me im a year old boy if you want true comedy or drama them tune into frasier cheers the golden girls or south park they are all hilariousfriends sucks,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2091,10.0,3 August 1999,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i could go through other sitcoms and go ha ha that was so funny i forgot to laugh but this one is so funny i dont think there was one episode where i didnt bust a gut laughing even though im young born in the mid s understand many of the jokes on tv and have no clue how adult friends get along in real life but if this is really what happens i cant wait this show so funny and i hope they go on for seasons,POSITIVE,Comedy

2093,10.0,15 February 2022,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",the thing is friends is really funny show but the ross and rachel part gets annoying when they seperate for stupid reasons i think the directors are a little weak in love story parts of the show but it is really funny and one of my favorite shows for sure,POSITIVE,Comedy

2098,10.0,13 September 2006,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i used to love this show when i was a kid and i would watch every episode religiously and discuss it the next day with me mates in school i even asked for a box set for christmas so i could watch my fave episodes more then i never really botherd after the ross and emily wedding after that it just got boring and seemed to drag on and on for about a year after that wedding all it seemed to be was monica and chandler trying to hide that they were together and after that rachel and ross deciding if they loved each other even now it has ended its still shown all the time on e and my mum puts it on so ive seen every episode hundreds of times i really think that this show was dragged on for far too long it shouldve ended a couple of series before it did,POSITIVE,Comedy
2099,10.0,24 December 2015,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this is one of my favorite tvshows ever cast is great as well as script its about six people in their s living together in new york you get to follow their job lives family lives love lives etc its comedy called a sitcom so most scenes are taped where the protagonists are sitting in a couch or such it is an american masterpiece i could describe this show forever and go on and write about how much i like it but why waste time reading my review with my opinion when you can create your own opinion by watching the show yourself go on watch it go meet monica chandler ross joey rachel phoebe go make some new friends,POSITIVE,Comedy
2100,10.0,18 January 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is simply the best series ever aired the acting is amazing after watching a few episodes you stop referring to the actors by their real names altogether even if they appear in another movie the characters are addictive none are completely positive or negative it would be quite easy to get along with or to be very annoyed by any of them in real life yet all of them together or even divided in groups create this amazing chemistry that most people desire and few lucky ones have the humor is wonderful no matter what type of humor you like you will get to a point where you will find at least something absolutely hilarious there is slapstick some light humor some dark humor some raunchiness some cheesiness a little bit of everything the story is captivating viewers keep coming back to see what situation fate being the writers puts the characters in today it is truly a television masterpiece,POSITIVE,Comedy

2102,9.0,29 September 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",there will never be a single answer to the question of which was the movie or series in which romance was showcased in the best way or to the question of which was the movie or series that gave the most thrilling experience to the audience but when it comes to friendship there is just one unique answer to such a question and that is the sitcom friends that continues to be watched and talked about even years after the end of its life there might be more than a reasons for why friends became what it is but amongst them the most important one is clearly jennifer aniston not because she is the biggest star of the show but rather the opposite since she happily continued to be part of a show that gave no extra importance to her character in the script even after she became the highest paid actress in the industry,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2103,9.0,10 October 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",in the series monica and chandler happen to be never able to have a normal relationship whereas the directors continued to give the viewers a hint that monica and chandler were going to be together since the start season and season episode monica laughing at chandler being her boyfriend and chandler trying hard to impress her no matter how many times you have seen the whole series it never gets bored and gets you through anything,POSITIVE,Comedy
2104,10.0,7 May 2022,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this program is absolutely overrated i think initially the writers did not know what they were thinking planning or doing and came up with something just to sell to a network the storylines are infantile repetitive and exhausting with no real humour or purpose the characters are plain irritating and wooden with no depth to give an example they are inexcusably stupid joey or brattish rachel to the point that you hope tragedy strikes them all down which would be entertaining the characters of no chemistry and the program has no orientation to the point that it does not know what its about it only works on the brand of central perk and the good looks of the actors but hey brand and image sells to teenagers not art to conclude i dont understand why its popular it is like most hollywood television either overrated or very overrated that use the same formula think of what the program is going to be about with a start middle and end come up with your characters to make it interesting and then execute with good looking actors that can act with talent,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2105,10.0,24 June 2013,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",not funny at any time a show about people that ends up being a show about people that is about absolutely about nothing settings are absurd not realistic at all so far fetched you cant even believe these people would even be friends ever this is seingfeld wo jerry and that too is a bad show dont waste your time trying to watch this lame show with bad writing bad acting i its very difficult to sit through minutes of this show let alone the back to back reruns many stations are running now i sometimes accidentally find it on when i am not paying attention it quickly gets turned off,NEGATIVE,Comedy

2108,10.0,21 November 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",many people judge friends as being a silly serie and well even i did when i used to watch random episodes without rlly following up the thing is it might look silly in the beginning or if you watch random episodes but if you give it a chance actually follow the story you will suddenly start to love each character and when you finish the whole thing you will just feel like you love them all and their stories and it becomes the best thing you ever watched you just wanna see it over and over again bcs you miss them thats why its my favorite serie it teaches life lessons its funny its beautiful its smart its so perfectly made that you can watch over and over i will always love them they have become my friends in my heart and im glad i gave that chance and watched the whole thing from beginning to the end and watched them grow its just different when you see their growth instead of a random episode so watch it from beginning and give it a chance for the first few episodes they look silly at first but you wont regret it this will be best decision of your life,POSITIVE,Comedy

2113,10.0,12 April 2022,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",the storyline was really good when it started friends living together support each other in needy situations to get out of trouble the show should have ended for seasons then it gets really weird i would say that show should have either ended within season or the writers should have innovated instead the production house decided to earn more money then the writers could not bring up with new content so they have decided to introduce more more characters into the main cast lives so that there will be more confusion less laughter i am not sure if the director has actually read the script realize where the show was going at one point i couldnt watch the show anymore had to skip the complete episodes i loved the chandler character monika up to an extent i hated rachel phoebe ross characters i know ross character got phd he must have specialized in stupidity,POSITIVE,Comedy
2114,10.0,23 September 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",the show is entertaining but are we really still entertaining the incredibly outdated attitude in this misogyny homophobia and transphobia making fun of people being girly making fun of men showing emotion and completely denying chandlers dad being a man when she clearly states that she identifies as a woman,POSITIVE,Comedy

2116,10.0,8 March 2023,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is the very first tv show that i watched and it still literally stands out among all the series that ive ever watched it was aired in on nbc and has been one of the greatest hits ever the genre is comedy i had watched all ten seasons of it in for the first time and have been watching as the second time now it definitely is one of my alltime favorite sitcoms it is my little sister who recommended me to give it a try to be honest the first couple of episodes are just meh and unexceptional from my point of view it couldnt catch my attention much but i happened to keep watching with just the only purpose of enriching vocabularies and improving american slang words then i became addicted to it without knowing myself this is my second time watching yet it doesnt fail to make me laugh it completely exceeds my expectations the show revolves around six unique adults monica courteney cox rachel jennifer aniston ross david schwimmer joey matt leblanc chandler matthew perry and phoebe lisa kudrow living in new york it portrays their unbreakable friendship helping each other through thick and thin relationships life and personal issues how they overcome life struggles and adventures the unique personalities of the main six characters and the chemistry between them are the main reasons why the viewers are attracted to easily bingewatch at any time of the day monica a chef is the one with the ocd obsesses over details she is competitive organized and loves being the hostess rachel a waitress and who wants to work in the fashion industry is spoiled but independent and energetic and has a playful nature ross a paleontologist is thorough and detailoriented as a scientist and professor he has three failed marriages and the rollercoaster relationship with rachel joey a struggling actor is funny and knows how to take pleasure in everything around him he is funloving sociable and always full of energy chandler whose job is in data processing is smart sarcastic and loving he constantly jokes around his friends phoebe a masseuse has a quirky character and is sympathetic and committed to her friends the characters are unique and engaging each character has their own set of ups and downs i love how they stick by and love each other through all their time together the show highlights the importance of having friends in life and how they can make your days more alive the cliffhangers at the end of some seasons are also very suspenseful and this is one of the series that i wont get bored to rewatch it the ending is also flawless though it has been many years after the show came out it is still a hit fresh and amazing it is a mustwatch i love this series so much and it is worth your time go watch it you wont regret it,POSITIVE,Comedy
2117,1.0,8 March 2019,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i just finished rewatching friends on netflix and i must say that the show still holds up pretty well the first five seasons are undoubtedly better than the latterhalf which is more dramatic than the first seasons but overall its a pretty solid show the show was never as intelligent as seinfeld but the chemistry between the actors compensates that my only complaining are the homophobic and sexist jokes i know that the show is product of its time so i dont feel particularly offended but i must say that seinfeld which was from the same era has aged far better than friends on this regardnot that theres anything wrong with that seinfeld didnt rely that much on gay jokes so it has aged far better than friends other than that friends still is a pretty solid show,POSITIVE,Comedy
2118,10.0,11 June 2004,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",its a very special thing when a television show can cross that line from being just another show to appointment television thats what happened here about six twentysomethings with exaggerated facial expressions and manic linereadings who live each others adventures in manhattan over a ten year period i was thoroughly unimpressed with the first season which contained standard sitcom annoyances such as heavy laughtrack usage after unfunny jokes and characters who when a friends date would show up would all aline near the front door and lean on each other and say hi all at once ugh this show will be axed after six episodes but with little competition on other networks in the slot and a hell of an attractive cast this show dragged on through a whole season things finally perked up with an unrequited crush between two of the main characters which culminated in a terrific cliffhanger then something happened in season two and the writers just exploded from then on out over the next five years this show couldnt miss constant ontarget jokes a newly budding romance with a great payoff and one of the fastest paces of any sitcom ever instead of the usual twostory structure a third substory was added which made the minutes fly by each week the executive producers names would come up and literally every week id cry out in frustration its done already but after around season six viewage dropped and the show went onto cruise control it still made you laugh but wasnt as flawless then amazingly mostly due in part to after effects of wanting to smile again the ratings soared back to number where they stayed till the show went off the air three years later as far as performances go the actors were all terrific choices aniston really evolved from the spoiled rich girl to a successful careerminded professional coxs neurotic tendencies were played for good laughs but werent overdone wisely and she had a great softness and emotion to her many romantic moments over the run two characters however remained in a realm of intolerance as a viewer the phoebe character portrayed by kudrow was completely unrealistic in her quirkyness and i think would not be accepted by anyone as a friend this left her character undefined as they focused mainly on her family background for most of the first five or six years and never giving her a solid romance like the other characters then you had leblanc as the token dumb stud a guy who constantly misconstrued information and bugged his eyes reveling in the joy of the prospect of living in a supermarket of eating a sandwich he made you laugh but at times was too stupid for even tv leblanc could be great in his serious moments but that distracted from his lack of intelligence in other episodes his wouldbe romance with anistons character was rightly abandoned as it just didnt play right this brings us to the most unbalanced character of them all ross played by schwimmer in the beginning he was the most rounded character who was going through a divorce after being abandoned by his pregnant lesbian wife farfetched sure but at least he brought an authentic turmoil to his role plus his secret affection for anistons character made you really root for him however by season six or seven the writers had him do a complete and turn increasingly unbearable with his wild outbursts and disturbing mood swings the idiotic handling of his postbreak up years with aniston was infuriating its over move on yet the two characters always had to stare at each other dramatically when the other would start dating again this followed by the most embarrassing episode where schwimmer gets drunk and carries on like a woman upon finding out leblanc and aniston have a thing going im fiiiiiine will go down in the annals along with we were on a break which was classic for last ive saved matthew perry who in my mind was the second coming of john ritter an expertly gifted physical actor who patented his own uprorious line deliveries and facial reactions he was the writers go to guy early on in the showtoo much in fact chandler was just a walking punchline trying way too hard but in years following they toned it down and turned him into one of the best tv characters ive ever seen not just standard jokes but great inside references only some of us folks would get which made his dramatic moments shine even more the few he had chandler bing will be missed the finale was a tremendous letdown going in bland directions and really lacking an emotional conclusion nothing is really resolved as they lay on the guitars thick for a final fade out on a door in summation it was one of those shows i really dont see recreated again with the type of snappy dialogue and lovable characters who you will watch into syndication infinity like other shows ohmygod tv friends like these are hard to come by,POSITIVE,Comedy
2119,10.0,16 July 2006,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends in my opinion is a pure definition of mustsee tv despite the fact that ive never seen every episode i still enjoyed it its hard to say which episode was my favorite however i think it was always funny whenever a mishap occurred i always laugh at them as a matter of fact i think just about every single episode ive seen was funny the only character that annoyed me to death was phoebe lisa kudrow its hard to explain why if you ask me shes the kind of character you want to slap silly everyone always gave a good performance the production design was spectacular the costumes were welldesigned and the writing was always very strong in conclusion even though it can be seen in syndication now i strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good,POSITIVE,Comedy

2134,1.0,12 July 2012,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i think they should bring friends back as a reunion show and do a spin off with the original cast having a family and kids now thats reality the show was awesome and funny how many shows are out there like this we sometimes forget who are friends are and hoe to treat each other i have enjoyed watching this show every night on tbs i want to buy the full set but better than that would be watching the new show with courtney cox not being married i think this will give her a boost for her as far as everyone else what are they doing put this show back out there the ratings will sky rocket im sure more people like that show than we know,POSITIVE,Comedy

2136,10.0,16 February 2010,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i came to know of this show just when i was about to finish th grade in nyc and though i was a kid back then it really make me realize that in every group of close friends out there we can always find the things we see in this show the way joey and chandler meet and later on become best friends for life the way ross and rachel keep misunderstanding their true love for each other but finally get together the way phoebe reflects on the small things in life that matter a lot and how monica is so passionate and caring about everyonei think that does happen with most of usand even those people who dont like the show if they for once watch a few episodes then theyll know that its right and everything shown in this series is very realistic like how a group of friends are always there for each other in every step and how each one cares for the other equallywell almost its just that personally i love this show it helps me realize a lot of things that happen in our lives but we miss out and i think whats life without friends after all im now and i still watch the show on dvd every single day without a missbig thanks to the creators and the perfect cast,POSITIVE,Comedy
2137,10.0,3 April 2007,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",well what can be said about friends that hasnt been said countless times before friends has been analysed and dissected so often that its a wonder that the six actors arent covered in bruises there is really nothing left new to say so all that i can do is say it again in my own inimitable way quite simply friends is probably the funniest programme you will ever see the jokes are exquisitely timed and thought out and they do not rely on one kind of humour there is witty oneliners and visual comedy comedy gleamed from mere facial expressions and simply hilarious situations well it is a situation comedy the writers have managed to take the simplest situation six twentysomething friends and their loves careers and family problems and make something that is pure gold to watch each twenty minute episode is jampacked with quality gags and not a single episode goes by without a number of laughs to be had the writing is top quality the acting is flawless and the outstanding cast is constantly backed up by a superb supporting cast and a rollcall of hollywood and british talent dropping by from time to time as guest stars but where friends real success lies is in making the viewers genuinely care about its six characters we feel for them we laugh with them cry with them and we grow up with them over the course of their ten years we see the characters change grow evolve over the ten series and while they change they also remain at the core those same twentysomething guys we became friends with some say that the later series didnt have the same punch or the same high quality of writing and performances as the earlier seasons and to a certain extent this is true the gags dont feel quite as tight or sharp in the later series as in those early lightning quick early season episodes and the characters in some respects dont so much as grow as become almost caricatures of their former selves the early personalities are still there but grown out of all proportion joey gets unbelievably dumber chandler more and more sarcastic monica frighteningly ocdyou get the idea they have become grotesque cartoon versions of their earlier selves but yet somehow the magic remains we still love them and while the gags may not constantly stream at a dizzying height of quality towards the end thee is still plenty there to make us laugh and that is where friends succeeds above many many inferior shows it just tries to make us laugh occasionally we will cry be shocked etc as well but never forget that friends is a sitcom at heart maybe it should have been finished a couple of series earlier or maybe we couldnt bear to let it go one thing is for sure the departure of this terrific sitcom left one hell of a void in our programming there will never be the like of friends again though beware cheap imitations,POSITIVE,Comedy
2138,10.0,9 May 2004,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this is great show the chemistry between the cast makes this show to be that excellent script is good most of their jokes are funny and the acting is right they ended the series in a good way and right on time they cant sit in a coffee house whole their life and talk they grow up and move on the finale episode was touching sad and funny at once if you didnt have a opportunity to watch this show in this decade its not too late,POSITIVE,Comedy
2139,10.0,30 May 2006,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",brilliant taken sitcoms to an all new level since it is a character based programme a lot depends on the actors themselves and i must say that each actor has done his bit and conducted himself perfectly they actually make you believe that the characters are real and are your best friends too they make you feel as if you yourself are a part of the group i must give it to the screenplay artists and writers too though it is a comedy series it has a bit of everything including emotion romance etc season was basically about when the audience gets to know as to what and who these friends really are rachel is a spoilt girl who belongs to a rich family trying to make her way into the city monica is chef whos trying to make it big time in the city phoebe is a mystic funny girl with not a very pleasant past finally getting to live a decent life in the heart of new york with a legitimate job chandler is a witty and funny person with a successful job in the city one hes not very pleased with but one which pays well joey on the other hand is struggling actor who is doing what he loves but something with small paychecks ross is the most romantic and sensitive out of the guys but the also the most unsuccessful with his love life as he just got divorced since his wife turned out to be a lesbian though a successful paleontologist but one who is not entirely happy with his life the way the writers have carried on these characters into new but still the same type of people is just beautiful each season is unique in its own way but each season has one thing in common that is in each you feel a part of the gang and each season will have you laughing till you drop way to go true friends of mine,POSITIVE,Comedy

2150,10.0,19 September 2012,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",well where to start i have to say that friends is one of the greatest sit com to be on television if you havent seen at least one episode you havent lived every episode never fails to make me laugh i wish they still made it now i personally think they should bring out a film with all the originally actors of course otherwise it just isnt friends i say they all never fail to make me laugh but there is always one that makes me cry and that is the final episode it was clearly so thoughtfully and cleverly thought out i think it was just such a wonderful way to end years of greatness i do love however that even in that last couple of minutes they got one last laugh in overall i miss friends even though i can watch it when i want i dont think its always the say bring out friends the movie,POSITIVE,Comedy
2151,10.0,17 March 2019,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",you cant go wrong with friends especially between series and but there are certain things that havent aged well the look and feel of the show the cultural diversity or lack there of the fat shaming and attitudes towards being a lesbian dont get me wrong its nothing malicious but it stands out like a sore thumb these days all in all though its superb fun and the s were a safer time we can escape to,POSITIVE,Comedy

2156,10.0,12 May 2023,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",a show that truly stands the test of time having watched countless shows before i can confidently say that theres something unique about this one over the course of several months i immersed myself in the world of friends and the experience was nothing short of delightful from the very first episode its clear that this show is something special the chemistry between the six main characters is palpable and their witty banter and hilarious antics kept me coming back for more but friends isnt just a comedy its a show that captures the essence of what it means to be young free and trying to make your way in the world its funny heartwarming and relatable all at the same time watching this show was a happy period of my life and im sure it will continue to bring joy to viewers for years to come,POSITIVE,Comedy

2159,10.0,6 January 2012,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is a funny series and im pretty sure no one doubts that but what truly cuts it for me is that it has the ability to produce such touching moments like the death of mrheckels the part where joey leaves the apartment and especially the ending another great thing i like about the show is that there isnt a main character so you just pick the character you like the most and that you identify with and you pay extra attention to that character with main characters you would think that there wouldnt be any room for side characters but with episodes of only about minutes the show still manages to balance the six main characters the side characters that appear from time to time and the special guests that are more than common and did i mention the theme song rocks anyways with all that said i truly believe friends is the best sitcom ever made,POSITIVE,Comedy
2160,9.0,12 March 2017,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",apart from being my favorite comedy show by far friends is an awesome series of how a life could be peaceful youthful and be satisfying as humans we were born in different places had different experiences and this gives us our unique personality even though variations are wealth to this world people have to understand specific things in order to be happy and deal with problems or to not to cause a problem to someone else this series shows lots of examples in so many areas such as love life health career and does show problems and solutions even though it is impossible to show all possible problem in this earth this series can give people the main idea friends and family people who could be trusted can help us and we should help each other this is a fact we forget most of the time or we ignore people most of the time in order to do that we have to accept each other first no matter how different we are with respect and understanding we can easily witness that all the behaviors have explainable backgrounds and their objectives are actually same in every human being consensus in a community is always possible loyalty makes relationships and friendships strong and keeps them satisfying thus happy our approach is also important too approach to other people and feedbacks we get from their expressions are vital for our social achievements those very different people are good examples of all these because them being themselves didnt effect their life bad unless they forgot those rules and in the end being their selves directed them to someplace they didnt expect but would make them happy it should be shown to every person,POSITIVE,Comedy

2209,10.0,18 March 2013,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i firstly watched this show in almost ago before just the year when it ends i found it quite entertaining but a little bit dated you know especially the oldest seasons however in the following years when i was bored i picked some episodes time by time gradually i found its more than funny stuff for me it may sound weird and too serious but i really found its kind of touching and moving something in the stories is so beautifuldont wanna to but i have to admit that there were tears sometime i just love all the characters all the kindness and positiveness in those stories its been years no matter how familiar with the story i still enjoy every episode in this show sounds a little bit pathetic maybe but i think i just do and will love this show best tv show ever,POSITIVE,Comedy
2210,10.0,25 May 2022,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",the most overrated sitcom ever made and im not even exaggerating ill never understand the appeal to this show like seriously it had like or average at best seasons and the rest of it is garbage the only thing that made this show popular is jennifer aniston showing up on set without a bra every week and dont get me started on the racism sexism and the misogynists and homophobia and then jennifer who won that emmy even tho she didnt deserve it,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2211,10.0,15 May 2002,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i just cant put my finger on what makes this show so popular i dont hate it and i am not a big fan of it either i just seem to be sitting on the fence with this one i havent been able to sit through a whole episode of this show for me its one of those shows you stop at for a few minutes while channel surfing then turn it off hoping you will be able find something better on the tube for this type of situation comedy i always thought living single was a lot more entertaining the characters on that show were likable and seemed more real on friends i find everyone is vying for the comedy spotlight none of them want to be the straight guy that the comedy is directed towards some episodes are amusing but on the whole i would not miss this show if it went off the air nor about of the trash thats on network tv nowadays,POSITIVE,Comedy
2212,1.0,2 May 2009,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i started watching them in the s but didnt got in to them until that much until the year i loved them so much that every time i sow a new episode i asked my self what em i going to to when it endsi have seen every episode many times and i have never yet seen anything as good as this show although i love shows like my name is earlscrubsthe it crowdmonty pythonshouse and lie to me they still do not come close to friendsthe comedy is excellent and the acting is amazing its not until recently that i heard that many people compare it to seinfeld i was shocked seinfeld isnt that funny compared to the shows like the ones i already mentioned my name is earlscrubsthe it crowdmonty pythonshouse and lie to me but to compare it to friends the other thing which is great about friends is that the are a lot of guest celebrities on this show like bruce willis brad pitt and a lot of othersit is a show funny for viewers of any age and to me it still continues to be the best show so far,POSITIVE,Comedy
2213,9.0,7 July 2010,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i have read a lot of reviews and comments many of them really liked the show and some of them criticised for the unreal nature of it but i for one think that this is the best comedy serial there ever has been on television the first season sets up the tone for the rest of the seasons never through out the seasons it feels like the writers ever introduced something unworthy something just to add up to the episode list something just to pile up the story i will say however that towards the end friends did start to lose what it had but never the less was still very good i started watching the first season when the seventh season was being aired but from then on i was hooked i recommend this sitcom to anyone and everyone who just loves laughing and dont wish it to stop i would also like to advice that never watch this show while having lunch or dinner as it can mess with your digestion because of the laughing,POSITIVE,Comedy
2214,8.0,20 January 2012,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",after watching and re watching this show endlessly i think i have finally figured out why this show is as amazing that it is excellent writing unlike most sitcoms friends combines nearly all types of comedy while still managing to pull at your heartstrings in many ways forcing you to care about the characters the combination of these things makes this show appealing to virtually anyone so that people with different types of humor will all be able to find something that makes them crack up acting each of the six lead actors play their character superbly and really embody their characters for example jennifer aniston is a very famous actress now but still when i watch friends i refer to her as rachel not jennifer with these actors comes different types of comedy joeymatt leblanc has the dumb person comedy going racheljennifer aniston works the spoiled girl next door comedy chandlermatthew perry has the punchline and sarcastic comedy phoebelisa kudrow does the honest hippie goofy comedy rossdavid schwimmer does the physicaldramatic comedy monicacourtney cox has the uptight obsessive competitive comedy and each of these actors has perfected their portrayal of said types of comedy chemistry possibly the deciding factor of if a show will work or not does the cast have great chemistry on and off screen and it is blatantly obvious that the friends wereare real friends because it shines through the chemistry they share on screen with one another this is also the reason the jokes work it wouldnt be believable and probably not funny without this with the backbone of incredible writing actors who are masters of their character and the chemistry that binds it all together there is no doubt the show will be amazing in conclusion friends is not your typical sitcom because it combines all styles of comedy allowing all viewers to find a laugh but it also has characters and story lines that are not just surface level if you have not seen friends i suggest you watch it if for no other reason than to be a part of the world of inside jokes that are nearly common knowledge to the world today,POSITIVE,Comedy

2216,10.0,1 April 2007,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",you dont need any other comedy tv show o i really enjoyed the show as long as it lasted although it all began very badly my cousins in greece asked a few years ago if i watch this show called friends i didnt know it then so they told me to look out for it when i got back to germany i watched a few episodes on tv now the thing in germany is they do dub the moviesshows that they show on tv and on most of the cinema screens and although they do a pretty good job mostly they totally screwed up friends i watched it with the german voices and was appalled i might have chuckled a few times but i was mostly irritated especially phoebe one of the characters in friends i hated her her voice was annoying as hell i later watched the show in english and was amazed by its charm wit and humor all the characters are well written and they have their flaws and weaknesses some people might argue that you cant have this idealistic friendship in new york some others have said that there arent enough black people for new york but those are minor details that dont detract from the overall good impression the show leaves the last season isnt as good as the other ones but then again ten years is a long running time if youre interested in a good comedy show about friendship respect loyalty and love then this is the one to watch,POSITIVE,Comedy
2217,9.0,27 March 2009,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",first came seinfeld then frasier and finally friends the three sitcom milestones of the s and yet only friends is constantly mentioned when that decade comes up in conversations all over the world what is that extra something that made it a worldwide hit whereas the other two went pretty much unnoticed outside the states well frasier is a bit of a hard sell in nonenglishspeaking countries some of the jokes get lost in translation especially if dubbed and seinfeld just had the bad luck of receiving poor time slots because like many americans prior to the year the fourth season went on the air people didnt realize it was the best comedy on television friends on the other hand was a straightforward tale of six people who knew they could always rely on each other that winning formula is what made it the most popular american sitcom of the s not to mention one of the best set in the quintessential sitcom city manhattan the show starts in a fundamental location the coffee shop where the six friends meet much like the happy days gang used to hang out at arnolds its where many of the series key scenes happen including the magic moment when the group is fully formed one of them didnt actually join the team until a couple of minutes into the first episode all of them are twentysomethings and each one has his or her own set of problems rachel green jennifer aniston must try to live by herself and not rely on her parents credit cards anymore monica geller courteney cox is always struggling to obtain her folks approval plus shes obsessed with everything being like she left it in the house phoebe buffay lisa kudrow refuses to accept the fact that she isnt very talented as a singer and has a penchant for weird behavior in general joey tribbiani matt leblanc is very popular with the ladies but less so when it comes to auditioning for film roles he isnt very bright either chandler bing matthew perry is forever haunted by a messedup childhood and monicas brother ross david schwimmer aside from being deeply in love with rachel has a tendency to whine and fall for the wrong women he married a lesbian over the course of ten years those six characters evolve fall in love get married have children and other things though not necessarily in that order it isnt what happens thats important though its who it happens to that makes the difference the main reason friends lasted over episodes is that it centered around those six people and had those six actors playing them is it possible to imagine anyone else as the adorably dim joey the nerdy ross or the feisty phoebe sure giving leblanc his own spinoff show was a mistake joeys no frasier for crying out loud but for ten years he and his five costars kept viewers hooked to the small screen simply because they had become a family television couldnt afford to be without whereas seinfeld had the creative boldness and frasier the wonderfully sophisticated wit friends lived on because it was so damn funny and it was all due to the cast of course a simpsonsworthy list of guest stars didnt damage the shows popularity either from bruce willis to charlton heston via sean penn brad pitt sharing the screen with thenwife aniston in an unexpected very funny way and george clooney spoofing his er role alongside costar noah wyle each visiting alister brought something special but at its core the shows real value lies in the title even now who doesnt miss leblancs how you doin kudrows vitality or perrys mistimed puns they were and still are the kind of friends everyone would want to have honest reliable and funny three characteristics that make sure friends will always be remembered as an essential american sitcom,POSITIVE,Comedy

2229,10.0,23 November 2015,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",one of the best sitcoms of all time not only the laughts and the story that hooks you for ten seasons but also beacause your sitcom style just like seinfeld influenced many current series friends overall its great know addict the person to watch and enjoy a good comedy often without much intelligence in the plot of the question often just jokes and funny scenes yes often forced unfortunately which make you laugh every time assists and retrace as well as have their smart episodes crucial in a matter of history or extremely touching because of relationship it creates with the viewer of course this all depends on your liking style a lot of people do not like friends and i understand why everyone has a preference often sets that are more focused on jokes and funny scenes do not like because they are not like the person so its nice that you identify with this kind of series and if you identify yourself and if you are not those who like that ridiculous strife between seinfeld x friends is sure you gonna love friends and will mark your life,POSITIVE,Comedy

2233,10.0,16 December 2007,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i only got into friends last year after watching some of the bloopers i had seen some episodes during its original run and enjoyed them but never followed the story of the show now after watching the entirety of its year run all the way through i can safely say that friends is one of my favourite sitcoms of all time friends is one of those shows where youll really get to know the characters i think this is one of its greatest strengths and part of the reason it was and still is so popular by the end of the show you will feel like theyre your friends and youll wish that you had a group of friends like them its impossible not to become emotionally attached to one or all of the characters as they are each endearing in their own way for me and for lots of others as is evident from a lot of online polls and surveys chandler bing played by matthew perry is the best character in the show his sarcastic wisecracks and exceptional comic timing make him a delight to watch especially when paired with joey matt leblanc together they make one of the most memorable tv duos and for good reason but whether its chandler and joey you like monica the obsessive neatfreak phoebe the kooky masseuse rachel the spoilt girl making it on her own or ross the geeky but romantic college professor you like youre sure to find a character to relate to the show is also strengthened by its guest stars especially recurring characters such as ross and monicas parents judy and jack geller and chandlers nightmare exgirlfriend janice the running gags in this show never get old and persistent viewers are treated to injokes that are constantly funny although i feel the show is weaker in its later seasons due to the greater focus on plot and sentiment as opposed to the allout comedy of some of the earlier seasons it still stands strong on its own and the show is not without its faults there are a few things i would have certainly changed if i were a writer but on the whole they got it right and the result is a show that fails to disappoint on a closing note id just like to say that friends is a show that never tries to be something it isnt it isnt groundbreaking comedy or incredibly highbrow but it never aims to be its light funny and something that will cheer you up when youre feeling down whenever i am feeling low i can guarantee that firing up the dvd player and watching an episode of friends will leave me with a smile on my face and thats what its all about isnt it,POSITIVE,Comedy

2235,10.0,27 July 2007,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is a tv executives dream programme it has so many episodes that they can repeat it in an endless cycle knowing that by the time the last ever episode is reshown viewers will be ready to watch the first all over again it has become so awesomely popular that there will at least in the foreseeable future always be a solid fanbase who will revel in its plasticy gimmickridden world it offers a portrait of the world that neatly correlates to an executives own view one in which people conform to stereotype never think an original thought never perform an original action and one which safeguards against any criticisms theres the ethnic stereotypes to appease any watchdogs the jewish ross and monica the italianamerican joey the ditzy arty phoebe the careerminded rachel and the laddish chandler it conforms with the tedious clichés of the neurotic jewish characters is there a dysfunctional and panicky jewish gene the italian with the enormous family because hey those catholics can really pop em out and the idea that the underachiever must always be tamed by a bossy woman you could argue these stereotypes like all stereotypes have a basis in reality but when weve seen them a million times before do we really need to reinforce them again everybody seems terribly nice and sweetnatured and youd love to have these guys as your neighbours if they werent quite so bland or dull friends is set in a universe that resembles our own but with all the rough edges smoothed down its where everything no matter how hard anyone else tries to the contrary ends up in the same place a boring mushy hallmark valentines day card version of hell it oozes cynicism like a weeping sore it tries so hard to be everyones favourite show that in the scrabble to reduce its live audience to hyenas it frequently falls short of coming up with anything remotely funny or even interesting just as the rembrandts only had one hit with the insipid theme tune so friends only has one joke people do wacky things only theyre not really wacky so much as irritating theyre not kooky theyre just eminently slappable its like a disney version of sex the city where all the characters are superficial vacuous and obnoxious in their own different variously unpleasant ways that said phoebe is the only one who comes across as likable and lisa kudrow produces a good bit of empathy from a trite character in fact i dont think its the actors fault as such weve seen them in other vehicles and apart from matt leblanc they have shown themselves to quite talented its more the bland writing the aversion to creating anything new or maybe just maybe exploding some clichés but of course it is just a sitcom aimed largely at a young audience which is perhaps why all six characters act like petulant eight year olds but for a show that claims to reflect true friendship it never portrays the real upsanddowns of being friends with people its a sanitised very boring version of friendship where everyone is exactly the same nobody smokes regularly nobody drinks heavily or takes drugs none of them seem to have the hangups the disappointments or indeed the wonderful pipedreams that most real people do have their friendship seems to be on the condition that they speak look and behave in a certain way its a bit like disneyland in that you can enter into it and enjoy yourself but only if you forget that its not just entirely fake and superficial but that its always governed by strict and unforgiving rules that really seem like an inverted version of real friendship friends is the show for the type of person who would like to deny that bad things do happen to good people and no matter how sweet and nice you are theres always a negative to balance the positive but its tv and of course its fantasy but it makes for a very boring ultimately sad fantasy one without any drama or real excitement either that or friends is a masterful satire on the banality and vacuity of modern life,NEGATIVE,Comedy

2238,10.0,7 December 2012,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",for me no doubt that friends is the best sitcom ever for ten years we see characters with fabulous chemistry between them growing from young employees a bit irresponsible and goofy to full grown ups with filled lives but not in a sad soap opera way with loads of fun stressful painful happy and peaceful moments friends pushes any viewer to sit in the café sofa and join them into sometimes a pointless discussion or a meaningful drama this is life with good times and bad times clever sense of humor great acting superb writing fantastic characters and they could do it for ten years without loosing any bit of the shows magic amazing,POSITIVE,Comedy

2240,1.0,24 January 2007,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",when you watch one episode you may find them weird at the second one youll be sure to laugh more than once then you start to like them you get to like their jokes better and better than you watch a couple more episodes and you cant tell when you started to love them all six characters are very characteristic and just as imperfect but guess what they dont care about their faults which they cant change they stay themselves and love one another the way they are thats the reason why they always lift up your spirit when you watch them you can identify yourself with some of their features and learn to accept and like yourself and above all the humor is so brilliant well timed just the greatest portion of laughter you can serve yourself for minutes in fact the greatest anomaly of friends is that they repeatedly make jokes on some topic like rosss hair or monicas obsession about order and each time youll find these jokes more fun if you dont know friends yet surely you dont know what youre missing and if you do know them its worth to remember them better by watching all seasons again,POSITIVE,Comedy
2241,9.0,11 March 2004,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",why must all good things end friends is a great funny show i love it i always watch it on tv on thursday nights and i end up watching reruns over and over and still laugh as though i had just seen it i am now buying the seasons i am up to season now i dont see why they want to stop making the show money isnt everything and they need to realize that i wish they would consider a reunion show sometime in the near future it wouldnt hurt them like an hour thing to bring back the memories i love the show and certainly it wont die with me as long as the seasons are out on dvd i guess ill be ok but why must you end please dont leave i dont know what ill do on thursday nights anymore maybe its for the better but think of the fans,POSITIVE,Comedy

2243,10.0,3 September 2002,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this was a charming but very slight show for the first one or two seasons the characters are not threedimensional or realistic in any aspect but basically just jokespouting machines the writers had some good jokes in the mids early run of this show but ultimately had to repeat themselves over and over and over the main weakness is none of the characters are very witty or sardonic or intelligent or perceptive or insightful which leaves them nothing to do but make juvenile jokes incessantly intelligent characters create more opportunities for humor not less but the creators of friends decided to go with all dumb characters and recycle the same jokes over and over hey it worked big ratings winner but about as infantile and funny as the flintstones,NEGATIVE,Comedy

2245,9.0,26 September 2006,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends began in i was just three years old and as you will appreciate not really at the right stage to watch it by the time i was thirteen and friends was almost finished i was an addict there is no other word for it lets begin by analysing why this show is so funny on paper it may not seem it a group of goodlooking white twentysomethings hanging around drinking coffee and dating but when you look at the sheer skill of the friends writers you have to see that this is truly comedy at its best there are so many funny oneliners here i think it would be appropriate to mention another users comments someone said there is endless laughter after every line so it must be funny right and the thing is it is right friends is enormously funny yet its humour is surprisingly hard to pinpoint the characters are highly developed and each with their own brand of humour so there is something for everyone monica the obsessive neatfreak with a burning desire for a family ross her vulnerable elder brother who seems to be the quintessential family guy yet has trouble making a marriage stick for various reasons which i will not go into at length lesbianism being an issue here phoebe ditzy and blonde yet with a deep and mysterious quality chandler the underdog with the highly developed sense of sarcastic humour which is the province of only the most maligned joey sweet and dumb but with a golden heart and then theres rachel the spoilt brat turned girlabouttown who never really realises that what shes always wanted is right in front of her i am not going to deny that there are flaws in friends the sentimental scenes do have more than a tinge of saccharine to them i personally cannot watch the final episode without cringing and sometimes the storyline wavers a little but the comedy note here the comedy which is as it should be the essence of the show remains intact always people are always ready to critise friends for one thing or another but the truth is and this is backed up by the skyhigh ratings that friends does everything a sitcom should do and its damn funny with it thank god for dvds and reruns,POSITIVE,Comedy

2252,10.0,4 September 2022,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",they use the trick of contagious laughter this type of comedy does not require intelligent dialogue management but rather makes daily funny situations only i once watched friends with my mates and asked them if they understood the joke they were laughing at and no one was able to explain it to me they just laughed because of the laughter in the background as for the cultural aspect it is a work directed to a certain class in society and it is often the middle class and the rich especially those of white skin due to the relatively stable nature of their lives the reason for this attraction is that friends is not concerned with the central problems of the individual but rather focuses on problems that are somewhat of a luxury for most other groups of society,POSITIVE,Comedy

2305,10.0,17 May 2024,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",there are many great sitcoms on american tv although they are often seen as the same each has their own style friends is the best sitcom with a soap opera atmosphere ever written the episodes are light fun the jokes flow naturally according to the situation sometimes the laughing track is overdone but it gives the audience a sense of wellbeing unlike other comedies such as seinfeld the dramas and romances are essential parts of the programme with the protagonists living out small soap opera arcs pregnancy divorce adoption etc the fact that none of the six protagonists have left the series as is common in several other popular tv shows is another strong point of friends that has maintained its cohesion the opening theme ill be there for you by the rembrandts is a classic that reflects the spirit of the sitcom however the programme has a serious diversity problem with hardly any black or asian actors throughout its ten seasons in the first two seasons ross david schwimmer gets a pet monkey having a pet monkey is forbidden in many places the situation even becomes a joke in one strange episode the producers aim was to make the series more familyfriendly today it seems awkward once they got rid of the monkey friends got a lot better in the first few seasons the focus was on the characters ross david schwimmer and rachel jennifer aniston and it took a while to achieve a healthy balance between the actors some situations arent believable like the episode in which phoebe lisa kudrow thinks her mother has reincarnated into a cat or when a saleswoman goes to rosss david schwimmer apartment to ask him out but in general the situations are realistic especially between the third and seventh seasons friends could also be accused of being too americanised with many references to characters from american culture which is understandable given that it was a series shown on freetoair television in the united states the episode the one where no ones ready is the peak of friends as it contains all the elements mentioned a wellintegrated cast good jokes and balance in the scenes between the actors,POSITIVE,Comedy

2309,2.0,27 April 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this show has everything that a good show has excellent cast amazing studios and a plot that makes you want to watch more and more i like the fact that the episodes are short and the situations develop in an enjoyable way allowing you to laugh and to connect with the characters this show is about a group of friends that live in new york at the start the characters have bad jobs and horrible love lives they experienced a lot together supporting each other and trying to be better people with a bit of humor and positivism this show is very astonishing and highly recommendedat the end youll want to compare yourself to one of the characters and pick your favourite one it will always be my favourite show of all time,POSITIVE,Comedy
2310,10.0,12 August 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",each character in this sitcom is just overdoing things and they r trying to portray its funny using background laughter only joey and monica feel to be in their natural elements while rest off they wayward to say the least and i just feel srry for those who have such poor taste in comedy,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2311,10.0,22 October 1998,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",when this sitcom came out it was original it was funny oh what a great show it was but now the writers have lost their grasp on the whole idea of originality it seems the same kind of thing happens every episode for example there was hardly a single episode in the first season when ross didnt mention his wife being a lesbian which quickly got boring janices character got so out of control and when she was brought back we were very lucky that the writers decided to get rid of her very quickly then theres the much hyped london episode how could anyone be so disappointed as me a british person when he finds that all the hype plus the fact that many respected british actors were featuring all this was for nothing the episode had no funny parts it was like the writers sat down thought of a small plot thought of the ending and just sat down and wrote a boring repetitive episode that started boring and ended boring all im saying and i know a lot of people disagree with me but a lot of people agree too is that the show should stop while its ahead the show should have stopped after season three when it still had a molecule of dignity about itsorry fans of friends but this show is toast,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2312,10.0,10 December 2023,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i know so much people who go to this show when theyre upset lonely or just in need of a laugh friends just has this sort of comfort that is so unique to anything else ive watched you feel a sense of belonging and feel as if the shows your own as you get more attached to the characters this show is everything u need it to be its a show about friends but it takes no highlight on one particular person so u get to know every character and get to have your own favorites instead of rooting for the main character solely because theyre the main character by far my favorite show i ever watched,POSITIVE,Comedy

2314,10.0,11 April 2019,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is a show full of whitty humor fun characters heartbreaking moments and awkward situations from the airing of its first episode in up to last episode in writers david crane and marta kauffman found ways to keep audiences captivated humor brilliant set designs and the wildly ordinary lives of joey chandler ross monica phobie and rachel are what kept us all watching thanks to the creative writing style of marta kauffman and david crane friends quickly became a fan favorite many of the iconic phrases they used throughout the show fall may somewhere in your vocabulary today phrases like we were on a break how you doin and worst of all anything that comes out of janices mouth we can all her her voice now chandler bing and oh my ga kauffman and crane were brilliant writers their ability to adapt and come up with new fresh ideas is what kept friends alive the two writers spent a lot of their time during shooting tweaking their writing to the crowds reaction if they didnt get the reaction they were expecting kauffman and crane would turn to the audience and ask for input they turned to the cast members particularly matthew perry aka chandler for suggestions as well many times the those suggestions made it to the final cut of the episode this was their way of ensuring that everyone was enjoying the show kauffman and cranes writing was fantastic their writing however was not the soul reason friends was as successful as it was people like the writers who helped kauffman and crane editing teams cameramen light guys boom operators and the set teams these amazing groups of people mad it all happen and brought writing on a paper to a ten season tv show just as iconic as the character of friends are some of their set pieces are equally as iconic when thinking of friends there are a couple pieces in each set that one might recognize the orange couch from the coffee house central perk the foosball table in chandler and joeys apartment the picture frame around the the peephole in rachel and monicas apartment and even the bizarre d framed picture named edna that floats around from time to time these things along with others you may be thinking of enhance the aesthetics of the show and draw your attention to the sets and what is happening around the characters when you see these pieces you know exactly where the characters are this along with good camera work are another reason why friends more than ten years later is still loved by many but arguably the best part of the show are the characters ross joey chandler monica pheoby and rachel are iconic names that made friends into the show it is today writers kauffman and crane made these characters relatable friendly and funny in order to gain fandom amongst all crowds from the controlling behavior of monica to the corky dad like humor of chandler everyone has someone they feel they closely relate to the choice of actors for friends could not have been any better with jennifer aniston aka rachel being the most popular of the bunch all have been able to go onto different acting jobs and perform very well in various roles friends has been off the air for over ten years now but the humor is not lost on us we use their language we recognize their names and we see their talent for its time and even for todays standards friends has earned its spot in history with all the other great movies and tv shows roger ebert said were two thumbs up,POSITIVE,Comedy
2315,1.0,14 April 2019,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this show when it debuted nearly years ago this fall and ended nearly years ago with a memorable finale remains a gold standard for comedies on tv you can find it on network tv as well as on netflix and still have a crush on the characters there have been attempts to spinoff the characters such as joey but to little fanfare,POSITIVE,Comedy
2316,10.0,13 January 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",im watching this show in nearly two decades after it ended but got to say this this show is just so good every single character leading ones are just so different from eachother yet fit the puzzle so smoothly every one of them have different personalities which are just too perfect and yup funny there is the crazy one the pessimistic the hero the clown the wise one the overlooked one the depressed the beautiful the big mouth the clumsy one the favorite and every other perspective you see irlthere is not a single episode which is just to proceed the story every single one of them is a imdb comedy masterpieces definately a recommendation for a leisure watch as the show is quite thick to eat in a single helping,POSITIVE,Comedy
2317,10.0,26 October 2019,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",if the laugh track wasnt there to tell you when to laugh it wouldnt have lasted long the awful campy acting is worst than anything ive seen if i could give this show a negative i would give it,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2318,10.0,12 January 2003,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",how can anyone dislike this show its so goddamn watchable if you dont find it funny perhaps you dont like to laugh since the humour is varied enough to appeal to practically everyone witty oneliners recurring jokes overthetop sarcasm bizarre sight gagshow many other ways are there to be funny besides friends is about life and relationships anyone disinterested by this must be bored by living itself and of course it has cracking characters im only and its hard to believe ive already lived through the entire friends saga this show will be funny to see again when im sixty ill chuckle with my wife about the memories the show holds just like my parents do now about ancient comedians who i fail to find funny do you remember and monica was so tidy she used to clean the toilet while people were using it and the guys and girls had a quiz once and the girls bet their appartment and lost it to the guys because they couldnt remember chandlers job and that joey guy was this really terrible actor who said that every time he had to cry on set hed just take a pair of tweezers stick them down his pants and just start pulling in a word unbeatable,NEGATIVE,Comedy

2324,10.0,29 October 2010,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends was one of the best shows ever however that being said if you watch too much you will become critical the first episodes are painfully awkward the show does progress however rachaels hair goes from awful to beautiful while monicas goes from cute to morticia awful as do her clothes ross is too pitiful in the beginningjoey is probably cuter in the beginning and after too many episodes i came to loathe him conceited self focused and a big coward some of the best the backpacking storythe playful pranks rachel teaches ben phoebe portraying estelle monica and chandler and the ink spoton the maidetcso goodhoweverjoey is the worst charactermindlessself centeredand lets look physicallytiny feet and handstruly an ugly bodyeccchhis redeeming qualityhis hair,NEGATIVE,Comedy

2326,10.0,22 November 2000,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i have been watching friends since the third season and after i watched one episode i was hooked i immediately started recording all of the episodes and reading anything i could find about it this show is one of the few exceptions of smart tv its funny but not to the point where it becomes silly most if not all of the episodes are absolutely hilarious when i watch friends i actually laugh out loud which is unusual for me perhaps the thing that i like best is that every week two or three plots are running at the same time any other show one plot is the main focus since the cast is made up of six characters it calls for different situations and i love that the most ordinary situationsdialogueproblems can be turned into something so complicated and thats what makes it so funny friends is a well written show that doesnt get out of control with its stupidity at some times the annoying laughter from the audience at the dumbest things makes me so mad the one downfall of the show is the constant change of wardrobe with the cast specifically with the ladies i cant say that ive ever seen an outfit worn twice even though the endless wear of dresses and khakis irritates me to no end i still love the show because of its writing and terrific acting in my opinion nobody is worth for minutes but thanks to the cast and crew for their creativity ive learned to like todays tv,POSITIVE,Comedy

2330,10.0,7 November 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",these guys are more than actors these guys are friends of mine i understand that its a tv show but i grow up with friends and still watching it even one in a week when im not in a good mood or something go wrong i turn on friends and i forget about bad moodand laughing all loud i know all replicas i know all their moves im still teenager while im watching friends i was so excited when hbo announced about friends reunion,POSITIVE,Comedy
2331,1.0,23 December 2023,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i enjoy friends every time i watch them but what i especially love is the amazing comedy of david schwimmer ross is for sure not my favorite character nor does he get the best jokes we all know who that would be but david makes such a fabulous work with what material hes got it amazes me time and time again i just hope hes done enough money for a life time there because it does feel a little bit like he has given all of his talent to the show my second point is actually a bit of a complaint for the show that big it is weird how many story inconsistencies it has there wre a lot of examples for it through out the years but i get especially mad with ep in season where ross and monicas parents have these lines i remember when we first got engaged well id gotten judy pregnant i still dont know how it happened how could it happened that the whole crew of writers no one on the set not even actors themselves remembered that just a few years back they were telling how ross was a medical marvel because the gellers hadnt thought they could have had children,POSITIVE,Comedy

2333,10.0,9 March 2023,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this review is the result of years of sporadic trying to get something from this show i tried honestly to find something in it be it funny or warming sure from time to time a line jumps that would be funny perhaps in another context but the wannabe soft parts are mushy the quiproquos would have been easily avoidable through simple clarification and the immature childish behavior of all the characters destroys even the rare glimpses of fun because everything is not lifelike at all the main characters are not relatable they are in their late s but they act like teens and they are so sketchy the spoiled independent girl the quirky girl the competitive girl the ohsofunny guy the shallow stud and the dorky unrequited lover many people appear to like them and the show maybe as a result of heavy promotion and of the viewers own shallowness but even as an escapist show it doesnt work because its almost annoyingly unreal others noted its leaning towards dumbing down because the only character with higher education ross is constantly mocked for it and appears as boring and awkward to me paradoxically perhaps the only almost likeable main characters are sometimes phoebe and joey for their sporadic down to earth common sense,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2334,10.0,19 September 2001,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this show has always rubbed me the wrong way and i finally figured out why these characters are just too petty and cruel perhaps thats why they each have only five friends to their name four for ross and monica hahaha matthew perry makes the show tolerable the rest of em can rot,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2335,8.0,10 December 2023,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",its one of the most iconic sitcoms and i know its been for most people unless if you are one of like a very big fraction who hasnt watched not even one bit this is easily my favourite sitcom by a very long mile if you havent watched a single episode or clip from it then you are missing out big time i watched the entire show and believe me it took me only seven months from the beginning to the end it was well known for its distinctive theme which of course contains the rembrandts hit ill be there for you and when i hear it i sing along to it and i pretty much know mainly most of the lyrics off by heart pretty much like each of the characters make this really stand out the main characters really make this the most recognisable sitcom as of now each episode makes its point of view and it makes sense to watch it as it should be the deleted scenes do make it stand out much more than it does what really grinds my gear is that theres quite a few of people who have never watched friends and honestly of americans between years old never watched this which is a major letdown and as i am a friends fan i did manage to go to the friends experience which was absolutely amazing and i did remember the scenes and quotes after watching the first eight and a half seasons on netflix i waited until july st to watch it on binge and then it took me only weeks to watch the last one and a half seasons which i didnt expect however i do tend to get through it eventually,POSITIVE,Comedy

2343,10.0,14 February 2001,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends may be very popular but it gets on my nerves not because of its content the idea of men and women living together is not new that idea has been around for a long time i mean nothing exciting ever happens and when something exciting does happen it always happens near the end of a season but the one thing about this show that always makes me tickis the live audience whenever a celebrity appears or a marriage proposition happens the live audience just goes crazy and screams like crazy sometimes i wish that this show had no need for canned laughter it would be better that way,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2344,10.0,3 January 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i may be biased here but since its my review so i reserve that right it was not only the first sitcom that i watched but also the first tv show dont listen to what people say this show is funny and it always will be as long as you have a good sense of humor that being said it has become a but overhyped over the past couple of years which i admit is a bit annoying but that doesnt stop this from being such an iconic show,POSITIVE,Comedy
2345,10.0,29 June 2019,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is the best sitcom i have ever seen i watched all ten seasons multiple times and plan on doing so again in a couple of years heres whats so great about it great characters who wouldnt like to have friends as good and diverse as this yes theyre all white but remember that friends began at a time when it wasnt considered a neccessity to at least have a black an asian and a gay character in the same show i cant imagine a person who cant relate to at least one of the characters the balance friends is quite often simple fun sometimes its emotional sometimes its almost depressingly sad but somehow the writers always managed to clear the air with a laugh at the right moment friends takes its characters seriously sure it makes fun of them as part of the comedy but every character also has its honest heartfelt moments without seeming forced the guest stars brad pitt george clooney bruce willis julia roberts jcvd elle macpherson robin williams billy crystal danny de vito the list goes on the quotability me and my friends still use many phrases jokes and references from friends in our every day life here are just three examples my girlfriends a lesbian joey doesnt share food we were on a break the writing although the show went on for seasons it didnt feel too repetetive in my opinion they found a good time for the end of the show some storylines feel similar but never bore me i dont know how they did it but they did i subtract point for the laugh track never understood that and some bestoffepisodes consisting mostly of funny moments from previous episodes noone needs that other than that perfect entertainment,POSITIVE,Comedy
2346,9.0,21 February 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",hard to imagine more famous tv series than friends however i still stumble upon people that havent seen a single episode i believe they just skip it from stubborness its quite common to avoid something because of its popularity well i dont recommend to do this the whole decade has passed with this wild bunch so many hilarious and heartbreaking moments revolve around a group of six people i cannot say that every situation portrayed in the show has real life analog but they are funny not every season was outstanding but repetition hasnt occurred once it is completely understandable as no ones life can be a complete comedy a quick circle of tribute to the main characters should be done of course the head of the group for me is chandler always sarcastic guy with tons of insecurities keeps an arsenal of jokes to defuse almost every situation some people should try his methods joey an ultimate foodie womaniserbasically gluttony and lust with a dumb attitude but you cannot stop being amused with him ross the most ordinary person of the group is the bridge to the viewer in my opinion but also is a counterweight to allfun colleagues phoebe an outlandish friends that is hard to understand but full of surprises rachel is presumably the beauty queen of the group pretty much likes to live easily and play with other people monica the chef to the marrow always want to be in control and loves perfection alone they sound horrible but the beauty is in the fusion of all those unique differences while i was writing all of this i realized that many moments are way more serious than you might think from the first glance so my advice is not to give too much thought and simply enjoy the show the best thing is that these friends will always be with you and will make you laugh whenever you are sad or just want to spend a fun time,POSITIVE,Comedy
2347,10.0,24 April 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i dont think i have ever been bored of this show no matter how many times a rewatch it just pick a random episode and you will be entertained,POSITIVE,Comedy
2348,4.0,8 March 2019,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is a tv series that shows the reality of six very close friends they are chandler ross joey monica rachel e phoebe over years it shows the daily life and what is happening with each of them in different areas the show caught me from the very first episode for example right at the beginning there are crisis in the lives of the characters with a more critical situation in ross and rachels life both of them had just break up their corresponding relationship they search for their friends help who were in the cafeteria where they hang out and share their crises and everyday experiences another interesting aspect in the series in my opinion is the love relationships between the friends because it shows that the basis of all good relationships starts from friendship and trust in one another the series also tells the story of overcoming the characters because it shows different personalities conditions and problems but with positive results starting with phoebe who grew up on the streets without a good family structure but struggled and overcame her obstacles and had success monica who in adolescence suffered from obesity but with her competitiveness managed to control herself lose weight and get a healthier life the story of rachel is the opposite of phoebe for she grew up in a house together with her family and with a great financial condition but she discovered that she had grown up and yet totally depended on her parents for her livelihood but with the help of her friends and willpower she overcame all her pride and grew in the area professional family and moral friends is a combo of reality comedy drama and many life lessons which make every second worth watching,POSITIVE,Comedy

2362,9.0,8 July 2003,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",possibly the most overrated show in the history of television and i cant understand all the fuss people make about jennifer aniston shes really nothing special at all the whole friends thing is definitely an example of the emperors new clothes syndrome if you ask me that such a load of old pony could get to be so popular speaks volumes about the collective taste or lack of it of the contemporary viewing masses i now brace myself for the inevitable deluge of derision from this shows legions of loyal followers but that is and will remain my honest opinion of it overrated annoying and extremely unfunny out of,NEGATIVE,Comedy

2399,10.0,16 May 2002,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",even my favorite show of all time seinfeld started to wane out in the final seasons i think friends has reached that point its almost time to call it quits i think the show should go about two more seasons but thats it now the writers are simply going for cheap techniques to lure in audiences can they even call the show friends anymore theyre all screwing each other i never had any friends like these so let me see whats the updaterachel is having rosss baby joey confessed his love for rachel chandler got married to monica and ross got married to practically everyone on the show this is a sitcom but the writers are treating like its dynasty or dallas i think all of them should break up and they should just be friends again after all thats the name of the show but to be on the positive side the show hasnt lost all touch i still think the show is very funny the cast still has the energy and chemistry they had when they first started chandler has gained back his sarcasmwhich is great because i was getting worried for a while i still wish chandler didnt get married to monica because he was so much funnier when he was slacking off with joey kicking back on the laz boy drinking beer and watching free porn his trademark sarcasm was in full swing back then then after he became romantically involved with monica he became her lapdog and the sarcasm was lost but recently his sarcasm has been coming back which makes me feel proud everyone has that sarcastic buddy who constantly makes smartaleck comments we all know chandler i know chandler i am chandler i can totally relate to his character im always spewing the sarcastic remarks at exactly the right times as for joeyjoeys still joey and he will always be joey i dont always embrace airhead characters on sitcomsmost of the times the writers make those characters stupidstupid and not stupidfunnybut him and phoebe are both a hoot and a half as dimwitted as joey is his gags are often witty i love that line where he says to ross if homosapiens were in fact homosapiensis that why they were extinct ross replies homosapiens are humans joey says hey im not judging david schwimmer is funny and sometimes hilarious as the welltodo but mildly stuckup ross gellar as dry as rosss sense of humor is he usually cracks me up even if im laughing at him jennifer aniston and courteney cox top off this great cast which also includes some memorable recurring actors like christina pickles and elliott gould as ross and monicas parents i havent watched too many of the recent episodes so i didnt get to check out all the guest appearances on the show but i did see the episode with bruce willis and he was hilarious i still like and will support this show for a few more seasons but ii still say if you want to see some memorable episodes of friends watch the first couple of seasons on the repeats i personally have seen those episodes thousands of times so i dont even want to watch a minute of the repeats but if you havent seen the show beforedo check out the old episodes before the new ones my score the old episodes out of the new episodes out of,POSITIVE,Comedy

2403,9.0,28 April 2013,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",youll seldom find shows like friends that were long lasting without considerable drops in quality during its ten seasons weve witnessed the life of six main characters and a myriad of recurring characters and guest stars probably the strongest message is that all of the six characters are good no matter what situations theyre going through and misunderstandings they might be causing at the same time the strongest quality of friends is that the show never became sleazy since ive invested a couple of months in watching the show in its entirety minus the bloopers and the interviews i think ive had a good overview seasons to were the organic growth in terms of plot and character development seasons and were the most mature and and were the logical phaseout actually there was not much left to be said in the given environment,POSITIVE,Comedy
2404,10.0,17 April 2013,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this is one of the best series ive ever seen i still remember the characters with their friends character names we are also friends boys and girls and have named ourselves from the characters of friends and im referred as phoebe as people come to me with their problems i always wish that i stay with my friends forever as we see in the series its so much fun you hangout and have fun all the time yes there are difficult times too but above all you guys are together always friends is not just a comedy series but you get to learn a lot the sacrifice of monica for ross i love it overall its all time no entertainer,POSITIVE,Comedy

2407,5.0,17 December 2006,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",its a wonderful masterpiece a must to see if you have years and you want to have an advance of what will happen to you in the next ten its truer than a reality its amusing and sad at the same time especially if you have the same age of the protagonists and you have seen all the ten years in few months you notice of how much the time that passes changes to you and it is what you happens to they that do the magic the magic for some minute to feel itself in new york and having to decide with six friends what to eat for the thanks giving its hard to write a ten lines comment especially if you dont speak english like an english but i wanted to leave my contribution about something that has left a sign inside me,POSITIVE,Comedy
2408,10.0,5 February 2024,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",look i loved friends before when i was younger you hear the laugh track so you in turn go heheheha i thought it was one of the most hilarious and fun loving shows ive watched it had been a while since ive watched friends and had kind of forgotten the plot i decided to rewatch it imma be honest and say that the show is hella overrated the laugh tracks being overused like ten in just one conversation between the two characters realising that if you remove the laugh track the comedy doesnt really hit its feels so empty and void less i dislike the character rachel now progressing through the series ross is actually a psychopath look i know that friends is one of this spoof comedy sit cons you can sit back and relax but for me its just a chore to watch and get through every single laugh track in each episode the show is not funny,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2409,9.0,26 January 1999,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",well after seinfeld was over everybody turned to friends on thursday night all i have to say is good choice everyone you can always count on the show to be funny especially with phoebe joey the cutest one of them all ross chandler monica and rachel they deserved to be paid million per episode to the cast of friends please continue your good work on the show everyone loves you and hope that it last on about a few more seasons youre our best tv friends friends,POSITIVE,Comedy
2410,10.0,30 May 2005,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is hands down the best sitcom of all time the main reasons are the chemistry on screen and that they are best friends off screen which is rare because in most sitcoms the actors hate each other because one gets overshadowed and has less publicity even tho friends is like that because of jennifer aniston overshadowing courtney and lisa they still stick by each other lets explore the main characters rachel green played by jennifer aniston when we first saw her back in she was spoilt and was daddys little girl but as time went she became independent and into her own after the we were on a break and when she married ross and vegas we saw that she was over ross and stood up and said we cant stay married she is telling him that its over this is the main highlight rachel standing up for herself seasonsince she had her baby thats when we see the true rachel green for the first time plus shes hooottt rating monica gellar played by courtney cox monica is the bitchiest out of all three girls because she gets very competitive and never lets anyone win especially chandler since they got married she isnt my favourite character but she does have her moments ie as fat monica rating phoebe buffay played by lisa kudrow phoebe is the funniest female character hands down her songs her wit and her blondness makes her such a brilliant creation to watch i couldnt imagine anyone playing her also her twin sister is funny because you can see that they dont get along and after the buffay the vampire layer porn movie incident where ursula used phoebes name you can see why phoebe hates heralso lisa portrays phoebes troubled life with a smile and i think that is what makes lisa such a great actress rating joey tribbiani played by matt leblanc joey is a great character but he is not my favourite because after a while joey became a tiresome character and all the other friends all got married had kids etc but he didnt seem to fit in anymore i mostly admired the joey and chandler relationship which got built up over the years which is great they have more chemistry on screen than chandler has with monica because i think that they were closer than he was with monica i dont think that his sitcom will ever be as successful because they main characters bore me and there is no chemistry on screen chandler bing played by matthew perry chandler the best he really is my favourite character because he is always making fun of how slow and dumb joey is i grew bored of him when he married monica because he lost his witt monica kept on being serious all the time and thats when chandler became serious and thats why i grew bored but he is still the best he still does have is moments but monica took that away and made him more mature which was a big mistake for chandler fansrating ross gellar played by david schimmer ross when friends started he wasnt the best character because he was quite boring but as seasons went on davids acting and comic timing improved and thats when he became really funny i liked it when he screamed we were on a break after this he became funny and as his relationship with rachel ended thats when he challenged matthew perry as the funniest friend im glad that he and rachel got back together and i would have liked this as a sitcom than joey friends will always be the best and even tho some episodes are bad and some are excellent you cant take the chemistry and great acting away from this great sitcom the best seasons are and also im looking forward to the movie that has just been announced friends rip,POSITIVE,Comedy
2411,9.0,7 May 2006,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is a series that will never die over ten series we watch the six friends grow and get closer within that we see several marriages arguments and makeups during the seasons i believe that the episodes went deeper into each friends life and showed us a lot more character along with that the writers managed to show us a whole new side of comedy i believe that friends will pave the way for new and upcoming comedies i come from the united kingdom and i am accustomed to and love the british sense of humour but i believe the writers bought the best out of every episode and made the series an international treasure i believe that the series was rounded off nicely but when i heard of i possible come back for our friends i was extremely excited and couldnt wait to here more even though i was excited i was worried that they might destroy a perfect ending lets hope the trio of writers can come up with another great episode or two,POSITIVE,Comedy
2412,10.0,11 August 2006,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends revolves around the lives of six distinctive yet unique individuals although their lives seem to be typically american if anyone anywhere had the chance to live half as happily as any one of the characters of the show he could without a doubt consider himself the luckiest person on earth friends gives us hope hope of a better life although the plot caries the characters throughout numerous troubles and quarrels the love that the six share allows them to overcome any obstacle and even turn the darkest moments into humor laughter is the best medicine quite true the only shame is that the person to make up that saying never had a chance to see an episode of friends truly incredible there is not a single episode out of the which would cause you to fall off your couch or choke on spaghetti out of laughter any person to watch only a few consecutive episodes would inevitably fall in love with all six characters who play the roles of what have become to be their own personalities the only and greatest negative remark regarding friends is that they should have kept the show going the writers marta kaufman and david crane proved they can keep the excitement of the show going for ten years which means they could have continued it indefinitely and they should have the greatest show to ever exist can be hardly considered a compliment,POSITIVE,Comedy
2413,8.0,2 June 2013,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i admit it i havent watched a single episode of friends until two weeks ago after watching some random episode i thought hey this aint so bad so i decided to give it a try now two weeks later im halfway through season i really got drawn into this show you start to care for those six people like they were family each character has his own perks and flaws and thats why you start identifying with them and with guys and girls theres really enough material to appeal to both men and women even though i love the characters and the comedy i cant give this show the full because after seasons plots are starting to repeat themselves i especially got tired of the whole ross rachel situation after a while also this show often contradicts itself while in the beginning ross has only slept with one women his exwife carol somewhere in season or chandler reveals that he slept with some cleaning lady in college which simply is not possible stuff like that happens quite a few times and i sometimes get the feeling that the writers forget to watch their own show those flaws really do bum me out and keep me from really getting into this show still great,POSITIVE,Comedy
2414,10.0,19 August 2007,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",seriously this is the greatest thing on tv ever all my childhood i thought that my favourite tv program was the simpsons but as i got older i started to watch friends more and i enjoyed it every single episode made me laugh i could probably watch the same episode times before it got boring my favourite male character was probably ross as he was the one who really got me into friends but i actually think that the best male actor was mathew perry he should be in more comedy films he also got the very last laugh in the last episode when he said the single word where my favourite female character is probably rachel as shes quite funny but i think that the best actress is probably courtney cox every time i watch the last episode of friends it makes me cry inside because i know that everyone in the cast and crew were crying,POSITIVE,Comedy
2415,9.0,2 July 2008,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i do admit when i first heard of friends i thought wow another crappy cheap sitcom when i finally saw an episode nothing else was on tv i flipped the comedy in this show is excellent and the story is also good if you havent seen an episode and you think ye right like a review will change my mind just watch at least a few episodes you will laugh so hard there are really sad emotional moments in friends and in the same episodes they still have really funny moments give this show a chance if you think it is a crappy sitcom cause its not hope there is a friends movie d friends has many funny characters rachel the girl trying to live without her father and his big money has a crush on ross monica the clean obsessive girl who cooks a lot sister of ross phoebe the funniest character just some random massager who is friends with the whole group chandler lives across the hall from monica and rachel with joey he is funny and messy ross the palientologist who studies dinosaurs and is the funny nerd of the group joey the struggling actor who lives with chandler he likes to steal food from monica and is kind of stupid,POSITIVE,Comedy
2416,3.0,30 May 2006,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",well what can i say there are no words to describe the utter excellence effort and comedy in this show the writers are right up there as some of the best writers in history the way the characters have grown over the years is great and yet again due to the ace writing the three girls on the show are babes and all three are comic geniuses jennifer aniston plays spoilt daddys girl rachel green really well also the neurotics of monica played by courteney cox is fabulous her comic timing is astounding lisa kudrow is brilliant in the way her character phoebe buffay can talk about such terrible things that have happened in her life like they are normal everyday things ahh the guys matt leblanc is a great actor and might i add as a year old girl gorgeous nobody delivers a line like matthew perry he is as sharp as a whip david schwimmer what can i say the way it takes him minutes to say a word is utter comedy this show is without a doubt one of the funniest comforting shows ever its basically minutes of fun,POSITIVE,Comedy
2417,10.0,15 January 2013,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",writing this reviewat i still hope to meet those guys in real life and shake their hand for what they gave meso much joy and happiness this show is about best friends and their lives six individuals jennifer aniston courteney cox lisa kudrow matt leblanc matthew perry and david schwimmer that were meant to play those rolesi cant think of any actors that would fit these roles better and i dont think there will ever be let alone the casting was superbthe script and those punch lines are still the source of tvshows that try more or less to create something similar i cant express how much i love those guys and how much i miss this show but i can guarantee to all viewers that have not seen it yetthat you are missing the best show ever created and i really hope all the people that contributed to this to be as happy as they made usthank you,POSITIVE,Comedy
2418,9.0,1 March 2022,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",its important to know that i dont typically write reviews but after seeing how high this show was rated i had too i have watched the entire series and quite honestly i dont know how this series is so highly ranked to me the shows writing is mediocre perhaps even less than mediocre and the acting is some of the worst i have seen of course there are a few exceptions being lisa kudrow and a couple of secondary characters but the rest of the cast is by far some of the worst actorsactresses i have ever seen now for the so called comedy this is just not funny by the way sitcom stands for situational comedy therefore there it should be funny the jokes are basic and lacking in mental stimuli the laughing in the background makes me wonder if these people were drugged or perhaps the show did not travel well through the time i suppose ill never know maybe i am the odd one out but it seems this show is far overrated and just liked by a bunch of people who want to follow the bandwagon let me tell you if you are thinking about watching this find something else there are far better sitcoms out there so dont fall into the bandwagon trap,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2419,9.0,22 August 2002,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",since the sextet of the hit tv show friends has kept fans around the world glued to their tv sets every thursday night at and i think the reason is that this group of unmistakable talent in someway connects with their audience the show has brilliant writers and a committed cast when you watch the show you feel like they are your best friends when they go through something the audience goes through it with them the show is a hit because it is real and you can connect with the plots that the writers so brilliantly put together its the gem of nbc and should be the bases of what every successful sitcom should be,POSITIVE,Comedy
2420,10.0,26 March 2007,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",you cant compare any other show with friends this is the greatest sitcom of all time if you havent seen it go buy the dvds i wish theyd made more episodes while this was on the air now the actors might be getting too old to make another season or they might just not want to which is too bad even if you have like me seen all the episodes many times they are still hilarious the only problem with this show is the number of episodes just isnt enough this is the only sitcom on imdb worth if in the future something even comes close to the greatness of friends it should be awarded in my opinion maybe theres still hope for a reunion episode or something,POSITIVE,Comedy
2421,10.0,14 September 2016,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",first off i dont ever rate a tv show but for this show it was easy to give it such a high ratingthe reason i became such a huge fan of the show is because my cousin suggested to me that i should just skip the first season so i watched the pilot and just skipped to season after that i bingewatched the entire thing when i had finished i went back and watched the first season and let me tell you if i had only season the first season i would have stopped watching after episode it was so bad the comedy was forced and unfunny the acting was terrible leaving out matthew perry and david and it was just boring not once did it make me laugh which is what sitcoms are supposed to do but the rest of the show was a master piece and to anyone out there who wants to know if the shows worth it watch the pilot and just skip the rest of the season itll be worth it for sure,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2422,9.0,17 April 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this is the greatest comedy show of all time no show can replace friends in comedy perfect cast and characters specially joey and chandler they are the heart of this show there is no single boring scene in this show full of entertainment show,POSITIVE,Comedy
2423,9.0,11 July 2013,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",everybody loves friends anybody who doesnt like friends is part of a group of the worst people in the world which is also made up of justin bieber and one direction fans friends is hilarious unlike me friends is also romantic unlike me it baffles me how i like it so much as ive got nothing in common with it but i do i can watch every episode over and over again without getting bored there is nothing that compares to it the writers are geniuss but the performance of the actors makes the script and therefore the show funnier theres no doubt that the fact that the events that occur in the show could realistically happen to you and me ordinary people has at least helped to make the show as successful as it is but its now over ten years since the show ended and people still watch it and love it and laugh at it friends is also known for having massive stars for example bruce willis jeff goldblumm and brad pitt in there show and its brilliant to see them out of their comfort zone and just doing something completely different for example its quite funny to see bruce willis go from shooting down terrorists in nakatomi tower to singing love machine in front of a mirror however im going to end my review now having realised that everybody who has the luxury of internet will have probably watched at least one episode of friends but if not watch it,POSITIVE,Comedy
2424,10.0,4 September 2006,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this is the best sitcom ever its about friendship live and expectations it is about staying true to oneself and most importantly it is about staying true to your friends its about love hate jealousy obligations deception astonishment its about the wonderful feeling of friendship over and over again you got acquainted to the personages as if youd know them personally you come to recognize them as friend and youd come to get personal preferences you got into the game as if it were your own id say it is the most true sitcom as it addresses the most fundamental human need friends it is not about fanzy life not about action loaded scenes it is about weakness strength love and loyalty,POSITIVE,Comedy
2425,10.0,9 September 2013,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",while watching friends i use to always forget that it is a tv show and those are actors im looking at they seem so real every character in the serial was having its own personality different from others you get so involved in their reel life that you dont realize it is not real i use to laugh with them cry with them feel every emotion that came across to me i liked monicas perfectionism joeys innocence chandlers witty humor phoebes unique imagination roses efforts to prove his intelligence and rachels style no one must have thought combination of all this can deliver a fabulous show with success like this friends night was always a fun night full of pure joy and laughter original sense of humor brought out so naturally that you will never think it was acted by these very good actors i must also appreciate the writer director and crew that worked behind camera to make this show a huge success and bring friends on tv and in our living rooms cheers to all,POSITIVE,Comedy

2433,8.0,22 June 2008,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",four years ago after the series final i wouldve said this is the best comedy sitcom ever made t after watching its reruns now with cold head i can only say its a triumph of american comedy sure one of the most successful and popular comedies ever made but its no lie that it isnt about quality from season to the show is a complete mess with unfunny situations snl imitation sequences and awkward performances the show starts to get a unique vibe and special charm since to be honest the humor gets more witty and leaves behind cheesy lines for raunchy humor instead but keeping the typical american humor all the time courteney cox jennifer aniston and david schwimmer shine all the time while the rest of the cast does it very fine and even gain status as peoples favorite characters on any sitcom the situations are tremendously creative from on and i cant think of any other show to perfectly manage the facial expressions of its cast its also part of the charm of the comedy pretty people performing decently even with their faces give this show a try and be part of american pop culture,POSITIVE,Comedy
2434,9.0,9 May 2006,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",if anyone were to ask me what are the hallmarks of a good friend i would have only the following answer he or she must be as cute as rachel as homely as monica as quirky as phoebe as geeky as ross as wisecracking as chandler and as crazy and lovable as joey friends changed my life forever the title track ill be there for you says it all the essence of a true friendship being there when youre needed the most caring when you didnt really have to being loved and cared for and having someone wholl give you a true perspective on life wholl side by you no matter what friends brought light in my life it taught me truly how life should be lived long live the good old friends,POSITIVE,Comedy
2435,9.0,6 February 2022,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this is the most overrated thing i have seen jokes are terrible i think i only laughed once the whole series and it was just kind of a huff rather than a laugh characters are terrible and all extremely annoying storylines are boring best part is the intro which is meh,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2436,10.0,28 February 2004,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",to say that friends is a great show is an understatement friends is one among very few shows that has that quality that special quality that blends great acting comedy and season after season of great storylines i myself did not starting watching friends until one day i caught it in reruns about five or six years ago and i was instantly hooked it didnt take me long to catch up with the other seasons i started watching the reruns everyday and i couldnt get enough of it i then asked myself why havent i ever watched this great show before i grew to love almost every character and was excited every time a new episode came on so after ten successful seasons friends is coming to an end its kinda bittersweet because as much as i want it not to end i know that the actors have been playing the same characters for ten years and want to move on i know like me millions of people will be tuning into the series finale in may with their fingers crossed praying that ross and racheal will end up together and that all the characters will end up happy in their lives if your sad that friends is ending take comfort in the fact that reruns air everyday on tvon several channels and all those awesome seasons that have been released or are coming out soon on dvd so i guess we dont really have to say goodbye to our friends just yet,POSITIVE,Comedy
2437,8.0,7 December 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",the show hooked me from the start i dont know how many times ive seen it from ep to the last my only complaint is the last season it gets a bit rushed to the end too much happens in short amount of time but the actors makes it great enough,POSITIVE,Comedy
2438,1.0,7 July 2011,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",ive watched the whole seasons for like times its a show about friends its a show about life and its a show about love and its pure comedy seeing that even when you watch episodes over and over you still laugh like its the first time seeing it friends is a show that changed my life and i think everyone that watched it just hopes i want to have friends like that friends for life that i can count on everything i remember being and planning with my friends on moving to usa probably new york and live like them because thats the best thing we could and can think of its a perfect life without being too perfect well they have their problems p of course me and most of those friends grew apart and thats why i still watch friends as it is the only real thing i have to rely on real friendship its a show that inpires me and a show that everyone should watch excellent very well made and genius,POSITIVE,Comedy

2441,10.0,23 December 2014,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is one of my top comedies of all time it has a really nice balance of being flat out funny and having characters that you can really relate to each character is different which offers comedy for different senses of humor it doesnt feel like the comedy is forced as with other shows it really feels like a group of friends with very different personalities all hanging out unlike other comedies it also really develops the characters and makes you somewhat invested in their lives which allows them to have some more serious moments like all the good comedies its one you can watch over and over through the years,POSITIVE,Comedy
2442,10.0,11 March 2017,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this is the first tv show i have watched every episode every moment without feeling boring even still now i am watching the old episode again for the second time i love joey and chandler so much this is a full pack of laugh out loud this is the best show ever and before friends the six actors who play the main characters were all unknown today jennifer courteney lisa matt matthew and david are six of the most known people in the world,POSITIVE,Comedy
2443,10.0,12 October 2019,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends was always basically a very lame very unfunny version of seinfeld aimed at shallow teenagers people who found seinfeld to edgy intellectual or cold and people who need a giant sized billboard announcing every joke in order to get it the whole setup of the show starting with the stupid couch in planted in the middle of the café which is apparently owned by the main characters of this sitcom and where no other customers are allowed to sit is unnatural and far fetched every line from every actor in every episode feels fake and is obviously just there to set up the next lame joke that you can see coming from miles away this renders the series utterly predictable annoying and boring friends has no natural flow no surprises and no funny jokes it doesnt help that many scenes and ideas in friends are copied straight from seinfeld though presented here in a lame sugary and extremely heavy handed way basically the friends writer are spoon feeding you old seinfeld jokes with all the interesting ideas nuances and flavors taken out and substituted with a thick layer of sugar to make everything sickeningly sweet,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2444,10.0,28 September 2002,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",the only thing i have to say about this show is that it just isnt funny none of the characters are likeable and not once have i seen an africanamerican chinese or hispanic person on the show why set it in new york if you arent going to take advantages of the unique opportunities it offers such as amazing multiculturalism being in the primary demographic for this show a fifteen year old girl my friends have subjected me to countless episodes if you are looking for intelligent comedy try watching frasier if you want your brain to melt into silly putty then watch an episode of friends,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2445,9.0,30 November 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this series just makes me laugh a lot im only born in a year after friends stopped airing but luckily it is always on comedy central this is such a great creation i love chandler bing as he always makes me laugh my favourite two lines are when chandler and monica are prepping for their wedding and monica asks chandler why are your family scottish and chandler says why is your family ross ooh burn,POSITIVE,Comedy
2446,10.0,4 August 2011,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this show is amazing not much else to say about it it is a great depiction of friendship and it also provides laughter tears and unforgettable moments throughout the series series was a good series to get the ball rolling it introduced the characters very well and although it was early days you could see the chemistry between the cast members series were all fantastic with s of laughs per episode and many great plots and subplots that were just as entertaining as each other my favourite series were both series and they were painfully funny and the way they incorporated jennifer anistons pregnancy into the show was terrific it felt like it should have happened and jennifers pregnancy was just well timed the show started to decline after series with series and not being the best of the bunch but even at its worse it was better than most so for anyone who has been living under a rock for the last years and has never watched this then i seriously suggest doing so,POSITIVE,Comedy
2447,10.0,23 September 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",well i liked verey very very match and i do not see perfect fanny enjoyable series lik it and never will be but i cant watched again i never now whay because that i will give it starts although i adore it,POSITIVE,Comedy

2455,10.0,8 June 2024,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i never heard anything about the tv show friends until when the covid pandemic emerged during the lockdown one of my sisters asked me where she could watch friends i was curious and asked her why it was fun to watch she enthusiastically told me that i would love it intrigued by her recommendation i decided to give it a try once i started watching i was hooked i ended up bingewatching all ten seasons in just one week the characters humor and relatable storylines captivated me after finishing the series i found myself watching it again and again completing the entire series two to three more times each time i rewatched it i discovered new nuances and enjoyed it just as much as the first time the show became a comforting and enjoyable escape during the challenging times of the pandemic now in i can confidently say that if anyone hasnt watched friends yet they definitely should its a timeless classic that brings joy laughter and a sense of connection the characters feel like old friends and their experiences resonate with viewers in a way that few shows can achieve watching friends was truly a great experience and i highly recommend it to anyone looking for a delightful and heartwarming series to enjoy,POSITIVE,Comedy
2456,10.0,24 August 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",you gotta see this the ideas discussed in the series are the base of some other hit movies,POSITIVE,Comedy
2457,9.0,14 August 2022,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",being born after the shows air gives me a unique perspective on friends originally when i watched when i was younger around i thought seasons were the best as to me they were the most relatable but as ive got older ive grown significantly more fond of the first few seasons of friends by the end of the show it gets dry however it may still be funny at moments the characters draw out to be so hyperbolic they are no longer relatable and it is clear they ran out of ideas for the show when you watch the first few seasons its filled with humor and lovable relatable characters i think joey gets treated the worst by the end although joey was not particularly known for his intelligence in the early seasons he wasnt so over the top obnoxiously dumb like they make him by the end of the show same goes for most of the other characters they just become such extreme and annoying versions of what they once were overall this is a worthwhile show to watch but stick to the first or so seasons,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2458,10.0,9 January 2022,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",absolutely great series quite simple at the same time but it is still loved by manys very good marketing campaign and we still watch it sometimes good spirit and aniston i love you jenifer,POSITIVE,Comedy

2461,10.0,9 May 2015,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",what to say about this show must be made for the brain dead out there th grade humor at best you can watch tune disney or nick for equal humor but that is geared towards kids so understandable surly anyone with any brains cant find this show enjoyable at work people watch it in the lunch room i can guess the punch line while the sentence is still being uttered and know it is going to be stupid i have had to either not go in the lunch room or get the remote and refuse to tune in friends it has created enemies but i dont care at least i still have my sanity the laugh track is even turned way up in volume,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2462,1.0,24 February 2001,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",half a dozen aging gen xers share their neurotic quirks with us every week weve grown to know and love them their circumstances and hair styles have changed over the years but their personalities have not the early marketing hype for friends almost prevented me from watching it the ads implied that this show captured the essence of an entire generation in a way that had not been done before i wanted to remind them and the public that another nbc show had already claimed to have done this thirty years earlier it was the monkees it wasnt true then and it wasnt true in fortunately both shows were better than their hype the ensemble cast has been around long enough to outgrow the ridiculous image invented for them the actors are all much older than the characters they play the world they inhabit has no violent crime no drugs no poverty no ethnic minorities and no skyhigh manhattan rents this isnt a criticism its a sitcom i dont want reality it will be interesting to see how the show will look if its still on the air in,NEGATIVE,Comedy

2471,1.0,8 April 2007,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",its not the worst thing on tv but nowhere near the best for everyone who says its horrible lighten up if you watched it more frequently youd find something you like and besides theres been much much worse as for being the best sitcom on tv id have to disagree theres only one really great sitcom seinfeld and everyone whos seen an episode knows it id rather watch a rerun of seinfeld than a new episode of friends any day if they were still making new episodes of course however id also rather watch a rerun of friends over any episode of according to jim or yes dear and for everyone who says jerry was bad in seinfeld because he almost cracked up in many episodes thats because the episode was so funny nobody on the set could keep a straight face actually when i see him almost laugh it makes me crack up because i know the joke really is that funny back to the subject at hand if you want mediocre go with friends its not that horrible,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2472,10.0,29 May 2004,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends next to gemini man was one of the funniest shows on television during the s i first started watching it when it was in its fourth season when i was in my last year of grade school i was hooked and eventually my older brother started watching it with me and he liked it as much as i did when they showed the reruns back then i watched those too dan and bull are my favorites i love dans sarcasm but never liked his perversion too much and i love bulls stupidity judge harry stone christine and all the others on this show were all cool characters in their own unique way too bad sitcoms nowadays cant be as funny as friends was whenever i get the chance i like to watch the reruns of it on ae the show just got better with every episode they showed and every funny situation harry and the gang would get into this show is worth watching if youve never heard of it feel free to watch the reruns now being shown on ae,POSITIVE,Comedy
2473,10.0,1 April 2024,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",for me friends is one of the best tv shows ever made i was born in the late s so in i was a decade or so younger than the characters in the series i consider david schwimmer being one of the best sitcom actors ever along with jason alexander from seinfeld although their characters were sometimes a bit annoying and too whining of course reviewing a show years after its final episode is always tricky people not only have different tastes the social taste even changes over time i can understand that for the z generation the humor in the series is a bit off or not so funny but the s were a different era and the show fits perfectly in that time if it started today i can imagine that i wouldnt be this thrilled by it,POSITIVE,Comedy
2474,10.0,27 July 2018,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",the series titled friends provokes us to do the unnatural to communicate the past this series is a featured tv show but the unlikely coincidence is that the show in its entirety in its past glory of the nineties is a pass down the achievements in cinematography is off the unusual people laughing in the background the visuals and success are combined with the cinematographer solid steady camera movements and lighting effects that are enhancing the actors like jennifer anistons comedy this comedy series became a success and is a featured tv show in our residences when it hasnt been your day or month or year as the song promo goes the writers block if there has been ten seasons with the pay of the actors increasing at record breaking consistence with the tv show friends the tunes and the sarcasms and dirty jokes are typical hollywood with the physical achievements of remaining aged the decade by mastering cinematography with acting like jennifer did lens and filters are unseen but humor succeeds then the visual stimulus or television show is a work of achievement with their studio apartment standing the test of time ten years in cinematography and acting the show has astonished us with humor for the following fourteen years from two thousand and four finale,POSITIVE,Comedy
2475,10.0,19 January 2022,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",well can anyone really not love such a great series in my opinion this is one of the most amazing series great directors work great acting great humor everything is great i think that for everyone who loves friends all the characters have long become family phoebe is a charmingly crazy outofthisworld girl an animal rights activist who believes that in her previous life she was a nurse and her arm was torn off in the war only phoebe can believe that the soul of her late mother now lives in a cat monica is beautiful clever witty funny and well just turned on purity only monica because of revenge on chandler could once chop off a piece of his toe rachel is the pride of her dad a beauty who has made an excellent career from waitress to boss sometimes she behaves like an adult sensible person sometimes like a true child rachel sobs on the day of her own thirtieth birthday believing that youth is gone joe is a handsome charming cute funny and narrowminded actor but it is his narrowmindedness that makes him so beautiful charming cute funny and his phrase how do you doin entered the fund of the best replicas of the series chandler unlike perhaps joe he is not funny but insanely witty this guy laughs at his own even the stupidest jokes and dances absolutely amazing chandler is absolutely the most charming friend living next door who has huge problems communicating with the opposite sex as long as he does not meet monica ross is a cutecutecute botanist or rather a paleontologist although who is easier from this although ross is to some extent even a scientist he is still absolutely crazy but his craziness makes me smile just when i look at him ross is the main married friend despite the fact that he was divorced all times he gives advice to friends on how to build a family life correctly only ross can wear a tie with dragons on an important evening for him without at least one of these friends perhaps the series itself would have lost its zest finally i want to say that friends has been going on and off for years and during all this time the series has not lost its popularity even the notorious offscreen laughter for so many years did not annoy me at all just because friends is really the best and funniest series,POSITIVE,Comedy
2476,10.0,1 January 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",humor life and love friends is one of those series that you watch a thousand of times and dont get tired one episode is like twenty minutes of therapy,POSITIVE,Comedy
2477,8.0,8 August 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends always and forever will be a timeless classic its hilarious has the best writing ive ever seen in a sitcom and has some of the best characters ever created and got the perfect actors to play the parts the way this show captures your s as a part of your life that youre grown up but not grown up is perfect the relationships that developed throughout friends are wonderful and kept me watching you can learn so many lessons from friends too its the easiest show to just watch sit back and laugh all the while getting heavily invested in the characters and feeling youre their actual friends and wanting the best for them if you somehow havent watched this show this needs to be the next show on your list even if youre not a big sitcom fan i really dont know how anyone could dislike friends,POSITIVE,Comedy
2478,10.0,29 July 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",its not easy to maintain something this funny for years without disappointing they made it look too easy but it isnt as easy as it looks characters and their relationship extending for funny crazy and emotional episodes and delivering such good hearted comedy is iconic everyone loves the environment and by the end of all seasons well have a mental map of all houses and places they hang out thats more than just a connection casting is just brilliant no review is complete without characters phoebe buffay the crazy one monica geller competitive clean freak rachel green dramatic and cute one ross geller the smart one chandler bing the funny one joey tribbiani the sexy one everyone portrayed so well that some people still remember them with their screen names guide to sitcoms outstanding impact made by characters on viewers watch out for cameos they are too good a fun ride overall,POSITIVE,Comedy

2481,8.0,2 August 2002,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",once you get past the fact that the people on friends have been the same age for years have switched the number to their apartment buildings and would not have enough money to own a beautiful apartment on the village with a wonderful viewyou can see that friends is a wonderful show with creative writing humor good acting and even sometimes morals the storyline in friends evolves each season to something new and unexpected all though if you really get down to it the show is not about friends that spend a freakish amount of time together it is about the ever changing relationship between rachel and ross because if it did not have that story line i guess you can say it has no plot and it would be referred as seinfeld but the thing that isolates friends from all the other shows is that no matter what is happening in the series or the real world it will always put a smile on your face,POSITIVE,Comedy

2517,9.0,2 November 2011,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is honestly my favorite show of all time i feel this way for many reasons first of all the cast is outstanding they have a chemistry that seems effortless each actor sincerely is that character secondly its funny i challenge anyone to sit through any episode of friends and not laugh at least once it would be very difficult the wittiness of the show makes each joke or punchline new and entertaining lastly the show obviously had amazing people working behind the scenes the directors the writers the producers etc many other shows cant hold an audiences attention for even one season let alone making it through ten throughout each season friends just got better and better the only thing wrong with this show is that they stopped filming,POSITIVE,Comedy
2518,10.0,25 November 2012,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",it can be the best tv comedy ever i literally crack up in every line the plot is well written the characters are welldeveloped even the supporting characters like gunther is yummy to watch they succeeded in not only making a sitcom but also making it live after several seasons i feel like i do know them its not like youre watching a show its like you set a secret camera to stalk on your dear six irritating but very interesting neighbors at first i love one character then turn to another now i cant decide i love them all i do recommend friends to everyone but be wary it can take you like a useless week doing nothing but watching it its really addictive,POSITIVE,Comedy
2519,10.0,18 February 2019,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i usually dont like to be mean about shows or movies im pretty much ok with the idea that everybody likes different stuff live and let live however when i feel that there has been serious misjustice done in the world of comedyhumor i cant stay silent the very reputation of the words funny comedy humor and hilarious has been irreparably damaged by shows like this there are many shows presently and in the past that have done this but they were usually very easily identified and correctly put in their place in the ol subpar category however after seeing the rating this show has received i felt it was my duty to dispel the ridiculous rating of as of and one should not be deceived by such numbers ok friends this is a show for people with a bland generic tame underdeveloped andor a nonexistent sense of humor who want to feel like theyre normal people that have a good sense of humor but alas it may be genetic or it may be environmental but there is simply a large segment of the population that are incapable of distinguising what is genuinely funny its not their fault they cant change its too late but we dont want to make them sad or feel left out so thats the reason shows like this one are created this show labels itself a sitcom but it seems that it couldnt make up its mind on whether to be a sitcom a dramedy or a soap opera for teenagersearly somethings but i understand why it has this identity crisis if youre catering to the audience i described in the previous paragraph you know that because of their underdeveloped sense of humor they would not be able to keep their attention on the show if it was more strictly comedyhumordriven with maybe a drop of dramasentimentality here and there think along the lines of the king of queens so big batches of noncomedy time needed to be dumped into to friends the range of humor these people get is so limited that the show couldnt expect to fill more than minutes of comedy and they had to keep them tuned in for the whole minutes of airtime so this is where the terrible or amazing to friends fans filler came in if you think all that sounds appealing or you know youre in the demographic of being humordeficient then by all means watch friends you will love and enjoy it theres nothing wrong with that thats what its there for people like youself but to those reading this that like to laugh at things that are actually funny and enjoy the many facets and types of comedy in the world i urge you not to watch this show as chunks of your sense of humor may wither and die if subjected to friends in any amount fyi i dont like to rate things star because it kinda makes me feel sad so i had to come up with reasons to give this tv show starts the reasons i came up with are as follows courteney cox gets a lot of cool points in my book because she was in bruce springsteens video for dancing in the dark and shes hot lisa kudrow was in an episode of a truly funny show cheers and she had black hair in it and she was sexy with black hair ok stars justified now goodbye,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2520,2.0,30 September 2008,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i was hooked from the first episode i saw the witty characters the funny oneliners the sometimes unfortunate timing in the lives of the people portrayed it all came together so perfectly everyone who watches friends easily finds a character he or she can relate to monica with her obsessive need to clean the apartment and sometimes its not even her apartment chandler with his motherissues phoebe who is so clueless sometimes anyway when the series ended it was like loosing a bunch of friends of my own and i gladly spend an afternoon now and then revisiting them and laughing as hard as the first time cause it is its timeless comedic style the makes friends what it is a wonderful show for everyone who knows about friendship and what it takes to make it work,POSITIVE,Comedy

2522,10.0,23 September 2005,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends in my opinion is the best television show ever and i was devastated when it ended after the tenth series all of the actors portray unique and incredibly funny characters and manage to keep the atmosphere and character relation throughout the whole ten years a review that i just read on the main page of friends claims that their favorite are in this order chandlerperry rossschwimmer phoebekudrow monicacoxarquette rachelaniston and lastly joeyleblanc this could not be more off my favorite characters in order from worst to best ross the only character that i hate he has very little funny lines and does not bring the atmosphere to the show that the other charactersactors do he is geeky and annoying and takes ten minutes to get out one sentence also the fact that the characternothing to do with the actor at all always tries to get rachel and cheats on her and wants her again and then marries another woman and then wants her again etc i find ross to be a pointless and pathetic character probably only added into the show to have an even mix of malefemale characters phoebe even though phoebe is my fifth favorite she is a very good character phoebe is the ditzy one that believes in fate and spirits phoebe is very strange and while seemingly innocent can be very dirty at times she delivers many funny moments and adds to the show joey joey is an italian from queens who is an actor though usually out of work or in dead end plays joeys incredible stupidity also adds to the show he is also the ladies man and tough guy of the show his lack of intimate feelings being the focus of many of the plot points about joey chandler chandler is also a great character all of his one liners make up the best part of the show but he just gets a tiny bit annoying chandlers parents divorced before he was which gave him some psychological problems luckily for viewers these problems bring humour chandler is a great character who is acted well by matthew perry monica monica is the skinny competitive prissy and perfect one monica is a chef and she strives for excellence in everything and will never give up a fight even though she wins at virtually everything her parents have always favoured ross over her which also adds humour rachel rachel is my favorite character in the show simply because she is the uptown spoiled one when rachel first moves to manhattan after running out on her wedding she still uses her parents credit cards and has never had a job she is witty and funny and brings a lot to the show the only drawback of rachel is that she falls in love with disgusting ross which is a real shame with the exception of ross friends is easily the best funniest television show ever and i give it,POSITIVE,Comedy
2523,9.0,17 January 2015,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",it is the best show ever it is funny it is classy it has drama it has romance it has love and more importantly it has sarcasm by chandler i have watched the whole series a couple of times and once you watch it you cannot get enough of it it is really that great i would love to see a movie of friends it is the best show ever it is funny it is classy it has drama it has romance it has love and more importantly it has sarcasm by chandler i have watched the whole series a couple of times and once you watch it you cannot get enough of it it is really that great i would love to see a movie of friends,POSITIVE,Comedy

2554,9.0,30 November 2015,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",what else is left to be said about this masterpiece sitcom all sitcoms since this aired tries to use the formula that this show has shows like how i met your mother relies heavily on the perceived successful formula friends is unique it features six of the most lovable flawed characters that you could hope to meet they each have endearing characteristics and hilarious quirks from series one the scriptwriters had molded their characters perfectly and none of them swayed from how we knew them each show had at least two themes running through it each character had their starring moments the jokes and laughs were shared out equally among the cast i cant recall a single episode that fell short in any way even the secondary characters that appeared in just a few episodes were wonderful the janice character popped up at least once in every series and was a great addition to the slick team ross monicas parents were funny as was phoebes brother its kinda wrong to pick out a favorite character from the main six as they were all great in their own way every screenwriter in this genre would love to be able to create a friends but it requires more than one great writer you need a great team of writers to keep the standards high but just as importantly you need the right actorsactresses this is the benchmark for all sitcoms perfection,POSITIVE,Comedy
2555,8.0,6 April 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is probably the most wellknown us sitcom in the world and upon watching its clear to see why the dynamic created by the main characters is unbeatable their relationships with each other make every episode fun and endearing to watch for a show of series or around this episodes each its ability to stay fresh and relevant throughout each series is remarkable its ability to resonate with all generations is also admirable as with all sitcoms some of the humour becomes repetitive or a storyline may take an odd turn but as sitcoms go it is a tough one to beat if nothing else give it a watch to enjoy that feeling around season where you know youve got another to come,POSITIVE,Comedy
2556,1.0,25 May 2006,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",its basically understandable and welcomed even in china mainland by those who are not good in english and live in a totally different background mainly wade through the lines and dialogues by chinese captions unfortunately most likely its translated by some idiots from hong kong full of stupid mistakes like translate massage as message or straight sex as something not bent probably make chinese who totally depend on the caption be confused with american humor what i want to emphasize is even if with so many obstacles it makes chinese laugh my favorite is chandler i wonder how can he figure out those witty jokes always immediately you know those are not meaningless trashes but always to the point and avoid awkward or stressful atmospheres chandler is the key of this comedy other four people except monica perform very well too my only disappointment is monica shes old and appearencely not suitable for playing rosss once fat younger sister and chandlers wife the two actors are respectively two and three of her junior more importantly i dont think her performance is funny at all especially when she was teased in restaurant kitchen by hostile kitchen staff and she toasted at her parents anniversary i felt sorry for her but not funny her action is formulaized yell at people while twist her body and arms staring with blank eyes that can fit any lines or maybe none like joeys australian girlfriend in one episode said shes loud for such a small person and i think shes annoying too,NEGATIVE,Comedy

2558,10.0,5 January 2008,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i registered in imdb just to write a comment on friends because i have to that is the least i can do for this great show there is not a single episode in their seasons thats not funny its so amazing how the creators and writers made each friend with a distinct character and how they evolve through those characteristics through long seasons i have watched most of highly rated comedy shows but i have never laughed as hard as watching friends and i know i never will maybe because friends set the bar too high friends was a show out of this world i cant believe how so many lame shows go on for so many seasons and they had to stop this show friends lord of the comedies i have watched through most seasons for many times and i will continue it for a long long time because i never can get tired of their jokes,POSITIVE,Comedy
2559,10.0,15 May 2024,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends has long been cherished for its humor heart and the deep connections between its six main characters over ten seasons the series delivered countless laughs and poignant moments making it a cornerstone of television comedy however as a dedicated fan i feel compelled to voice my strong disapproval and emotional hurt over a particular storyline that deeply undermined the shows legacy the romantic involvement between joey and rachel in the latter part of the series is not only a glaring misstep but an outright betrayal of the characters and the fans ross and rachel were always portrayed as soulmates their tumultuous relationship serving as a central beloved thread throughout the series to see joey and rachel have a romantic affair was nothing short of a violation of his characters integrity and the trust of the audience this storyline was not only unnecessary but also deeply insensitive it felt as though the writers completely disregarded the emotional investment that fans had in ross and rachels relationship the idea that joey a character depicted as a loyal and caring friend would act in such a way is not just implausible but offensive it suggests that friendships cannot be trusted and that betrayal is inevitable which is a damaging message to send i am genuinely upset and emotionally damaged by this turn of events its shocking and disheartening that the creators chose to pursue such a controversial and hurtful storyline the decision to depict joey and rachels affair reflects a lack of sensitivity and understanding of the fanbases emotional connection to the characters its a glaring miscalculation that left many fans feeling betrayed and disillusioned friends will always hold a special place in my heart but this particular plot twist has cast a long shadow over an otherwise exceptional series its a reminder that even the best shows can falter when they lose sight of what made them special the creators should have explored different more respectful storylines that honored the characters and the fans emotional investment,NEGATIVE,Comedy

2566,3.0,20 November 2015,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i realized that one of the closest things to my heart is going to end forever six episodes before the last so much so that despite being a contained person as myself i began posting constant whatsapp statuses about it talking to all my friends everywhere how it was all going to be over for me forever then came the second last episode two days later after watching that episode i couldnt bear to watch the last one not just because all of it was going to get over but also because the way it was supposedly going to get over i knew ross and rachel would end up together but monicas house would be gone the group wont be hanging out any more at least not as often as they used to everyone was getting settled in their life i had come to terms with the fact that it was going to end but this way i cant even imagine them beyond the series when harry potter series ended it was devastating for me but at least it ended on a note that gave me the thread to extend it post the ending to imagine how their daily lives might be like the second last episode of friends however made me immensely sad two days later i shut my room and saw the last episode of friends it was the best ending ever i will tell you how i will avoid the spoilers those who know the ending know how perfect it is despite all the fears that accumulate on watching the second last apart from that i cherish the fact that now they are a part of my life now i have the chance to rerun the whole series which i am doing currently and watch it from the perspective of different characters and i must tell you it is just as funny and light hearted as it was when i watched it for the first time it wont be a hyperbole to call friends a classic it is hands down the most famous series ever made years post its pilot people are still watching it and enjoying it more than the current running series friends is the scale the quality of other series are measured in comparison to its standard despite its yesteryear limitations of technology they were using flip mobile phones in their last season guest roles that would hardly excite the current generation the storyline theme and dialogues of the series are so timeless that they have achieved eternity and so you still find taylor swift adele and many other major artists talking about watching the series like it were something still being telecast for the first time just likes its eternity making it cut through generations it is a series which no matter how many times you watch it will make you feel the same way it did for the first time it is the best stress buster it is friends,POSITIVE,Comedy
2567,2.0,31 May 2007,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",its one of the simplest ideas for a show just friends who share their lives together but that is part of what makes it so wonderful the friends and actors have such a great understanding and connection with each other it makes you want to be their friends all of them chandler joey monica pheobe rachel and ross have their own personalities but yet still have that bond with each other and also because of the personalities being so diverse it is quite funny chandler i know he is usually the favorite of everyone and yes he is my favorite probably since i can relate to him the most i certainly use sarcasm a lot and see his point of view most of the time joey he is the most childish out of the but thats what you grow to love about him sure he makes some dumb mistakes im not gonna lie but theres still a certain cuteness about him you cant deny monica i relate to monica quite a bit too from her competitiveness to her ocd cleanliness everything has to be perfect sometimes that works in her favor and other times not so much pheobe while she can be completely blonde at some times no offense meant i am blonde as well she is mostlikely the one whos the most wise out of all of them having grown up on the streets she isnt afraid to defend herself yet is such a caring and gentle person rachel i find her to be the most annoying mainly because of how selfish she can be but there are times where i agree with her and she did make it without her fathers help ross he can be whinny and needy however theres still something about him that you cant quite place but that makes you want to see what hell do next overall this is one of my favorite shows to watch in the entire seasons they never run out of hilarious jokes fabulous story lines or those special bonds that make a friend,POSITIVE,Comedy
2568,5.0,19 August 2024,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i have to admit i watched this show many many times because it was and still is constantly on tv ok the characters can be funny and relatable at times but there are a lot of not funny moments and you hear the laugh track i find chandler the funniest i hate ross phoebe and joey maybe joey is not so bad but he is too stupid and unbelievable as a womanizer and how can he live in ny with no money i think the best and funniest episode is when everybody finds out but the problem is i cant mention a second best no there is not one that comes close to this one funny that more of the actors said that this episode was their favorite i wonder if they could name a second favorite so overall i gave that is a pass mark according to me because there were some sweet moments in the show but nothing spectacular i dont really understand how it became so popular,POSITIVE,Comedy

2622,8.65,3 January 2009,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",hey fans you can go to this site to vote for a friends movie there never has been a sitcom that truly pictures life among the singles twentysomething as good as this show does its not just comedy it presents the episodes in such a way that one can truly identify with the situations they face so the audience has something to talk about in coffee shops too the humor is universal i feel like im part of the group every time i watch it because i feel the different emotions they go through plus of course it is so much fun because its fastpaced every scene and every moment is relative to what is going to happen next so you dont feel like it is dragging you onto nothing just like how a sitcom should be funny,POSITIVE,Comedy
2623,8.65,2 April 2012,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i did not just watch a tv series for fun although it was really fun i also lived with friends and i did learn so much im not the same person before friends you can barely find something that makes you laugh in the meantime teaches you watching friend you get everything you want laughing crying learning annoying sadness happiness im young and i still havent had sex but i think now after finishing friends i know a lot about it and i think it will help me handle my sexual life it helped me overcome my little sexual obsessions im not going to adore friends unwisely with all infatuations it has its own flaws but it does have some hidden layers while you watch it the things between friends and how they deal with their issues thats really instructive and sometimes inspirational i learned how to get along with people i love and how unselfish we should be at some critical points i learned how sometimes we should be submissive and ignore ourselves how to be compassionate about our important individuals how to speak without talking actually i dont know how i learned that from the series but i did chandler always gets right to the point without wasting your time directly to the ultimate point he is the very moment joker who never gets clichéd and is always fresh phoebe is extremely creative and comes up with ideas that amaze the audience with its novelty not clichéd at all rachel has the greatest heart which you can hear her heartbeats after all if i am to choose one of friends to be with thats for sure ross i used to be a little monica but im definitely chandlerross im not saying these because i adore these two characters so im trying to say im like them besides maybe no one really cares who im alike the most but with this arrangement of characters i think every specific audience can find hisher lookalike to some accuracies thats the strength of friends of course there are clichéd sequences at the series that sometimes are hard to avoid because patterns can be not enough like when theyre apparently unwilling to do something and they come to an agreement not to do that thing but suddenly someone breaks the ice and others follow actually i dont consider these repetitive sequences as a serious shortcoming for two reasons first the series is really long and after some time one way or another repetition comes to the way and second we cannot say we dont have those repetitions in our routine lives so its going to be ok because the series is a model of real life at some moments they really annoy you like there have been some times that i was just like god i hate phoebe stop that but compared to the scenes you are thankful of the series cast those annoying moments are unbelievably nothing chandler running into janice is really really really annoying theseries is not ideal but compared to other motion pictures it sure is a masterpiece i wont regret watching this show,POSITIVE,Comedy
2624,8.65,22 April 2022,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",you know the shows not funny when they have to put a background sound of people laughing in order to trick you into doing it the most overhyped show ive ever seen,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2625,8.65,21 October 2002,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i am glad to see that i am not the only one who thinks that friends is just a big waste of time and talent and i use the word talent here looselyi have tried to watch friends on many occasions and it has never made me laugh i think the plots are lame the jokes are stupid and the characters are certainly not people that i would consider being friends with how this show can be the show in america right now is beyond me also by reading a lot of the comments here from friends fans i have determined that the average friends fan has the intelligence and maturity level of a six yearold child not everybody enjoys watching this brainkilling garbage so get over it already,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2626,8.65,17 October 2024,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i started bingewatching a few weeks back and its where you get seriously involved as one of the characters in the episode you get to feel chandlers jokes monicas neuroticism and rosss evercomplicated love life each character brings something unique making their interactions both hilarious and heartfelt rachel green embodies the journey of selfdiscovery starting as a waitress her transformation into a fashion executive is inspiring her onagain offagain relationship with ross adds depth showcasing her struggles with love and independence you cant help but root for her as she navigates the challenges of adulthood monica geller rosss competitive sister brings a mix of humor and heart her obsessive cleanliness often leads to comedic moments but her passion for cooking and her journey toward finding love with chandler make her character relatable watching her grow from a neurotic chef to a devoted wife and mother is both touching and entertaining phoebe buffay is the wild card of the group her quirky personality and unique outlook on life are refreshing from her hilarious songs like smelly cat to her unconventional backstory phoebe reminds us to embrace our individuality her relationship with mike showcases her ability to love deeply adding layers to her freespirited nature chandler bing is the bingking of sarcasm with a wit that often hides his insecurities his journey from a job he hates to finding fulfillment through love with monica is compelling chandlers humor serves as comic relief yet it also reveals his vulnerability making him one of the most relatable characters in the group joey tribbiani is the lovable goofball who captures our hearts with his charm and innocence his simplemindedness leads to many laughoutloud moments especially with his infamous pickup lines despite his superficial pursuits joeys loyalty and bigheartedness shine through reminding us of the importance of friendship ross geller is the intellectual with a knack for romantic entanglements his passion for paleontology and his complicated relationship with rachel drive much of the series drama rosss quirks and memorable catchphrases like we were on a break add humor while also showcasing his growth throughout the series the chemistry among these six characters is electric you find yourself laughing crying and cheering them on as they navigate lifes ups and downs together their stories remind us of the importance of friendship love and being there for one another even after finishing the series the characters linger in your mind making you feel like youve lost friends rather than just characters on a screen in a world where time feels fleeting friends offers a comforting escape reminding us of the importance of laughter and connection its truly goat stuff a show that never leaves your heart,POSITIVE,Comedy
2627,8.65,7 March 2009,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",what is so great about this show is that it is so universally loved everybody has heard of friends i cant think of anyone who doesnt like it and its comedy is suitable for both sexes and almost any ages even my mom would like this show and she never watches situationcomedies heck she hardly watches anything american at all and its status is well earned friends is very funny who can not laugh of chandler and joeys crazy situations ideas and personalities who doesnt find rosss dimwitted ability to make a fool out of himself funny who can resist phoebes eccentricities everyone laughs when monicas competitive instinct takes charge of the situation and rachelyes rachel i just saw this episode where she had an infection in her eye but refused taking eye drops the other had to bend her down on the floor to get the drops in her eye that was a big laugh in addition jennifer aniston is definitely one of this earths most beautiful women that should count for something to if you asked the whole world what the best situation comedy is friends would win by a mile,POSITIVE,Comedy
2628,8.65,13 January 2019,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i adore friends but ive watched it all the way through several times and i keep finding more and more plot holes like why do they all seem to have multiple birthdays and why was rachel in season but not until season it makes no sense still an enjoyable show if you dont focus on that stuff too hard,POSITIVE,Comedy
2629,8.65,18 August 2024,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",my wife and i have probably watched this entire series fifteen times beginning to end whenever there is nothing good to watch and that is more often the case than not today friends is our goto for a warm familiar yet still hilarious alternative the show has taken on a more poignant dimension with the loss of matthew perry but his are still our favorite scenes friends is the perfect machine remove any piece and the machine wouldnt work behindthescenes documentaries always stress how close the cast members were in real life and that comes through in every frame of the show everyone is having a great time and the fun is infectious the huge irony is that we never watched the show during its original run but were more than making up for it in syndication,POSITIVE,Comedy
2630,8.65,28 May 2019,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i loved this show i saw every episode if not times each i will say i sometimes just want to buy all the seasons i thought the cast is good the acting was great a good look at reality when you move out on your own,POSITIVE,Comedy
2631,8.65,26 July 2024,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i mean seriously how can you not love this show it became the framework for hundreds of shows to come in the years that followed its release it also shaped a generation of people the humour they would have and their approach to romance and friendship its not only one of the most comforting shows ever created but also one of the most vital shows to its genre and television as a whole it made you connect with people who were simultaneously relatable and entirely unique at the same time whether its chandlers ability to turn any situation into a joke or rosss inability to stay collected in pressured situations you find a way of seeing yourself in the words and actions brought to life by these brilliant and surprisingly underrated actors yes its mainstream in every sense of the word but it also needs to be understood that it was all for one reason it changed the world whether you can admit it or not,POSITIVE,Comedy
2632,8.65,29 May 2018,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",so no one told you life was gonna be this way your jobs a joke youre broke your love lifes doa its like youre always stuck in second gear when it hasnt been your day your week your month or even your year but ill be there for you when the rain starts to pour ill be there for you like ive been there before ill be there for you cause youre there for me too youre still in bed at ten and work began at eight youve burned your breakfast so far things are going great your mother warned you thered be days like these but she didnt tell you when the world has brought you down to your knees and ill be there for you when the rain starts to pour ill be there for you like ive been there before ill be there for you cause youre there for me too no one could ever know me no one could ever see me seems youre the only one who knows what its like to be me someone to face the day with make it through all the rest with someone ill always laugh with even at my worst im best with you yeah its like youre always stuck in second gear when it hasnt been your day your week your month or even your year ill be there for you when the rain starts to pour ill be there for you like ive been there before ill be there for you cause youre there for me too ill be there for you ill be there for you ill be there for you cause youre there for me too,POSITIVE,Comedy
2633,8.65,8 April 2022,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",possibly the least funniest thing known to man the laugh track will not make something funny awful show poorly written terrible characters over episodes of absolutely awful awful american attempts at comedy if i could rate lower than one star i would,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2634,8.65,8 January 2003,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",the show has had its time and maybe it is time to move on the show began slowly in my opinion but hit its stride by the second season when rachel and ross finnaly got to together but that never lasted the third season was a bit boring at times but then the fourth season was the best it was funny from the jellyfish episode to the wedding in london then came the fifth season which was great at times until the monica chandler love affair was reavealed the next two two years chandler got less funny and rachel became a evil evil person monica became a control freak the seventh season was the worst but it picked up last year and now i am waiting for the ninth season will ross and rachel just sort it out and get together,POSITIVE,Comedy
2635,8.65,7 March 2009,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends did pretty much rule american comedy culture and one of the most popular programmes in the world the premise of the sitcom is about six friends from new york starting in their mid s and goes into their s they are rachel green a woman working in the fashion industry ross gellar a paleontologist who is in love with rachel monica gellar ross sister rachels best friend and a successful chef chandler bing an office manager ross university roommate and later marries monica joey tribbiani an actor who loves women and food and finally phoebe buffay a masseuse and the most bohemian of the group friends had some top writers working on the show and kept it consituenly funny also had drama and strong character development and you see how they all change everyone has a favourite character my was chancellor this is comfort viewing it doesnt matter how many times you have seen it you can just easily watch it over and over again i grew up with friends and like the simpsons at its peak a highlight of how good american television can be friends was also able to employ top guest stars such as bruce willis tom selleck and hank azaria the key actors all had a excellent comedic timing and friends always did well at the emmys there are some problems in later series joey slowly becomes more dumber when friends started joey was not as well read as the other character but he wasnt stupid however his intelligence level fell as the show progressed also ross become more nonionic and phoebe is made more wacky and less realist as a character friends is comfort viewing,POSITIVE,Comedy
2636,8.65,8 June 2019,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this show is amazing no other sitcom is even comparable to this one all characters joey phoebe rachel chandler monica and ross are seriously my best friends thanks to this amazing show all comic timings and scenes are superb acting is awsome and emotional scenes are so good that i always get tears in my eyes this is an amazing experience more than just a show and people who dont like this seriously have no sense of humor,POSITIVE,Comedy
2637,8.65,29 May 2000,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is really the best comedy on the net next to the british men behaving badly ok i admit they have their weak episodes and there also was a season i didnt like that much but that can happen overall very good i especially like ross the museum nerd chandler the gaylike weirdo and rachel kind of a stuck up spoilt person the other three are not bad either but they are more standard in their jokes and dont surprise me as much as the others and they dont make me laugh as much if id have to rate it id give it an out of,POSITIVE,Comedy
2638,8.65,21 July 2019,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i love i ove i loveeeeee my best comedy shiw i have ever seen,POSITIVE,Comedy
2639,8.65,2 July 2019,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",im a huge fan of comedy in general and this show never failed to make me laugh it was little slow to me at first but it got more interesting as the first season progressed chandler and phoebe are my favorite,POSITIVE,Comedy
2640,8.65,27 June 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",the play means a lot to me when i was extremely depressed i basically expected to watch the play without stopping to save my mood over and over again then theres another thing i always believe and want to tell myself everything will be ok,POSITIVE,Comedy
2641,8.65,20 January 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",yes i had friends who loved friends i however was not one of them whether its because i found the entire premise to be far fetched and antidotal or because i disliked the characters themselves i cant be certain each of the troupes were shallow and flat no matter how good the actor or actresses were when attempting to breathe life into them not unlike other shows which dominated the airwaves it was not a must see and i found better use of my time that hasnt changed age hasnt improved it this is still an empty hallow time waster,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2642,8.65,8 January 2005,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",the sitcom is the best ive ever seenim not really a tv person but once i watched one episodei became completely sucked inthe actors are greatit was so reali cried each time ross and rachel went on a breaki laughed every time chandler did his dance or made some sarcastic comment about something or someonei laughed each time joey guarded his food with his lifeit was always fun to see monica freak out about something and chandler fixed everythingthough that rarely happenedphoebes songs were always funnyall six of them were greati dont think friends would have been as much fun or successif there had been a different casti have to say i feel really sad now that it has endedmy elder brother and i are the greatest fans of friends everwe cant make up our minds which character we like bestthey are all awesomei am yet to see a sitcom that would be as funnyinterestingheartwarming and great as friendsnone can even come close,POSITIVE,Comedy
2643,8.65,11 May 2019,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",an absolutely perfect sitcom immensely funny with great characters and a well written drama element o,POSITIVE,Comedy
2644,8.65,26 July 2019,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this is by far the best sitcom i have ever watched having watched other immensely successful sitcoms like the office i would ascertain the character development in friends is incredible most of the characters by the end of the show did not change their character from what it was at the beginning of the show there were too many moments that were emotionally connected to me which is where david and marta kaufmann done a fabulous job monica has this finicky character which some of the audience might not like but her other aspects more than make for it initially chandlers character looked the most comical during the first two seasons but after that joeys character stood out to best in the series throwing up with instantaneous jokes that would tickle most of the bones in our body the scene where joey is asked to describe the relationship between monica and chandler and add something about the love he consciously uses alliteration with lovingsharinggivingtaking even after he inadvertently uses a better description of how they meant to him that is the best scene of the series,POSITIVE,Comedy
2645,8.65,2 February 2007,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",has change mine and a lot of my friends lives not original but brilliant sad that it ended though the characters are interesting well written lovable and everyone can relate to one of them who hasnt said a chandler quote its good to see an american sitcom that isnt stereotypical with the american dream so prevalent theres no big houses quiet suburbs stereotypical teenagers and doesnt bother with hard pressing issues such as drugs this show reminds us why we have so much american tv because all the other channels want there own friends when it ended it was an end of an fantastic era and this sitcom will go down as the most influential ever,POSITIVE,Comedy
2646,8.65,20 August 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",the best part is marcel and even thats pushing it if you took out the laugh track i am convinced no one would know when there was a joke a good of the jokes if you can call them that are someone says something wacky and goofy and then another character makes a silly face and the laugh track goes nuts if i had a billion dollars i would buy the rights to friends recall every dvd reedit every streaming platforms versions and remove the laugh track and rerelease them to the public and see if people still think its good,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2647,8.65,3 December 2004,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",since friends officially walked out of monica and chandlers apartment to the great central perk for their last cup of coffee i have bought all eight seasons of friends on dvd and watched every one of them i am impatiently waiting for seasons nine and ten over the years i have sadly watched the final episodes of some of my favorite shows such as mash seinfeld bob newhart and frasier to name a few the ending of friends was a very poignant time for me and my family for ten years my daughters and i waited for thursday nights to watch our favorite tv showfriends joey ross chandler monica rachel and phoebe were indeed our friends as we loved each character through the investment of the friends dvds they will remain a part of our lives forever,POSITIVE,Comedy
2648,8.65,30 August 2024,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i cant begin to describe how much i love this show since i was a teenager and watched it on tv today i watch the same episodes again and again and is like watching it for the st time the thrill i feel of what is going to happen next if rachel and ross will end up together monica and chandler is like the first time i watched it and that is what makes a show classic you never get bored of the jokes or the plot and all the charecters are lovable also its good to see matthew acting although feeling sad about him not being around friends is a treasure to humanity i love all the episodes,POSITIVE,Comedy
2649,8.65,8 October 2019,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",the shows cast seem to be good friends however i believe being hollywood for so long it seems like that might have decreased and thats a shame because i think people need to laugh more like i did and still do when i see these my favorite characters were joey and chandler but phoebe and rachel were great too ross was good when he went on his rage episodes and interactions with the group and poor monica did her best but some scenes seemed too much although she was needed for the story great show and wish they could reunite,POSITIVE,Comedy
2650,8.65,13 July 2013,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i have seen this tv series for several times it is a really good sitcom it brings me a lot of happiness the series is just normal peoples life but it shows us the happy part of life it affected me and even changed some of my view on life anyway it is good and give me a lot of happiness thanks for the team of friends i like chandler for the most he always has jokes and the next one is monica she is manipulating but it make the comedy be more like our normal life and rachel she is beautiful i like also her movies although they are not that as good as friends and joey he seems to be not smart and that brings a lot jokes ross is fine his english is good and his love for rachel gives us the feeling life is good although the end of the series makes us sad to some extent i dont like phoebe for i think she is not that friendly to china china is not as what she thought she shall come to china know china and then give her comments,POSITIVE,Comedy
2651,8.65,25 April 2024,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",before watching the friends someone how many best friends do you have me zero after watching the friends someone how many best friends do you have me i have best friends someone can you say names me chandler monica joey rachel ross phoebe the best show i ever feel to watch them after watching the whole seasons i feel like why they finished with seasons why not more anyway watching again and again and will be watching lifelong i feel like i have best friends who wont leave me forever in my life friends show dont deserve because it deserves,POSITIVE,Comedy
2652,8.65,23 March 2019,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i unsurprisingly admit that this is yet the greatest show ever and the greatest cast member of all time and not to forget gunther the stars has it all i still wish that there will be a movie as a sequel for the show heartbroken,POSITIVE,Comedy
2653,8.65,9 January 2022,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",at first it feels good makes you happy but not so much in the rerun and its the background laughter that makes it more funnier but the casting was perfect each and every character did their job really well infact it was the characters that made the story good or else it was an average story specifically rossjoeychandlermonica rachelphoebegunthercarol and susan,POSITIVE,Comedy
2654,8.65,3 July 2019,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i wont lie the show did have its moments and made me laugh there were also some heartwarming moments and memorable scenes however friends are highly abusive the abuse is knit under all those seemingly incessant jokes rachel and ross relationship is highly toxic there is no respect for characters outside of circle they are only there so the main characters could make fun of them its promoting herd mentality but the main characters are not saved either everyone is being devalued and shamed consistently outside of humor there is really no story going on or anything of value on the other side it is also promoting unrealistic life expectations for young adults the office for example makes fun of its characters all the time but never in devaluing or hurtful way instead you come to love all these personalities and their quirks it is completely opposite with friends yuck,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2655,8.65,27 May 2004,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i was a late blooming friends fan i didnt begin to watch the show until at first i was appalled by the way they all slept around but as i was able to view the show in syndication from the beginning i became a permanent and ardent fan who wouldnt love these ohsohuman girls and guys next door the actors are superb and in my opinion too good for the material they were given for the most part the characters are believable but some of the stuff more than borders on the ridiculous somehow however each episode is nothing short of hilarious we hurt when ross and rachel break up we fervently wish chandler would find someone to love him for himself we pray to god that joey doesnt get an incurable disease and we are drawn into these hopeful young peoples lives and made to feel like were also sharing a cuppa joe and listening intently to monicas dating problems or phoebes horrendous songs i am not ashamed to admit that i cried when the last episode was aired it was like seeing my children leave the nest and fly on their own this show makes you care that much i would personally like to thank everyone involved therell never be another show like friends,POSITIVE,Comedy
2656,8.65,23 December 2014,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",it was summer when i had watched the pilot episode of this show during that time i think i have also found six friends in my life who really know how i feel how im doing and how i struggle in life so the series goes and the gang found a reason to change who they used to be we have witnessed their challenges their sacrifices the love that was lost and found and how they coped with it by the help of each other ibthink its the strength of the show awesome characters and a perfect scriptwriting friends knows how to depict the reality of twentysomethings life by adding comedy to it though there will be a really dreary moments in which you cant help the niagara falls flowing from your eyes but there are also moments when they can drive you crazy by making you cry like a baby and cackle at the same time for the past ten years months to me friends really captured my heart and teach me countless lessons in life that i will truly treasure for the rest of my existing this is the only show that i think i will watch for nth time i am really gonna miss this it feels like i lost my friends the grieving feels like death amazing friends with their amazing antics and there comes the nostalgic feeling again its so hard they were more than characters they became our friends i cant let you go phoebe joey chandler ross rachel monica i will be forever thankful sighs,POSITIVE,Comedy

2663,8.65,18 June 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",im not saying that its the worst show ever and its horrible but if you want to watch a comedy there are so many better options i found the storyline repetitive and the characters never really change or grow its one of those shows thats so trendy and thats why you watch it,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2664,8.65,11 February 2002,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is definitely the best tv series ever if you have never seen it you wont regret for spend half an hour in front of the tv its a comedy series about friends that have to learn by theirselves how to survive in new york it wont be easy but will be very funny if you see it youll love it,POSITIVE,Comedy

2669,8.65,26 June 2019,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",back then friends was the nonplusultra a new genre of sitcom that worked on a lot of levels but the thing is that if you make something new there are a lot of mistakes that you can make others will watch it learn from it and make it better dont get me wrong friends is great and its cool nostalgia but a lot of episodes are boring fillers and sometimes the series will try to be funny or cringy so hard it really hurts it cant keep up compared to himym for example even knowing that the newer sitcoms really stole a lot of ideas from friends they still do a better job managing the episodes and keeping the characters interesting if there would be episodes less every season and a better more interesting storyline in the later seasons it would be truly a this review sounds very negative but i think friends is a great show this is just me trying to explain why i can not give,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2670,8.65,20 May 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",if you wanna enjoy hood laughs watch it from the later seasons because its not funny in the seasons as they didnt develop there yet good series very good and laughable,POSITIVE,Comedy
2671,8.65,11 September 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i dont understand why this show gets brought up in the same conversation as seinfeld this is drivel people who like friends are the same who like big bang theory im trying to make my review long enough if you like this show maybe you should turn off the tv and color,POSITIVE,Comedy
2672,8.65,27 April 2004,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends seems such an unoriginal idea newyorkers who just happen to be boys and girls with different career styles and personalities living and hanging out together i guess its all about the chemistry and the things you can do with the characters probably why it lasted a decade all the friends have interesting storylines ross espically and ones together its brilliantly written with great jokes a great sitcom strange to seem a great sitcom starring young people phoebe and joey are really funny characters their dumbness is the reason and their loveibility monica was a wonderfully sweet girl at the beginning with a sense of tidiness and bossiness but in the later series it seems shes been absolutely transformed into this loud bossy hardly sweet girl and i always wished for the old monica back ross maybe annoying to some but he does end up with the best lines sometimes in episodes rachel is overrated she may be a big star in real life being married to brad pitt but it doesnt make her the best character on the show as that goes to chandler whos always being funny and i dont care if the other characters dont like his jokes because i do the early series was better than the later series i wish phoebe married david instead of mike but its still great and watchable heres to friends a great series and a great decade,POSITIVE,Comedy
2673,8.65,25 November 2006,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is my favourite programme ever i especially like this particular episode joeys fridge brakes and he eats all of the food out of it chandler comes along and joey asks him how chandler wants to pay him chandler refuses as he no longer lives there ross comes along later and he pushes ross in to the fridge and blames chandler it continues and its well funny i love joey and my favourite girl has to be rachel because shes funny pretty and i just generally like jenifer anson in her movies shes much better than angalina jolie i cant bare her shes plastic brad was well to ugly for you and so is vince but its your choice lol zara fuk,POSITIVE,Comedy
2674,8.65,25 June 2019,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",an exceptional sitcom that can not be replace by any tvshow when i was first watching this show all i just expected was a light comedy so that could kill my time whenever i was boring but then as the seasons going up everything changedi then started to brought my emotional feelings the show was beyond than just a comedy it started to tear you apart drop you in tears at least in my exprience a guy who doesnt love romancecomedy at all i cried like a baby its so rare to see casts that dives really deeply into their characters that you wouldnt be able see if this is a show or real life it even changes a lot of my perpective about us human this show just shows me that people are so complex and complicated with all those various emotions our life with people around us are meant to be sometimes rough and sometimes smooth all we just need to do is to live up with that along with the emotions as we cant just expect our life with friends to be always happy this show not just gave me entertainment but also lessons of life at least in my opinion at the end sorry if my english are messy i am not really good at writing,POSITIVE,Comedy

2677,8.65,19 October 2002,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i think of this show being a modern day saved by the bell with rachel and ross being zach and kelly you just know they will end up together this show was redhot to me its first five or so seasons ever since monica aand chandler got together the show kind of fell apart and i have lost interest in it but it is still the best show on tv today and i will be collecting the dvd set,POSITIVE,Comedy
2678,8.65,9 December 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",you just fall in love with these characters you become friends with them pretty basic but amazing casting is perfect and writing is very perfect although some have criticized the producers for not hiring any black characters,POSITIVE,Comedy

2685,8.65,25 March 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",im totally biased when it comes to this tv show not only i grew up watching it ive actually accidentally memorized most of the lines because ive seen it all the way through at least times and im not one to exaggerate i know humour has changed and friends has a lot of issues such as homophobic and sexist jokes i dont really defend it on the matter and im the first one to feel personally offended by those but it was a progressive show for an early s mainstream comedy and there are very good parts of it that still make me laugh out loud my generation certainly has an emotional attachment to this show and i love rewatching it again and again and crying over keys every time,POSITIVE,Comedy
2686,8.65,25 June 2022,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is great there is so much to say about it i have always loved this show and have watched every episode so many times now ive decided that i cant watch it anymore because i no longer enjoy it in the same way i thought id actually stopped liking it altogether but when i saw the reunion it made me so happy i am so jealous of people who have never seen it and get to watch it for the first time i will just patiently wait until they do another season or something just like all the other shows and movies are doing also i would just like to say for the record that ross and rachel are an awful couple i have disliked them since it originally aired but couldnt work out why until i grew up i still like them individually and the best couple are carol and susan they should have had way more screen time it has also not aged very well in some ways but is still funny in other ways,POSITIVE,Comedy
2687,8.65,23 April 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends has to be the greatest overhyped garbage its unfunny weak scripts there is hardly any character specification or differentiation the characters are mainly copy of one another its annoying,NEGATIVE,Comedy

2694,8.65,9 February 2002,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i tried watching friends not long after it debut and was not too impressed this overrated sitcom is often poorly written and very predictable the cast is composed of six misfits which come across quite unfunny the humor is the usual for most s sitcoms with irresponsible and cheap sexual gagsit has however had its funny moments but they are few and far between this show while a ratings powerhouse for nbcis not a reflection of its writing i guess nonhumorous dysfunctional characters appeal to a large segment its a shame that well written sitcoms such as newsradio never got the ratings they deserved while a pathetic program such as friends scored big numbers,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2695,8.65,21 December 2018,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",never was a fan but watched a few episodes now they are repeating it on tv so i decided to watch from the beginning just saw episodes and is so dumb and stupid dont get what people see in this to give it a score of how can imdb score the same score they gave to the masterpiece and for sure the best sitcom ever seinfeld,POSITIVE,Comedy
2696,8.65,7 December 2002,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this series used to be so funny i mean it still is funny at times but as soon as the marriage seasons started first with emily then chandlermonica the series shifted slowly into soap opera hell chandler hashad the most brilliant sarchastic lines which really made the series more watchable why do the other friends pick on chandler and look upon him as a worthless jerk when hes about the most likeable character in the show always hints at him being less manly or something in his relationship with monica hes now the whipped dog always luuuvving his wife slowly becoming less and less funny now the series are sticky full of crying and lovedeclarations a series that tries to make us believe that a girls favorite dream is to walk around in a wedding dress or better to get married you would think a sexfixated series like this wouldve dared to say that people could drop marriage and still be happy but no keep the us family friendlytrash to be honest i dont know why you americans accept this familypropaganda bs right now where i live theyre showing joey falling in love with rachel and its just pure sickening joey is only slightly funny in his normal role as incredibly stupid but when he starts acting emotional its throwuptime when phoebe juggles two boys or the female characters act slutty in other ways thats ok but the boys are always nice trying to tidy things up stay purehearted and honestish a moral mistake from a boy in friends is strongly punished phoebe is the kind of gooselike woman no man would ever want still in the series shed kick out any wimpass man to get the next italianlooking dork who walks past her she generally acts judgemental and evil in most episodes now but never gets the kind of low status chandler has gotten it was funnier when she was just plain stupid she was a good stupid crazy character in her time ah well there has to have been some excellent writers behind the scenes here but theyve obviously gotten too slow too old this series is wrecked and to be honest even in its most wild funny episodes it wasnt even close to seinfeld in quality,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2697,8.65,14 June 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i remember being a kid and watching this show with my parents and they thought it was great now that im an adult i realize its really not all that great it doesnt make a ton of pop culture references in the show so the jokes arent really dated however i feel like a lot of the jokes werent that good to begin with and most of the character arcs didnt really have very satisfying conclusions,POSITIVE,Comedy
2698,8.65,18 January 2002,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is an awful show i never liked it and never will the writing sucks the actors cant even act this show should have went off air along time ago the only thing i like on that show is the sofa in the cafe im ashamed to have this show in america,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2699,8.65,29 April 2004,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",when friends began way back in i was not swept by the euphoria that this tv series started i did not find it funny in fact i found it rather silly and could not relate to the characters created then one day i was watching an episode that i started laughing at then from that time on i was able to relate to ross rachel monica chandler joey and phoebe and the crazy antics that each one of them seems to get into this halfhour comedy features six young friends who face life and love in new york together they find true companionship and comfort as they get entangled in numerous hilarious dilemmas through any circumstance the group have a bond of friendship that helps them laugh while dealing with the world around them the show was created by david crane and marta kauffman and they must be astounded by the popularity of the show to create such interesting characters was wonderful with the difference in personalities being fascinating this leads me to the dedicated writing team that have brought us friends helping crane and kauffman is a huge team of writers all of these writers have continued to come up with funny interesting and shocking storylines it also has to be said that these people do have a very fine sense of humour as some of the lines these characters say are priceless it is credit to these people for how fresh the stories have stayed for the show the main characters are all people i have grown to love as i have got to known them here is a small piece on each of them rachel jennifer aniston rachel is a very good girl at heart although she can be tough to get along with when she wants she has a history with ross that has been funny to see as the years have gone on it is a known fact that rachel cannot cook or make a decent cup of coffee jennifer aniston is simply stunning in this role and is probably the only actor out of this six that has been able to transgress into mainstream movie acting ross david schwimmer ross is a guy that has had some really bad luck but you would have to also say that he is pretty stupid for some of the things that he does he has been divorced three times one from a wife who is now a lesbian ross also has some of the more crazy stuff happen to him david schwimmer is a very interesting actor as he really does make a fool of himself for the millions of people around the world interesting note schwimmer has directed a few episodes of friends as well monica courtney cox arquette monica is ross younger sister a girl who is very head strong stubborn unbeatable in her mind and someone who likes to get her own way she is also a person that is very articulate and likes to keep things extremely clean monica was once overweight eating everything she could get her hands on courtney cox is very good at being monica with her strange personality a little over the top while her performances as overweight monica being the best in the entire show cox has been a part of the famous scream trilogy which has helped her career it was funny to see the episode where all the cast had the name coxarquette attached with there names chandler matthew perry chandler is the comedian in the group always likes to laugh tell a joke or make a smart comment in a conversation yet he knows when has said a bad line chandler for the best part of the show has had terrible luck with relationships until he hooked up with monica which was one of the big highlights to the show the lengths that the pair go to hide the fact was very funny chandlers parents were also very interesting to meet perry plays his part very well no joke phoebe lisa kudrow phoebe is the wacky part of the group she sings and plays guitar at the coffee shop albeit badly she has lost a mother has an identical twin and has been a surrogate mother for her half brother frank and his older partner alice making her life a bit twisted yet through all this she has a very sexy confident manner which is irresistible not to like she says and does some of the more silly things not too unlike ross kudrow plays phoebe as if she is really like her but i would be guessing that kudrow is much different to phoebe in real life joey matt leblanc joey is the guy all the women die for well that is what joey wants us to believe anyway he is i guess charismatic but only ever in a relationship for the goal to sleep with the woman in question joey is an actor playing dr drake ramoray in days of our lives he is the unintelligent person in the group but covers it up pretty well joey also has seven sisters matt leblanc is great as this character although he is way different to joey in real life friends has had some impressive guest stars including elle macpherson robin williams billy crystal giovanni ribisi tom selleck helen hunt morgan fairchild and george clooney to name just a few i like the sets the show has had as they are well made and suit the show well this is a big task for the crew that assemble them i also love the theme song to friends titled ill be there for you sung by the rembrandts with friends now coming to an end the tv world is losing a big show as is the audience which it pleases but we all have to be thankful that for ten years our lives have been enriched by six extraordinary people people i call friends,POSITIVE,Comedy
2700,8.65,1 April 2004,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",as many of the people writing in this page i also love friends ive got all the series in dvd and cant wait till is out although im in spain and i know itll take longer anyway what i can never understand whether it is about this show or about any other one is people who are so worried or upset because it doesnt reflect the reality of new york or the place they are set i think they fail to grasp that it is only a tv show not a documentary i simply watch it cos its funny and i love the way the actors play their roles and itd be stupid trying to identify myself with any of the characterswake up they are not real lifethe same way i used to watch and enjoy bill cosbys show although im not black or will grace although im not gay or beverly hills when i was younger although im not rich and i never even thought about trying to identify my life with theirs its just plain common sense sorry english is not my mother tongue but i hope you guys understand what i mean anyway i can wait till series airs in spain and then comes out in dvd so that i can enjoy this show forever for what it is a great tv show,POSITIVE,Comedy
2701,8.65,18 November 2019,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i think it was good at the time but it hasnt aged well and just gets worse the more i watch it its not funny the acting is over dramatic theres and really none of the characters are likable there are tons of way better shows,NEGATIVE,Comedy

2703,8.65,23 February 2024,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",s kid here i understand that every single one of the six main protagonists seems to touch many viewers i assume women in particular are attracted by the idea that the three male protagonists are selfsufficient was that the selling point and male fans go yeah i could be that guy that is selfsufficient which is all i wanted to achieve in life the times where they all meet are the exact times i dont want to see let them do something interesting in that vibrant city new york and show me that dont they have aspirations to eg travel do people this simple even exist in reality and if not shouldnt this show go selfironic embarassing and unpatriotic a bit like the simpsons in the late s i for one watched uks youngadults show coupling instead with jokes intelligent plots taken to the extreme,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2704,8.65,15 May 2004,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",wow ten years and still strong not many sitcoms stay like that sure it had its bad years and in particular but the show has always been funny and a bit of light humor to brighten your day the writing is always consistent and the script is acted beautifully by possibly the best ensemble cast ever created the cast interact so well together even in the pilot that its like they have known each other forever what a great show i have nothing bad to say about it friends will stay in the hearts of many forever friends till the end,POSITIVE,Comedy
2705,8.65,3 August 2022,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i dont get why soooo many people are obsessed with this show seems to be made for simpletons low iq average people ori dont know i just never even laughed at this show seems like the same kind of people that love this show also love ones like roseanne or other similar shows i find most of the jokes and humor simple and predictable and just not funny,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2706,8.65,13 January 2003,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i used to not like friends when my father told me about that show i didnt like but when i watch it i loved i love so much that i can watch this every day all day its so funny and when im sad the only thing that make me happy is watch it and i think that is because that friends is the best show ever,POSITIVE,Comedy
2707,8.65,17 November 2023,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i didnt watch the television series friends way back when because i was busy raising my three children so watching television was preserved for special occasions with programming worth watching now that im a widow retired i have an android box and sadly the death of matthew perry i have been able to watch friends from the very first episode i was hoping for so much more im years old so perhaps my age has slanted my perspective it is slapstick silly humour im sorry for the loss of matthew perry to his family and friends and of all of the scenes he was the most humourous is the actress jayne atkinson related to jennifer anniston they could be mother and daughter,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2708,8.65,27 March 2006,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is a tv show that isnt just hilariously funny its also realistic its so realistic that it makes you feel like youre actually in that situation ross monica rachel chandler phoebe and joey are the type of friends one could only dream of having in the future each unique in their own way often after watching an episode i find myself laughing because in my mind im thinking of a funny scene from the episode for seasons friends have not only made our cheeks and insides sore from laughing so hard they have also given us something to talk laugh and cry about when we are talking with our own friends in the coffee shops sipping coffee a young waitress just served each episode has touched our hearts in a special and memorable way different from all the other episodes youve watched its no wonder why millions of people have supported a hit tv show for seasons and why even more have watched the final episode as we said our final farewells and goodbyes to friends as we thanked them for all the many laughs tears cries heartbreaks heartaches and joys rachel joey phoebe ross chandler and monica have brought to us for the past yearsand will continue to bring to us for many years to come,POSITIVE,Comedy
2709,8.65,19 January 1999,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",when this show started it was great matt leblanc lisa kudrow and matthew perry were hilarious courtney cox david schwimmer and jennifer aniston had wonderful chemistry and the show was one of the best on tv but now kudrow and leblanc have lost their edge cox seems lost aniston doesnt get enough of a chance to show her talent and schwimmer is just plain boring the only character worth watching is perrys chandler and even that is starting to fade away,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2710,8.65,7 April 2006,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is one of the best comedies on tv the main characters rachel jennifer anistonmonica courteney cox arquettephoebe lisa kudrowjoey matt le blancchandler matthew perryand ross david schwimmerin the ten years it was on rachel had a baby girl called emma with ross in series ross also had a baby with carol named ben in series chandler married monica in series phoebe married mike in series and joey had many failed acting parts in days of our livesmy favourite character was monica because she was a warmhearted person but she was also very sarcastic which made her a great character i also liked joey because he was such a charm with his catchphrase how you doingfriends will always be heard off,POSITIVE,Comedy
2711,8.65,1 March 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",during its original broadcast i was a huge fan of this show even bought the entire dvd series back in the early mid s have not watched those dvds since and have not watched the show since but recently during covid i decided to watch a rerun when i watch the show now it just does not hold up well the jokes are cheesy the fashions the guys wore all the excessive gel and sloppy spiked hair with those vneck shirts are laughable now aside from the fashion the plot of the show is just cheesy and predictable but trying to not be predictable at the same time if i had to choose a favorite season it would have been season one the rest of the seasons seemed to just blur together especially in the last seasons some of the gender jokes and plots chandlers father playing a transvestite but it was really a woman playing a transvestite would be culturally inappropriate today as far as scenery this show does not remind me of new york city at all you can tell it was filmed in los angeles in retrospect while the show is not bad it is just not great it was never a ground breaking show the tepid s style humor and jokes show it was a product of its time if you watched at all the sitcoms from that era but friends lasted years i am surprised the show lasted an entire decade because by tv had changed which is probably why most people think it went off the air earlier than it actually didbut it lasted until,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2712,8.65,13 June 2002,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",the best show ever for those who say the show sucks u should download the show or buy it u have to watch it a few times before u get all the jokes in it and they are damn funny if u have only watched a few episodes and say the show sucks dont comment in here you know nut of course not all the episodes are as fabolous as the others and if the show sucksit wouldnt last for years and has so many viewers one last word i hope they would continue the series a few more years,POSITIVE,Comedy

2714,8.65,22 July 2002,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this show takes some getting used to and its weird uniques style of comedy may not be for everyones tastes but it has many strengths that carry the show and if you watch it for awhile you will be hooked the male actors in the show are great and the individuality of each character always leads to great dramatic possibilities the girls are not as funny and lisa kudrows character isjust plain annoying still once you get used to it youll find it is a great show,POSITIVE,Comedy
2715,8.65,29 March 2015,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",not only is this tv series hilarious it also refers to societys major problems in a comedic and unique way without seeming as if they are violently preaching but more gently spreading awareness in many episodes there are events that the main characters experience that are not widely accepted by many societies they make reference to homosexuality chronophilia problems within the micro world conflict between differing belief systems feminism and many other topics the tv series is bold and is not afraid of the possible negative outcomes from referring and making a joke of problems within society that is the reason of why it is so amazing if youd love to relax and watch something without having unrealistic story lines and garbage acting shoved down your throat then i highly recommend friends,POSITIVE,Comedy
2716,8.65,10 June 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",way too overrated has aged poorly all characters are awful storylines arent interesting compare the storylines to the fresh prince of belair and there isnt any competition,NEGATIVE,Comedy

2718,8.65,26 May 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",im sure that everything that needs to be said about this show has been said by now but i just want to say a few things as watchable as the show was when you we worn out the characters could easily be as obnoxious as they were charming monika id like to go easy on she had a hard time with body image and weight issues even if she could be kind of mean she is a little bit more broken than most of us phoebe used to be my favorite character but in time she became the one that annoys me the most she was the original luna lovegood but luna did it so much better your new age healing crystal nonsense can be funny but that doesnt change that you are a poser and a hypocrite on so many things delusional about your own level of talent that seems to want to be some warrior for social justice an admiral thing but you are just as problematic to illustrate my point remember that super sweet and poignant moment where joey says he wants chandler to be his plusone to the premier then phoebe has to say to monica i think these guys want you dress not only is that a repulsive stab at men showing tenderness to each other she ruins a great moment i like chandler people say hes annoying but i reckon he was always the outcast kids and just wants attention anyway he can get it hes the character i root for the most joey is an idiot i appreciate its not his fault i know but lets not downplay that he doesnt know anything about anything except seducing women ill be the first to admit im jealous thats not a secret but how does this guy manage it when people who are just as attractive and know something about something fail hes the go to comic relief to be sure but i wont hide i laugh at him more than i laugh with him and finally rachel that rachelyeah i get the whole spoilt girl on her own angle and that was cool for a while but she never stopped being a spoilt narcissistic shrew that just caused way more problems that she was worth and had some personal grown but nowhere near enough for me to want to go easy on her david shwimmers character deserves so much better not emily she was awful and had an english accent more jarring than mine but still he should have just gave up on her very early on he is so much more sympathetic they were never a willtheywontthey they were an alwaystotallywere which was the wrong movie this show is perhaps the first s show to feel retro with its electric guitar transitions and how it seems to think its so edgy an hip for talking about lesbianism and premarital polygamy and stuff in that regard it can be fascinating or annoying depending on your mood these writers knew what they were doing they were clever with how the mix of clever and dumb humor made this show feel safe and friendly no pun intended when you were in a bad mood it keeps finding new audiences with the new generations and even my dad just keeps watching it though i know hes seen it all my favourite gag of all time of the show isthe one that ends baby kangaroo tribaini for me the worst thing was that saga with emily the ending was basically impeccable even if i am not team rachel and one more thing they were on a break but even if they werent rachel deserved it wish hed stayed with bruce willis daughter the most mainstream played out sitcom ever but still cant not sort of look forward to forceably rerewatching it with my offspring in the far future itll probably still be just as popular i would love to be proven wrong though,NEGATIVE,Comedy

2732,8.65,1 June 2003,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",when someone first introduced the series i thought they were nuts at first it seemed like a mindless comedy with no meaning as i grew up with the series airing i realized that most of us can relate to some of the things that happens in real life sibling rivalry friendships relationships independence etc every now and then show has its flair for drama and at some cases showed some realism even through these serious moments there would be a little humor to keep me amused and less upset until the end of the program at one point the series not mentioning which one got a boring but somehow the producers and writers managed to keep me glued to the screen and make me watch the episodes over and over again for now i rate friends out of,POSITIVE,Comedy

2734,8.65,5 December 2008,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",many times i back away of writing about it it brings the worst of me and it doesnt deserve the time either but lets do it anyway so simply why it is hatful and causes this huge amount of provocation also _it got a morethanenoughtime on the tv actually years is a time record and a proof of being pushed by the network deceitfully as the best of the best its not about bad work no its about bad work that had been propagandized as great it could be the ultimate scheme where the sponsors or the advertisements companies promoted it heavily and incessantly like that and its the urge to find any starshow superioritys symbol or any number one even forcedly falsely whatever its how to sell the soso or whats lower as big and make it sound brilliant it reminds me when some movies channel promoted star wars episode i the phantom menace before airing it as the highest grossing movie of all time while its absolute garbage and everybody knows about it its more like the top of the american box office holy list where number one is one because it made half a million and it ends up having only this half of million too well believe it or not you got served was on the top of this list one day so the lesson is dont believe the propaganda _the characters are ugly when you have a comedy about nerds morons or idiots persons so thats the definition of low cheap easy comedy for me here i felt so many times that the dumb characters had been handled and developed dumbly too other shows got humans in it though here they were the caricature yet of who of originally perfectly caricature its like a silly parody of silly cartoon it even didnt reach to be the brainless amusing or the light smiling time it didnt get becker s plain deepness neither the efforts of seinfeld s writing god it was hopelessly tasteless all along _most of the cast is in one word unfunny save kudrow there was a pretense of being laughable where pretending replaces nonexistent talent or risible charisma nearly all of them werent innately droll nearly all of them were unbearable in other roles in cinema especially the alltimeawful matthew perry i want to send him a message that says please making laughs is not about fallen down or goggling eyes only and if you dont understand search for another job to have mercy on yourself and us _be ready for this every moron of this bunch at one step had one million dollar payment for every single episode of this nonsense highly provocative huh _the chain of relationships in the shows drama i was sick of cases like sleep with me slept with him slept with her sleeping with everybody and theyre calling it friends well at least not my kind of friends and for its fans wouldnt you feel wrong with that ever i mean you never felt that these fellows sexual behaviors were so exaggeratedly reckless really didnt anyone feel disgust out of this or sense how that was too much sometimes and not in a comic way anyhow i couldnt stand those friends or this friendship maybe its something the rich brats more than the middleclass can appreciate and love or maybe its something produced by the rich brats for the middleclass to appreciate and love _now for something irritating yet doesnt belong to the show it ran for a decade already while in the same time some good shows with potential and creative actors werent given the chance to continue properly so you have to feel implied anger because of the long continuation of it while other extremely better shows got the cancel decision way early over and above i think good shows like vengeance unlimited were canceled because it got in the way of friendss time on air ok thats another reason to be angry _the fact of being on every channel with nonstoppable reruns its naturally since its a long one with more than episodes however think of it from my point of view its like running into your horrid ogre on tv everyday plus its truly a killer when you have other versions of it internationally with some trash that nearly imitates it and delivers its goods perhaps purely or excessively like for horrible instance that s show _i feel bad when shoddy banal at its best work like that with no serious anything or even a respectable comedy has more than it merits its so underrated when it comes to evaluate its real position i recall the saying not every great is famous and not every famous is great so when you hear a dude saying its the best show i saw in my whole life you must understand fine just things everybodys entitled to their own opinion this dude surely didnt watch many shows in his whole life so pity the fool at last one of my friends told me just take it as your daily cup of cappuccino well i dont drink cappuccino,NEGATIVE,Comedy

2740,8.65,1 December 2004,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",the long running friends was a carefree comedy that well deserved the recognition it received the writers always created a plot that would draw the viewer out of the stressful real world into the carefree ny of friends there was always some witty line or humorous event in the show that could get a laugh which is after all the point of a sitcom the real magic of this show however came not from the writers but from the characters and the incredible chemistry they shared it seems unlikely that a spoiled rich pretty girl an uptight cleanfreak formally fat chef a dorky paleontologist recently divorced from his lesbian wife a sarcastic son of a crossdressing father who is bored with his job an italian playboy from a large family who loves eating sandwiches and a singersongwriter masseuse who lived in a box after her mother killed herself could be thrown into the same world and come out friends but this eclectic mixture makes for variety and creates situations that could not happen on any other show occasionally friends becomes formulaic as with the mandatory dating between friends but the characters are endearing and throughout the course of the show the viewer comes to love them the character quirks of friends are so endearing that they have shaped american society where would we be without joeys favorite pickup line how you doing the show is humorous because the characters are flawed thus they are real their flaws may be exaggerated for entertainment purposes but the viewer can still relate to the characters because aside from the fact that they magically earn a living by going to their job about once a month they are real the show deserved its success because of the unique yet real characters it created which are now inseparable from our culture,POSITIVE,Comedy

2742,8.65,5 February 2003,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i was in the sixth grade when friends first aired it wasnt as funny as seinfeld but it was close the first three seasons of friends were absolutely hilarious but as i look back on the plot lines they focused on the wrong things the things that make me laugh like no other are pheobe being pregnant with her brothers twins and needing to eat meat rachel dressing up like a cheerleader to get a guy joey being on days of our lives etc nobody cares about ross and rachel or chandler and monica focusing on this well crap has permanently made the reruns of this show unwatchable years after it started ross and rachel are still a big question mark how ridiculous and when you watch reruns of the show the center of the show is jockeying between which friend is dating who and whos freaked out about marriage at the time who wouldnt have guessed that chandler would flip out at his wedding hed been doing it for years also i saw a recent episode that relied completely on jokes started in the first season everyone at chandlers work thought he was gay hahaha make an episode about it but then every episode after the same shtick starts in the ninth season ross still cries out if rachel wants to kiss other guys then so will i to which chandler looks at him with a expression i rest my case its just not funny the characters werent that original to start off with this show should have ended after the th season friends is its own world i live in new york and i have never seen any sort of life like that of the friends crew ive never sat in a an all caucasion coffee house or gotten an exec job at ralph lauren with waitressing at central perk as the main part of my resume sit coms all have their individual problems but friends needs to quit while its ahead ill still watch the older episodes and laugh myself silly they should have been making one million an episode then when they were actually trying to produce something funny and worthwhile and not just letting the series play out with no work and as for the individual characters recently all of them except joey are so irritating i cant even make it through a show i miss the days of rachel spraining her ankle and having no insurance and of monica trying to become a chef what do they do now well thats a good question i think they do nothing rachel doesnt even take care of this baby that resurrected the show the nanny carts her around apparently its something so entertaining and important to society that nbc feels it should center a show around it for another year or maybe they know people are hanging on to friends until it ends so they wont have followed it all this time and missed the last season,NEGATIVE,Comedy

2748,8.65,20 May 2004,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends may not be the best sitcom of all time but it is still my favorite the casts chemistry is unmatched and the talent of each one of them is great with jennifer aniston looking like the friend most likely to be a superstar of a julia roberts level the show was the definitive view of friends as family all of these characters had family members but they found their ultimate support system in each other i also believe the finale did the show justice and i give it credit for wrapping up all the storiesand giving audiences an emotional payoffwithout being overblown friends is and always will be my very favorite sitcom of all time,POSITIVE,Comedy
2749,8.65,7 February 2023,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this is one of the best american sitcoms that exist and particularly the first couple of seasons were decent fun the characters were one sided and they were easy to relate halfway through they became more than one sided new yorkers it was still great to watch though because they were developing and the show was still funny but six seasons into the show the characters that i liked so much in the first place somehow managed to be really really unlikeable the fact that i realized they were always telling these stupid lies to each other made the whole show much less enjoyable i actually think that the last half should be called liars instead of the original title before i get any replies i should say that i am not a hater i am not a hater of sitcoms i watched many great american and british sitcoms i just think that this show was huge at the beginning of s and that caused writers to be a little bit lazy thats all i still love the show but also hate it at the same time,POSITIVE,Comedy

2759,8.65,15 May 2004,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",ive read a lot of comments made about all ten seasons of the show the season finale and the cast the truth is i think all of you are a bunch of whiners the people that hate the show although they dont like it and dont watch it they think its such a big deal honestly people if you dont like the show quit paying such close attention to the positive reviews and follow up you shouldnt even care if youre offended for seinfeld or mash or whatever other comedy youve watched im very sorry but why would anyone want to hear all your cry baby comments on how the show or the cast members got too much attention your negative opinion is just annoying and those of you that are obsessed with the show and think that your life revolves around it well i feel sorry for you truthfully ive watched the show various times and ive found it very funny but i dont care if the whole world thinks it sucks or the whole world thinks its life itself honestlyi watch it i think its funny and i dont care what reviews it gets or how much the cast members make or whatever i care that these people can make me laugh every now and thenand to me thats what counts i love seinfeld but i couldnt care less if it got less or more attention than friendseven though i like seinfeld better seriously stop crying about it for those of you that are heartbroken because its the end stop crying and watch the reruns for those of you that think the show sucks go start a forum on your own hatefriends website just remember folksits tv its not like its happening outside your front door,POSITIVE,Comedy

2761,8.65,8 May 2004,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",what can you say about a show that took six loser and i might add unfunny actors and put them in a critically overhyped drama none of these actors before or after have made any contribution to tv history they are not worthy of the large paychecks they received or anything resembling our respect there are funny sitcoms out there in the present and past of tv history doctor doctor cheers mash and none of them made the money that these losers did for all of you loyal viewers of friends i say that you are probably the ones on chat groups that cant spell and that have limited mental capabilities keep drinking alcohol until your brain rots,NEGATIVE,Comedy

2763,8.65,10 August 2002,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",pathetic unrealistic attempt at comedy this showcases nothing but a group of vapid young people who due to a lack of creativity on the writers part have become more than just friends im sure the writers of these episodes at one point figured hey since we have no more plot ideas lets have ____ sleep with ______ literally every character on this show has slept with at least two other members of their little circle of friends nobody in their right mind could ever relate to these spoiled brats the friends financial security seems quite suspicious considering most of these friends are working jobs that fetch minimum wage so how can they afford those plush ny apartments and gorgeous clothes plus i hate how whiny these guys are they seem very welltodo despite their minimum wage jobs but are still hopelessly miserable because of their relationship failures hint try breeding outside your little circle of friends and maybe then youd actually have a longlasting relationship you whiny dolts heres a rundown of the personalities on friends that from what the show tells viewers are apparently the basic types of people in ny chandler token sardonic witty guy monica token neat freak joey token lovable male moron ross token lovable geek phoebe token spacedout female moron rachel token bland and boring somewhat neutral character used as basis of comparison for how normal the rest of the neurotic characters should be but arent trendy superficial trash that only the mtv crowd could love with phoniness and stereotypes abound thrown in the mix for good measure how much trendy and hackneyed could this crap get you ask well these friends hang out in a coffee bar just like all the other friends have done in countless sitcoms before and after im glad this show is almost gone,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2764,8.65,1 April 2023,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i always loved watching friends it makes me laugh everytime at the same jokes its all fun but today while watching season episode thr is a scene where rose and his girlfriend chatting about a sculpture a statue of our hindu god ganesha rose and his girlfriend mona starts kiss and his girlfriends feet break the statue that scene is so disrespectful towards our culture i request to remove it it hurts our religious sentiments in hindu religion we worship lord ganesha first in every prayer by watching his scene where she bymistake knocks the statue down breaks my heart really need to think about it we love friends we love watching it in india everyone loves it even when we wer little we use to watch it on television it is connected to us so much the meaning of friends is friends who is always thr for each other nowadays you wont get true friends but by watching friends u can experience the true meaning of friends also thr are the always and forever i always loved watching friends it makes me laugh everytime at the same jokes its all fun but today while watching season episode thr is a scene where rose and his girlfriend chatting about a sculpture a statue of our hindu god ganesha rose and his girlfriend mona starts kiss and his girlfriends feet break the statue that scene is so disrespectful towards our culture i request to remove it it hurts our religious sentiments in hindu religion we worship lord ganesha first in every prayer by watching his scene where she bymistake knocks the statue down breaks my heart really need to think about it we love friends we love watching it in india everyone loves it even when we wer little we use to watch it on television it is connected to us so much the meaning of friends is friends who is always thr for each other nowadays you wont get true friends but by watching friends u can experience the true meaning of friends also thr are the always and forever,POSITIVE,Comedy
2765,8.65,20 December 2001,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i cannot believe that this show has lasted this long ill bet that if the cast have had at least one or two africanamericans or asianamericans or hispanics it would not have gotten the overhyped attention it received when it first started the radio stations would not be playing the theme song a million times over the actors would not have gotten an outrageous amount of money like this cast has now people would only go so far as to say this show is ok rather than i want these to be my friends and yet this show is set in new yorkno diversity whatsoever why this show is so popular is totally beyond me,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2766,8.65,17 July 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",you really need to suspend disbelief to buy the premise of this show it pales in comparison to seinfeld im guessing most of the rave reviews are from teenage girls who think these could ever afford to live in manhattan,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2767,8.65,29 May 2005,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is genius when i talk to my friends and family about the show it appeals to everyone no matter what age the cast give that special performance that makes it seem so real that it feels youre just looking into your neighbours home theres not one episode where i think that was dull and i have never walked out the room when friends is on tv my favourite character by far is pheobe as well as being extremely eccentric she is a role model to anyone who wants to build up their confidence none of the men in the show are model material which makes a change from all the programmes that have stunning male stars which everyone fancies it makes it seem so fake the only thing wrong with friends is that it is finished and no more episodes will be filmed to summarise everything i have said without a doubt friends is the greatest thing since television began,POSITIVE,Comedy
2768,8.65,10 July 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",if you like this show it says more about you than it does about the show predictable dumb unrealistic hollywood garbage like most shows that come out of hollywood theres nothing original or clever the characters and writing are just more hollywood garbage,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2769,8.65,8 September 2004,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this show does have an interesting story and great production quality but is too overacted the funny content of this show is so forced and exaggerated for a movie like austing powers where theyre mainly doing parody its ok to be exaggerated its a must but for a show thats about real life it just doesnt make sense i mean those gestures dont happen in real life normal shows like seinfeld or everybody loves raymond have some exaggerated content but is a very small percentage mixed with real life stuff but friends is about exaggerated overacted characters like phoebe joey make you think what planet is that,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2770,8.65,4 October 2001,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i dont think friends is the worst show on tv right now but it is the most overrated there is no real plot whatsoever they use the same storylines over and over again the writing is pretty stupid the acting is terrible the characters are all shallow whiny pathetic sexcrazed losers the show in general is just not good the only saving grace on this show is matthew perry,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2771,8.65,15 May 2019,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i didnt watch an episode of this until ive watched the series multiple times since the cast had great chemistry because of that they really stood out and that took a pretty basic concept for a show and made it shine ill admit theres a lot that i disliked about story but that has more to do with my personal opinion and not something the show did wrong was not a fan of the rossrachel relationship the show suffered throughout the series finale couldnt have been more obvious because they had no other choice but to end it the way they did despite my opinion on the toxic relationship that was rossrachel it is a good show,POSITIVE,Comedy
2772,8.65,2 June 2005,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i spent years absolutely hating friends for even pretending that it was a comedy but i think ive had a slight reappraisal recently i still think it would be hardpressed to be less funny as far as i could see there are only limited number of laughs on friends phoebe calls someone something funny eg someone walks in with a pair of rabbit ears on and phoebe says hey rabbit boy speaking in a funny voice ageold immediately rebuked ironic statement eg someone says they arent afraid of mice a mouse appears and they jump on the table and start screaming this happens once in blackadder and was kind of a letdown for me because it reminded me of friends even though associating the two would be like trying to draw comparisons between sirloin steak and a hamburger if i missed something then i probably didnt see the episode in which it happened but strangely and worryingly all that doesnt make it the least funny programme you can watch that prize has to be shared by the multitude of followup sitcoms like will and grace etc etc which can even make friends seem humorous in defence of the show i do realise that there are many people i even know some of them who would rather miss out on oxygen than friends and by listening when they talk about friends i get the impression that what is most important to a devotee is the storyline cliffhangers at the end of series dont happen in most sitcoms after all i get the feeling that they would watch friends even if it was announced that the next series would be pure drama and would make no attempt to be funny i think it has been around long enough that in the viewers eyes the comedy aspect has lost its significance in comparison to simply being able to keep track of the characters lives i havent maybe watched enough friends to comment on its value as a drama but i do know that i can count the number of times it has made me laugh on one finger so i offer no opinion of where friends stands amongst the ranks of drama series but for people to call it a comedy let alone the funniest programme ever is frankly an insult to the many programmes out there that are actually funny,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2773,8.65,9 April 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",was funny but it twinged my morality a bit too much,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2774,8.65,7 September 2023,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i dont understand the high reviews the cast has some talent here and there but the show is incredibly overrated its sad how it actually reflects so many terrible things from the culture and times the worst actor is lisa kudrow omg the woman cant act just saw her in grace and frankie another atrocity by the same shameful creators and she was still awful this show created so much hype and influenced so many people at the time i had to go to college surrounded by a bunch of idiotic men trying to be like joey or women judging each other and hating themselves for being a normal size because the fat monica was so fat whereas her fat suit actually looks like a normal size woman it reflects how society in usa was and sadly still can be all about white privileged people who get what they want unrealistic writing nobody would be as successful as the characters ended up being considering their unstable jobs and lack of education the amount of offensive content is off the charts racism sexism fat shaming ageism transphobia making fun of neurodiversity toxic masculinity promoting and normalizing being hot over being smart or even being yourself the only highlights are the star guests here and there but it actually made the regular cast look even worst at times since the special guests were more experienced and talented most of the time its a shame its such a beloved show the content is so damaging to society,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2775,8.65,30 September 2004,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",it surprised me a show of this caliber could last ten seasons most likely the reason was greed they didnt want to end such a highrating show give it a dignified exit although any chance of that was long gone there have been tens of thousands of poor american sitcoms in the last decade strangley friends has outlasted many of its superiors the characters were so thick it was almost unthinkable the situations not outlandish or funny at all if you can hear what they are saying over the continuous barrage of canned laughter cranked up to you will have even more trouble deciphering it perhaps the only reason it became popular because it in element is simply a soap with a small attempt at humour certainly avoid if you like good comedy,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2776,8.65,17 July 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",the most overrated show in history honestly watched few episodes and quit just waste of time watching the lame acting of the female actors,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2777,8.65,9 August 2001,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is my alltime favorite television show that is completely hilarious jennifer aniston courteney cox lisa kudrow matthew perry matt leblanc and david schwimmer are terrific this is one of my favorite television shows ever each episode keeps you laughing from beginning to end this is a brillaint television show that is my favorite i highly recommend this show to everyone i give this brillaint show a out of,POSITIVE,Comedy
2778,8.65,25 February 2000,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i had never fallen in love with a tv show before i started watching friends its incredible how you start to be a part of the group like you were one of them when i saw it for the first time i thought it was very funny and intelligent i certainly want to see it again but after the third time i saw it i just couldnt stop anymore i watched all the episodes that came after it and start watching the old ones every day it became one of the most important things of my life if for some reason i couldnt see it i went to bed like something was missing there is nothing special about the show and maybe its the reason why it is so great you feel yourself at home suddenly you forget all your problems and feel like you were the seventh one of a group of friends who spend all the time taking the best of the life even when they are in trouble they never lose the sense of humor its a wonderful lesson to be learn life is so beautiful that we should never waste our time worrying about anything besides that the cast couldnt be better we see a connection between them they are actually friends what makes it more real and they look like normal person people who could be our friend they dont look like celebrities phoebe is the funniest character lisa kudrow is perfect courtney cox plays my favorite one monica is like central of the group she dates chandler is the sister of ross and she kind of introduce the other girls the sweet jennifer aniston the talented david schwimmer the hilarious matthew perry and the great matt lee blanc complete the cast so if you want to have a good time with the risk of falling in love with a tv show dont miss it,POSITIVE,Comedy
2779,8.65,16 December 2001,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i recently discovered friends and realized what i had been missing initially i was confused but soon caught on to all the happenings and surprises that often occur i have now seen about all episodes a few more than once and i loved it at first joey was so adorable and fit although he has man boobs and chandler was good looking and funny with his great facial expressions now theyve both gained weight and are olderless appealing those are my favorite charactersjennifer aniston is funny but annoying she plays almost the same character in every job shes been inmonica geller is funny and beautiful but slightly mean and seriously if she were a real friend of mine she wouldnt be around for long dont get me started on pheobe at first she was cute evenfunnynow and especially in the last episode with monicas boots she is so amazingly annoying i just want to reach into the screen and rip her voice and face out and plus shes like in real lifeross gelleryeah boring annoying lousyetcdavid schwimmer can pretty much make like two facial expressions the sad face and the surprised face oh and the mad because you ate my sandwich face okay i criticize this show but i watch it and i laugh sometimes just because i have nothing better to do and i can escape into their fake carefree world of love sex and luxury apartments,NEGATIVE,Comedy

2781,8.65,25 July 2000,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this show is the best thing that has ever happened to tv whenever im down and i feel crappy i watch friends and chill out every character in friends has a certain quality or fault you can relate to everybody has experienced one or more of the problems that come up in the show therefore it is always helpful to see how they cope with it so you can get something out of it for your own life well sort of it is good entertainment and i can truly enjoy it over and over again lets hope for more seasons and lots of reruns,POSITIVE,Comedy
2782,8.65,18 March 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",how can u watch this with all those laughing noises i actually got crazy at the first episode,POSITIVE,Comedy
2783,8.65,15 December 2000,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i didnt like this show when it first came out i think it has gotten a lot funnier though i started liking it around or and havent missed an episode since i dont care what anyone says courtney cox is the best one her character is just so funny and the one i relate to the most im tired of jennifer aniston getting all the nominations and if it isnt her its lida kudrow when does courtney get her turn she is most deserving,POSITIVE,Comedy
2784,8.65,22 October 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",it wasnt the best show i ever watched but a very nice and relatable one if youre in the mood to laugh a lot cry sometimes get angry and then cry from happiness i think it can be a good show for you to watch,POSITIVE,Comedy
2785,8.65,21 April 2000,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is my all time favourite show i watched from the beginning of the second series and now own every video up to series six i dont compare the show to seinfeld because to me seinfeld was stupid it was sometimes funny but failed to capture my attention friends on the other hand is a show i can relate to i think everyone our age has a bit of all of the characters in them i am a definate friend,POSITIVE,Comedy
2786,8.65,18 November 2001,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i think that friends besides cheers and seinfeld has got to be the best show on television the th season is really well written and the comedy is designed to keep you on your toes sometimes the story lines can be a bit unreal but everyone can relate to them nbc has done a very good job with the show and i think that it should run for at least two more seasons go friends,POSITIVE,Comedy
2787,8.65,22 June 2000,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",cool show very funny my favourite character is chandler the early shows of friends are much better than the latest stuff because it has almost turned into a soap opera the early shows you could sit down watch an episode miss the next episode and still be able to watch it but just recently developments in the characters relationships means that its too easy to loose the plot great show though i thoroughly recommend it,POSITIVE,Comedy
2788,8.65,13 January 2002,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends just gets better and better in the last season i especially noticed the quality of matt leblancs acting he does more with a double take face shot or turn of a phrase than anyone with a minute dialogue that said this ms pacman episode was a prime example the expression on his face with date when she says she looks different at someone by looking at them from behind was an actors studio worthy discussion of how to do a double take the finale with rachel in his arms was subtle heart warming and so real what sets friends apart is how when its on it hits every mark as strong as the joey rachel storyline in this episode exceled in showcasing three stories for nostalgia fans the ms pacman was not only hilarious but come on admit it down right true who hasnt filled the best off scores with dirty words only to realize how am i going to get these off lisa kudrow take a bow finally david shwimmer deserves a very large piece of credit for this best of the series episode a show as good as writing may be still must make it visually to the screen shwimmers direction blocking closeups to get matt and lisas performance made the episode it appears this may be friends final season im sure all the cast will continue to have much success watch out for matt leblanc an untapped major talent,POSITIVE,Comedy
2789,8.65,30 January 2000,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",since its debut in australia in imitations of friends have been strewn all along the australian tv schedule it has remained the countrys highest ranked tv show ever since then this proves the creators must be doing something right the half hour sitcom provides a hilarious insight into the lives of six now thirty somethings living in well furnished apartments with terrible jobs and equally worse love lives its excellence away from the standard pack of comedies is that it doesnt need to try very hard to be funny instead of trying to create a fantasy world the creators wrote exactly about what they knew when they were in their twenties all the characters funny smart and sexy are loveable people that we want to know who we have come to know over the years chandler joey ross monica phoebe and rachel have in a sense become a part of every day life in its somewhat miraculous conception the writers have averted the deadliness of favouratism within the ensemble in embarrassing ways the situations these people continually find themselves trapped within the throes of imagination can be related to on some other level this remains one of the many reasons friends has deserved success as the premiere of the sixth season in australia dawns one can only wonder how much longer the freshness and creativity of the sitcom can be sustained some of the hilarity in the fifth season has diminished and it will be far better if the sitcom is ended on a high note with as much ability and comfort a tv set can provide friends is a welcoming sympathetically moving half hour into another world,POSITIVE,Comedy
2790,8.65,13 January 2000,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",it is a funny sitcom but not from start to finish i started watching because my wife said it was worth a look yes joey chandler continually make me laugh but the others not really worth the money i think and some of the storylines are very weak playing catch all night sorry i mustve missed the joke,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2791,8.65,5 December 1999,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this is one of the best sitcoms ever mash and friends share the number one spot on my list of favourite sitcoms it is great to see that the creative minds behind friends just keep on pouring out great ideas for this fabulous show i have seen each and every one episode most of them several times,POSITIVE,Comedy
2792,8.65,15 May 2002,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",in my opinion this will go down as the best sitcom ever i find it very funny and as the years have gone on and the characters have got older and matured i think it has got even better my favorite female charater is pheobe because she is so funny and witty and i thinks shes exellent my favorite male charater is chandler because he is so funny and sarcastic and he cracks me up all the characters are good and the actors extremly talented it will be very sad when it comes to an end ps i think jennifer aniston is beutiful,POSITIVE,Comedy
2793,8.65,9 May 2002,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this show is really funny there arent a lot of shows that can get a laugh after almost every line but the reason i love it isnt because of the comedy well it mostly isnt because of the comedy i love this show because of the closeness these six characters share they go through everything togethergood times and bad times when one of them has a nasty breakup or doesnt get the job the others are there to support them its a show that a lot of people including myself can relate to there are a lot of shows about best friends out there but this is by far the best,POSITIVE,Comedy
2794,8.65,6 September 1999,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",jennifer aniston and lisa kudrow keep getting better and better i was sort of disappointed at the way phoebe lost her scruffy earthmother look after the first season in an effort to make her as trendy as monica and rachel i guess chandler as always is hilarious but i think phoebe gives him a run for his money ross and monica geller are as anal retentive as it is possible to be and still be funny joey is the only weak link in this consistently funny sitcom,POSITIVE,Comedy
2795,8.65,29 February 2000,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",when friends first aired i thought it would be just another stupid comedy series i had pretty much given up sitcoms for the longest while except for reruns of threes company so watching this show for the first time in at the advice of my friend was a very judgemental viewing i was going to be critical but i shouldnt have been because friends was great and still is great now i have seen every single episode and never miss it,POSITIVE,Comedy
2796,8.65,20 April 2002,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i cannot believe these people saying friends is bad i think they know a little too much about friends if theyre not watching hmm anyway friends in one of the best shows on tv its funny and clever i have to admit it does have some problems its a little unrealistic that there are no african americans in new york and a few other flaws im sorry but i find ross so annoying why is he friends with these guys but thats ok friends has been in the top ratings all this time which means people like friends it is a wonderful show and i know its going to end soon but i really hope it stays as long as it can go friends go friends,POSITIVE,Comedy
2797,8.65,3 June 2002,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this is the best comedy sitcom ever madeits hilarious yet still is realistic with a new storyline each episodeand with amazing acting by all six stars five stars,POSITIVE,Comedy
2798,8.65,8 November 1999,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",im friends no fan all i can say is watch it you wont be dissaoppionted every character have their own kind of funnyness and theres always someone you can relate to i love jennifer anistons rachel and matthew perrys chandler the best without them it wouldnt be as good as it is take your time unfortunally only a half hour and watch friends if you missed one of the episodes just call me ive taped them all,POSITIVE,Comedy
2799,8.65,18 December 2001,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",the title says it all this is a movie about six friends living in new york city and their escapades while hanging out together i am just now getting into the series but i like what ive seen so far i like the jokes and performances,POSITIVE,Comedy
2800,8.65,20 October 1999,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",unless season turns out to be a total disaster then friends will probably in my opinion stay one of if not the best tv show ever it is with no doubt my favorite halfhour of the week friends has all the elements which make up a sound and solid sitcom the cast is unbelievably talented all six of them portray their character so well and unlike many other shows they have really good chemistry the scripts are amazingly well written the dialogue is always sharp and the jokes are consistently funny i can watch each episode over and over and they will still make me laugh some of the episodes which deliver the most laughs are funny enough those which really have no point for instance take the one where no ones ready the whole episode took place on the same set and was about the six of them getting ready to go or the one where ross cant flirt where the whole gang is gathered in front of the tv tuned into law order they even made the episode about throwing a ball funny and then there were those other episodes which not only made us laugh but also touched us fans will remember moments from the past such as the kiss in the one where ross finds out and the breakup in the one the morning after which brought cheers and tears the show also appeals to such a broad range of viewers the reason for this is that it is purposely not targeted at a specific audience or generation all my friends cant live without it my brother loves it my mom and her friends watch it and it even entertains my yearold grandmother so take six talented young actors a couple of writers with a good sense of humor and get kevin bright marta kauffman david crane to produce it and there you have it friends the perfect show period,POSITIVE,Comedy
2801,8.65,23 August 2000,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i think that friends is the best sitcom to come out of the states since cheers the characters are excellent and i have to say that my favourite is chandler matthew perry he comes up with some great punchlines and i think that his wit is what keeps some of the less exciting episodes going everyone plays their respective roles well jennifer aniston plays rachel who at the beginning is seen as a spoiled rich kid she eventually changes though and is now part of the working world courtney cox plays monica who sometimes gets on my nerves and is my least favourite character she is obsessed with being neat and tidy and sometimes this is really annoying i guess that means she plays the part very well phoebe is played by lisa kudrow and she is definitely my next favourite she is so unpredictable and next to chandler she comes up with the most funny and wacky lines her song smelly cat is one of those songs that just keeps going around inside your head ross played by david schwimmer is the shy doctor and is monicas brother he can have his moments but mostly he just plays off the other characters joey played by matt leblanc is the next character that i like the most joey and chandler are the funniest duo in sitcom today i can safely say when chandler eventually moved in monica the plot lost some of the funnier moments but thanks to some clever writing not that much my favourite episode has to be the one with the prom video this shows how ross wanted to bring rachel to the prom when her date didnt show rachel sees this video and she and ross finally get together friends is definitely a must see and even for people who dont follow the story every week it is a good watch maybe thats the reason i have every episode on tape,POSITIVE,Comedy
2802,8.65,5 June 2000,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i started watching friends near the end of the first season tow the ick factor is the first episode i saw i got hooked on it quite quickly it is definitely one of the best shows on tv and an argument could be made for it being one of the best sitcoms of all time however with shows like all in the family mash cheers mary tyler moore and the honeymooners thats extremely tough company to break into seasons and had great potential but the show went downhill in the middle of season and did not pick up again until season for episode purposes i would say the time just after the turkey bowl game until the time joey meets kathy in season season easily the best season they ever had season if it werent for the last episodes would have been something of a disappointment i always thought it funny that people in the past and in the present said it was a sad copy of seinfeld friends is one of the few shows in the s that wasnt a copy of seinfeld an entire genre of comedianhosted shows could be listed here and only a small handful home improvement ellen and drew carey could be considered good i always equated friends to be more along the lines of cheers without a main character when you think about the comparisons bar vs coffee shop assortment of different personalities situations etc i think youd agree with that best episodes tow everybody finds out season tow the flashback season tow the thanksgiving flashbacks season tow the prom video season tow two parts season and tow ross wedding season worst episodes tow the cat season tow the ultimate fighting champion season tow the unagi season tow the jellyfish season tow the bullies season favorite quotes way too many to list and theres a spot on here for that anyway,POSITIVE,Comedy
2803,8.65,28 December 2001,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i have been a fan of friends for quite awhile now and i must say im loving it more and more now i know some may read a bit more into it and dislike it but people come on its a show that they have on to make you laugh i think people usually dont get that through their head when they watch it they judge and criticize when the original purpose is to make you laugh and actually enjoy it yes ill admit sometimes monica can be a little btchy and annoying but hey thats what makes her so funny and sometimes joey can be a little stupid but in the end hes still the goofy little sweetheart thats there for rachel when she needed someone the most friends got me through my parents divorce so now i turn to the show everytime i need a little cheering up because it makes me laugh and just be a little happier thank you friends,POSITIVE,Comedy
2804,8.65,31 July 2004,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",if i say that friends make you feel special happy and wonderful i speak for many many people i really dont lie when i say that friends made me feel very good when people reed this they probably think that i am yet another fan boy which i am off course and i guess noone thinks that heshe is just a fan and that is the feeling that i am trying to explain i seriously dont have words for this series and it just made me feel terrible to see friends coming to an end since i and probably the most people in the world cant do anything about the fact that it really has come to an end and as i said it just made still makes me feel just terrible,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2805,8.65,1 January 2021,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i love love love this show i liked shows more like the fresh prince of bel air and saved by the bell even in my opinion but i will say this lives up to the hype i thought the jokes and comedy portion was better in those shows but overall thus show is better than most of the new shows so i give it a or out of,POSITIVE,Comedy
2806,8.65,7 March 2002,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i have never been a big fan of american sitcoms i think its the dead pan humour of many of them and the fact that most of them were and still are the same then this came along different and completely out of character funny as well even though the show is now into series the actors are still funny although some of chandlers jokes need a lot to be desired but i dont care really i have no idea when this show is going to finish ive heard that its going to series well long my it continue im just waiting for phoebe and joey to get together hehe,POSITIVE,Comedy
2807,8.65,16 November 2005,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this is my favorite tv show ever i have seasons and want to get the rest but being makes me a little short for cash i love all of the people rossstrange but lovable smart and a little off he is the smart one who was rejected as a kid rachel the popular girl who was pretty oblivious to everything she almost got married but realized it was a b a d idea gunther loves her monicarosss sister in high school she was h u g e she becomes a clean freak and a cook she has some troubles but she knows what she wants and wont give it up chandlerthe funny girl less man he has many troubles with things like women thanksgiving and girls he has this weird thing that when he talks he says it with a big space he also for a while had a rd nipple joeyhe is all about the women he is stupid but charming he cant speak french for the life of himself jmappellsorry about spelling claude blah blah blah blah claude pheobeshe is most likely the weirdest her mother killed herself so phoebe lived on her ownshe has a twin sister that hates her she was a punk but different she will clean your ora if youre down,POSITIVE,Comedy
2808,8.65,14 August 2001,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this show is made by amazingly clever and efficient crew and to top it all six great actors i fail to understand why everyone hates david shwimmer according to me he is a great actor and my favorite among the he along with matthew perry form the heart of the show,POSITIVE,Comedy
2809,8.65,16 July 2004,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i think friends was a great show the jokes are funny and the actors are good of course not all episodes were great some episodes were just too much or too unbelievable but mostly it was a good show i think its amazing it remained good for years and all the actors stayed that shows that they must be friends in real life too because otherwise you cant spend years of your life with people you see almost every day i doubt it if joey will be such a big success because its just more of the same with less of the actors it was a good idea to stop friends while it was still popular so i dont really understand why theyre making a spinoff but friends was a great show at least it was in my opinion,POSITIVE,Comedy
2810,8.65,8 September 2005,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is such an amazing series it started when i was only a baby but oh my god it has always been a program i have watched and will talk about and laugh till it hurts about i will definitely recommend it to every one which i do most of the time anyway the writers and the cast add something that no other program has they have such a unique quality and if you have not watched it i advise that you do because you missing out on something so incredible i just cant believe it has finished i was so upset and it is so hard to watch the last episode because i no there is no more after it i would give it out of every time and stars its better than stars,POSITIVE,Comedy
2811,8.65,31 December 2002,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",could this show be any funnier yeah it probably could but is it most deffinitely worth your time the oneliners and varied characters always lend a nice flavor to the humor and while some of their material has gotten old in its eighth and ninth season its grip on the coveted thursday pm slot is far from slipping one thing i like is that even though there are story arcs in this series many of the episodes stand independent of each other plot lines are carried out over several episodes but it wouldnt be hard for a casual viewer to jump in and out friends always delivers great laughs every week tune in and you wont regret it,POSITIVE,Comedy
2812,8.65,7 February 2006,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i think that this is a great showmovie i think that it is one of the best ones ever in fact i am watching it right now i think it would be great for all of you this show is on tv on my different channels like on some fridays and many many more it is really funny and it gives you memories to remember it by so give it a try and your live will be the bestyou got it it is my favorite showmovie have a great day have a great day and remember that this is the show for you sweet dude,POSITIVE,Comedy

2814,8.65,19 January 2006,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this show is fantastic every single episode is hilarious how can it not be the script is well done and the characters work well together there is a certain chemistry about that group even though all of their personalities are totally different chandler is sarcastic and is always making a witty comment he is my favorite out of the group then you have monica a neat freak who has a big competitive drive her brother ross a dinosaur loving man has many funny moments the actor does a great job of portraying the geek and all his charms then there is rachel her personality is that of a shopping addict her personality was once more complex but after achieving her individuality she didnt have as many layers but she does give us some laughs as with her wants such as the time in the seventh season when she fell for her secretary and phoebe with her crazy ideas and schemes always makes a funny comment but i think that the most liked character would be joey with his perverted nature stupidity and most of all the he caring of his friends i love this show and have no complaints i give it,POSITIVE,Comedy
2815,8.65,14 February 2003,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",as far as sitcoms go this is the best the characters are likeable and theyve been around for about the last ten years so we really do feel like we know them by now the beauty of them is that you can watch them over and over and over and still find them funny now they arent exactly brainfood and they arent exactly realistic but then it is a sitcom and not panorama and its main purpose is to entertain and make people laugh and thats what friends does i think it is just as funny now as its ever been,POSITIVE,Comedy
2816,8.65,7 January 2006,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends has been one of the truly greatest tv programs of all time its witty characters and unmatched storyline which often is missed in most sitcoms where the story lines are often discarded and from time to time very good guests on the show such as george clooney bruce willis brad pitt and reese witherspoon to name a few each character joe rachel chandler monica pheobe and ross are such great characters that you can really relate to in some situations and in my personal opinion chandler being the best character in it with some of the best lines in tv history a definite,POSITIVE,Comedy
2817,8.65,30 December 2005,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends was and still is an incredible television show the writing done was absolutely brilliant with every episode having something to make it memorable the actors and actresses had wonderful delivery and the chemistry between the six is fantastic the main characters include monica an obsessive neat freak who is sister to ross a paleontologist that is still a geek on the inside ross was college roommates with chandler the sarcastic one with neverending girl problems rachel is the spoiled girl who you simply have to love joey is a struggling actor who has a weakness for meatball subs and phoebe is a massage therapistguitar player who has her own special point of view on things i own all seasons on dvd and have seen every episode and i would like to personally say that this could very well be and in my opinion most definitely is the greatest television show of all time may it go on forever in syndication,POSITIVE,Comedy
2818,8.65,8 January 2003,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",the actors and actresses are wonderful the characters are wonderful the plots are wonderful it couldnt get any better whoever says that friends is a bad horrible useless tv show well lets just say they couldnt be any more wrong ive been hooked on this show ever since it started and it only got better from then on why else would it have won so many awards so much praise and glued so many peoples eyes to the tv set on thursday nights and this show deserves all of it even years from now friends will still be loved and well recognized almost everybody can relate to the six characters and the lines are witty and extremely funny this isnt just an opinion its a guarantee,POSITIVE,Comedy
2819,8.65,31 October 2001,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i am quite insulted that some people think this is the best comedy since seinfeld firstly it is unfair to both shows because seinfeld cannot be matched i must admit that i watched a few of the earlier episodes because of the hype and the stars but i found it mediocre mildly amusing at best it wasnt awful just nothing particularly special it was bearable to the extent that i would watch it if there was nothing else on but recently i saw a couple of episodes of the new series and i was appalled by how bad it had become the jokes are just not funny anymore and appear to be based solely on the stupidity of the characters now who were never really that bright to begin with the characters have seem to have lost appeal and dimension becoming very single faceted especially joey ive noticed his iq dwindle quite significantly from the first series ross has always been annoying monica has never really been funny and phoebe has always been irritatingly unfunny chandler who was quite funny earlier because his jokes were based on wit has lost much his luster how it is able to sustain ratings is quite beyond me i think if people step back and look at how much the show has deteriorated they will realise that they have been watching the show for the sake of watching it rather than for any serious enjoyment either that or they still think the girlsguys are hot by the way how could aniston possibly be nominated for an emmy shes an adequate professional actor but definitely not emmy standard then again jerry seinfeld was nominated year after year despite looking like he was going to crack up laughing in at least one scene every episode,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2820,8.65,6 August 2002,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this show is one of my favorites on tv right now it shows the lives of out of college and living on their own friends through their dating lives and their friendship there are few shows that are about people in their twenties most are of those in their teens as watching the show i live in a fantasy world and hope that when i get into my twenties that ill have friends as close as the characters of this hit tv show friends that will help me through my hard times such as those on the show and i know i speak for many i will miss this show when it leaves the air and i hope that they have reunion movies and other movies based on this show such as the shows of the s and s i cant think of life without friends,POSITIVE,Comedy

2822,8.65,22 October 2000,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends happens to be one of the most humorous sitcoms in todays tv industry very watchful due to the funny storylines and loving friendship that each of the six characters give combined with the superstars the show features especially i want to make mention of courteney cox arquette i tell you courteney can be my friend anytime but she also can occupy my view anytime is she a sweetheart or what i can agree with people magazine that courteney is one of the most beautiful people in the world in any given year to bad shes married to david arquette hey courteney divorce david and marry me i want you as a mate for life just when you think you see beautiful women and more beautiful women something better comes along and that happens to be courteney cox for me courteney and her fabulous beauty along with her charisma are the most important factors that influence me to watch friends a great show enjoy the humor and courteney cox arquette,POSITIVE,Comedy

2824,8.65,15 April 2002,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",poeplepeople if this became americas show i think there s a pretty good reason the show deserves to be awarded so many emmys really everyone in the cast deserved to be praised its just damn hilarious and if people are criticizing this show they just have to shut up and get a life ofcourse we may think that ross and rachels relationship might me going on and off a little too often but who cares the rest is great and this show totally deserves to be loved whether in italy or china i went to italy last year and saw that on the french channel friends was on i just cant get over it and that even though i dont have time to watch every time its still god damn funny,POSITIVE,Comedy
2825,8.65,1 September 2002,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",could this show be any better showing the lives of the now thirtysomethings living in new york this programme can do no wrong monica and chandler now happily married are ready for a child as chandler is no longer afraid of comittment rachel and ross have their own bundle of joyemma gellar green but will joey become stepfather this programme is pure genius who would have thought a group of mainly foreversingletons thirty somethings could be so interesting,POSITIVE,Comedy

2831,8.65,6 January 2003,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i love friends and at first i couldnt work out why but then i realised its for the most simple of reasons the show is well scripted well cast and above all else the writers and actors have been able to create real characters that you cant help but love the key to the shows success i feel comes from the great backgrounds that each character has been given especially with each other the underlying history explains so much to us and gives us the feeling that these people really do know each other and have been friends for years i just hope that theres a few seasons left for this show because it would be a real shame to lose such a great comedy series and even more than that it would be a shame to not be able to watch chandler joey pheobe ross monica and rachel every week because they have such a real feel to them because not only do we know the characters but we know all about their somewhat comedic lives,POSITIVE,Comedy
2832,8.65,16 January 2003,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i generally tend to hate shows everyone wont shut up about and the ones that get like a gazillion viewers every week because that just makes you look harder for flaws but i cant do that with friends yes as everyone has said there are flaws but if you are looking for the flaws then youre missing the point anyways do you sit down and watch a sitcom to see what you can complain about in it or do you sit down to watch it and have fun one thing that you do need to get through this thing is a little suspension of disbelief however to believe that an actual person can be as ditzy as phoebe or as stupid as joey requires some leeway there joey would be put in special place if he were real and phoebewelllets just say shed also be a special girl the jokes are often very unrealistic in the fact that no ones life is that funny and no one tells jokes every seconds the whole laugh track seems timed and that is one thing i will comment on about being flawed i hate the whole system where they babble about something make a joke babble joke babble jokesee where im going and no one in the show seems to think anything is funny something insanely funny will happen to lets say phoebe so that you are cracking up and the other people ross rachel etc are just standing there their reactions are all wrong in one episode rachel let a pillow fall off their apartment balcony and later a man came to their door and handed the pillow to chandler who was unaware it had even fallen and he takes it with a weird look the laugh track goes crazy and he turns around and just sets it down not even bothering to ask his friends in the room what the hell was that about i mean who would just put it aside and not say hey guys someone just gave me a pillow hello he just forgets it sure but all this is not the point however bad it may seem its a fun show with funny situations and the characters are great so the show has endured for years if only people in real life knew how to kick it back like these people thered be no worries i think everyone could take an example from the characters of friends and by the way whats with the bad reviews i mean the show gets number or every week in the nielsensthat millions and millions of viewersobviously just aboutgee percent of america thinks its funny whos badmouthing the other percent enjoy it its a funny show,POSITIVE,Comedy

2836,8.65,24 December 2005,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i have seen friends so many times first from the beginning till the end and then every time i feel watching it between other daily activities and i can just say it is unique the best tv show ever made with all the things which made it impossible to compete writing directing are great and also all the actors really fit their place although it may seem strange but i know there are negative votes on friends and with all the respect i think humor is something which cannot be learned or thought so there will always be such people who think that making jokes or bringing laughter to other peoples life is a cheap way of entertaining anyhow i myself love the show and i think almost everything is perfect but it seems that guys cast crew is much more better than gals my personal idea david schwimmer rocks dont miss the series pals and enjoy every second regards shahab,POSITIVE,Comedy
2837,8.65,16 March 2003,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i really like this sitcom if it is a sitcomit has laughter and odd people so it probably is its in the same league as caroline in the city and home improvement with a dash of erstyledrama to make it all the more fun my only complaint is that the incidental music is predictable to decimal places,POSITIVE,Comedy

2840,8.65,7 April 2003,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",how to sum op a great comedyseries thats now in its th season its nowhere near stretched out the characters remain fresh and one can only wish you had friends like these theres chandler m bing the one who makes fun of his friends in this show yet they all make fun of him not always appreciated by mr bing himself married to monica geller these two are the only married couple inside this friends gang theres rachel karen green a once posh spoiled rich girl who made it on her own without help of her dads creditcard but with these friends joey francis tribbiani the ladies man who as an actor wishes to be al pacino instead of being just as good as him he may not be the smartest of the bunch but hes always there when you need a little joey ross geller the nerdy geeky guy works something with dinosaurs had a crush on rachel like forever and now has a child with her a bit soft but loyal to his friends it wouldnt be the same without a little bit ross monica geller the one whos always the host of the gang used to be very big when she was young she and rachel are the ones who know each other the longest obsessive in a funny way you can tell shes related to ross last but not least theres phoebe buffay the masseuse whos a bit weird and funky these friends share a life together most of the time in monicas appartment or at central perk a coffeehouse in new york and in a funny way we see whats going on in their lives recommended episodes are pilot episode tow no ones ready tow the prom video tow that couldve been tow the free porn tow all the thanksgivings tow everyone finds out tow the chick and the duck tow ross got high these are probably some of the best episode of the friends series in which you will find every character at hisher best but heck almost every episode is great the series never get boring from all of my dvds these are the ones that are played most often my rating out of,POSITIVE,Comedy
2841,8.65,11 December 2003,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",for me friends is really funny and i feel sorry for those who cant appreciate it although their not too well developed sense of humour isnt their fault they should try to educate theirselves no offense but maybe finishing a school would help this is not meant as an insult i just find friends truly great,POSITIVE,Comedy
2842,8.65,11 January 2003,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is a min show about friends who live in the state of new york some are roomates or married it basically shows their everyday life and events i know many people say that the plots are irealistic to begin with they are not that irealistic as many people make it seem first of all it is possible for you and your friends to live in the same city or be roommates it is also possible in real life to get married as did monica chandler or rachel ross and the past of each character adds a little something but are not impossible nor improbable ok so on the show there not always at work but its showing the times there at home or hanging out i must say i like friends because its funny and it gives you a glimpse of what could maybe seem like your future and i must add if this show sucked this much as many people say then why is it it has aired for around years and won and award because its good as are the acters each of them have mastered their character which makes it even better,POSITIVE,Comedy
2843,8.65,30 January 2006,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends tells the story of a group of people who are tied together by the force of friendship through their year journey they have filled our hearts with laughter joy and sometimes even sadness even in some cultures where living separately from ones family is very uncommon friends has shown that it is not as hard as it sounds and has even made me want to move out and live with my friends the great storyline and the way everything just fits it the best part of friends in some way at least one of the characters resembles you the goofy coffee house people live their life in the funniest manner giving us faith and courage about living life single and at the same time making us laugh the sweetness of rachael motherness of monica crazy hippy phoebe the sarcastic jokes of chandler the slow brain of joey and geeky ross all make us understand the importance of friendship this is truly a great show which has filled years of my life with laughter and if the ending episode didnt have such a heavy emotional effect on my heart i would gladly watch it with my friends around,POSITIVE,Comedy
2844,8.65,5 January 2003,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i dont think this is like saved by the bell its just friends which is much better than sbtb where has this guy been friends is a classic and will continue to be i cant wait for the next series to start on thursday i will be watching it every week so there,POSITIVE,Comedy

2846,8.65,1 April 2001,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i believe that friends has to be the best tv sitcom on television we can so easily relate to what is going on and actually in and indirect way be able to deal with our own problems through their solutions not only is it helpful that way its also a funny comedy show there is never a boring moment and the writers and actors always leave us wanting more i would have to say that they picked the greatest actors that they could have mattew perry for one is a terrific actor he has so much talent and is so funny,POSITIVE,Comedy
2847,8.65,29 July 2003,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends i think is the best sitcom on television i was seven when the series began in and ive watched ever since enjoying every second of it from spoiled rachel to analretentive monica to new age ditz phoebe to womanizer joey to smart aleck chandler to geeky ross the friends gang is often touching sometimes unusual but always hilarious throughout troubles love lives career difficulties and other problems the gand has survived it all in a comical way that never fails to brighten ones day the show will unfortunately be ending its run at the end of next season and im sorry to see it go i highly recommend this show to anyone of any age,POSITIVE,Comedy
2848,8.65,19 January 2004,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends has been one of my alltime favorite shows the writing has always been top notch with equally top notch acting the actors lucky enough to be cast in this very funny show have done it well for years kudos to ellie kanner for the initial casting of these fine comedic actors while i have enjoyed all of their performances i must confess that jennifer aniston matthew perry and matt leblanc have been my absolute faves with courtney coxarquette being my least favorite i feel her talents lie not with comedy per se but rather within the dramatic realm if lisa kudrow can keep her phoebe character out of other roles hasnt accomplished this yet she will have a fine film career i must comment though that even though ive enjoyed the comedic talents of aniston et al and their talented writers and producers i must not ignore my utter disappointment in the lack of gueststarring minorities in the years its been on the air with the notable exceptions of the talented gabrielle union and the actress who played joeythenross girlfriend in i was appalled at lack of ethnic minorities depicted on the show one needs only to walk out onto the sidewalk in ny to witness the cultural diversity fans from other countries never having been in manhattan surely might deduce that it is an allwhite territory i am continually bothered by hollywoods erroneous depiction of how america is why is it that sitcoms always have either an allwhite cast or an allblack cast this is and people of all races comingle and coexist everywhere except maybe in montana utah and places of similar demographic populations anyway its been a great years after a shaky first few episodes in friends developed into one of the alltime greats great writers producers and actors all share credit for this enormously funny sitcom i just hope that writers and producers in can create equally funny sitcom material that can be applied to another group of equally talented actors that displays diversity to the castwritersproducers of friends your fans bid you adieu,POSITIVE,Comedy
2849,8.65,17 January 2001,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is a model comedysitcom the characters are well defined each having their own personality and traits unique to them from monicas high maintenance to phoebes weirdness the producers of the show have done a good job to ensure friends never fell into the hashed out old boring theme found in shows such as mad about you and suddenly susan it reminds me to some extent of a seinfeld type show with the show content always being a little obscure in some way the script is well crafted the actors portray their characters magnificently and in a way in which most people can relate and while not being slap your thigh and laugh out loud funny its entertaining and well worth watching,POSITIVE,Comedy
2850,8.65,14 July 2003,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i find this to be a fantastic show that is so full of humor that you just forget all of your worries and get sucked into the lives of these six people albeit it is farfetched and the situations they find themselves in are not really realistic but it is a comedy after all and a good one at that,POSITIVE,Comedy
2851,8.65,13 June 2004,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is a great memorable series that came out in one of my favorite years of the s the show is about six friends in new york city who are on their own and struggling to survive in the real world find the companionship comfort and support they get from each other to be the perfect antidote to the pressures of life my favorite characters were rachel jennifer aniston phoebe lisa kudrow chandler matthew perry and joey matt leblanc i remember on the night of the series finale when i was out having dinner at a restaurant and it was pm and every one at the restaurant was watching the hour series finale on nbc and i said to myself that i was sure that every one all over the world was watching this if you like the show so much you can get it on dvd plus i also catch some of the repeats on fox this has been another great comedy series to remember along with the simpsons just shoot me dhrama and greg will and grace the fresh prince of belair the drew carey show and the king of queens user rating bottom line a great tvseries to remember,POSITIVE,Comedy
2852,8.65,6 August 2004,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i think that friends is great the story lines are so so so funny in every episode i laugh and laugh and laughespecially with ross the actors in my opinion jennifer aniston courtney cox arquette lisa kudrow matt le blanc mathew perry and david schwimmer were perfect i think that best characters were ross and rachel and maybe joey the love story between ross and rachel was the best we were on a break i think that because of the people that watched itfriends will be like seinfield it would be on tv again and again and people would never get tired of it at least i dont get tired of watching some episodes like the one with brad pitt and the one in vegas to sum up friends is one of the best shows on tv,POSITIVE,Comedy
2853,8.65,8 January 2002,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i use to be a huge fan of this show but now its lost all its appeal its not funny anymore the cast although great are not half as good the weird guest apperances by other movies stars is maybe the worst part,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2854,8.65,29 September 2001,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i have watched friends for a long time and i have to say that it is one of the best shows on the air today it is a downtoearth comedy about six friends who live in new york they all follow the trials and tribulations of love work and being the best thing of allfriends this is a show that i personally think will live on for ages to come,POSITIVE,Comedy
2855,8.65,4 December 2002,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",for some reason this base excuse for a sitcom seems to remain on our screens year in year out why is it that audiences cant see past the halfbaked scripts and street theatre acting to realise that it is merely a collection of hackneyed grated gags performed by an overpublicised cast who are screaming towards the main supporters of this show are evidently those who list their main asset as an unroadworthy rv and like their raccoons well done perhaps it would be appropriate if friends was to be relocated to a trailer park somewhere in the midwest of the us only then would we be able to see an episode where the cast become tornado fodder whenever i am forced to endure an episode it takes at least a flagon of sour mash for me to get past the first ad break every week its like being ambushed in a foxhole by bob saget and listening to his lame monologues while the napalm burns around you come on consumers demand more from your networks and let this dolphin get caught in the fishing nets where it belongs,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2856,8.65,18 May 2003,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i think friends and the simpsons are the best tv shows ever every episode has something refreshing and interesting in it of all the characters i like chandler the most i just love his sarcasm the other actors are great too i know some people think this show is getting worse if they dont like it why do they keep watching it friends is as funny as it has always been and i hope that i will have the seasons on dvd a welldeserved,POSITIVE,Comedy
2857,8.65,13 December 2002,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i thnk that is amazing how the writers could make such characters that the world can sink into there is so much history and every episode the plot unravels making you want to watch it more and more chandler is my favorite character because he is soooooo funny i love all the characters and i hope that there will be a th season friends is the best show that will ever be created,POSITIVE,Comedy
2858,8.65,7 May 2001,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is such a brilliant show since the show started in every episode has been absolutely brilliant and always very funny its great how jennifer aniston courteney cox lisa kudrow matt leblanc matthew perry and david schwimmer really do there characters so well i couldnt imagine anyone else playing rachel monica pheobe joey chandler and ross besides these guys friends is one of the best shows ever if not the best show i love this show friends forever,POSITIVE,Comedy
2859,8.65,12 November 2004,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i like very much this show i think it is done very well with various stories really intricated and many many gags its plenty with guest star that play strange rules for their characters as brad pitt or julia roberts or bruce willis many themes that are in the show are well presented with no hypocrisy or welldonestuffthings but with seriety and goodfeelings with many laugh too i think that this show is more comic than most of other show now in tv and you feel like this guys are your amici im buyng all the series on dvd and i watch and watch it pspardon me for my englishi know its really bad bye,POSITIVE,Comedy
2860,8.65,19 March 2000,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i love watching friends for many reasons the series is well written and acted my favourite is the fantastic lisa kudrow the characters are very well outlined except for monica shes really insignificant and i think that is one of the most important things for a tv series but friends is not the n ive seen many comedy really smashing friends is absolutely politically correct its like a very well homework but i think something like sex and the city frasier seinfeld are the decisive s comedy series not friends even if it makes me laugh but it doesnt make me think,POSITIVE,Comedy
2861,8.65,22 December 2002,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",the only reason that this show is still popular is because it was the first sitcom to use the whole storyline and plot it was the original out a while longer than the rest so as soon as ellen and drew carey and all came out not long after friends already had an audience everyone thought these other shows were clones and friends was the best it survives now only because the characters are very over the top extreme and daft not to mention dumb they seem to try to hard to make you laugh i think the directors just want to see what they can get away with it has been announced another season of friends to be made im gonna watch the last two eps praying therell be a really sad ending thatll finally kill the show,POSITIVE,Comedy
2862,8.65,14 July 2003,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i love friends its my favorite show ever the main idea of show is brilliant because there is so much you can do with this sort of plot i laugh every episode thats on tv i have every friends season on dvd i enjoy watching it because it also envolves every day life for some people overall i think this is a great show and i recommend this show to all viewers who like comedy series and like to laugh every time you watch it,POSITIVE,Comedy
2863,8.65,8 September 2001,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this is my favourite american sitcomwith frasier following behind the first series was not so funny but the series came into its own in series then peaked in series and but getting a little desperate by the end of series the first epiosde of series is probably the funnies episode in the series but after that series goes downhill you can tell they are getting desperate for example they are using more and more flash backs to the past the stort lines are getting weaker and i waish oss and rachel would hurry up and get back together anyway still worth watching i have lost count of the umber of times ive watched my friends videos its not up there with the classics like only fools and horses although any americans may not regard that as a claasicit is regarded as a classic in england anyway friends gets,POSITIVE,Comedy
2864,8.65,9 July 2001,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is the best shoe ever it has everything anyone could want its fit for any age and has a great cast exept for david schwimmer the characters are fantastic lets take rachel for starters shes funny spoiled pretty loves to shop but when it gets to ross she cannot let him be if hes with someone else she wants him but when hes all alone she could care less then theres monica i like courteney cox but monica gets on my nerves with her neatness and obsessive behavior nobody can forget phoebe she is one of the best she usually doesnt make any sense she is very funny i love it when shes mean to ross and when she flirts with chandler and joey oh and her songs are the funniest ever now who can say they dont love smelly cat then theres joey hes cute funny because hes stupid and kinda slow i like this character but couldnt stand it if he ends up with phoebe then theres the best the one and only chandler bing he makes the show what is without his wit and sarcastic remarks friends would be nothing not to mention he is drop dead gorgeous and in the end theres ross i like this character because he makes me laugh with hes depressing hi and his geaky ways but there is just one thingi hate david schwimmer like really really dislike himhe is annoying and not that good looking he has no career outside friends without this show hed be nothing i mean has anyone seen the pallbearer thats the worst movie ever hes acting in other movies are just poor but overall friends is the best show ever and i give it a out of,POSITIVE,Comedy
2865,8.65,19 October 2003,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",probably how funny the programme is different people all living in new york i could think of that but the characters are great and the situations they get into are pretty hilarious chandler is the funniest and is always sarcastic joey is lovable phoebe is a dumb blonde who believes in spiritual things and thats a pretty fun character to have monica is very obsessive and clean these days someone who is like this is called a monica ross is quite funny when he has his moments on how camp and nerdy he is and rachelwell ok great characters fun show impressive guests great situations so sad to see it go,POSITIVE,Comedy
2866,8.65,15 March 2003,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i know these guys been working long but a cool mil an epi thats just plain crazy what are they doing thats so damn important that they need that much to work the shows good but its not that good you have monica the neurotic with an ar disorder beyond belief rachel the perpetual highschool cheerleader rich girl type and perhaps the most annoying whos trying to be independent of daddy phoebe the flower child hippie person who was probably going through withdrawal at birth and tries to sing rancid songs about smelly cats with that damn guitar ross the brother to said neurotic with issues of security and obsessiveness whos been divorced more times than liz taylor with kids chandler the only funny one who always appears gay on first sight and joey the sandwich eating struggling actor who should struggle because he stinks with a penchant for sleeping with women all these characters are just exaggerated forms of people we hate and would beat with a stick if we had the chance they become funny when theyre put in funny situation but they do make me laugh my laughing aint all the way to the bank like theirs though,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2867,8.65,6 May 2004,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",im sitting here watching the very last episode and i see these practically something well kudrow is actors saying words that would be more appropriate to someone easily ten years their junior i stopped watching this show about or years ago and im amazed that the very last episode still has the characters talking about literally the same thing but anyway season finales are notoriously bad inevitably producers feel the need to come up with some crazy plot line etc blah blah blah maybe one day theyll just decide to do a series finale that feels like all the other episodes that made the series a hit in the first placebut i digresswere we really supposed to care whether rachel ended up with ross afterall these years give me a break fun is fun but is joey chandler worrying about how theyre going to break apart their beloved foosball table really all that funny then the two of them reminiscing on all the good times they had with the foosball table can someone please pass the barf bag anyway did rachel ross get together in the end did they oh did they of course they did hello,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2868,8.65,11 April 2001,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",let me tell you about my friends they are funny boisterous in every sense and there is something fresh and new every episode how can you not like the show the show is awesome i love each character equally i would never say i like rachel or monica at any time they all do their fair share in my opinion i cant contemplate why the show hasnt won an emmy or a golden globe for their work a whole bunch of nominations is what that show got it needs to win and i believe it will soon enough go friends go,POSITIVE,Comedy
2869,8.65,18 December 2004,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",the show friends is one of the most successful sitcoms the world has seen it has an all star cast and fantastic writers the raw talent of the writers is unbelievable it is rare to get so many jokes in one episode from a sitcom but friends never fails to please when people watch the show they compare themselves with one of the characters whether it be neurotic monica or geeky ross either way they shine a light on the stereo typical people in the world making them feel better about themselves you can tell by watching the sitcom that there is a friendship outside the media bubble and that on and off set they will always be there for each other this may sound like i am favouring friends over other sitcoms but it is the most successful because of the witty jokes that are put into the love factor people always say that the ross and rachel situation is too much for a sitcom and that it shouldnt have gone on for so long but they are the most famous couple in the television world even people who arent so keen on the show always have a favourite character or episode and i think that shows that the sitcom has such a big effect on the world it draws you in and makes you believe that you could be a friend with so many personalities in the show it lets everyone have someone to compare to chandlerwitty rossgeeky joeysweet but dumb monica cleaning freak has to be perfect rachelprom queen bimbo pheobeblonde individual the show wouldnt be here today without the creators david crane marta kauffman and kevin bright lisa kudrow quotes there would be no six of us without the three of them and that hits the point head on they have made sure that the writers are the best and that the actors are like they are they opened doors for these six actors and have given them their futures without crane kauffman and bright they would probably be sat at home watching the show just like everyone of us and wishing that they could play the part of their favourite character the only reason they got to play the parts of these characters is because of their own personalities as that was the deciding point in the casting so before people comment on the structure of friends id like them to put pen to paper and write a show as successful as it then and just then can they make remarks on the show,POSITIVE,Comedy
2870,8.65,25 May 2003,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i got into this show about or years ago and i was quickly hooked it was always so refreshing and funny i was so upset last year when they were thinking about ending it after seasons and i was at first very happy when the cast signed on for a th season yet i soon realized they should have ended it after season there were a few funny moments this year but most of it was just lame the writers just really ran out of ideas for example the whole ross and rachel drama was funny the first million times but now after nine seasons theres still talk about whether or not they are going to get back together and they have a baby together and to add to that joey gets a crush on rachel while shes pregnant with ross baby but she doesnt like himbut then she does and they hook up what is that im tired of the show having the friends hooking up with each other and all these other crazy story lines i cant even imagine what the tenth season is going to be like i have the first seasons on dvd along with the fan favorites i would definitely recommend watching the older episodes in fact i think the show is great until chandler and monica get married the show really should have ended then but what show ever ends at its peak of course the producers are going to wait until it dries out its audience compare the first seasons with the last couple seasons the older episodes are much more enjoyable than the newer ones it was great to watch the friends grow and become successful but it was just more funny when they were still struggling in their s its like a completely different show now that they are all in their s and have to settle down as much as i love to watch this show i am definitely ready to say goodbye its time for everyone to move on,POSITIVE,Comedy
2871,8.65,4 May 2001,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is the funniest show i have ever seen its funny but can be serious at times this is a show about friends who have a unique relashionship this show has made me laugh and made me cry its a show for everybody trust me you will love friends take my advice on thursday night sit down and watch friends trust me you wont be sorry,POSITIVE,Comedy
2872,8.65,14 May 2004,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",while most series finales are less than stellar i thought the friends finale stank particularly bad i was beginning to think that seinfeld ended better they brought back all the memorable characters relived old memories and generally engaged the audience much better by contrast in friends there was absolutely no mention of joey moving to la and nothing about ross kid ben just to name a few large loose ends they shouldve spent less time on the rachelross simpering sessions which got really annoying towards the end and a tad more time tying everything up the frasier finale from last night on the other hand was very satisfying now that was a good show,POSITIVE,Comedy
2873,8.65,12 May 2001,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",all the stars are fabulous their acting is flawless each episode is worth watching times each moment is fun filled definitely worth skipping all other tv programmes that may clash with it,POSITIVE,Comedy

2875,8.65,21 April 2001,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is my favorite sitcom and has been since it aired in i love each and every one of the friends i feel like i know them and that they are my friends they are funny and lovable and every episode is fun to watch i watch about episodes a day we have plenty of reruns and i never miss any i know them all by heart because they are so funny and touching the show has lasted this long i believe thanks to the great relationship among the members of the cast offstage it is very important and it is clearly shown through their acting its true the last two seasons have been a bit less funny than the previous ones but they still are funny and very fun to watch i hope this show is never canceled,POSITIVE,Comedy
2876,8.65,4 October 2001,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i would have to say friends has long since crested its appex last seasons shows were all devised as obvious attempts to steal survivors megalithic ratings when a show cant gain ratings on its own a lesbian college kiss between the beatlegeuse girl and jennifer anistan pitt come on now thats straying far from the shows baseline stories is a sign of serious writers block in the shows creative team also these friends are really demanding when it comes to nbc dishing out the dough why should nbc pay them phenomenal paychecks when average sparinglypaid people living in the wild are wiping the floor with them on the other station rachael pregnant whos the father who cares if nbc is really ratings hungry brad pitt will make a special appearance as the father i would rather watch jeff probst and dirty normal everyday people sturggling against each other in the bush,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2877,8.65,17 May 2003,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",why is it in america whenever something is great they have to ruin it songs on the radio that get played every minutes horrid movie sequels casablanca with jlo and great tv shows that just dont know when to throw in the towel i realize that whether friends is still good or bad is not the issue when it comes to business and advertising as long as people still watch the show nbc can sell their advertising spots at a very high price the quality of the show is not relevent so sad when friends first aired and people started talking about it i refused to watch i thought pretty people who all are friends in nyc not interested it was only by the rd or th season when it was still going strong that i decided to watch it much to my surprise it was hilarious i was completely hooked i was so glad that they put the reruns on other channels so i could see all the great stuff i missed it was a great ensemble cast often i pondered which charactor i liked the best and the least while ross always came up as the most annoying while discussing friends with anyone he actually was a very good charactor they all had something about them that made them almost equally interesting and funny i never was disappointed if they focused more on one charactor than another i thought the show was very well acted and the actors had great comedic timing i must say that throughout chandler was probably the funniest and most adorable this brings me to my point friends jumped the shark a long time ago i dont remember the exact moment but chandler and monica in my oppinion the worlds worst couple getting married no no no them dating was actally kinda cute but them being married like on many other shows just killed the story line chandler was funny single insecure guy who had a great personality but was clueless with women also i realize that just by virtue of their age that him and joey still living as roommates would seem unlikely but them living together and the scenes with them were some of the funniest on the show monica was funny in her own way but her and chandler together killed the funniest parts of the both of them monicas neurosiss just got intensley annoying as she henpecked chandler draining him of all his humor ross and rachel having a baby ok i liked ross and rachel together they were a great couple because they were so different the geek and the prom queen they had real chemistry but now years later when they had one last fling and she got knocked up i always thought that they should end friends with rachel and ross falling for each other again and maybe end the series with their marriage but that clearly wont happen again because as we see now their fling was a drunken meaningless one and now rachel lives with ross and all they do is annoy the crap out of each other becasue they both still want to date other people and now its considered rude and insensitive this last episode reminded me of the last seinfeld which i hated where they portayed the charactors in just the worst possible light phoebes long lost lover comes back from minsk and she reunites with him but is still in love with another guy mike she keeps saying mike when shes addressing david how cruel and unlike her real charactor it was terrible i thought they could have summed phoebe up by bringing her back with david who she seemed to truly love years back and was devastated that he had left last but not least joey and racheli must admit it was a little exciting to see them kiss and weird too but the whole thing is just a little too incestuous rachel has a small baby from the former love of her life on a one night stand and now one of his best friends is gonna start something up with her i realize stuff like this does actually happenbut its a little pathetic and dont want to see it on a show i used to love this is like all those shows that get so desperate for story lines that they have celebrity appearances and go to hawaiiits just time to pull the plug,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2878,8.65,5 January 2000,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is a good sitcom but not the best show ever in my opinion there are some rather brilliant comedic moments and a great assortment of characters friends uses certain qualities that remind me of seinfeld i poke fun at that with my dad who really enjoys this series a lot more than me granted the show usually repeats itself and that gets annoying like the whole ross and rachel relationship enough said on that i also thought the series was a bit of a work in progress and stale during the first season still the cast is pretty solid and the series started to take off by the second season overall id say it is a good show,POSITIVE,Comedy
2879,8.65,3 April 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends are so unfunny worst minutes of my life i am so angry that i spent my time to watch this trash would not recommend to anyone,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2880,8.65,23 May 2020,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this is literally seinfeld but less funny and made to be more mainstream friendly would not recommend if you are over the age of,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2881,8.65,19 September 2008,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",it became a bad soap opera during the leadup to chandler and monicas wedding and then it just got worse the last two seasons are completely unwatchable monica became annoying rachel an big executive who could afford a nanny please that was a stretch and phoebe suddenly became a bore chandler became annoying because as monica became more insane he just enabled her and humored her because he was so afraid of getting mad at her the writing became bland the situations became unbelievable and the guy who played phoebes future husband is a mannequin he has no personality or talent he was not funny and he sucked the life out of every scene the finale was predictable and boring they should have ended the series after season or,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2882,8.65,23 September 2002,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",ive watched each episode more than times i know every line and it stills cracks me up i love all the characters i even love janice for crying out loud but i felt really disappointed when i watched this last season i can honestly say that it kinda sucked i mean joey falling in love with rachel whats that all about i think thats just trying too hard it should end already and if it ended i think i wouldnt be the only one to keep watching the reruns over and over but there is one thing that really bugs me all these great seasons and not one single emmy for best comedy and now for the worst friends season ever they get one thats really pathetic,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2883,8.65,11 July 2008,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is hailed as one of the best sitcoms the s ever produced and that high regard holds true years after it ended its phenomenal run it is often considered a more universal show than others in its league on the surface it seems typical a few locations the characters frequent laugh track situational irony what differentiates the show however is very much its core idea friendship against all odds it may seem difficult to make such a concept as funny as it became in the hands of the creators but the show manages with ease even in the beginning when the group still seemed rough around the edges almost right away friends adapted a strongly serialized format creating story arcs that lasted for whole seasons at times references to past occurrences continuing plot lines from one episode to the next and from season to season though some might find this concept too soap operalike the main intention is clear it mirrors real life the show never tried to shove morals down viewers throats condescend to lowbrow humour or be drastically different and yet just by doing this it was different throughout the shows run even though there were points where the quality dipped just a little the writing and setup remained razorsharp something unexpected due to its nature for many of the milestone episodes the shows original creators david crane and marta kauffman would take over writing and remind us what made the characters so endearing real and hilarious and thats where the real strength lies the ensemble cast worked seamlessly together never missing a beat from episode to episode on their own they could shine but together they took on a new concept some story lines broke them off into groups of two or three and each character had a different dynamic with every other character creating a complexity that again was unexpected but behind all this the show had a wonderful simplicity the characterizations could not be broken down easily although each one had neuroses and reallife qualities and they were all simply trying to get through life with each others help along the way four of the six eventually paired off within the group monica and chandler about halfway through ross and rachel offandon throughout and it only strengthened the bonds and the humour rather than failing miserably as it may have done in the hands of some to quote a recent editorial on the best tv shows ever it claimed to be about friends but it was really about family,POSITIVE,Comedy
2884,8.65,20 August 2007,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this is show is about the lives of six people who are very good friends they get into very funny situations and its also very touching at times it is very good that the show went on for as long as i did my favorites are joey chandler lisa kudbrow and jennifer aniston shes super hot although i dont really like the mathew perry character cause hes kinda gay anyway this is such a great tv show and it never gets old i have never laughed harder than at some of the episodes like the one where the stripper cries or the one where rachel has a baby i laughed my ass off every time i see it its shows like this one that really make me appreciate american television overall this is an hilarious tv show and if you dont like it than your probably just some friendless loser with no life who sits around on hes fat ass and eats tacos all day bob,POSITIVE,Comedy
2885,8.65,2 February 2004,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this is a funny show everytime i watch friends it makes me laugh from start to finish i love all the characters on the show but i love phoebe the most played by lisa kudrow she always makes me laugh i just wish they could make another full season together it is a bit too early to end friends now they should film season and we can see monica chandler in their new home see how phoebe and mike are doing they could go on forever with tons of jokes and special guests there is no need to end the show i think friends should return and keep on going until they run out of ideas,POSITIVE,Comedy
2886,8.65,23 April 2004,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",ive been a fan of this show since its st seasonits among some of my most favorite shows that grow up with me when i was a high school friend of mine told me theres a show on tv called friends which has a great theme song ill be there for you and said i should catch this showsofollowing her recommendation i began watching friendsuntil nownow im and i still watch it i do agree with some ppl that it seems therere no more plots in this show and should have ended long ago ross and rachel on and off and on and off for yrs come on but i still love this show they give me a good laugh every week i love chandlers jokes joeys cuteness and his undenials of being a pig and a man who doesnt wanna grow up phoebes strange temper and smelly cat and many of her other weird but funny songs rosss constant labellingofhimself doctor ross geller and the like monicas obsession of cleanliness and order as well as rachels habit of gossiping although friends is losing new plots as the years go by i think its good to end it after years a decade sounds good for a shows life expectancy right,POSITIVE,Comedy
2887,8.65,23 November 2003,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",could it be anymore funny and perfect friends have the chance of having an amazingly talented castplus as a groupits the most connectedinside and outside the set on tv the writing is brilliant and the story lines are clever unlike many other shows you can watch friends more than one timei watch reruns a day my advice to allwhenever you feel depressed or sadtune to friendsit will cheer you up and whenever you feel happytune to friendsit will make you happier friendsyou changed my life years ago simply the best,POSITIVE,Comedy
2888,8.65,1 October 1999,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is one of the best written funniest sitcoms today and possibly of all time it is definitely a show that will be remember years from now like bewitched and threes company each star jennifer aniston rachel courteney cox monica lisa kudrow phoebe matt leblanc joey matthew perry chandler and david schwimmer ross adds their own good acting skills and bring their characters greatly to life you can relate to their neurotic behavior and situations and you feel like you can really be friends with these people my favorite character is chandler his dry and sarcastic and neurotic personality and great stage presence from matthew perry makes this character one of the most unforgettable and i have to say that phoebe is well after him the new and hottest storyline chandler and monica keeps the show fresh and adds great new comic situations if you havent seen friends im pretty sure that you will love it,POSITIVE,Comedy
2889,8.65,26 July 2004,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends has been in my life for years and im years old what makes me so drawn towards this show is the fact that these people are real and that everyone has a part of monicachandlerrossracheland joey in them these characters arent out of the ordinary they feel like real people this show is really different i mean there is no supernatural or unnatural details in the show basic one word is hilarious thats all there is to describe the show it also seems like the names are so perfect for the characters because i really cant imagine any other names for any of the friends friends is just as close to reality as a tv show could be i am sad yet happy to see the friends go away but i cant wait for joey to come out this fall,POSITIVE,Comedy
2890,8.65,1 September 2004,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i recently started watching friends its a bit weird that the first episode i saw was the finale but once i saw it for the first time i knew it had a great history behind it so i started watching season one and worked my way through the entire years i must say it is very easy to get addicted to it what i enjoy watching most is the trials and tribulations that go on between ross and rachel im always eager to learn what happens to them in each season some people say that friends was on television for too long i strongly disagree because it is a great show that people can relate to others say that they do not like how many of the friends get married or how in the later seasons they get into more fights etc while some people think they should just go back to being friends i say the writers of the show did the right thing if they were just friends throughout the entire years it would get rather boring not to mention it is an example of real life no group of friends stays perfectly fine forever they are bound to have their fights relationship crisis etc this just shows how life really is what is so great about friends is that it keeps you laughing constantly and makes you cry when things dont work out between the characters it has variety and thats what is so great about it i am heartbroken it went off the air but i sadly agree it was time for it to end friends will always bring laughter to those who watch it and bring memories of a time when characters were sometimes more than friends,POSITIVE,Comedy
2891,8.65,3 January 2002,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",something amazing about friends you can only watch each episode once if that because they immediately cease to be funny whenever you see a rerun once you get past that they have no minority friends or even other friends though when its time to throw a party they can find enough people to fill their apartment the dorks are still annoying they are immature selfish and dumb sure that was also true on seinfeld but that show reveled in all that you loved watching them but you werent supposed to love them friends is like product hyperplacement you are supposed to want to be like them and buy all the stuff they have ricky ricardo on i love lucy owned his own nyc nightclub and couldnt afford all the stuff these idiots have essentially this show is about the actors hair and thats it i am glad theyre canceling it its just old in years well look at it the way we regard bosom buddies today,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2892,8.65,20 April 2006,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i can successfully say that i have seen every episode of friends starting with season one in central perk to the end of season ten in monicas apartment this show is amazing when watching it one cannot help but feel like they are one of the friends i was so disappointed when friends ended but its always nice to watch the reruns i collect the dvds and have the game this show is the absolute best show ever i can be in the most terrible mood and after seconds of friends i can set aside my problems and just hysterically laugh its a great relief knowing that my friends are there for me i definitely am a friends fanatic,POSITIVE,Comedy
2893,8.65,6 September 2000,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this is my alltime favorite tv show ever my second favorite is newsradio which is also great but it doesnt come close to matching this if they would release them on video here in the usa i would buy every episode i envy the british who have every episode on tape including even the most recent and all but the latest season on dvd its a great show and i think its better than seinfeld which is pretty much responsible for its popularity speaking of seinfeld i wish theyd release all those episodes on dvd too ala xfiles,POSITIVE,Comedy
2894,8.65,26 June 2001,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this is not just a situation comedy this is how life should bethere is a perfect mix of little dramas and of the wittiest scripts ive ever came across furthermore the cast is so cool you cant but love them the best piece of tv comedy ever,POSITIVE,Comedy
2895,8.65,1 August 2002,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is one of those shows that will always be around years from now well be watching it on nick at nite then tv landyes its one of those lifelong friends that you never have to worry about losing what makes this show work is the chemistry between the characters and the actors who play them sure the one liners plots and jokes are great but it wouldnt be the same if there wasnt chemistry courteney coxarquette jennifer aniston lisa kudrow david schwimmer matthew perry and matt leblanc work together so well so fluently and so convincingly that you start to really care about the characters their quirky habits walk the line between charming and annoying but come out so much more charming because theyre so relatable jennifer aniston plays rachel green out of all the characters id say shes changed the most we saw her go from a prissy rich girl who just left a man at the altar and painfully cutting up her credit cards to a successful confident independent woman plus shes got some great hair courteney coxarquette plays a formerly fat monica gellar ross schwimmer sister and now chandlers wife shes a neat freak if there ever was one and thats where many of her laughs come from lisa kudrow plays phoebe buffay my personal fave a ditzy but lovable folk singer and massuse her songs are hilarious who can forget smelly cat david schwimmer plays ross monicas brother and the father of rachels baby emma i feel hes been overlooked in the cast hes a little geeky a little dorky but youve gotta love him hes had three failed marriages first wife a lesbian second accidently said rachels name at the alter thrid he and rachel got drunk in vegas and eloped he and rachel have been the on againoff again on a break couple of the show and fans are rooting for them to be the next couple matthew perry plays chandler bing his one liners are classic and his sarcasm is hilarious could he be any funnier matt leblanc is the aspiring emphasize that word actor who like phoebe is a little ditzy and quite the womanizer friends has been able to take the usual sitcom plot and liven it up to make it something new and exciting as well as come up with many plot twists and storylines of their own ill let you know if i ever see a bad episode of friends until then sit down turn on your tv eat some popcorn and enjoy friends,POSITIVE,Comedy
2896,8.65,2 July 2002,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this show may have some weak points ross whining season eight but it is still my favorite show i really didnt like season eight too much because it was so much of a soap opera and since when did monica get to be such a clean freak type person i think it may have happened as soon as everyone found out she was dating chandler btw does anyone else think they arent a very good couple it may just be me but they seem a little mismatched still i like this show it has just the right amount of strange humor to keep me entertained thanks,POSITIVE,Comedy
2897,8.65,23 March 2003,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",to thirteenthfriday no inconveinent prenancies what about emma you seem to know so much about the show but dont know about rachel having a baby its not a reality show its a comedy people dont laugh at serious things if you dont like the show dont watch it haha sorry i am upset that you think that everything has to always be realistic me,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2898,8.65,27 August 2001,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",although i admit i enjoy seeing friends ive got a problem with postproduction and the backing laughs which many times come on when nothing funny has actually been said cant the staff do better and keep them in a low profile or just drop them anyway this is a problem common to all sitcoms as other people have commented here its time to put an end to friends why simple the cast is not in their latetwenties anymore and is getting outrageous amounts of money for what they do add to this the fact that the writers seem to have squeezed their brains dry looking for decent plots and these are getting dull and weak for instance why did they need to bring winona ryder to kiss jennifer aniston was that intended to gain some audience who prefers survivor if a sitcom gets to the point of including a lesbian kiss to attract potential viewers it only proves the show is running out of ideas eight years is too much time for any tv show so the smartest decision in artistic terms of course would be to call it quits now before friends dies from lack of inspiration and greed from the actors many sitcoms have made the same mistake before going on and on until becoming rubbish and sadly thats how theyre remembered seinfeld comes to mind its actually curious how little success most of the friends cast has achieved elsewhere maybe courtney cox has been the luckiest one in lousy horror movies like scream but most of the rest havent been very wise choosing acting roles in movies at least regarding quality friends first season was weak and little funny the second season was better so they were the third and the fourth and the fifth was the best season ever probably due to the chandlermonica secret affair even after being discovered by their pals hysterical that episode as a matter of fact kept being amusing early series lived up to expectations but was slowly losing interest i cant say a lot about the seventh season since i live in a country where it hasnt been aired yet but according to people who have seen it the downhill slide has continued and now theyre about to start series i wonder what the writers will come up with after the wedding are they planning to make the still single foursome tie the knot as well who knows one may complain that friends is a show full of cute faces and that is not realistic even i say that myself but the problem is thats what the bulk of the audience wants to see whether we like it or not rating,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2899,8.65,6 April 2009,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is a great show that deals with many different issues i particularly took interest in the episode involving phoebe when she decided to donate the use of her uterus to house embryos for a couple that could not have children without the help of phoebe this episode really stood out because it showed that there are couples who have realistic dreams that they are not able to fulfill on their own this deals with science and the ability to create embryos without sexual activity this episode shows why such practices should continue to be legal and the positive effects that it has on many couples in the world today the positives of such practices seem to far outweigh the negatives such as a story that has been in the news recently apparently there is a woman who has been fertilized twice through in vitro fertilization and now has children and no father for any of them this is a rare case and should not be the basis of an argument against this technology,POSITIVE,Comedy
2900,8.65,1 July 2001,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",ive pretty much seen every epposode my friends and i all have the best of friends dvds and vhs the cast is perfect for the roles it shows what life really is wo putting fake things that never happen things like sleeping with your best friend then falling inlove with him and marrying him also things like have three devorces and only being watch this show its great,POSITIVE,Comedy
2901,8.65,15 October 2000,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",when i was young and still living in la i liked shows like bewitched and i dream of jeannie which i still love i also liked all those animated cartoons which i now dont with the exception of those made for more mature audiences such as daria and dilbert but the first ever show in my mature life that i loved was friends i first got into it when all the grownups of my family one night watched friends and seinfeld i wasnt too impressed with seinfeld which i now love as mush as friends but i did love friends seinfeld is hilariously funny but the jokes are more sophisticated and can be understood much more by adults or teenagers than young kids friends whilst having its share of sex and political jokes can be liked by kids of younger ages as a lot of jokes are simpler or more visual i still get a kick of watching all the old episodes i watched when i was young i didnt understand so many jokes then or mistook them for other meanings and i now go of course how could i have missed that the cast is great i dont know why so many people keep attacking monica i actually like her a lot my favorite character no doubt has to be phoebe played by the hilarious lisa kudrow who could have potential movie talent which she wasted on movies with no potential but she is climbing up since analyze this phoebe is the very zany spiritual not very knowledgeable woman who can also remember stuff from her past lives chandler played by matthew perry who like lisa did stupid movies until the whole nine yards proved to be funny and successful is the cynical sarcastic guy who makes most inside jokes and whose job is a mystery to all monica played by courteney cox now with the addition of arquette to the name courteney probably proved to be most successful on the big screen with the scream trilogy is the cleaningfreak tidy neurotic of the gang chandler and monica make a great couple joey played by matt leblanc whose only movie worth mentioning is lost in space is the dumbest guy in the group every group has one rachel played by jennifer aniston whos movies are all rather stupid and is now married to brad pitt is the spoiled one from the rich background who loves shopping ross played by david schwimmer who has made some pretty stupid movies including one he made with his israeli actress wife mili avital is the geeky scientist guy who has been married three times four years to the mother of his child who turned out to be a lesbian for a split second with emily who oops instead of saying her name at the ceremony said rachels who he married out of drunkenness in vegas friends is not as funny as it was in the first four seasons but it is still very enjoyable and worth watching ross and rachel are kinda getting on my nerves always leading us to believe theyre on again then off and ross is just getting way too whiny but i love friends and i dont see how anybody can hate it these are just anti people friends is unhatable you may not like it but i dont see how you can hate it,POSITIVE,Comedy
2902,8.65,18 February 2004,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i love this show it never misses a beat with its hilarious humor most episodes are hilarious with only a few here and there that arent quite up to par the characters are so great each one is developed enough so we can really relate to some of them in my opinion the best season is with ross getting marcel the monkey and other things even though the show is ending soon reruns will be on forever people will remember this show till the end,POSITIVE,Comedy
2903,8.65,5 November 2005,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i have watched many tv shows out there but none of them compare to how great friends is friends isnt just about having friends but its about sharing memories together and having fun times the best part in my opinion about friends is the very last episode of the th season its really suspenseful and it keeps you on the edge of your seat its also sad at the same time but i wont spoil anything for anyone who hasnt watched the final episode yet i like monica the best because shes really organized although sometimes she can be very competitive but shes a really great character what i find weird about joey is that sometimes he knows a lot but other times hes really stupid for example he cant add simple addition in his head but another time he can do minus hes a pretty funny character though rachel is the whiniest character but its really hilarious when she whines its so real ross is such a nerd it seems weird that such a cool person like rachel would fall for him but thats part of how funny this is ross is really funny in his own special way phoebe is one of those characters who is really funny and pretty brilliant as well shes a great character chandler bing wow hes a real joker and i think he and monica go great together i wish friends went on for more than seasons but oh well friends is the greatest show,POSITIVE,Comedy
2904,8.65,21 May 2000,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i loved friends during its initial four seasons the actors were brilliant the writing was perfect and true to the shows premise it was the best comedy of the s unfortunately these last two seasons were completely messed up with seinfelds departure friends became more of a seinfeld than a standout comedy about young people attempting to live their lives independently i no longer like phoebe she was fantastic from the pilot to her giving birth to her brothers triplets but afterwards she became a stupid character unfriendly selfish its not the freespirited phoebe i once knew and loved these six young people no longer act like friends the writing changed completely what happened to ross rachel when did rachel stop loving ross we never see rosss son anymore monica chandler are the most boring couple ive ever seen we hardly see them together they dont have any chemistry like ross rachel had the stories used to be dramatic and characterbased they grew and learned from their actions recently theres been no dramatic development on friends instead awful episodes like the unagi episode which doesnt make any sense in the overall storyline went on air i hope friends gets back on track next season developing its characters in realistic ways as it used to i want this show back to the glory it was held for four seasons instead of becoming another dumb sitcom of the s like seinfeld,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2905,8.65,30 May 2004,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i only really started watching friends a couple of years ago but since then ive been a massive fan it never fails to make me laugh i dont have favorite episode just lots of favorite moments like when joey gets locked in the cabinet by the burglar and when he gets the turkey stuck on his head then when rachel and ross get locked out of the apartment and rachel starts worrying about emma i havent got a favorite character i just love the way the cast react to one another and work together to make the show funny the last episode made me cry when they all left their keys on the side now its time to collect the dvds and relive all the classic moments from a great show even though there will never be another new episode the show will never get old people wont get tired of watching repeats friends will remain as funny as ever,POSITIVE,Comedy

2907,8.65,12 August 2002,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is a wonderful show with a wonderful cast i cant see how anybody could say anything bad about it it is very funny and entertaining one of the best shows in history no other show can compare to friends to put it simply it is the best while other hit shows drive themselves into the ground after a few years friends gets even better as time goes by another great thing about this show is that the cast is wonderful the cast couldnt have been chosen better to put it into three words everybody needs friends,POSITIVE,Comedy
2908,8.65,27 March 2001,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",go to the library and check out a book of restoration comedylate sish you can be sure that crane and kaufman ate this stuff up while in college and probably look it over even now to keep fresh the situations people going thru all sorts of tricks and scams in the name of love parents making fun of their kids kids making fun of the parents guys trying to figure out how to break up with girls true lovers stumbling along to marriagesound familiar already covered by etheredge wycherly and congreve and very wittily too i love friends i watch the episodes over and over and still get a kick out of it i love restoration comedy too and i think it is because it and friends are so similar,POSITIVE,Comedy
2909,8.65,18 February 2003,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends has been the best cable tv show on since it started like every other show they sometimes tread over the same story lines but it is always funny and always fresh i recently read this is the last season and even though i am sad about that it is good to see it lasted this long friends will never be replaced and i dont think nbc realizes that yet this show has been amazing and funny and fresh since i love it,POSITIVE,Comedy
2910,8.65,19 June 2001,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",well no doubt that this show is hilarious but the actors of the show have a very good chemistry between them and this is the main reason for the success of the showthis is very important because the actors have a mutual understanding amongst themselves and this is the reason why they perform their roles so well,POSITIVE,Comedy
2911,8.65,8 August 2005,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i think that friends is great matthew perry is divine in all seasons and he is just so god damn funny i think series is the best cos monica and chandler get together eventually i am hoping someone will get me the full box set for my birthday or xmas cos i love friends jennifer aniston is my favourite actress the quote i like most from chandler is could i be any funnier which seems to crop up in most episodes the hey how u doing from joey is also really sharp and witty i always seem to find myself going i know because of monica every episode i see i also think of myself in later life been like rachel working in ralph lauren and blooming dales going out with ross having a baby etc i also think about how far she has come since series epa where she walked into central perk in that wedding dress matthew perry is so sexy,POSITIVE,Comedy
2912,8.65,11 May 2001,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",in my mind this is one series that will never loose the spark to attract audiences all the time at the beginning i felt that the story lines were a bit boring and a tad tedious the basic story line is about friends rachel monica phoebe joey chandler and ross who lead ordinary lives until rachel comes back to new york and finds monica after leaving the alter after this the story line continues he falls in love with her and so on through out the whole running length of friends the plots do get much better and nearly all the time after the fighting and the arguments the episode has a happy ending if you enjoy laughing at people who are trying to survive being single in a hard world then i personally recommend this for you i have nothing left to say apart from enjoy,POSITIVE,Comedy
2913,8.65,10 April 2004,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i admit that i did not start watching friends when it first started i actually did not start watching friends until the th season when nothing else was on since then i saw just how talented the actors are and how well written the show is one of my favorite things about friends is that all the actors have theyre own different way of being funny this way you do have to see the same thing over and over again from the different actors another great thing about this show is that everyone relates to at least one character from the show its about everyday type of stuff and that is one of the things that makes this show so great when i heard that the show was going off the air after this its tenth season i was very upset but only because i think they could still do a lot more with the show i also cant wait to see exactly how this show is going to end and who is going to end up where,POSITIVE,Comedy
2914,8.65,9 November 2003,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i hear some people saying that they think friends has gone downhill or they cant find new things to say i personally am amazed that every series has kept up the standard and i am never disappointed when you watch other sitcoms they start off quite funny and there are lots of different things going on with each of the cast but very quickly instead of having a few storylines going at the same time they eventually run out of ideas and have just one mildly amusing storyline but in friends the writers have really kept up the standard i wait for the next series to come out on video then i run out and buy it phone in sick from work unplug the phone stock up on junk food and its always worth it the first time i watch them is just a preliminary viewing cos im so excited that i cant concentrate properly but by the tenth time ive watched them im still peeing myself laughing friends rock,POSITIVE,Comedy
2915,8.65,17 November 2005,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",ive been a fan of this magnificent show for many years of my life now wich say a lot figured im born just years before this whole adventure started i must say that this i the funniest show ever produced the storyline is something special and unique and it had never been done before it was about six best friends living in the big city and making it on their own the friends always make you laugh and if i have a bad day i can put on a episode and laugh and forget everything else and all the characters are funny you cant choose a favorite one cause theyre all charming in their own way paleontologist kind of boring geeky but master in weddings ross geller notsofunnybutthinkheis adorable chandler muriel bing goofy cute joey francis tribbiani bossy control freak caring monica geller goofy massaging thinksthebestofeveryone phoebe buffay and fashionably beautiful and caring rachel karen greenyouve gotta love em all this is the show you cant go through life not having seen i myself have got all of the episodes on dvd and i at least watch one episode each day if youre going to see just one sitcom in youre life this is the one folks dont just sit there go and watch friendsd highly recommended,POSITIVE,Comedy

2917,8.65,4 January 2003,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this show was my life for long while but now i can live without the show if you look back on the show the first season was average and then season was superb but after watching season i didnt even buy that season on video because of the poor quality but last year was much better and i am becoming an addict again and want the series to go into a th season or i will probably freak out and please let ross and rachel get together,POSITIVE,Comedy
2918,8.65,27 September 2018,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",who hasnt seen friends the show is immensely popular all over the world friends is a landmark television show one whose aftereffects in comedy still reverberate to this day think big bang theory this show about six twentysomethings in new york city became an instant classic and the reruns have ensured that the popularity does not fade endearing characters witty jokes and personable storylines throughout the years made this one of the most widely watched shows not just in america but all over the englishspeaking world if you want genuine entertainment you cannot go wrong with friends,POSITIVE,Comedy
2919,8.65,5 August 1999,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i think that friends is a great show with a very smart humor and the cast is great i think that jennifer aniston and lisa kudrow are the best,POSITIVE,Comedy
2920,8.65,26 November 2005,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends what can i say possibly the best us sitcom ever created a classic that every person must watch and will have you crying with laughter in every episode we get to see chandlers sarcastic wit phoeboes eccentric weird and just plain wacky attitude and blunt comments joeys notasbrainy yet lovable personality monicas obsessive cleaning rosss boring nature and his solameitisfunny comments and of course rachels charming wit and charisma and thats just the main cast theres always the annoying laugh that warns us of janice at the most unexpected times or the quiet jealousy of gunthers every episode is fun and refreshing with just the right balance of drama and comedy to make a very successful show,POSITIVE,Comedy
2921,8.65,7 January 2003,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this is the first movie or tvshow i comment on imdbthis will hopefully not be the best reviewits not even a reviewbecause i dont know what to say but i know the feelings im trying to express now is lovemy endless love for this show and all its characters never has a tvshow made me feel so much in this casehappiness moviesyesbecause they go a lot deeper into human emotionsbut never a tvshowuntil this one came along and i was in loveour relationship has been going on for almost seven years nowit came to norway a couple of years after it started in usaand it will go on as long as the show is runningwhich i hope will be for a couple more seasonsand forever after that in my mindand in my heart,POSITIVE,Comedy

2923,8.65,31 May 2002,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this is a really excellent television show its only behind fresh prince of belair it is still awesome almost all episodes are excellent and all the characters personalities monicas cleanliness chandlers sarcasm phoebes stupidity are all really played out well the characters are really cool and the cliffhangers at the end of each season is really awesome overall the whole series is excellent and it is ending in one year sadly rating out of nd best tv show,POSITIVE,Comedy
2924,8.65,19 June 2003,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",its the best thing for friends to end it was beginning to fade in quality but ten years for a sitcom is some achievement in any right the show in my opinion started pretty mediocre but then became easily the best comedy america has produced in many a year the characters were great and the original casting director deserves a medal for bringing these six actors together because like it or not every one has laughed at least once i dont think there is a character i hate because i even find time for david schwimmers ross plus lets not forget the three girls are hot i will always enjoy the reruns,POSITIVE,Comedy
2925,8.65,2 March 2002,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",every time i watch friends i get this good feeling inside like this show makes me feel good its hilarious a knockout david schwimmer courteney cox arquette matt leblanc matthew perry jennifer aniston lisa kudrow make a grrrrrrrrrreat team also one thing id like to add monday friday pm pm on fox saturday pm on tbssuperstation sunday on fox oh yeah the new ones come on thursdays at on nbc those were the friends showtimes if you like soap operas comedies watch the new episodes thursday at pm on nbc this show is so great my favorite episodes would have to be the one where ross david schwimmer gets with janice the one where janice cheats on chandler matthew perrythe one where joey matt leblanc gets nominated for a soapie for his part on days of our lives i actually cant say all mine because if i did i would have to mention every episode ps friends is great,POSITIVE,Comedy
2926,8.65,21 February 2002,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i love this show sooooooo much all of the characters are likable chandler is funny joey is sweet pheobe is mentel rachel is funny monica is funny ross is childish every minite of this show has something funny in it,POSITIVE,Comedy
2927,8.65,18 November 2001,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is prehaps the greatest tv show of the late s no show has kept me so involved with the characters and had so many correlations with my own life and so many other of my own friends while some of the stories might be a little unrealistic at times the bond between the characters never deviates from how real life friends interact with each other they are critical of their friends behavior and actions they might not always agree with each other but they still stick together for better or worse you might say that its only a tv show but the few genuine true firends that i have follow the same patterns,POSITIVE,Comedy
2928,8.65,22 April 2000,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i have to admit that i was not a fan of friends at all until very recently the show first debuted in and at that time i was still bemoaning the loss of saved by the bell the show that i had watched all throughout my formative years quite frankly friends didnt strike my fancy at all i began watching friends periodically in the spring but a busy schedule forced me to put the show on hiatus until late last year now after having caught up on virtually every single episode i am hopelessly hooked friends has become a part of my daily schedule hey reruns are not all bad lol just as jeopardy was and is the storylines are clever and witty and the manner in which the producers have chosen to title each episode suggests a certain creativity and boldness that to my knowledge has never been tested before as far as the six characters go they are in my opinion mutually complementary that is that it is the group dynamics that give the characters their charm and appeal because admittedly it would be very unlikely that i would be able to last minutes alone with any one of the characters i suppose however that that is the way it is with most television shows while some of the characters appear to be notoriously indolent the lives that they live are gloriously appealing fun fluffy bunny games is what their lives are all about and i would be incredibly thrilled if i didnt have to continuously fret over the pettiness that encompasses my existence,POSITIVE,Comedy
2929,8.65,21 July 2000,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i love friends it is such a good show my favorite character is rachel i think that rachel and ross should get back together because they were so cute together when bruce willis guest starred it was funny monica and chandler also make a really good couple ive been watching this show since its debut in and it is surely one of the best shows i hav ever seen congratulations on its nomination for best comedy series and to jennifer aniston rachel and lisa kudrow phoebe who got nominated for best supporting actress in a comedy keep up the good work,POSITIVE,Comedy
2930,8.65,18 October 2001,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is such a cool show i mean i dont think the plots are realistic though and the characters arent realistic either but watching friends kinda makes you escape from reality and into their world its just hilarious all the actors uses great and realistic ezpressions and its fun watching them act like idiots i mean rachel is all miss prissy so its just fun watching her acting like a spoil brat watching pheobe act like a retarded freak kinda cracks me up monica reminds me of my mom joey talks a lil too much bout sex though chandlers the best cuz of well he knows how to act i just think friends is the koolest show out there and ne body can watch it and have fun well some contents might be unappropriate for ppl under,POSITIVE,Comedy
2931,8.65,8 December 2002,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i am a huge fan of this tv show and it shall go down as one of the best tv shows on television along with the simpsons the actors of friends compliment each other so well and make the show what it is which is entertaining and hilarious if anyone thinks this show is stupid or pointless then they havent given enough time to watch the episodes from the beginning the show can be confusing at times if you dont know what it going on,POSITIVE,Comedy
2932,8.65,29 September 2001,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i love this show at first i didnt know why but now i do this is such a ripoff of saved by the bell its the same show but different for example ross and rachel ross and rachel on and off zack and kelly on and off ross and rachel get married in las vegas zack and kelly get married in las vegas obviously the inspiration for this show came from saved by the bell its even on nbc saved by the bell was on nbc as a matter of fact this show premiered a year after sbtb ended this show is like sbtb after high school thats why manyincluding myselflike this program the only difference between this show and sbtb is that friends has no black people its just like star trek,POSITIVE,Comedy
2933,8.65,22 February 2003,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends started as a really good comedy show it had funny characters that you can love easily but as they started to run out of ideas all the new incidents have nothing to do with the characters like for eg joey falling in love with rachel or even chandler marrying monicathey killed all the funny parts of chandlers character when they got him married maybe its time to stop it or find new good ideasif the ideas dont run with the characters they should make a new show with new characters about themthey expect us to believe that the characters weve watched and knew for years would do what ever comes to writers minds it should be a little consistent,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2934,8.65,20 April 2004,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is finally almost at an end after ten years and for a lot of people this ending is going to be too difficult for words i think i am one of those people its hard to describe why i love friends so much and why its ending is going to be so upsettingits only a tv show but ever since i was twelve years old and i made the effort to watch the premiere of series to see what all the fuss was about i have been hooked beyond words rachel was going to the airport to tell ross she wanted to be with him but he was getting off the plane with julie i hadnt seen one episode of the first series i didnt have any idea of the build up to this momentross infatuation with rachel for an entire series was nothing to me i didnt have a clue but i knew that i cared and for me to be so involved within two minutes of watching tells me friends must be something special and it is at the time i loved frasier too everyone was talking about niles and his love for daphne but i never cared about that half as much as i did ross and rachel even in those two minutes i think one of the reasons for this is just the realism of the characters to me as great as it was frasier was a show of caricatures friends was about real people with the possible exception of phoebe phoebe is probably the character with the least depth despite the fact that she has the most interesting background her mother killed herself she lived on the streets but its easy to get the feeling that the whole character background and all was originally designed for cheap laughs its only in the last two seasons that phoebe has been given a real relationship and her forays into meaningful storylines have been erratic which is a shame because the emotional phoebe moments have always been my favourites whilst her lines are funny she is deeply unconvincing as a character at times however all of the other characters are identifiable with many of the same problems that we face even as the episodic storylines have become rather more unbelievable in the last couple of years the characters have stayed constant and for a sitcom it has had its true dramatic and emotional moments in season nine monica and chandler discovered they were unable to conceive thats pretty heavy stuff for a sitcom but friends was never afraid to head into these topics emotion and comedy has rarely gone so well together friends has made me laugh out loud and cry into my pillow it has never failed to lift me up after a bad day i have every single episode on dvd and i must have seen them all at least ten times but i dont stop enjoying them and i dont believe i ever will friends has something magic about it and i dont know if i will ever put my finger on what that is exactly but i know i will always appreciate it for being there and making me smile,POSITIVE,Comedy
2935,8.65,12 December 2005,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",what can i say about a great show that lasted years won tons of awards over of them had a great cast great plot great lines well id say that sums up friends perfectly friends was a great show so great that a lot of people were devastated when we heard the news that it had come to an end including me i loved friends and still do like i said before the cast is brilliant lisa kudrow matt leblanc matthew perry david schwimmer courtney coxarquette and of course one of my favourites jennifer aniston i remember watching the pilot and i thought it was so funny dont ask me what my favourite line or favourite moment was because there are too many of them even now that its over lots of people ask me what was my favourite moment i just smile and say i dont have near enough fingers to count them the concept was theres people who are friends hence the name of the show and they all live in new york they all get together every day at the local coffee shop central perk and talk about there day and there relationships basically there life the neat part is with some shows you watch it and you feel like your watching a show but with me and lots of other people when you watch the show you actually feel like your watching your friends on tv kind of like a home movie whos my favourite friend well that would have to phoebe played by the hilarious lisa kudrow she was my favourite friend and still is i love phoebe and lots of people say im kind of like her i guess its in the ways we think and were very openminded although im not a vegetarian jennifer aniston though would have to be the best actor on the show she plays rachel green who has had lots of relationships shes been married i think or times to ross gellar david schwimmer she played rachel to a t she was very funny and very enthusiastic than theres monica gellar ross sister whos played by the hilarious courtney coxarquette monica is a woman who is very very clean and organized kind of the opposite of me however all are willing to lend a hand and keep an eye on the guys which brings me to joey chandler and ross leblanc perry and schwimmer all of the guys are hilarious they too have had there share of relationships and get a lot of funny lines and sometimes dont always get each others jokes joey would have to be my favourite guy youve probably seen him in the show joey which is a spinoff of friends anyways the reason why i wish my friends were more like the cast is because the friends on tv are more funnier always willing to lend a hand and they all work together kind of like a family whether its through deaths births of marriages the friends are always there i remember sharing countless laughs and quoting lines and trust me theres no show thats going to top this one so to conclude it was a great show i still love watching reruns and laughing at things that ive laughed at before im gonna miss this show it was really really great if i had the choice i would give it out of but i cant so im gonna have to give it a which sucks because it should deserve a heck of a lot more,POSITIVE,Comedy
2936,8.65,30 May 2002,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",ok all the people who said the show is stupid are stupid i have friends like some of these people so when you say stuff about them you arent just talking about the people on the show you are talking about alot of this country besides if you hate it sooo much why do you watch it what yall need to do is get a life in case you didnt know this is like americas number show and instead of commenting on how stupid it is comment on the shows you do like what would the world be like if every show was completely realist that would be way too scary so if ya dont like a show dont watch it by the way friends rocks and im sorry to see its ending your year old friend hermione,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2937,8.65,14 January 2018,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",ive watched over five seasons of friends on netflixsome really funny lines that made me laugh for surebut eventually i got really tired of racheland her everythings about rachel persona so im going to switch to another netflix showits really not all about rachelshe treated ross so badly for at least a season and he tried to get back but it didnt workso now mid season hes trying fix it with emily and miss rachel has decided she still loves rossim pretty tired of her anticsso even though i like the show overall im going to say goodbuy to friends and move onmaybe rachel and ross should have done the same,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2938,8.65,8 January 2004,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i am always surprised at the amount of people who still love the tvseries friends as it comes into its tenth year the first few years brought a new approach to an old formula and although it borrowed heavily from previous shows like cheers and taxi it still seemed to have a unique quality but now as the television is littered with sitcoms friends has become very formulaic and predictable with no real development in the characters the earlier years when the series was developing to extice larger audiences and when it was trying to impress were the years it did impress now it seems as if the cast of friends turn up to make the fans happy which generally means that there are no surpises and the programme simply becomes repettitive once where friends reined as its markets niche it seems to inspire more poor quality unimaginative sitcoms now is definetly a good time to move on provided the cast dont just get handed similer characters in film scripts which would be a shame because some of the cast have some acting talent which is wasted in a tv series with nowhere to go but down,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2939,8.65,18 November 2000,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",if there were a sitcom hall of fame then friends would defintly have a spot beside the other greats likehappy daysmarried with children and the simpsonswhat is so brilliant about this show is that it has no limit it has stuff like homosexuality discussed in it and it was one of the first series to feature the word vagina it follows the life of six young people rachel green is a woman who ran out on her husband at the altar ross geller is a man who has divorced three woman on the first marriage that lasted seven years his wife turned out to be gay on the second one he said the wrong name at the altar and in the third one he was drunk in vegas and married rachel they were also a couple in season two and three but broke up ross has a son named ben and is the brother of monica geller monica geller is a cook who was really really fat when she was a teenager but lost weight so she could get a mans attention and the man accidently lost his toe because of all that monica is now engaged to that man and that man is chandler bing the sarcastic member of the show his parents broke up when he was only nine which caused chandler to start smoking but he stopped phoebe bouffay is the magical member of the group she was also marriedto a gay ice skater joey tribbioni is the rather dim member of the group he is an actor and it takes him just a shower to get over a relationship and this series wich is on its seventh season is about these people and their attempt to survive in the real world,POSITIVE,Comedy
2940,8.65,3 December 2005,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this is the best there is no other take them all together all the memorable moments theyve made this is one talented group working here crane kauffman and the six friends theres no thing greater than laughter this kind of laughter how do you sum up ten years we havent seen them all but will probably buy the dvd set but we finally saw the concluding episode we knew about it wed read about it we knew almost exactly what was going to happen but still we were kept on the edges of our seats and theres a nice twist the producers put on the whole thing in the final moments no giving away anything here but it is good it is fun and its very nostalgic thanks to everyone working on this series this is television when it works well like it always should thank you for ten years well miss you but hey are you in a hurry maybe we can get a cup of coffee somewhere if you know of a good place that is,POSITIVE,Comedy

2944,8.65,28 March 2003,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",when i was about to see the show friends for the first time two years ago i was skeptical because my expectations were so high all of my friends were encouraging me to see it saying ohmigod you havent seen friends so i gave in and watched an episode i had to admit that it was definitely well written well acted and always had an episode of interest that a teenadult could relate to and unlike most sitcoms each episode has something different and new to offer like a guest star etc after one episode i was hooked the show just draws you in mostly because the characters are so darn cute and likable monica courteney cox arquette rachel jennifer aniston phoebe lisa kudrow ross david schwimmer chandler matthew perry and joey matt leblanc are hilarious fun and enjoyable to watch each character has a certain characteristic about them such as monicaneurotic neatfreak rachelsweetie chandlersmart funny rosscute brainer and joey and phoebe are the ditzy big kids the group of six live in new york and spend their something lifestyles filled with ups and downs involving love loss and friendship i think it was a smart decision to give friends a tenth season why end the show at the peak of its popularity i advise anyone who hasnt seen an episode of friends to do so you wont be disappointed and with ten seasons of success under the friends belt youll see why its so popular,POSITIVE,Comedy

2947,8.65,25 February 2003,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is whitout a doubt the best comedy show on tv nothing even cames close to being as good as friend i think they shold carry it on for many more years to came why end it its been going for like years so why not keep it going for more people will always watch it i think matthew perry as chandler is just classic he is my favorit on the show i love his sarcasum he is the funniest guy in the world but i have to say that phabee really irritates me she has this really bad attitude towards chandler like shes always downing him i hate people like that anyway i love friends and i have every single episode on video and dvd i hope they never stop making them or even more,POSITIVE,Comedy
2948,8.65,26 January 2000,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",why is it that people continue to watch friends with a neverdying adoration that is a simple question to answer it only gets funnier sexier and more entertaining with age unlike most shows on the television the six main actors and actresses are all talented and interesting they have managed to create their characters in a way that makes them feel real to the viewer all of us can relate to one or all of the characters on some level rachel monica joey chandler ross and phoebe will live on even after the show inevitably goes off the air,POSITIVE,Comedy
2949,8.65,9 August 1999,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this is the funniest tvcomedy ever made i cant come up with anything worth to criticize if i have a bad day i just throw in a tape with friends in my vcr and just relax and laugh as hell the best thing must be when chandler and monica got together i almost swallowed my tongue when monica showed her face in chandlers bed the night in london excellent the only thing thats missing is of course phoebe and joey to get together dont you think i do and a big star to the writers to come up with all these jokes not a single boring one and one to matthew perry his way to say s is so great or what about the way he say all his meanings with one marked word and his humour in private almost the same have i heard a person with bigger humour is hard to get and of course one big star to david schwimmer who has being married to natalie imbruglia friends is not a tvcomedy that you like or dislike its something you hate or love,POSITIVE,Comedy
2950,8.65,27 December 2005,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i remember when the pilot episode first aired here in britain it was a sunday night and i stumbled upon it by luck who was to know that six months later when it was released with all the proper advertising that it deserved that it would have been the most popular program to hit both side s of the globe to run for ten years and still continue making you laugh as much from the pilot to the finale i believe anyone connected to this master piece from the writers to the set hands should be proud that for just minutes a week they filled the viewers life with laughter and that is the greatest gift that anyone could give so thanks warner brothers,POSITIVE,Comedy
2951,8.65,13 February 2019,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this is the best tv series which i have ever watched although this movie was shot long time agoit is relevant nowdays because all heroes very real their life it is the life of each of us there are we can see a lot off different situations which happen every day and this series teaches us to look at everything with humor the humor is great almost every joke can be aphorism the cast is very nice every hero is perfect for his role all seasons pleases audience good plot great acting funny jokes and of course the best soundtrack i recommend this movie to anyone and ereyone,POSITIVE,Comedy
2952,8.65,26 December 2002,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",a starring david schwimmer matt leblanc matthew perry jennifer aniston lisa kudrow and courtney cox six people three men and three women living in new york have funny plots unfold in their lives this show was my favorite show of all time but it fell down there are some unforgivable flaws that i cant seem to forget the characters for example are all slightly flawed rachel what a btch she always has to get what she wants i have three perfect examples julie was rosss love ross loved her a lot and in my opinion they couldve ended up together but no rachel has to barge in the relationship and steal ross from julie i forgot the characters name but christine taylor ross was dating her and really liked her then rachel tells her to shave her head bald and steal ross from her emily was going to marry ross ross loved her very much then rachel goes over there to stop the wedding and makes ross say the wrong name and ruin the marriage i cant help but disliking her monica was great then she started talking and it was over pheobe was hilarious then she got ditzier and ditzier shes also a btch shes so mean to everyone at times chandler was my favorite character his witty and sarcastic remarks made him hysterical then he fell in love with monica ross is a geeky guy but still funny then he fell in love with rachel joey has very little flaws about him he is my favorite character friends is an excellent show but the many flaws made it bad for me rank tied in rd with andy richter,POSITIVE,Comedy
2953,8.65,10 February 2001,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",like i said i enjoy watching friends its one of the few sitcoms that i can watch these days but now from a recent episode it appears as though nbc may trying to turn back the clock from a recent episode rachel turned thirty years old yet it was my impression that these people had turned thirty a few years ago it almost appears as though nbc may be trying to turn back the clock to keep the shows younger audience interested when in fact the majority of the actors are in their mid to laterthirties i will continue watching the show because i still find it to be quite funny but i do not like it when these higher powers begin to rewrite the show and change the facts just to keep their ratings up,POSITIVE,Comedy
2954,8.65,10 September 2003,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is by far the best comedyshow ever the characters are adorable the actors fabulos and the dialogue sharp and great timed but the storylines are getting more repetitive and less original till the sixth season it was perfect the seventh season was not so good but the eight one was great again the ninth is just ok but still much better than other comedy shows and its good that the charakters are moving forward with marriages and children and moving together etc thats ok and just natural i mean they are all in their ies but all this parenthood stuff and familyplots could be very annoying and wouldnt fit very well with our friends so its good and sad that this sitcom will end its a good sitcom maybe the best and its the right time to stop it i will miss it so much but with my complete friendsdvd collection i will get over that lost hope for a rocking last season friend forever,POSITIVE,Comedy
2955,8.65,1 August 2003,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i have been watching friends for as long as i can remember i think the first episode i ever saw was the one with the princess leia fantasy and i thought it was hilarious but i wont go into that right now after years and years of watching a sitcom you really feel like you know the characters and you even pick up on little habits and things that they do i agree that maybe it is starting to wear a bit thin the actors are almost into their fortys now arent they but still it had a good run and i have the entire friends collection on video so marathons are a sure thing i guess the only things that could possibly annoy me about friends is the fact that no matter what no matter how long it takes for them each one of them always ends up with the girl guy they have been after always even if it only lasts a week or an hour they get them eventually i dont know if that does happen for everyone but it doesnt seem realistic also is anyone else getting a bit tired of the whole ross and rachel thing i dont know about you but sometimes i wonder what the hell they see in each other when they start to annoy me but that has gone on for far too long and they should get over each other and find other people anyway i am really not criticising much its just something i noticed anyway bottom line is friends is the best comedy sitcom on tv along with the simpsons but i dont think i will be surprised or even sad if is their last season as it has to end eventually and i think the timing is perfect,POSITIVE,Comedy
2956,8.65,2 June 2002,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",what would we do next year without our weekly dose of friends for the past years ross rachel chandler monica joey and phoebe have become our life and a huge part of us all will be missing when the show comes to an end next year everyone is brilliant in their roles but the standouts are definitely jennifer aniston and david schwimmer the others are great but jennifer and david really shine every year in their roles as rachel and ross i know im going to be upset come may next year when the series ends but at least i have my collection so i can watch my friends whenever i want,POSITIVE,Comedy
2957,8.65,13 December 2000,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",this show is just the funniest show ever all the actors are amazing and they make their characters so real that you just cant help falling in love with them and take them for what they are for better and for worst start watching and it is certain you wont be able to stop,POSITIVE,Comedy
2958,8.65,14 September 1999,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",cause youll be there for me toofriends is a comedy show about six singles monica courtney cox rachel jennifer aniston phoebe lisa kudrow joey matt leblank chandler matthew perry and ross david schwimmerthese friends go through some difficulties of life in a very funny wayfriends will make you laughjust a great showwatch it,POSITIVE,Comedy
2959,8.65,24 May 2003,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",many a day i have been sad and lonely and the only thing to look forward to was friends at in syndication cute and likeable and never pretentious the characters are fun to watch at times they may seem a little animated but what the heck who wouldnt laugh at phoebes quick witted and sometimes innocent comments friends is a real spirit booster and the actors are pleasant to watch,POSITIVE,Comedy
2960,8.65,24 September 1999,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends has always been and most likely always will be my favorite show of all time its one of the very few shows that has been consistently funny all over the years what i also love about this show is its ability to portray hilarity one minute and then the next complicated emotional issues right tothepoint with excellent scripts and fine precise acting friends is about as good as it gets i personally hope the show will last for years from nowbut all good things do eventually come to an end but i know ill never forget the laughter tears and fun i shared with phoebe chandler monica joey rachel and ross,POSITIVE,Comedy
2961,8.65,6 April 2003,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is the best show ever i luv it so much i never miss an episodejennifer aniston and matthew perry are my favourite actors the writers are so good they just keep coming up with the best stuff every its always funny and original i dont want friends to end i wish it could go on forever,POSITIVE,Comedy
2962,8.65,28 April 2003,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i have watched nearly every series of friends and particularly liked the first when came out i was a bit disappointed that the comedy hung on sex jokes to much but after watching them more often i have come to like them more than the original series the key i think is not to take it to seriously so its completely false and they have never done one thing that is remotely normal and they never go to work etc it makes me laugh all the time and in the end as a comedy that is its purpose id give it ross joey are by far the best characters,POSITIVE,Comedy
2963,8.65,11 September 2001,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i havent watched this show for as long as its been on i much prefer the older episodes where joey is a hot stud that hasnt changed but he seems to have a brain on him i think theyve taken a turn for the worst by making him seem all out stupid all the characters seem to have more flaws coming out with time ive started watching it again and putting aside my distaste for the dorkiness of the characters,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2964,8.65,25 November 2003,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends starring jennifer aniston courtney cox lisa kudrow matt leblanc matt perry and david schwimmer in this great comedy people are struggling on their ownand find a friendship with eachother what can i say this is just great i love it i always laugh and the writing is fabulous the charecters and perfect and the acting is superb i love this friends,POSITIVE,Comedy
2965,8.65,5 October 2005,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i love this show i even have no words to describe what i feel every time i watch it you know when youve got problems you should watch it because it makes you forget all the bad things in the world for example i watch it when i feel bad when im very nervous it always helps me i feel like im in their company too i wish everyone could have as good friends as phoebe monica rachel chandler joey and ross are its so bad that the shows over i just love these characters so much i think everyone can find some piece of his own character in each person of six friends all the situations we face in our lives are in this serial and all the familiar problems are shown there in such an easy way that you begun to think that life is not so difficult if youve got friends,POSITIVE,Comedy
2966,8.65,8 August 1999,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i cant go a week without watching friends after seasons its in the number spot what gets you hooked at first is the humor but after a while we become attached to the characters and their lives id recommend it to anyone i love it my gramma loves it my boyfriend loves it and practically all of my friends love it anyone who seriously dislikes friends either hasnt seen enough of it or is simply determined not to like it it may be hard to understand exactly why we love it so much but its not hard to see why its number this show is my favorite of all time,POSITIVE,Comedy
2967,8.65,2 November 2005,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",i was only years old when this show came out it took some time for me to really get into it i didnt care much for the first season but as the show went on from season to season i really got into it if i had to pick one character i liked the most was chander bing his sarcasticwitty attitude just makes me laugh of course there was some really touching and sad moments on the show like the one where ross and rachel go on a break or when joey tells rachel that he likes her or when monica and chander find out they might not be able to have a baby another thing besides the stories that make this show worth watching is the amazing chemistry between the cast members jenifer anistoncourtney coxlisa kudrowmatt leblancmathew perry and david swhimmer all had chemistry despite on the set problems between david and jen from season and but over all if your ever having a bad day and you want to come home and watch tv this is the show to watch,POSITIVE,Comedy
2968,9.0,22 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",season when this series came my girlfriend wasnt especially interested im a huge fan of comedy mysteries and loved steve martin when i was young but her enthusiasm for either is mild but after five minutes i had to stop and make her watch it because we are new yorkers and this series nails new york in five minutes the weird relationships with bypassers the artsy types the justified paranoia it was all there and immediately hilarious the series is about a trio of murderpodcast fanatics who bond over an actual murder in their luxury apartment building soon they are investigating and podcasting but they are also each keeping secrets from one another in a wonderful mysteriesinamystery structure everyone has secrets the series says and digging deep is fascinating exercise the cast is terrific martin is lowkey funny short who i am generally lukewarm towards is very funny as a flamboyant theater director and selena gomez more than holds her own as a hilariously snarky temporary tenant this show has been a hotticket item as far as i know certainly my friends and fellow new yorkers love it so i was shocked to see how many user reviews just hate this show or only find it mediocre to the point where they insist all favorable reviews are paid for this response is inexplicable to me the show is amazing when a new episode dropped we watched it immediately its just so so so so good ignore the naysayers this is a must watch other seasons season a shade weaker than the first season but still excellent season what the hell happened season had steve martin playing his character as a complete idiot and after great seasons selena gomez turned lackluster more glum and less snarkily witty and when the mystery was solved oh my god these were the most nonsensical motives you could come up with sure there were still good moments good guest stars surprisingly enjoyable songs but omg,POSITIVE,Comedy
2969,8.0,11 September 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",so i just finished watching only murders in the building and have to say i enjoyed it more than i thought i would i originally had no intent on watching because it looked like a show aimed for people years old i was wrong after seeing all the great reviews and all the award nominations for both seasons i finally gave in and watched it its a funny who dun it kind of show its about three strangers who all love true crime podcasts and then all of a sudden find themselves making one of their own from a murder in their own building these three selena gomez steve martin and martin short start to put together the clues to find the murderer the series has something for everyone if youre looking for a show to just have a good time with and keep you entertained then give this a try its just a fun show that you can binge over a few days,POSITIVE,Comedy
2970,8.0,29 September 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i was actually surprised by how much i liked only murders in the building theres a reason that both seasons have been nominated and won so many awards the cast selena gomez steve martin martin short and writing is what makes this show so special martin and short play off one another like the legends they are and gomez is a lot better actress than i expected the three of them are just so likable and easy to root for in this series this show was so good and every episode is so entertaining that i binged both seasons over the course of a weekend its a murder mystery show that has plenty of twists turns and laughs im looking forward to season coming out soon season should be the best yet with paul rudd and meryl streep added to the cast cant wait,POSITIVE,Comedy
2971,9.0,19 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",when the initial episodes of only murders in the building started raking in on rotten tomatoes i must confess that i was skeptical that steve martin and co could keep up the quirky fun nature of this comedythriller series till the last episode but martin short selena gomez and him form an unlikely yet rambunctious trio who keep us hooked and entertained till the very last episode of this brilliantly written infectiously funny series steve martin and a fantastic martin short star as a pair of geriatric hasbeen performers who run into a young gild gomez who also happens to be a fellow murder podcast fanatic how this ragtag trio come together to solve a strange murder that takes place in their apartment forms the rest of this story although some comedyinvestigative series have had huge fan bases like monk and psych this genre has always been a tightrope walk that most creators shy away from finding humor in the most unlikeliest of places and filled with unexpected twists and turns and a host of delectable supporting characters it is no surprise that steve martin was also one of the creative geniuses behind the writing of this work leaving us on a tantalizing knifeedge with a cliffhanger climax i cannot wait for season well worth the rotten tomatoes rating an immensely bingeable suspenseful laugh riot highly recommended,POSITIVE,Comedy
2972,8.0,7 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",we all know that steve martin and martin short can combine to produce comedy gold but who could have predicted that steve martin and selena gomez would have such incredible chemistry add in the wonderful nathan lane and now sting and after just episodes i am completely hooked,POSITIVE,Comedy
2973,10.0,2 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",love everything about this show from the opening credits to the cast to the music but why oh why ruin it with the god awful casting of amy schumer as herself shes awful then you have cara devilgne whose just as grating both need to go quick,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2974,9.0,18 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this type of lighthearted and quality comedy and show is hugely lacking in this day and age i am really enjoying this show so far i think it steve martin and martin short are comedic geniuses and the banter throughout was very natural and fun i was a bit skeptical at first because of the seemingly odd choice to cast selena with these two classics but it totally works,POSITIVE,Comedy
2975,10.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",good writing fantastic casting and a brilliant story im hooked,POSITIVE,Comedy
2976,10.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",a great cast lighthearted and funny just what we all needduring the horrible times we all have faced in the last year and a half nothing dark to drag you down here,POSITIVE,Comedy
2977,6.0,28 June 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",first series enjoyable the introduction of amy schumer is annoying she isnt funny and cant act its really ruined it im hoping its a shorter term introduction like sting in first season rather than a permanent cast member,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2978,10.0,25 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i love steve martin i do i do i do but i have to say martin short is the funniest person on the planet and i already love this tv show i dont even care about true crime podcasts i think theyre weird and that morbid fascination is not healthy also im too old to know who selena gomez is but i do like detective stories and this one is original and laugh out loud funny but this show is that good watch it,POSITIVE,Comedy
2979,6.0,9 October 2024,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",when i first found only murders in the building i thought it was clever funny and kept me wondering what would happen next season two picked up nicely where one had left off the dialogue was great however season three found me feeling as though they were undoing what made this show unusual now we are at season and its like a piece of gum after you chewed it for an half an hour its tastelessly bland uninteresting and more trouble than its worth sad really martin and short are great together and gomez was tolerable adding all these cameos was a big mistake they didnt need any more than the cast on hand in the initial seasons,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2980,5.0,11 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i saw all the good reviews for this and decided to give it a go im so disappointed cause i really expected this to be good it was just ok felt kind of forced and a bit too silly for me i enjoyed martin shorts character but i didnt think steve martin was that funny in this which was a shame kind of felt like a male version of grace frankie with selena thrown in to widen the viewer age range i like selena but for whatever reason she put on this dull monotone voice throughout the whole thing which began to really grate on me a couple of episodes in im hearing impaired and the deaf episode just felt too much all the hollow muffled sound in that episode was just really annoying for me and left me turning my hearing aids down i understand that they are trying to be inclusive but just felt weird not the worst thing youll ever see but definitely not an,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2981,8.0,20 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this show is a joy to watch its witty and lighthearted which is exactly what we need right now very reminiscent of clue,POSITIVE,Comedy
2982,9.0,10 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",some barely plausible characters end up starting a podcast on a murder that happens in the tower block they live in i loved the characters and i thought the casting was excellent i had never heard of selena gomez but i loved her in this it is very light going with a scattering of jokes and mild drama there is the odd speciality episode like the one without any spoken dialogue other reviewers have stated that although alright this is not as great as people make out technically they are absolutely right it isnt ground shattering stuff but as a fan of the likes of monk jonathan creek rizzoli isles it feels like there has not been anything new in the same vein for quite a while this is good honest light sleuthy fun and the smile on my face as i watched every episode justifies my star rating alone edit season season starts of very shaky with some clumsy attempts at humour that dont land and amy schumer stomping through the middle of the plot like a bull at a tea party but by episode it is all back on track well done,POSITIVE,Comedy
2983,10.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this show is so refreshing the casting is so good it has the right mix of comedy and mystery selena steve martin and martin short are the trio we never knew we needed to see on screen recommend this to everyone,POSITIVE,Comedy
2984,10.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",seeing the dynamic between the trio is really fun to watch selena performing along side comedic legends must have been intimidating but she holding her own and performing spectacularly shes a great actress and on her way to potentially join the legends in the future look forward to seeing the rest of the series and more from selena gomez in the future the soundtrack is beautifully scored well done siddhartha khosla definitely one of the best released shows by hulu and in my opinion one of the best this year a must watch,POSITIVE,Comedy
2985,10.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",watched the show tonight its funny witty and the mistery is actually very enjoyable and gets your attention sincs the beginning the acting trio is really charismatic and has good chemistry i thought it was going to be a steve martinmartin short thing but i was very surprisded with selena gomez her oerformance was great and you really get drawn to her performance and scenes maybe this will open opportunities for hwr in the acting industry she deff has some chops,POSITIVE,Comedy
2986,7.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",a well made gentle series steve martin does all the heavy lifting acting wise selena gomez provides a bit of young input and martin short some moments of silliness the plot is a bit jumbled but that is intentional to create a bit of mystery it also has a slightly cartoon feel in the costuming and art direction its not gripping or tense more curious and fun some of the critiques and scores here are over the top its good but not that good also the short episodes are annoying minutes minus the intro and titles is too quick best to let or episodes build up and then watch the or at one time,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2987,8.0,22 August 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i previously rated the show an but i have had to lower the rating after season i loved season and but im just not enjoying season as much the main characters seem to have different personalities the show in season and was warm engaging and funny but a lot of that is lost in season somehow i personally dont really like the musical theme of season but others appear to love it the reveals are obvious and easily guessed at the beginning and arent very interestingtwists the writing seems way less serious as though they know its a stupid premise so havent put as much effort into the writing overall i am disappointed with season the ending certainly wasnt worth dragging out episodes for would love to see the show carry on more similarly to season,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2988,6.0,26 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",what can i say really well filmed great cinematography steve martin and martin short are a great duo that works perfectly and selena gomez is good on handling her role with these two legends the show is funny and has a very good pace with sting nathan lane jane lynch and tina fey showing up the episode with nathan lanes son is a brave effort on his own and i did enjoy this resolution due to being really good it will certain gather a bunch of emmy nomminations if you are not watching this yet you should the binge will be quick because this is extremely charming and entertaning,POSITIVE,Comedy
2989,10.0,15 September 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the first season of this series was ok especially steve martins character and comic work the later stuff has started to meander and is not very entertaining at all why is it that series producers feel compelled to milk every last drop out of an idea rather than leave on a high and sail away gracefully i suppose the real problem is that the streaming services are calling out for more and more product to heck with the quality that is very unfortunate for viewers and in my mind it is embarrassing for experienced entertainers like steve martin overall not really watchable any more sadly,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2990,9.0,8 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",and boy are you with only murders in the building this clever miniseries is a parody ofhomage to true crime podcasts with martins and shorts characters along with a young woman played by selena gomez investigating a murder in their new york apartment building plenty of surprises are in store and theres great chemistry among the cast members including some guest stars youre sure to love every part of it,POSITIVE,Comedy
2991,10.0,23 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this is so cleverly written the acting is also great though gomez is the weak link in the chain the story is very well written the dialogue is believable the cast is great despite gomez weak pedigree but everything else was absolutely worth seeing again and again very very funny and smart the mystery is very compelling and engaging i love it highly recommend,POSITIVE,Comedy
2992,10.0,29 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",they have some good episodic cliffhangers but for me the charm of the show revolves around steve martins and martin shorts catalog of works their expressions alone make me want to laugh selena gomez is an excellent balance for the two comedians the additions of sting nathan lane tina fay and more put it overthetop for me,POSITIVE,Comedy
2993,9.0,17 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i do like her butttt holy cow her acting has gotten worse over the years her monotone delivery is ear stabbing cara and amy are horrendous as well,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2994,10.0,5 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",but with a nice addition of selena gomez who i didnt know could act although she mostly plays third fiddle to shows greater talents of martin short and steve martin i hate the term bingewatching but thats exactly what i did with only murders in the building it hooked me from the start not just because this show reunites two thirds of one of my favorite childhood cinematic teams chasemartinshort trio from s three amigos but also because the premise sounded promising and once i started watching i couldnt really let go as all of the murder mysteries go this one follows the same beaten formula of twists and turns suspects and innocents with an unlikely trio to lead the investigation the police seemed to have dropped from the getgo so many questions and most of them get answered my the season finale cant wait for the second season by the way and overall atmosphere of the show although a bit pretentious and too predictive at times captures and opens up the characters to the core so much that we instantly fall in love with them and route for the gem above all is steve martins charles with his once big now small and broken little man who just wants some peace and quiet but rushes headlong into life as soon as another person loses it and finds friends he seemed to have long forgotten how to make martin shorts oliver is his usual charming self with his own interesting story yet to unravel and selena gomez mabel is an extraordinary insertion to the team of yearolds which gives it that life and vigorousness they all including the tenants in the building needed above all besides the outstanding performances by the cast fantastic soundtrack and oneofakind episode are among this shows greatest moments and i hope it would get only better and bigger in the upcoming season update season certainly did not disappoint as it added more mysteries more colorful characters and more depth to the already established ones and the ending bring it on season,POSITIVE,Comedy
2995,7.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",really fun the best trio ever mabel mora is my fav character ever highly recommended,POSITIVE,Comedy
2996,8.0,24 September 2024,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i have watched this perfectly casted bunch of actors religiously for seasons season not so much the path its taken just doesnt do anything for the draw to keep watching the storyline has always been exactly what it took to be excited to watch the next episode while i understand wanting to mix it up a bit to keep it interesting i just dont get this idea of bringing in other named actors for the twist and turn of a different storyline everyone in the watching audience im sure has their own take on this changed season but for me keep the original group of fine actors and just change up the situation cheers to those st seasons,NEGATIVE,Comedy
2997,4.0,10 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i know we are only four episodes in to this series but i am really enjoying it so far it is dark funny topical and has a little bit of mystery i am not a huge new yorkophile but i appreciate the appeal and the willingness of this series to poke fun at itself this reminds me of how much i enjoy and have always enjoyed steve martin i am seatbelted in and cant wait to see where this story takes us the series is about a murder in an expensive piece of residential real estate in new york called the arconiaor at least our three strangers turned podcasters think its a murder the police think it is a straightforward suicide the three strangers played by steve martin martin short and selena gomez all live in the building and are brought together during a fire alarm because of their love of a true crime podcast the podcast is done by a character played by tina fey everything is not ok in oklahoma when the three of them discover there has been a death in the building they decide to come together to solve itand naturally do a podcast about it amazing cameos and wonderful melancholy storylineseveryone seems to be hiding something which is a great set up for a whodoneit,POSITIVE,Comedy
2998,8.0,31 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this is the strangest collection of reviews i have ever seen it seems that most of the reviews are from people who love selena gomez and are answering back to a lot of the reviews where people obviously hate selena gomez all of these and ratings dont seem genuine for such a take it or leave it show it doesnt have the oh i gotta binge because i cant wait to see what happens next feeling it is more like it is just ok or meh to give it such high ratings means it compares with the greatest things youve ever seen did those people just come out of hibernation there is something off here,POSITIVE,Comedy
2999,10.0,21 April 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",why is selena gomez in a show with a talented cast she just doesnt fit she doesnt know how to act her character is is so stiff with no personality or emotion and i cant stand the way she talks she talks like her mouth has been wired shut also you can hardly hear her i feel sorry for steve martin martin short two great actors to have to work with someone that seems to put no effort into her characteracting im guessing she was cast in this show only because she has a huge fan base and most followed female singer on ig why not give the role to someone more talented a real comedic actress this show could be so much better without gomez,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3000,8.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",one thing i love about this series is the characters when the trio are always together they create chemistry i have to commend selenas brilliant performance here i thought that choosing selena gomez as a colead actress with the comedy legends will not work very well however i underestimated this woman and turns out shes doing what i want her to do never expected to love this show at first but im saying it right now watching this show is a must it is definitely one of the best shows released by hulu and one of the best tv shows of this year,POSITIVE,Comedy
3001,9.0,2 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",im a long time fan of steve martin and martin short so i had to check out this series their past collaborations are electric im not aware of selena gomezs work but i know who she is after reading other reviews its fairly obvious there are many selena fans who wanted to voice their overwhelming approval of her performance to pad the rating those reviews stand out because they are not really reviews just kudos because they are ardent fans tell us why you liked it im sure many who stated such and also stating their admiration for the other leads past work was a token i cant imagine the fandom realistically includes legendary septuagenarian comedic movie and stage actors and a disney popstar if i had a dollar for everytime i read the word amazing i could produce the show i digress this show after episodes is fabulous i hate most tv shows created in recent years comedies are formulaic recycled crap drama is redundant and stale i give some with an interesting premise a chance fail the only network shows i like now are ncis the original and young sheldon streaming stranger things and alien tv yes im odd that way castle rock was cancelled so i love quirky original concepts like rd rock from the sun big bang theory the aforementioned stranger things and alien tv etc this show has it all its hilarious dramatic thrilling mysterious eclectic thatrical and insane all at the same time its a definite rollercoaster ride of emotions if you didnt bust a rib with the cats arrival on scene then you are dead inside steve martin is his usual sardonic self and teaming him with martin shorts overthetop theatrics their sarcastic banter is always entertaining add to that selena gomezs deadpan snarky often dismissive repartee with them is priceless they have fantastic chemistry for their very distinct personality types im quite impressed at her ability to hold her own with these two and it was so refreshing to hear a young woman have a lower register voice for once and not hearing super this and that constantly cmon people there are other synonyms for that word it makes you sound silly and unintelligent the storyline kept my attention and i love how they cut to each characters unique perspective in interpreting the clues they have short auditioning the tenants and selenas visionsdelusions they throw in backstories with flashbacks and ambiguous habits to build the character profiles finally the supporting cast masterful casting in my opinion the tenants are the kookiest group of people you could ever imagine and they all live in the same building nathan lane and sting as well great i was sad when episode ended i now have to wait until next week but its worth it you never know what will happen scene to scene or for that matter what may come out of their mouth so yes millennials and gen zselena was amazing so are the rest,POSITIVE,Comedy
3002,8.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",and then i found this hidden pearl ive seen the first episodes and im liking it phases like in episode just say anything to agree yeah my kind of humour im really hoping that they will make the sensible decision and dont stretch it if this does become a success and they see dollar signs because then we are again in for bad writing bad plots and bad final episode,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3003,7.0,8 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",steve martin martin short nathan lane i could watch them all day takes you back to a different time yet the storyline is so relevant i loved this so much,POSITIVE,Comedy
3004,7.0,27 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this was a phenomenal show it is so much better than i thought it would be i started watching this show late i didnt start watching it till episodes in i saw commercials for it before it aired but it didnt peak my interest then weeks later i am scrolling through disney this show catches my eye so i decide to start it i live in canada we dont get hulu disney canada imports some of hulus shows to the country i binged the first six episodes of the show in under hours i then had to wait for episodes weekly which is normal because this show is a murder mystery i feel making the fans wait a week for each episode built so much more suspense than if all episodes were released on the same day i loved everything about this show the acting the writing the characters and the story martin short steve martin selena gomez and everyone else and i mean everyone were absolutely perfect in their role my favorite was martin short as oliver putnam the character of oliver was so quirky and funny and martin short was perfect for him oliver wasnt the only perfectly written character all of the main three as well as the side characters and all the suspects were so unique in their own way especially most of the suspects they were all funny it was perfect lastly the writing of the show was perfect the writers made the perfect murder mystery the suspects the leads the red herrings all perfect i also loved the character development of the characters it was cool to see their backstories this show was incredible everything about it i recommend this to anyone trust me you wont regret it they left us on a massive cliffhanger at the end of season i need to find out what happens next cant wait for season,POSITIVE,Comedy
3005,3.0,8 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the show is cleverly done with comedic brilliance from steve martin and a light enough touch for just about everyone but selena gomez is unwatchable her intonation is flat as roadkill and her expressions are barely any better she is so annoying to watch that my wife refuses to watch the last two episodes its quite a tribute to martin short and any others who were involved in the writing that the show is as popular as it is,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3006,10.0,7 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",before i start this i think season is an absolute treasure from me the plot is great character relationships feel real and authentic and just the feel of the show is just captivating okay lets start off with amy schumer i know her role is giving mixed opinions and rightly so the way they presented her in this is not well written at all i think this was a last minute decision and they didnt have too much time to write her character a good story also her playing herself doesnt make sense in this show i get the whole keeping celeb thing intact but come on now its just a bit too random the next point is cara delevingne she should not be in the show at all it simply doesnt suit her or the show she plays a bit of a wacky painter and enters the show through mabel now her character entry is okay but in general this seems too fast paced and there is absolutely no chemistry between her and selena it feels so forced and unnatural what on earth is going on please tell me these two do not actually get together it seriously feels empty and cold dont get me wrong both selena and cara are good actors but them being in a relationship yeah unfortunately we need to pull the plug on that as i said before it was so forced rushed and awkward i honestly want to know what was going through the writers producers and directors heads when they saw this scene my final point the plot is fine but after seeing the first three episodes its not drawing me in like season when watching season i literally could not wait for the next episode to come out but season i really hate to say it but the series has lost its magic i told all my friends about this show and didnt ever shut up about it too such a shame takeaways,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3007,8.0,30 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i think overall season one was quite good steve martin and martin short while not a magical duo worked very well together especially as each others straight man in think we all agree the false leads was overplayed and season one could have been perhaps two episodes shorter season two in contrast is just insufferable the writing is cringe the humor has changed from subtlety repartee and irony to entirely dumbed down sophomoric or physical humor that simply does not work i dare anyone to show how and where this is a script with any intelligence at all where is there anything that would even bemuse a new yorker were are the funny references to well known manhattan foibles and uniqueness the only one i saw in the entire season was stolen directly from woody allen and this seasons supporting cast is there for what exactly selena gomez did a yeomans job considering her struggling with serious illness and being thrown in with the mega talents great comedic star no but she did well considering people should know the original script did not include her character but cara delevingne and schumer please their inclusion is forced artificial and they add nothing at all the repetitive gushing positive reviews of season two here on imdb are glaring in that they are uniformly not specific they also include a lot of repetition making many possibly shills what is so enjoyable about it they dont say i can only guess it is because they got more of the jokes because it was so dumbed down and what on earth is with the ticking of every woke box i can see that if it supports the story but how does that does that support the story here it doesnt it seems like a glaring and forced substitute for quality writing enjoy season one skip season two season one stars season two stars,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3008,10.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this is is honestly the best one ever old school comedy with a drizzle of thrilling experience in it selena gomezs sarcastic role and the comedy legends old school humor is just perfect three of them remain to be the main character theres no overshadowing each other here and im loving it a must watch,POSITIVE,Comedy
3009,10.0,23 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i love my share of who dunnits sometimes i have to take a break though because i start to feel a little unsettled watching too many of them this one brings the mystery but is also strangely a little more lighthearted as weird as that sounds because it is about murder after all this was unique in the way it has a comedic satirical spin that completely works the three leads are unlikely friends but they have great chemistry together the ending gets a tad silly but again it works with this show whereas it may have not in other more serious murder mysteries a negative factor is the shows episode is less than minutes and you have to wait to watch the next episode until the following week at times it feels like more ads than substance however cant fault the show for that glad it was renewed hopefully season has a bit more of a shocking twist and the reason for the murder is a little more complex than season but overall really enjoyed this,POSITIVE,Comedy
3010,10.0,1 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i love the show and cant wait to see the mystery unfold but as a teenager i think the language is a bit severe wish they didnt use those words that much in the show but other than that i think its great,POSITIVE,Comedy
3011,10.0,1 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",love the cast and especially selna gomez really add some great colors to the show,POSITIVE,Comedy
3012,6.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the acting from everyone is just so natural and the humour isnt forced loved it selena gomez proving once again that theres nothing she cant do steve martin and martin short showing their powerful dynamic once again but with the added bonus of the gomez would recommend,POSITIVE,Comedy
3013,10.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this series is simply wonderful the charisma of the characters and the plot holds you a lot and right in the first episode youre amazed the series has a really nice mood too the production is also very good and not to mention the performance of the actors that is sensational especially selena gomez who showed what she came for no doubt this series has come to be a major contender for the emmy,POSITIVE,Comedy
3014,6.0,11 December 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",trying to be goofy with two wild and crazy guys the show bogs down every time selena gomez is in the scene decent cameos and the sting puns rock but i dont expect ill be checking out season,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3015,2.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this show is incredible all the acting and the plot are amazing especially selena gomez with her return to tv she embodies character and delivers every line perfectly,POSITIVE,Comedy
3016,10.0,28 June 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",cannot stand michael rapaport in anything he ruins anything hes in keep the formula simple amy schumerugh short martin gomez are great in this as they were last season short especially gomez is the hidden gem on the show martin is always incredible in everything hes in,POSITIVE,Comedy
3017,10.0,21 August 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i only watched season and it was okayish barely thinking back i dont know why i didnt give up on it faster its not particularly funny nor ground breaking its not even even that interesting steve martin and martin short are the only redeemable aspect about this but they can only do so much with what they are given so theyre not great either i think im maybe nostalgic about them since i used to always watch them while growing up now selena gomez i dont dislike her or anything in general but here her acting is really really bad is she even trying she delivers her lines in such a monotone way and she lacks any comedic timing if the script wasnt so bad she would be enough of a reason to not watch this its up to you but i would pass on this one,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3018,10.0,21 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",good show but the show is to short for a week to week drop hulu should have invested a little more into it i didnt know i would have fall in love with it,POSITIVE,Comedy
3019,9.0,24 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",writing writing writing the writing is so good and not wasted on characters back stories each character serves a purpose i hope it continues like this next season,POSITIVE,Comedy
3020,10.0,21 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",so good to see martin steve on screen together again and their chemistry with selena is great i loved the whole aesthetic costumes and set mixed with the scoring and music is fantastic great mystery funny endearing and clever,POSITIVE,Comedy
3021,8.0,27 October 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i started to watch the show with the mindset that this would be a light minute episode comedy to shut down your brain in those lazy days yet i was surprised how engaged and entertaining it turned out to be steve martin and martin short are long time collaborators and i assume friends as well in their personal lives so their chemistry is unquestionable this on its own is a major positive aspect of the show murder mysteries are a hollywood classic and theres ton of content already on this topic so its hard to be original in the realm with that being said this show actually does that in a refreshing way the chemistry is again the glue of it all the comedic duo gives the heart and are the major source of comedy which on most cases is well timed so we have plenty of funny moments while being a light hearted kind of show the murder plots are actually interesting and well designed of course some folks are obviously not guilty and depending on which episode you are it might become more clear who de culprit is yet the moments leading to the inevitable revelations are great and most of all they make sense which is something not all murder mysteries get right i did enjoy all seasons including the third while it becomes more far fetched as more seasons are made season and murders are more plausible while the third could arguably be debated as stretched i still felt that the plot was interesting the actors involved did an amazing job they really went for an all start guest list of actors its a well written story with great depictions and it maintains that balance of being a tv show about murders while at the same time it feels like a cozy light hearted family comedy i do struggle a bit with selena gomez performance ive seen her in other movies and i dont think that she is a bad performer but her delivery on this character feels off and distant you get used to it at some point but i dont know why she seems to struggle to deliver intensity or charisma to the character although her chemistry with steve and martin is great,POSITIVE,Comedy
3022,6.0,6 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i recommended yes its only episodes in but its so good and im so happy to see selena gomez in acting its a disney plus original everywhere and hulu in us so watch it,POSITIVE,Comedy
3023,9.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this is definitely a series worth watching episodes in and i am hooked only murders in the building not only has a starstudded cast but a hilarity in its dark material that makes the series totally bingeable and entertaining if i could compare it to another show it would be search party i can honestly say i cant wait to see how this ends the only problem i have with this series is that it was not released in full in one day i hate waiting around to watch it on a weekly basis like its update i rewatched the series and would have to say that although the first time around this show was exhilarating to view the second time did not hit as hard i love the show i think it was fantastically produced the sets are gorgeous the dialogue is funny the characters are well written however i would agree with most of the reviews this time around that the twists were predictable and could be seen from a mile away nonetheless the series is still one of the best to have come out in a while it was quirky done right definitely going to watch it again soon,POSITIVE,Comedy
3024,7.0,5 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",great story and the men are great when selena gomez opens her mouth im taken out of the story she is really on the surface and sounds like kermit the frog is that her usual voice soo weird,POSITIVE,Comedy
3025,2.0,1 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",steve martin and martin short are great as always and selena gomez does a good job of keeping up with them better than i expected she is not as bad as a lot of these reviews make her out to be overall it is a very enjoyable show a little different than most of the garbage on tv today for instance lets make yet another ncis with a bunch of unlikable people doing the same old tired things in a new place but i digress i love nathan lane in anything and all of the actors do a good job i am looking forward to more twists and turns before the final reveal my one criticism is episode the silent episode i get it very artsy fartsy or maybe just an attempt to show what it is like to be deaf whatever the reason just because you can do something does not mean you should i do not stare at my tv when watching it without ever looking away so this was very difficult to watch also i missed the texts and some stuff because it was too small and i could not see it needless to say i feel frustrated because i missed a lot and i do not want to watch it again once was torture enough so please do not use that particular method of filming again,POSITIVE,Comedy
3026,10.0,8 October 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i really liked season it was great there were signs of things to come with all the emphasis on how wonderful in every way mabel is eye rolling in the extreme its intersectional feminism shes called amazing so often its ridiculous that aside the writing was solid and engaging and the irritations i felt could be compartmentalised and didnt ruin the overall enjoyment of the mystery if steve martin wasnt in it however i would probably not watch the intersectional post modern writing is very sadly turned up to in season what on earth is amy schumer doing in this or cara delevingne the quality of the writing took a dive i dont think they had a plan for season well if they did they have done a very poor job with execution one good season will have to do,POSITIVE,Comedy
3027,10.0,23 August 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",first to seasons were excellent this third season is so lost convoluted the show lost its direction its seems to me they are turning the series into a show about the creation of a broadway play and lost the most important and compelling point of the what this was originally about murder and how this eclectic threesome were able to solve the crimes with the added bonus of a pod cast i believe for some reason the show has gone off the rails it has lost the uniqueness that made this a really good series i truly hope the show can get back on track but for some reason it has gone down a rabbit hole and it seems to be losing its original charm,POSITIVE,Comedy
3028,10.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",its very good the two martins comedy vets who we all know and love have an outstanding performance here and selena gomez is a welcomed addition to the iconic pair the writing is witty the mystery is set up very nice and the sets and costumes are very well made there is a sense of privilege within the characters but thats what it was trying to do sometimes the comedy doesnt land but its a treat to watch all these amazing actors do their job,POSITIVE,Comedy
3029,9.0,21 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",was looking for a good show to watch and just stumbled upon this show saw it had steve martin in it and that got me interested martin short in it got me even more interested when i started watching it i didnt even realize selena was in it liked her character and acting great to see martin and short to their old selves again kind of felt martin fell off with the pink panther movies but the writing is great the acting is great and they managed to capture this certain vibe i havent seen in a movie or series for quite some time definitely a fan hope they can keep up this standard,POSITIVE,Comedy
3030,10.0,1 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",very lighthearted easy to digest and amazing characters not difficult to understand or catch on despite being a crime show also,POSITIVE,Comedy
3031,10.0,21 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",there seems to be a lot reviews downplaying the acting by ms gomez she is playing a character to embody stereotypical gen z and i think she does a fantastic job fbombs and all steve martin and martin short bring classic comedy and writing while selena gomez helps provide a modern spin i also appreciate nathan lane to throw in some albert goldman vibes the writing is funny and sweet my only complaint is i wish the episodes were a bit longer i definitely recommend a watch,POSITIVE,Comedy
3032,7.0,23 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",great show great cast im really enjoying the show so far,POSITIVE,Comedy
3033,9.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this show takes an interesting approach to murder mystery and keeps you intrigued the main characters compliment each other well and are so funny,POSITIVE,Comedy
3034,6.0,20 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",not my typical review because i feel like i might be the only one bothered by this firstly i promise i really like the show and before anyone says it yes i know gomezs character is supposed to be like that but the monotone and stiff mabel keeps distracting me from the story like i struggle to take her seriously i know its not gomez herself because she is a good actor so clearly thats how the director wanted mabel to talk and act i really wander if anyone else feels this way because i know its a specific little thing but i cant get over it so besides that personal issue its a good show and i highly recommend it,POSITIVE,Comedy
3035,4.0,24 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i really have enjoyed the show the banter between characters is engaging from sarcastic to heartfelt feels like a convoy id have with my friends when im tipsy steve is perfection character wise and martin is like can you be by uncle or grandpa id love a guy like that in my family selena well plays her ish character to a freaking tee touch bit entitled but still exudes confidence respect so far loving the story line and input from characters a bit refreshing from normal comedy type dramas some seem so hokey pokey this one seems more down to earth shall i say believable im hooked thanks for the show guys,POSITIVE,Comedy
3036,10.0,14 December 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",its very well made just that ms gomezs horrible acting ruins it every time she is on forget about the dialogue delivery get expressionless face makes the series unwatchable,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3037,9.0,7 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",and they decided to take a great show and destroy it by throwing in amy schumer michael rappaport and the lesbian angle of course sheesh thank you hulu i mean not surprised by the heavy handed commercials that are rampant on your platform,NEGATIVE,Comedy

3040,9.0,29 September 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",lets just say this show is one of the ones that keeps you wanting to watch more after the episode ends its has great comedic scenes but its also a mystery thriller it does a good job of keeping it funny but serious at the same time it can make you laugh one minute and the next youre hanging on the edge of youre seat the acting trio of martin short steve martin and selena gomez plays very well together who would of thought only thing im worried about is just how many seasons it can go on with the same type of plot line but overall very watchable obviously like any show it could be better but overall its a would recommend the watch,POSITIVE,Comedy
3041,10.0,27 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",absolutely fantastic series totally hooked from the getgo brilliant cast excellent writing what a cliffhanger cannot wait till season which just got the green light,POSITIVE,Comedy
3042,7.0,9 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",martin short steve martin and selena gomez are so funny in this it takes a couple episodes to hit its stride but once it does its lol funny theres silly physical comedy and great dialogue banter and the chemistry between the characters is awesome the mystery itself is light and fluffy so go into this expecting more of a comedy than a murder mystery and youll be satisfied,POSITIVE,Comedy
3043,10.0,19 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",slow at the beginning but as characters are introduced got much better martin short is his usual self selena gomezs character is very flat dry probably written like that steve martin is neurotic lonely jane lynch is hysterical its a madcap mysterycomedy reminded me of its a mad mad world throughly enjoyable looking forward to a nd season,POSITIVE,Comedy
3044,7.0,30 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",only murders in the building has an interesting setting a nice prompt cozy atmosphere and great cast however the three main characters with their undenayable chemistry and interesting background stories were far more interesting than the murder case itself which was presented rushly,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3045,2.0,26 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",not only do i love whodunit style shows i live the actors ive always been a huge fan of martin short since his sctv days steve martin has a great dry humor that pairs well with short finally selena gomez rounds out the trio with her youthful insights and wit i cant wait until next season,POSITIVE,Comedy
3046,10.0,26 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i dont get this casting she cant act and shes not funny the writing for the other characters is still witty especially martin short but i find her to be a distraction,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3047,10.0,29 June 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",while i rated the first season highly with a unique set of actors and compelling story the second season appears to be a rehash without a new twist more hollywood fluff versus a creative comedy that we saw in season one,POSITIVE,Comedy
3048,10.0,24 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",it was a fun watch it was decent at the very least not sure if my standards are just getting lower and lower these days or i just actually liked it although im pretty much sure i would watch season when it comes out,POSITIVE,Comedy
3049,10.0,1 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",a perfect cast lighthearted and very funny just what we all needduring the horrible times we all have faced in the last year and a half nothing dark to drag you down here,POSITIVE,Comedy

3051,10.0,1 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",if youre debating on watching it give it one episode i promise youll be hooked i decided to watch this because lets be honest i cant be the only one who misses seeing selena gomez on screen the genuine friendships between the actors are so aparent and perfects the chemistry within the show and makes it work soo good,POSITIVE,Comedy
3052,6.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",arguably the best series of steve martin selena gomez and martin short all in one show its a guaranteed hit gomezs comedic personality in this show is everything make sure to give this show a watch youll love it,POSITIVE,Comedy

3054,6.0,10 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",theyre trying to keep it interesting with plot twists but was expecting to like this more what stands out to me though is that selena gomezs voice is really grating on me,POSITIVE,Comedy
3055,3.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the show is a delight to watch and contains themes of comedy and mystery the acting by all the characters especially the main characters helps to execute the plot in a phenomenal way all in all this show is definitely a must watch,POSITIVE,Comedy
3056,10.0,1 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",must be people involved with the show hoping to up the ratings and get people to watch not a good tactic id say i tuned in because im a longtime martin short fan but i found shorts energy and charm to be brought down by steve martins character who seems aloof and by selena gomezs who seems uncomfortable not to mention rude,POSITIVE,Comedy
3057,10.0,12 September 2024,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i liked everything about season one selena gomez made everything work steve martin and martin short needed something to balance their slapstick season two dropped my rating of the series down to a everything felt too tired still i watched the entire season who knows why i returned for season when i saw meryl streep on the cast list sadly the blah ha blah ha blah ha drowned her out she is one of my favorite actors i am watching season episode as i write this i may or may not make it through the season making it through the episode is also in question the actors playing the actors who are going to be in the omitb movie set a new low for the series it seems that most series go well beyond their sell by date with only murders that might have been season,POSITIVE,Comedy
3058,8.0,1 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",show of the year funny and gets you hooked up,POSITIVE,Comedy
3059,9.0,2 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",well the two comedy kings have shown their power every scene is dramatic mysterious and funny selena is back in her best she is as good as sherlock holmes,POSITIVE,Comedy
3060,10.0,7 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this is an absolutely hilarious and spellbinding series however it would be great without all the fbombs its as if they are just thrown in over and over to get a rating that might attract more viewers im no prude but this is really an excellent series and doesnt need to have that included to make it great,POSITIVE,Comedy
3061,10.0,1 September 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i enjoyed the first two seasons though mainly for martin and short but the third season is just drifting aimlessly and episodes have gotten repetitive characters wander about spouting limp dialogue with the rare flash of humor and then someone finds a clue in the last scene that points to another character possibly being the murderer but that character will have an alibi in the next episode so they start all over again even martin and short look bored this season and gomez has never added anything to the show shes completely out of her depth as a character and actress she stumbles about with her dead eyes droning out words in an irritating nasally voice that makes you stop listening as soon as she appears even the occasional flashes of cleavage and lesbian kiss from last season havent made her interesting as for guest stars streep is always a joy even with little to do but rudd is completely wasted ill keep watching but unless this thing kicks it up several notches and maybe gomez flashes more than cleavage i suspect they wont have a fourth season then again based on martin and shorts attitude i doubt theyd care,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3062,7.0,1 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the type of series i love to watch theres not many shows like this currently so im excited that they did this i love the cast martin short steve martin are legendary and are known for being great comedic actors selena gomez is also a great addition to the duo already hoping for a season,POSITIVE,Comedy
3063,7.0,9 December 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",steve martin and martin short make this show worth watching selena gomez on the other hand is so bad that its painful to watch the scenes shes in she delivers her lines as if she read them from a large sign teeth clenched and staring emptily it is hard to believe that she would have landed this role if she hadnt financed part of the show please replace her in season maybe a small animal could take her place season is slightly better that the first one so it seems they are still looking for a suitable form for this show combining comedy and dramacrime is not an easy genre but steve and martin know their trade,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3064,5.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this show is something i loved this show starting with first series this show is definitely show of the year,POSITIVE,Comedy
3065,10.0,10 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",stick it out the show gets progressively better it isnt as good as half the reviewers say nor is it as bad as the other half say its a light hearted show that wont give you many actual laughs but it is cute and clever in a martin and short kind of way the storyline isnt very engaging at first but it definitely gets a fair bit better after a few episodes i almost gave up a bit into episode but i hung in there episode is a bit of a turning point thats when it starts to get interesting im now on episode and the story has gotten quite good its a decent ahow,POSITIVE,Comedy
3066,10.0,18 September 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",with powerhouse comedians martin and short this should be non stop funny unfortunately its tiresome slow nycentric annoying and of course caters to the required intersectional nonsense which distracts unnecessarily from the core context of good story writing gomez cannot act let alone open her mouth to speak properly martin is slow somewhat funny but seems a bit past his prime short is funny and energetic but could be unleashed more to propel the show forward as the monotone gomez and sleepy steve martin hold it back nice effort good visuals clever format but too many neurotic cliches and not quite the zest i was looking for based on my expectations,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3067,10.0,29 June 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i love this show so much can not wait to watch the season so excited until amy and cara are in this show please make em go away their acting are ruining the show not a big fan of the two of them,POSITIVE,Comedy
3068,10.0,1 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",amazing tv show its nothing like i expected and it exceeded my expectations yall should give it a try seriously plus selena does an awesome job its nothing like shes done before and oh my god she eats the roll up,POSITIVE,Comedy
3069,10.0,17 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i have missed the quirky very steve martin martin short type of upbeat comedy that was so popular in the late s and have found myself really missing ituntil here it is again a little offbeat a lot witty with some new york style sarcasm thrown in this show is a murdermystery in an apartment building with three strangers and nothing is as it appears on the surface nuff said about the plot the acting is steve martin classic steve martin who remains fabulous and martin short also always a winner selena gomes is a fun addition to their act highly talented and quite enjoyable i will be looking forward to the next episode every week,POSITIVE,Comedy
3070,10.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this show was so refreshing no comedy has done it the same in a while with the awkward silences and the down to earth real raw emotion in this show its bound to be an emmy favorite,POSITIVE,Comedy
3071,6.0,1 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i havent watched a sitcom since frazier went off the air as so many others have already written it is witty engaging entertaining and all out fun it doest pander to the lowest common denominator nor insult a viewers intelligence the writing and performances are spot on while the story captivates the viewer playing along with the who dunnit i felt like i was at dinner theater mystery rather than my living room i cant wait for the next episode,POSITIVE,Comedy
3072,10.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",highly recommend this show is best in mixture between criminal and comedy wow love all the cast,POSITIVE,Comedy
3073,6.0,27 August 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",s was so good were not good specially when cara delevingne came it was unwatchable just couldnt bare watching her scenes when i started watching this show it had me laughing out loud and eagerly awaiting each new episode the first season was a breath of fresh air with clever writing witty humor and a cast that had excellent chemistry the show seemed to have found its comedic stride right out of the gate its unfortunate that the show didnt recognize its peak and instead decided to keep pushing forward with more seasons in retrospect its clear that the show should have heeded the old adage quit while youre ahead the first season was a delightful gem that left a lasting impression but the subsequent seasons left me wondering why the shows creators didnt know when to call it quits its a disappointing reminder that not all good things are meant to last and sometimes its better to leave the audience wanting more than to overstay ones welcome,POSITIVE,Comedy
3074,4.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this series is amazing the story production and acting of the actors is spectacular i was surprised with selena gomez her acting is great i highly recommend watching this series everyone will love it,POSITIVE,Comedy
3075,10.0,22 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",seriously do the directors of these us shows have a checklist first season brilliant second season enforced changes that make zero sense like seleba gomez character suddenly having her cake and eating it and as for amy schumer,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3076,9.0,30 June 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",first season was smart and funny schumer adds an awful stupid angle she steals scenes and i hate seeing her perhaps if she could act that would be helpful,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3077,10.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i cant stop watching its so good they all did a great job in love with the show selena queen of acting real did what she had to do,POSITIVE,Comedy
3078,10.0,6 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",such a great and funny show love this trio please we need more episodes,POSITIVE,Comedy
3079,10.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this show is a must watch just saw the first three episodes and i am obsessed,POSITIVE,Comedy
3080,10.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",fantastic rarely does such a smart show last long but heres hoping it will this show is very well written with just the right amount of comedy and a perfect fit for the current true crime podcast trend the two martins work well together and ms gomez is perfect in her role cant wait to see more,POSITIVE,Comedy
3081,9.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",it was really good such a good series to keep away with so interesting it is awesome to watch selena acting again,POSITIVE,Comedy
3082,6.0,3 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",it is awesome to see steve martin and martin short at the top of their game the show lets them have fun and take viewers on a whimsical ride at the same time its unfortunate that gomez acting detracts from every scene shes in i cant figure out if her exaggerated affectation is intentional or if shes just that bad but its pretty jarring still a fun romp but not mustwatch tv,POSITIVE,Comedy
3083,8.0,1 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",like many others i listen to true crime podcasts all the time this show is perfect for that large demographic its also really funny and keeps you engaged at all times cant wait for next weeks episode,POSITIVE,Comedy
3084,10.0,13 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",can someone replace selena gomez no doubt she is gorgeous but she cant act her acting is so plain makes me cringe please casting director dont ruin the series im giving it because michael short steve martin amy ryan im a huge fan of hers sting tina fey and other neighbors stole the show i like the concept if writers can read the reviews some scenes are not necessary,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3085,10.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",first off the show is average average and that isnt bad if you think knives out is the best mystery ever created you will love this if you are a fan of everything from death in paradise all the way to father brown mysteries you will think this is average the start is not needed the three telling a tale of their new york isnt needed its too woody allen and its like bad poetry artistic decisions only look artistic when done for artistic reasons this reeks of trying to hard to be intellectual there of course is the obligatory women get raped by men cause its a mans world and wahmen reeled off by selena gomez this isnt novel or unique in fact it literally follows the same beats as so many before to the point where ultra city smiths lampooned it only a few weeks ago on our tv screens the positives steve martin and martin short they are legends and this isnt a payday for them this isnt phoned in i will agree with that amazing from them selena gomes i love her i am not a huge fan of her music but her personally i actually like as she has never come across the same as miley and taytay both seeming up their own ahem ms gomez has always seen like the cheerleader that didnt want to be mean like the other vapid airheads but couldnt help being attractive and popular i am so glad she is normal in this and that she plays someone that isnt just a something idiot she actually is playing a functioning adult the cinematography is lush no other words for it money spent well the acting between the is amazing now the negatives the pacing is off the story is taking too long to set up exposition can be done far more naturally the start is elongated and filled with horrible little cliches and tropes the pilot is bad but i give the show a as pilots arent usually the peak of a show the mystery is not that smart with the only good aspect being that they are fans of podcasts no different to the main character of zomboat being into zombie movies or things like truth seekers its been done and worse still you should never touch a subject that rhyse sheersmith and steve pemberton have touched with their amazing inside number the pilot follows campbells journey way too much at the th min mark they literally hit one of the steps on time as for the reviews anyone that has given this above a needs a word with themselves worryingly on here and google the reviews seem fake made by people that have had their profiles for less than a week is it bad no it is amazing no its average worse still its a hackneyed mish mash of agatha christie tropes we have them all here from miss marple to and then there were none as for the podcast thing its a bit isnt it,POSITIVE,Comedy
3086,10.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the characters complimented each other it was thrilling and funny at the same time i grown up watching the three of them never i have imagine that those will make a good team of amazing actors,POSITIVE,Comedy
3087,10.0,1 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i loved the first episodes and im really looking forward to the next ones to come,POSITIVE,Comedy
3088,10.0,1 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",selena is everything show is different in a good way,POSITIVE,Comedy
3089,7.0,4 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",its definitely unique and i love the creative direction of it however some of the acting is not up to par in my opinion and its a bit slow but nevertheless i love it excited to see how it grows,POSITIVE,Comedy
3090,10.0,2 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",just a quick review but i will say this show is absolutely sublime honestly it is the best show i have seen in a while very clever and very funny a perfect mixture of satire comedy mystery thrills and physical play the trio of lead actors just fizz with chemistry and the story builds with a steady flow of twist turns and farce but what really makes this show shine is the brilliance of the characters interplay that keeps you mesmerized and hooked the music is also a nice surprise from the well written theme tune to the clever choice of music in the different episodes do not listen to the haters they know nothing this is the real deal happy to report that the long wait of steve martin and martin short back on the screen is well worth the wait and the very talented selena gomez definitely holds her own sit back and enjoy top class acting and a first class script cannot wait for season,POSITIVE,Comedy
3091,6.0,23 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",there are probably similar shows but there are also hundreds of shows one can watch on regular tv and all these platforms like netflix amazon prime and disney but when i gave this serie a try i was pleasantly suprised as i cant remember to watch a similar serie like this as i could really relate to one of the main characters of the shows an amateur detective trying to solve a murder crime therefore i love the serie i just hope it wont last too long as out of series quality drops after the rd or th season,POSITIVE,Comedy
3092,10.0,13 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i realize that were trying to appeal to a younger audience but did there really need to be a f f f f f f f tirade in the second season seriously i guess swearing was easier than writing something better not needed first season was better in every way,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3093,10.0,23 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",an amazing storyline and the characters are entertaining the music is great and i give the show a the show is very interesting and not at all what i expected but its even better i really hope there will be a lot more upcoming seasons from this show and at last the details are amazing,POSITIVE,Comedy
3094,10.0,25 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",firstly ignore the haters if you hate whodunnits or things that do not rely on goreextreme violence nonstop cgi action gratuitous use if the f bomb andor sports then this is not the show for you its also not about rebellious mensa youths playing chess but if you like murder mysterieswhodunnits and are looking for something clever fun and just a tad lighthearted despite being about solving murders please watch this show the filmmakers do a great job of taking the podcast medium and bringing it to life in an entertaining and colorful way more entertaining in fact than many actual podcasts themselves regardless of your imaginative capabilities the casting is fantastic and the main protagonists have a great chemistry together really bringing life to their characters and while some supporting roles arent fleshed out too deeply you get a great sense of the overall ecosystem of sorts at the arcadia through the protagonists adventures which is all that matters here it isnt the deepest show or the most dramatic but its approach to death our differences and the weird things that can bring us together is honest thoughtful and genuine yes there are silly moments and silly characters but this is a comedy and unlike other showsfilms purporting to be comedic does actually contain amusing things as a millennial i enjoy a real range of genres from romantic period pieces to rob zombie style horror but at the end of a long day i truly looked forward to each episode drop of only murders as something light but still thoughtful to enjoy and decompress really looking forward to season,POSITIVE,Comedy
3095,10.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this series is wonderful the story production and cast is spectacular,POSITIVE,Comedy
3096,10.0,1 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",omg i loved see the selena gomez act again its soooo good,POSITIVE,Comedy
3097,6.0,4 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",only murders in the building is fun and entertaining from the start i caught a review from david bianculli on fresh air just prior to the shows release that grabbed my attention and had me marking the release date on the calendar his review is spot on the show is as good as advertised those disappointed after expecting a novel and superior crimemystery series are partly missing the point the mystery cliches are part of the humorous parody the podcast plot line provides an amusing relatability many watchers will know the experience of discovering a friend or acquaintance shares an affinity for the same true crime podcast eg serial etc the enthusiasm for such podcasts is noted with a hilarious reaction by a detective outside the murder scene to the three main characters snooping around goddamnit what fn podcast are you all hooked on many viewers will also connect with the characters from a childhood andor adult secret desire to be a real crime detective martin a cocreator is more subdued and cynical in his role allowing short and gomez to balance either side of him with their typical highenergy and dry sarcasm respectively gomez really shines and her character has depth the viewer gets to share the tension and conflict mabel must feel hiding her secrets from the other two this show hooked me like i hoped it would when i heard about it and i simply cant wait for more,POSITIVE,Comedy
3098,10.0,1 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this is fresh story amazing cast full of thrillers and suspense cant wait to see how story unfolds in upcoming episodes first episodes keeps you on the edge of you seat and love to see selena gomez on onscreen,POSITIVE,Comedy
3099,7.0,22 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this is a pleasant show steve martin and martin short are fun to watch selena gomez was fine in wizards of waverly place and a few disney made for tv movies but she is really wooden here maybe its the direction but her performance so far is mediocre the story moves along slowly but at least it moves,POSITIVE,Comedy
3100,5.0,1 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the show is so fun the cast is amazing and selena gonez ate the role,POSITIVE,Comedy
3101,10.0,7 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i am liking this show well enough after episodes first of all selena is gorgeous as always and also somewhat coy and mysterious good on her landing this gig but some things bother me a bit the attempt to be edgy seems to just be gore and swearing there is not a clear direction on what the target audience is is this for young adults old people what i watch things outside my target demo but i want that to be a consistent experience i dont flip on some looney tunes from my youth expecting it to be adult oriented i want it to be a kids cartoon so far im being pulled in a few different directions so its a bit annoying from an acting perspective i think martin is standing out he fits the character as written almost to a t and seems to jump out of the screen at you on the other side steve just doesnt quite work for me and ive never really considered him a top level actor anyway but he still kind of works as a contrast to martin as for selena lets all be honest here and admit shes just not a toplevel actress but shes cute and is clearly there to counter the two old guys with her youth and as weve seen in the trailers no spoilers shes a central character but so far maybe hasnt had a chance to flex her acting range im also throwing out the question what is up with her speaking voice her tone is so very nice as always but her enunciation is off almost like she had a jaw injury another comment on the acting in general is that everyone seems to be a bit distant put another way i am not seeing as much chemistry as i would like well give them some more time to warm up but for now its almost like each person is acting to the camera not to their costars this show does give me vibes of the flight attendant which i also liked but sometimes it feels like they copied some things here and there could just be me,POSITIVE,Comedy
3102,10.0,8 December 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",boooring but i am forcing myself to watch it to the end out of respect for the comedy giants in it the dialogue sounds like it was written by an average joe in a coffee shop just awful,NEGATIVE,Comedy

3104,10.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",great acting excellent cinematography and great script a good balance of lightheartedness with elements of mystery as classic whodunnits have,POSITIVE,Comedy
3105,10.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",it really doesnt get any better than those surprisingly selena gomez is doing pretty good in this show with acting she fits the part i cannot wait till they release the new episodes,POSITIVE,Comedy

3107,6.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i adore this serie its sooo funny and interesting and the actuation is yall should watch it right now,POSITIVE,Comedy
3108,10.0,3 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this series has me hooked its unique fun suspenseful i see a couple bad reviews claiming its not much of a thriller but thats the point the series is a mysterycomedy and its suppose to have some comedy and its not meant to be thriller also we have steve martin and martin short they are comedians so its to be expected the show was going to have some comedy i recommend watching this if you enjoy true crime mystery and comedy because this show has them all and its very unique and different from other shows also selena gomez shines through along with steve and martin theyre all an incredible cast,POSITIVE,Comedy
3109,6.0,28 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",for a show in which the casting was the main hook it doesnt seem to work that well between them gomez is off bland doesnt fit and its only more obvious when put against the backdrop of martin and short who actually have great dialogue between them but thats really all they have this show forgot plot so it kinda plods along sleepily the pacing is off big time as well that said good side characters and surprisingly well directed but selena was the wrong call in casting,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3110,3.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",amazing cast plot binge watch worthy excellent performance by the actors loved it,POSITIVE,Comedy
3111,10.0,1 September 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",funny campy and weird an easy to watch crime comedy that takes you all over new york and keeps you guessing its well produced and has a decent cast the jokes can get a little repetitive and forced especially the ones about age and charles brazo bad acting something that cannot be ignored though is selena gomezs acting emotionless and wooden when she speaks almost not even opening her mouth to deliver the lines its very distracting i dont understand why they could not have found someone else for that role still looking forward to season though and i heard there may be a season in the works,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3112,10.0,23 August 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",first two seasons were excellent but struggling with the third meryl streep is very overrated and is so lack luster all the tim dont get me started on her thinking she can sing its also lacking the pizzazz of the story is very blah and boring paul rudd is fantastic as always just really wish he was in more scenes and longer while the martian and steve chemistry is good its definitely running its course and needs to wrap it up soon i hardly find and laughs in this weird characters have joined the cast a mother son relationship that is pretty awkward boarding on incest i hope this is the last season,POSITIVE,Comedy
3113,10.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the best show of i loved it so much selenas acting is superior shes so wonderful and amazing actress also steve selena and marty are the trio i never knew i needed,POSITIVE,Comedy

3117,7.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",can we talk about the twists in this amazing series it picks slow but you will get hooked after watching second episode let me not begin to talk about the actors steve martin selena are fabulous i cant wait to see aarons part in further episodes,POSITIVE,Comedy
3118,10.0,28 June 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i loved season onei anticipated season two and then suddenly amy schumer appeared amy schumer thanks for ruining season for me you couldnt be less funny,POSITIVE,Comedy
3119,7.0,7 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i know im going to upset a lot of people here with this one so im going to get it out first im not sure selena gomez was the right person to put up against two comedy powerhouses like martin and short as dynamic and outstanding as these two gomez is equally flat and uninteresting adding in guests to the show like tina fey sting et al and she really pales on screen with her flat affect other than this im a huge mystery fan usually british mysteries but this has enough of a feel to compare to those and im enjoying this show very much the story line grabs you from the moment martin says only murders in the building given its a mystery it moves slower than id like but british mysteries usually wrap up very quickly so im allowing this to not bother me i like how the characters lives are fleshed out so we can know them better the shows not at all heavy or dark other than the fact theyre investigating and podcasting about a murder in the building the jokes are also light and the byplay between characters is enjoyable its my sincere hope when this one is done martin and short will consider others sans gomez but with a more talented actress,POSITIVE,Comedy
3120,1.0,16 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this remind me so much of game clue in the best way possible i want to know what will happen next as what i expect never happens which makes the story and writing brilliant making me on the edge of my seat awaiting the next episodes,POSITIVE,Comedy
3121,10.0,6 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",because this is definitely bingeworthy martin and short are back at it again folks and its exactly what the world needed both are aging like fine wines and are just as funny steve martin and dramatic martin short as ever i cant wait to find out the complete story and who dunnit e t a though i find the show entertaining and definitely would have watched the entire season in one go only murders in the building isnt the kind of show id watch every week i realize that sounds a bit strange however its the kind of show i might forget about or i likely would choose to watch something else over this if i was in a time crunch i may wait until the entire season has been released then go back and watch all at once,POSITIVE,Comedy
3122,10.0,17 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",when i saw its promos i became very excited seeing big names experienced cast but it was a let down too slow did we really need to know that much of the characters back stories the current happenings could have been made more interesting and considering wide range of colorful characters living in the building where murders occur the tv show turned out to be very bland i held onto my patience for upto the first quarter of the rd episode before giving up on it,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3123,10.0,19 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i love it all the cast is perfect and effin adorable together i can honestly say that for some random reason i never was a steve martin fan idk why ive never watched any movies with him in it ever really but no i adore him and martin short is i mean come on awesome and then selena gomez which i can say i was pleasantly surprised by her as well loved it two thumbs up gold metal lol im excited for a season to see what happens next and then hopefully a show with many many more seasons,POSITIVE,Comedy
3124,10.0,16 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this show is funny and warm with great acting fabulous characters and an absorbing mystery storyline i expected all that but really didnt expect the tenderness among the characters and the depth of the characters these are just superficial characters with slapstick jokes sure its funny but its heartwarming and heartwrenching at times too grade a entertainment,POSITIVE,Comedy
3125,10.0,16 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",a high quality production from top to bottom well done and thank you everyone concerned,POSITIVE,Comedy
3126,10.0,6 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this midwestern girl loves this show steve martin always so likeable since forever ive seen him with his band several times fan since snl martin short never a fan but he is brilliant in this im going to have rethink and review martin short selena didnt know she was an actress but she is believable and very interesting to watch those eyes and body language the fans outside were well chosen the kid on s e what a face hoping he and the fans are incorporated into the storyline somehow not done later,POSITIVE,Comedy
3127,7.0,21 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",stylistically refreshing for a murder mystery comedy i found myself laughing and repeating lines throughout the evening,POSITIVE,Comedy
3128,10.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",selena is back with a bang the leading trio is everything highly recommended,POSITIVE,Comedy
3129,6.0,17 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the whole premise of the show seems intriguing but the show is very slow with not much going on i dont understand why the rating is so high maybe is all the gomez fans,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3130,1.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",light hearted and so much fun to watch and selena killed it,POSITIVE,Comedy
3131,10.0,1 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",not sure what kind of television these star reviewers watch but this show is at best the production is good but the plot is certainly not inventive i am on ep and am over martin shorts annoying character more selena more bunny not on the edge of my seat more like edge of sleeping,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3132,10.0,1 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i like the fact they use modern features such as podcast and mix them with a crime but at the same time funny story very entertaining and selena is stunning here,POSITIVE,Comedy
3133,10.0,1 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the show is amazing selena steve and martin are the trio we never knew we needed btw i have to say that selena gomez acting is just out of this world im obsessed with omitb and cant wait to see ep,POSITIVE,Comedy
3134,10.0,4 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",though it wears a face of a mystery it is as much as three amigos were a western this is a festival of interesting characters not taking itself very seriously the last thing you want to do is guessing who dunne it just pay attention to everything around the plot and youll have a great time it brings back the vibe that got buried lately by self absorbed writers and wooden actors if you consider it over the top well it is on purpose the rating wouldnt have been if the market wasnt riddled with me me me im so important characters but in times like these the is a nobrainer,POSITIVE,Comedy
3135,10.0,6 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the trios chemistry is very good only episodes in so far so good,POSITIVE,Comedy
3136,6.0,1 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",selena really did a great job mabel is my favorite so far i love her character,POSITIVE,Comedy
3137,10.0,1 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",for fans of cozy mystery and crime stories this is a gem steve martin and martin short have allways been favorites of mine and selena gomez fits in well in this trio of amateur detectives seen two episodes cant wait for the next ones,POSITIVE,Comedy
3138,7.0,3 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the show has been interesting but has way to much needless f words it doesnt add to anything and just makes the show seem vile,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3139,2.0,20 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",only murders in the building is a masterpiece it is perfect and i love it every episode is perfect there is not one flaw with the show it is a much watch it might be my favorite show of all time the performances are fantastic marty short gives a perfect performance as oliver putnum which is probably his best performance and steve martin gives a excellent performance that is one of his bests selena gomezs performance really surprised me she can really act and she was just great i mean great in this without giving spoilers the story and the other side characters and tenets are also perfectly acted and casted nathan lane was amazing i mean amazing his performance and character was one of my favorites all three of the main characters interacts are real because they are great together off set and marty and steve have always been hilarious in this this show is so funny i laughed out loud so many times it was so funny the directing was so good i was very impressed i am invested in the story and the characters all the episodes were perfect but the finale was amazing and that cliffhanger was so perfect i loved it i cant wait for season two i want a lot more seasons of only murders in the building,POSITIVE,Comedy
3140,8.0,3 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",after episodes i am still watching the cast and production quality are obviously top notch i have always loved the casual nature of steve martins acting half the time he doesnt even need to say anything but he feels a bit underused at this point especially considering he created and produces the show i want to know more about his character maybe it is coming the character played by gomez is set up very well the dialogue is good and there is ample intrigue it would be a bit harsh to say gomez cannot act it could well be the direction is also poor what is with the monotone nature of her voice it sounds to me like she is just reading the script out loud most of the time barely a hint of feeling in the words i get the distinct impression she is trying too hard there is no energy to her acting but it must be a bit daunting to play opposite her costars i will give her a chance lets see where this takes us,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3141,10.0,7 April 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",only murders in the building is painful to watch i tried to watch the first four episodes to see if the series would get better but it only gets worse the premise is absurd affronts our intelligence and the dialogues seem straight out of a high school play the series starts with a murder in the middle of new york and the police assume its a suicide and worse still three residents of the building with access to everywhere and everything start an investigation and a podcast about the case veteran actors steve martin and martin short are completely wasted in this series and selena gomez unfortunately does not convince as an actress this series is just awful,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3142,10.0,28 June 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",show is great but amy schumer kills season season was well written had pretty much everything for a dramatic comedy good to see steve martin and martin short back together again selena gomez is always good and glad to see her back acting again the three of them work well together steve martin and martin short have great playoffs as they always had as in previous movies im not sure why they added amy schumer to the cast but they could have done better she doesnt fit in with the rest of them she tries to be funny but nothing she does or says really hits her comedy in stand up isnt funny either so she was a waste of a cast member the producers could have gotten a nobody to fill her role cant wait for the rest of season,POSITIVE,Comedy
3143,10.0,19 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i started watching it a few days ago and i love it steve martin is brilliant as always martin short is hilariously neurotic and selena gomez proves that she can hold her own with these comedic legends this is the show everyone must watch this fall,POSITIVE,Comedy
3144,8.0,17 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",she nailed it so far the episodes just so good we cant forget abt the other actors either omg steve martin martin short aaron dominguez omg preach for them too theyre such good actors i love them this is gonna be one of the best shows of all time i can see it,POSITIVE,Comedy
3145,10.0,22 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this is awesome i love the combo like crime murder mystery thriller comedy really enjoy this good script and brilliant casting,POSITIVE,Comedy
3146,7.0,6 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i really warmed up to this show short martin and gomez have great chemistry i like the oldfashioned decor and the moody atmosphere the story is engaging and i will look forward to the rest of the series,POSITIVE,Comedy
3147,10.0,23 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",im a bit disappointed on how short the season was since it was only episodes and each for about minutes i loved the chemistry between all three characters and i loved how there were a lot of plot twists in a short amount of time and the show moved on pretty quickly as well so ready for season,POSITIVE,Comedy
3148,7.0,12 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",short and martin are great especially short however gomez is a distractingly bad actress if not for the writing and the acting of the other two she would make the show unwatchable,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3149,1.0,1 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the show is amazing so fun the cast did a great joband selena gomez ate the role,POSITIVE,Comedy
3150,9.0,26 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",most older viewers will go in to this to see steve martin and martin short team up while younger viewers are likely here for selena gomez you will certainly get your fill as far as screen time goes but not quite the best as far as performances go all three are fine enough in their roles but we are talking a spoofy murder mystery here steve martin gets more humor and drama than the others and does well with it and generally being a lot less over the top than we are used to seeing him which i found refreshing martin shorts character works more an annoyance that lets others be funny although he does have some funny lines but much less than we normally see selena gomez is a bit uneven she works best when she is investigating and not so good when she is supposed to be emotional it cant be easy holding your own with this cast but i do think she held her ground pretty well the story is a spoof about crimemurder podcasts and manages to go through many different phases during the episode run it started strong and then ambles along very pleasantly until it crescendos with a very good final episode it feels comfortable all the way through and that isnt a bad thing in this age of media violence this is a balm that i looked forward to watching each week and enjoyed until the end,POSITIVE,Comedy
3151,10.0,21 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i have been a fan of steve martin and martin short in their earlier effortsbut nowit seems they have suffered from major talent withdrawal and selena gomez what a completely talentless piece of workshe talks as if her jaw is still numb after major jaw surgery and her monotone voice emits the fbomb at regular intervals apparently one of the major requirements to be a writer in hollywood today is to inject as many fbombs as possible i fail to see how this series got labeled as a mysterycomedy when both elements are absent,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3152,10.0,31 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",only murders in the building is perhaps the most unique show out there right now martin short steve martin pair works like an well oiled machine the pacing of the show is just right for this genre there was plenty of intrigue in the plot to make the audience glued to the story right after the first episode the plot starts thickening and by the end we had a very nice well developed plot in terms of performance both martin and short did a commendable job they were not only funny but also were emotionally invested in their characters overall this is an exceptionally well written show looking forward for the next season,POSITIVE,Comedy
3153,10.0,6 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this is a really great show i think selena gomez is really good in it martin and martin are great as usual this is well written and keeps you interested i do not find it funny tho at least not yet,POSITIVE,Comedy
3154,10.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",selena is very very very beautiful and the story is so good also i like it,POSITIVE,Comedy
3155,7.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i always say im not going to binge watch next time i find a show i like but alas i have failed again this series is adorable fun and so far anyway bereft of any of the social agenda garbage virtually every show nowadays seems driven to inject just simple lighthearted fun reminiscent of when tv was actually entertaining it does have a bit of profanity but at least its not blasphemous i adore steve martin anyway martin short is thankfully lowkey he can get annoying when hes over the top and its my first encounter with selena gomez but she does a great job too watch it,POSITIVE,Comedy
3156,9.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",im literally obsessed with this show you have to watch this,POSITIVE,Comedy
3157,6.0,1 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",when i first heard about the show i didnt had a lot of high expectations but i was so surprised after watching the first episodes the plot is well executed the characters are multidimensional and theres so much to uncover about them they are not what they seem like at first glance each episode leaves you wanting more and more as the story unfolds if you want something fun and intriguing at the same time congrats this ones for you,POSITIVE,Comedy
3158,9.0,22 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",ive enjoyed it love the pace the backstories and the character growth has been really interesting worth the time,POSITIVE,Comedy
3159,9.0,6 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",found myself getting bored with it but saw it through to the end a few very few funny lines and a story that isnt particularly interesting and and do they have to say tim kono every time they are talking about him wouldnt tim do most of the time some of the storyline was lacking in logic and unlike curb your enthusiasm i really wasnt all that anxious to tune into unwatched episodes appreciate the effort of all involved as its certainly not easy to write a whodunnit but given the cast i expected to be laughing a lot more dont think ill tune into season unless the wife really wants to watch it fortunately the episodes are only around minutes long so its tolerable,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3160,10.0,31 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",only watched up to episode boring dull and unfunny selena gomez even acts and sounds bored of it nothing keeps you interested in the first episodes to keep you watching any more,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3161,10.0,28 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",a great series very funny brilliant story great characters and makes me want to go to new york desperately im not a true crime fan and you definitely dont need to be to watch this either,POSITIVE,Comedy
3162,10.0,12 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",look i love the show it is amazing since episode one it has kept me constantly on my toes and i am so happy we are going to be getting a season but i do not like cara and amys characters i mean i am all for progressiveness but what happened to oscar i dont understand i mean did he and mable not date anyway grate show worth your time,POSITIVE,Comedy
3163,10.0,25 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i love the story line i think my favorite was the cat in the freezer cant wait til season a little more light in the picture be nice it was really hard to see otherwise it was good,POSITIVE,Comedy
3164,6.0,8 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this is hands down hulus best series full of comedy thrills mystery and murder steve martin martin short show their still strong comedic forces in this industry selena gomez is at her best along side martin short gomezs comedic timing and quick witted delivery is up with the greats of this show this show will be a staple not only in hulus ever growing discographybut the discography of each actor involved in this series,POSITIVE,Comedy
3165,10.0,1 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",althought the reviews were good i actually didnt except the show to be that good ive finished watching it h ago and since then ive been doing nothing but think about who the murderer is ive been collecting clues and trying to hold a case failing miserably but well made about five different theories since then and even created a gc on to debate about them safe to say i cant wait to watch the next episodes and hulu is sick for releasing one episode per week like what was the reason,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3166,7.0,2 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i have to preface by saying i love steve martin and have since i was a teenager and saw him sing king tut on snl and as dr maxwell in the old bee gees sgt pepper movie i made a scrapbook of him and everything i feel he has rarely made a misstep in his career and i was thrilled to find out he was finally going to be in a series show i love martin and yes selena too so but theres a reason for the many high reviews as this show has it all truly laugh out loud comedy great cinematography and sets and a truly twisty intriguing mystery that unfolds in a tantalizing way i think the episode lengths are perfect too cant wait to see where this goes,POSITIVE,Comedy
3167,5.0,13 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i like the show sometimes but whatever is going on with selenas voice is weird is she trying to talk like this is she going through some physical struggle is she trying for a certain effect did i miss something that explained this seems like all the reviews that say only the nicest things dont address this elephant in the room it constantly takes me out of the plot i have seen her so fun and full of life and her normal voice why this change please explain so i can enjoy this show fully,POSITIVE,Comedy
3168,10.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",amazing omitb is so good i love to see it congrats selena gomez,POSITIVE,Comedy
3169,9.0,25 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this show could be so much better why did they choose selena gomez for mabel she ruins it for me luckily martin short and steve martin are kings so they carry the show but selena could have picked anyone but her shes so monotone and not believable in this role her character is not very likeable anyway so its super hard to write anything positive about her,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3170,10.0,7 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i cant give this show enough love the amazing cast is obvious but damn do they work well together the score is amazing cant help but to get excited when the opening song comes on just love it keep it coming,POSITIVE,Comedy
3171,9.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i woke up and was like what should i be watching it has been a while since i watched something so i was quite surprised cause i had no clue theres a selena gomez tv show its been a while right im excited i watch the first two episodes and they are great funny and gloomy it should be its a gloomy tv show after all i know this has nothing to do with the show itself but i love selenas outfits and color mixtures soo girly i know any way enjoy this,POSITIVE,Comedy
3172,10.0,2 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",ive been waiting to see omitb for a while now and i actually signed up for disney just to watch it i enjoyed all episodes and was left wanting more these characters are very fun together and im glad to see selena on tv again,POSITIVE,Comedy
3173,7.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",good clean lighthearted fun kq couldnt agree more,POSITIVE,Comedy
3174,9.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",fantastic cast and a fun premise two episodes in and this series shines unexpected quirky and well written only hope it keeps this up for the remaining episodes,POSITIVE,Comedy
3175,7.0,2 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this trio was a good choice for an ensemble story i really enjoyed seeing steve and selena of course martin playing on each others talents i think this was the best casting fir the type of story that unfolds a unique way to blend a little mystery with light comedy for sure,POSITIVE,Comedy
3176,9.0,16 February 2024,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this show is pretty goodbut honestly it peaked in its first season imo which is a shame season was quite outlandish but in a controlled way like fireworks whoever decided putting coloured gunpowder in a pipe and setting it on fire crazy whoever decided to shoot a bunch of them up in the air and make a display genius season is twisty and dramatic a little bit hammy a little bit cliché and very self aware the acting is solid the mystery is entertaining and engaging the resolution is great fun it just works season isfine thats not fair its actually pretty good too but its essentially a rehash of season so meh season sucks it couldnt hold my attention at all the dynamic changed far too much far too dramatically the situation doesnt work the character balance is off and the chemistry is dead im content to pretend in my own little head that it didnt exist and the show ended at the end of season,POSITIVE,Comedy

3178,10.0,6 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this is a show i was eager to see there are aspects that personally disappoint the pacing woody allen used to do these things so much better with an underappreciated energy and precision the peculiar interactions between the odd trio yes i know gomezs character is supposed to be somewhat disconnected from the older pair but her behaviour in the early episodes is just a bit too odd and illogical to work for me the alreadycliched talking to a dead guy conceit after the flight attendant and others this needs a long long rest and i know i know these things are subjective but gomezs weird ultraconstipated nasal mumble but the charm of martin and short makes up for any misgivings and keeps one watching like so many shows these days this feels like a minute movie stretched out to fill up a nonnegotiable run of episodes but its entertaining even during its detours and digressions not a great series by any means but a welcome one,POSITIVE,Comedy

3187,10.0,6 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the star reviews have to be fake im watching for martin and martin to read some of these you would think selena gomez is the best actress since meryl streep i dont know much about her music but her voice is so annoying the show isnt horrible and its not great its something to watch,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3188,10.0,29 February 2024,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",watching season one now its an interesting story steve martin and martin short are genius as usual always a great pairing martin short in particular is hilarious ive never watched anything with selena gomez in it before so i had no prior opinion her speaking voice is beyond grating i didnt know it was possible for someone to speak nasally and monotone at the same time kind of like that roz character from monsters inc if you can get past selenas irritating voice and the excessive unnecessary thoughtlessly applied and sometimes distracting use of the f word its fairly binge worthy,POSITIVE,Comedy
3189,10.0,1 October 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the show reminds me of the old tv where we had charisma good writhing and most important really good actors selena gomez really does bring some intresting youth to the triobut withous steve marin and martin short the show wouldnt be such an interesting one they bring that acting that we do not see anymore in the new tv showsthey give not only the appeal for drama but they have the fascination for classy and dashing the show as said before brings a couple of good points together such as writhingactingsomething really important to me new faces without thaking out the base actors i really hope the show continuous with the same energylove and devoution to create such an amazing content,POSITIVE,Comedy
3190,10.0,7 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",first season was excellent but second is not martin short and steve martin are brillian but selena gomez is not a good actress in fact she is terribly bad and amy schumer really she is not funny or anything i keep watching because story is interesting and funny and scenes are nice and want to see what will happen next all in all a good series,POSITIVE,Comedy

3193,7.0,13 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",one of the best shows that i ever watched loved it,POSITIVE,Comedy
3194,1.0,13 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i couldnt get enough of the cliff hangers each episode steven martin selena do an incredible acting in the show its comedy and mystery mixed in together and i love seeing mature content coming from these characters selena does a great job interpreting her emotions into mabel mora true actors can literally bring life to characters and selena has done it so proud of the good reviews,POSITIVE,Comedy
3195,10.0,11 December 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the first season was fantastic we couldnt get enough of it we watched it so fast once the second season came out we were so excited to watch it the second season left a lot to be desired with each episode they turned a good portion of it into trying to push a narrative of sexuality which isnt anything this show has ever tried to do before it was extremely disappointing to see yet another show fall into this pattern it was so boring that i dont think we will be watching the third season they couldve done so much better cara delevingne was a horrible addition to this season and it ruined a good portion of it this was supposed to be about mystery and solving murders and her character completely ruined it,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3196,10.0,20 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",ive been a fan of steve martins since the beginning i saw him early on in his career when he said excuse me and wore an arrow through his head loved him on snl every single time he was on bowfinger is one of my favorite movies i was delighted to see that he can still do physical comedy his antics in getting to the elevator and the subsequent mayhem that ensued had me roaring really a fun show to watch and i cant wait to see how that awful woman died,POSITIVE,Comedy
3197,10.0,2 June 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i think ill start with the bad stuff first i was really looking forward to this show for a while and then after months of waiting i finally got around to watching it and at first i was very disappointed so i seem to be in the very minority in that i didnt mind selena gomezs character her acting didnt blow me away but it was fine her character wasnt actively annoying like the other main characters were i get they are great actors and i used to love steve martin in his older movies when i was younger but i think the characters themselves were just so unlikable but thats just me but aside from that it took me over a week to get through the first four episodes they were just so boring and nothing happened and no meaningful progress in the plot happened aside from a few seemingly interesting cliffhangers i almost decided to stop watching completely a character later in the season actually referenced an earlier episode and it seems the writers were self aware of how pointless the first few episodes were a whole episode with no stakes except i would say it was multiple episodes but starting at episode stuff actually starts happening and the pacing becomes much better i wont spoil it but it starts getting some interesting reveals and the characters become slightly less full of themselves and more bearable i dont typically like whodunit murder mysteries but i think the differing personalities of the main trio and the intriguing premise ultimately paid off even though it was incredibly slow to start so i dont really blame people who quit a few episodes in,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3198,9.0,5 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i love steve martin martin short but i truly dont understand the rave reviews for this show i could only manage to suffer thru the first episode but that will be all it was so boring not funny i could go on but the biggest problem is the terribly miscast selena gomez who is not an actress she literally has one expression and couldnt act her way out of a paper bag anyone saying shes great in this is a fangurl sorry but thats just the truth in fact i dont know what two comic geniuses like steve martin martin short were doing getting mixed up with her in the first place if you want to see them back when they were funny its actually depressing to see how old they are now and life was a lot better too watch father of the bride talk about comedy gold this show however is not,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3199,10.0,5 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i dont know what i was expecting when i watched this but i ended up loving every minute ive not seen steve martin or martin short on my screen for a long time though i am a fan of their work such an odd mix of actors on paper but somehow it really works i loved the twists and turns and the nod to all the true crime junkiesarmchair detectives amongst us every other person seems to be on a facebook crime group these days and it made me laugh that they channeled this so well i liked the heart behind the characters as well as the comedy element i watched this show with my partner and teen daughter and we all enjoyed it its not often you can watch stuff with the family anymore we loved it and would really recommend,POSITIVE,Comedy
3200,9.0,6 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",what a show it get the viewers attention just as it startsand i dont think any comedy mystery can be better than that these three brilliant actors have given us what we expected truly exceptional show and the mystery of who did this will keep us guessing what a show,POSITIVE,Comedy
3201,7.0,7 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i was honestly unsure on how i would feel about this series but its fantastic its funny and cheesy and i love every minute of it steve martin martin short and selena gomez work so well together they are the perfect balance ive seen a couple people complaining that selena gomez is coming off as monotone or rude but have you all ever considered that this is the way the character is supposed to be portrayed the same way that both steve martin and martin shorts are supposed to be portrayed in a specific way i think everyone does a fantastic job with their character im also really loving everyone who theyve gotten to be part of this show i screamed with excitement when i saw nathan lane if yall want something refreshing and something funny and with an interesting storyline definitely watching this,POSITIVE,Comedy
3202,10.0,20 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",who knew dips could be a meal would you save a frozen legged cat who was tim kono if you have ever sat around your home thinking about these things wonder no more steve martin martin short and selena gomez are here to answer your questions in a murder mystery way called only murders in the building set in a building only murders moves from floor to floor with relative ease actually an elevator and some stairs occasionally venturing out into the court yard and even the mean streets of new york along the way we meet other people with other lives but the meat and potatoes is the murder in the building so if you want to get hooked on an enjoyable series staring stevemartinshort and selena gomez watch only murders in the building,POSITIVE,Comedy
3203,7.0,7 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",even when she was tiny on wizards of waverly place i was like this girl has serious chops and impeccable comedic timing im so excited for to break the disney chains and do real works unfortunately we got springbreakers and behaving badly but look at her now steve martin once again shows his stunning talent for writing and seeing him and martin short work together again is a real treat can not recommend this series enough,POSITIVE,Comedy
3204,5.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",finally a great comedy show it seems like it has been quite awhile since a truly good comedy series has been produced the first three episodes left me wanting more and the acting from the three leads is exceptional their chemistry is undeniable short is truly a legend and the story overall is very thrilling and funny,POSITIVE,Comedy
3205,10.0,20 August 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i got hooked after first few episodes mystery comedy and iconic characters with occasional cringey dialogues it follows the same old formula lead to one suspect and new evidence appears and turn to new suspect and repeat some twist in the end season follows the same journey and making it so boring i like the characters but the show struggles to offer something new and refreshing to keep me hooked it also has a lot of fillers and some romance of side characters that has no relevance in the story howards romance i saw the ratings on season is great i personally havent touched it yet,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3206,9.0,2 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i dont know why anyone would think you would have to be paid to give this series a star rating it was fantastic i wasnt sure about the first episode but after that i was hooked i actually didnt figure out the killer right away and i didnt expect the ending,POSITIVE,Comedy
3207,10.0,6 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the writers cannot agree on whether the folks who live in the anconia are tenants ie they pay rent to a landlord or owners ie they own their apartments and pay a monthly maintenance fee to the coop thus bunny is chairman of the board a coop thing but seeks to evict martin short a landlordtenant thing,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3208,10.0,26 August 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the first seasons were awesome i was totally hooked very intrtreging and kept your attention through out waiting intensely for each next episode season eh not so much episode was soooooo boring i left it numerous times to watch something else dredging through i returned to continue watching it the rd season thus far moved soo slow for anything exciting and seriously nothing exciting ever happened so sorry episode and offered little more excitement i seriously doubt i will continue watching anymore of this show not sure what happened that it clearly went off the cliff totally boring very slow moving no excitement at all sad cause i was enjoying it oh well on to another show,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3209,10.0,22 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",ignore the long reviews from people who gave up after one episode stick with it sit back and enjoy the entire masterpiece as soon as you think you know where the story is going the investigation goes in an entirely different direction full of twists and turns jokes and whodunnit excellence only murders in the building is truly fantastic selena steve and martin may be as unlikely a trio as their characters themselves but it really works persevere at the start it gets better you wont be disappointed,POSITIVE,Comedy
3210,10.0,23 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",who knew that aging comedians and a millennial would have great chemistry its witty and a great mystery caper no spoilers however i hate mysteries in which the culprit has two sentences the entire investigation until the last minutes of the show this is not the case,POSITIVE,Comedy
3211,7.0,21 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i just finished watching the first four episodes and im already hooked the chemistry between the three main leads are impeccable its a murder mystery in the same vain of knives out except you have three individuals who love true crime podcasts trying to solve a murder mystery in their building the series blends comedy and murder mystery well but doesnt skimp out on the drama as you hear the back stories of the three main leads it makes you tear up it has some of the best writing ive seen cant wait for the next episode im excited to know how this murder mystery plays out in the end highly recommended for those that enjoy a well scripted whodunnit with a superb cast,POSITIVE,Comedy
3212,10.0,1 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",brilliant show no faults the three main cast members two comedy legends and another surprisingly to me as i hadnt seen her in anything before great actor can not wait for season never even saw this advertised before watching just stumbled across it on disney why was a bigger deal not made of this,POSITIVE,Comedy
3213,6.0,27 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",maybe a storyline thats been done before but everything at the same time is sooo original the sets and fashion styling is extraordinary and just stunning the acting fantastic and dialog seamlessly witty and lastly i simply love the music only murders in the building is a fun and gorgeous ride,POSITIVE,Comedy

3216,10.0,4 December 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",omitb is a show that is well thought out in my opinion but doesnt take itself too seriously i like the characters very much they each have that thing in common that connects them and no its not just the podcasts their chemistry is funny touching and dare i say homey i like it that it dables into the mysteries of the characters lives too but also doesnt lose focus on the main mystery the murder some reviews might say its too short which i disagree its perfect this way imo just as short as a podcast and it makes u crave more and more without dragging it out for an hour i cant wait for the next season thats all im gonna say,POSITIVE,Comedy
3217,10.0,2 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i just watch three episodes and i can say i like it as you know it contains comedy this show is like the movie called pink panther if you like pink panther you should watch this if you like detective show like sherlock you shouldnt watch this overall its a fun show to watch it will entertain you in someway,POSITIVE,Comedy
3218,10.0,21 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",cant we have one show that doesnt gratuitously interject wokism and so many interject it in the second season we need trigger warnings if youre going to continue to do this enough already too bad because i was enjoying this otherwise innocent whodunnit series,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3219,10.0,1 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",being a big fan of selena i started watching this show i didnt had much expectations from it but to my surprise it turned out to be awesome the humor in many places justify the that this is not an ordinary crime drama in some places the show gets too serious in some places to which the humor lite the seriousness so it kind of neutralizes the show and balances both the sides which is great to be honest a the story plot is also kind of new which i havent seen in the past crime dramas the best thing about the show is the trio of mabel charles and oliver these characters are so well written that makes the show more enjoyable,POSITIVE,Comedy
3220,10.0,26 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",its a crime story its a comedy its a thriller it just awesome all the characters are played extremely well and the tree main characters are just awesome,POSITIVE,Comedy
3221,6.0,14 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",an old feel to a new show classically scripted heaped in mystery and fun these types of shows are no longer made which is the biggest tragedy the best thing ive seen in ages,POSITIVE,Comedy
3222,3.0,2 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",binged the first episodes last night and i am so excited for more of this show they successfully poke fun at true crime nuts police procedural dramas and of course new yorkers the clues are interwoven a la agatha christie and alfred hitchcock but the playful tone keeps the horror at bay shaping up to be a fun whodunnit my only beef they missed a chance to enhance the narrative in the opening credits it shows a view of our protagonists through the building windows each performing tasks specific to them but they are in the wrong apartments if a show is to take place in apartment hallways and elevators with little to distinguish where we are in the space it could get confusing during the st elevator scene i was literally thinkingok per the credits shes in the penthouse martin short is in the middle and steve martin is on the lowest flooronly to find out im totally wrong they do a fabulous job of making the apartment interiors very distinctive which is such a blessing its a nitpick i know but now episodes in i still dont know where everyone is its also a distinction that may prove important later if say one person passes a shady character on the stairs during a fire drill but the others dont because they are on lower floors,POSITIVE,Comedy
3223,10.0,5 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",well let me start off by saying that the show has potential to be a great the story is intriguing and cheesy in a good way but the acting is pretty bad especially from selena gomez her monotone character makes me not feel or root for her steve martin and martin short both do a decent job but i have to note that martin short is carrying the show besides the acting the show is filled with weird camera shots not sure if its meant to make the viewer feel uncomfortable but i can assure you that i dont like it for instance there was a scene where steve martins character was talking and selena gomez was standing in the background looking very awkwardly now that the bad stuff is out of the way lets talk about the good stuff first lets talk about the story its a classic whos done it which you can never go bad with if you add selena gomezs little secret to this it provides the show the tools to make it great in addition i have to say that i love the wardrobe of the characters and how effortlessly they made a simple scenes look beautiful in conclusion the show may seam decent but there is something that makes me want to click that watch the next episode button cant wait to watch the next episode and see in which direction they drive the show,POSITIVE,Comedy
3224,10.0,23 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",great story smart fun great actors martin kick ass all series are good and interesting very good characters and story great story smart fun great actors martin kick ass all series are good and interesting very good characters and story,POSITIVE,Comedy
3225,10.0,16 October 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this show is an excellent effort at updating the whodunit genre with modern sensibilities story telling and settings but serena gomez is awful and every time shes on screen she manages to completely take you out of the story her delivery is monotone and wooden her face doesnt move due to a lot of botox and most of the time she sounds half asleep imagine lana del ray acting and this is what you get seriously she is absolutely awful and it really brings the show down martin short is brilliant at being martin short and he really manages to save this steve martins character could be played by just about anyone but he still does a decent job the plot is nothing too amazing its just nice and engaging and worth a watch if you can get over the dead eyed frozen faced half asleep nihilistic hipster delivery of gomez,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3226,10.0,14 September 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",st season was great funny terrific acting just a real joy pleasure to watch nd season good but not quite what the st season offered rd season except for a number of the same familiar faces no more resembles the nd season much less the st than a hotdog in the bun resembles beef wellington what is the horrid thing that is being passed off as only murders in the building the acting is stilted there is zero feeding off of the cast between each of them its as if people were brought in off the street and told to read off of teleprompters whoever wrote season please bring them back,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3227,10.0,27 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",two screen legends doing what they do best for decades in an atmospheric and artistic show selena gomez is equally exceptional i think season will be even more marvelous my most favorite episodes are and dont expect something of a low quality this show is like a gourmet fine wine not everyone is meant to recognize that sit back and savour it,POSITIVE,Comedy
3228,10.0,6 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",its undeniable that this show came out beyond my expectations all the cast members are performing really well and the script and dialogue are flawless got a chance to finish the whole season and i could confirm that no one will know whos murdered tim kono until the end of the season and i have to say the art direction costume and sound mixing are doing their jobs perfectly fine everything goes to the same direction to serve the story brilliantly another highly recommend show so far,POSITIVE,Comedy
3229,7.0,24 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i love this show this is the best creative writing and production to come along in a long time my only disappointment is the episodes arent long enough but i love watching the episodes more than once to catch some of the details i miss the first time around dont miss this show,POSITIVE,Comedy
3230,8.0,1 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",it is a very good series it has humor it is interesting from the first minutes you can already notice that it is an excellent series the characters are well done you can see that the actors are really good at acting it promises a lot and in its first chapters it does not disappoint just by seeing those chapters you want to see the entire season and look forward to the second season without a doubt it is such a good series that it is worth hiring star just to see only murders in the building recommended,POSITIVE,Comedy
3231,6.0,11 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",great show and great cast including those two blokes and that chick and a few other people,POSITIVE,Comedy
3232,2.0,6 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",as a fan of steve and martin i couldnt wait for this but my expectations were blown away by the writing acting and the great ensemble this show only episodes in is just fun to watch and the story pace keeps you engaged selena gomez is doing a great job keeping up with the incredible talents she gets the privilege of working with,POSITIVE,Comedy
3233,8.0,25 December 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this classy whodunnit turned out to be somewhat of a breakout hit and its not hard to see why buoyed by a magnetic central trio a strong supporting cast and bundles of twists only murders is an absolute hoot to watch there are some real highs here and some genuinely innovative moments but the rampant joy of it all is slightly punctured for me by some of the heavy signposting for many of the twists and some clunky pacing overall though its an impressively dignified and polished project that seems to jump from high to high what will the fourth season bring,POSITIVE,Comedy
3234,10.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",selena gomez is a talented singer beautiful young lady but she isnt a very good actress especially up against titans like martin short and steve martin however this is a very good show with a very good supporting cast so its worth watching,POSITIVE,Comedy
3235,9.0,16 September 2024,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",martin short and steve martin make this show the show is witty and funny it is quite suspenseful with a few curveballs that keep you on edge very well written and superbly produced most of the guest starts are funny and fit perfectly in amy ryan tina fey paul rudd jackie hoffman and in particular jane lynch are perfect examples however some other guest starts like amy schumer meryl streep eva longoria just to name a few are pure duds and pull the show down one thing that is evidently unspoken and the elephant in the room is that selena gomez is boring as hell and to start with she needs to get some basic training in acting,POSITIVE,Comedy
3236,10.0,8 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",its been a while since ive seen steve martin but men its such a good feeling to see him back again funny but with his own unique flair and style and hes still got it martin short was always a bit of the outsider that i kind of liked but learned to appreciate more over time hes just so weird but in this show it really works selena gomes fits the bill as well and then the writing excellent it gives you that vibe of old crime movies but in a very original new coat really a nice addition to the tv show landscape its never really tense but the twists and turns are quite original and just entertaining its just a great feel good with some funny moments without overdoing it and an intriguing story more please,POSITIVE,Comedy
3237,10.0,1 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i dont have a habit of writing reviews it was a treat to watch a beautifully done show fantastic cast it goes without saying that these performers are each fantastic in their own right but even so performances across the board that are are genuine relaxed grounded subtle yet full etc is not a guarantee this is some of the most refined work i have seen these performers do bravo to direction and whatever else in the show environment facilitated this also lovely writing that gently asserts a fresh step into this genre and is a fun addition to it other arts in the show are very strong too sets costumes props editing cinematography sound etc such a pleasure to experience the world that they built and the way they portrayed it on a personal note as a native new yorker who most recently lived on the upper west side and moved to california last year i was grateful to see parts of my hometown and my most recent neighborhood and so affectionately depicted thanks to all who contributed for this lovely art,POSITIVE,Comedy
3238,7.0,2 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i had to subscribe to hulu to see this one and it does not disappoint steve martin martin short and selena gomez are terrific i idolize steve martin and am so glad he is dong this show it makes me happy to watch it which is very important to strive for these days this show has humor with a touch of reality and surprises,POSITIVE,Comedy

3240,7.0,23 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",obviously there are some plot holes however this is an all round really good show super hilarious love the chemistry between the characters the use of generational jokes would recommend,POSITIVE,Comedy
3241,1.0,16 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this series is so good steve martin martin short and selena gomez are a great team the acting is superb the whole production is brilliant a must watch,POSITIVE,Comedy
3242,10.0,23 October 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",ok im not going to sit here and lie to you that i didnt just binge both seasons in one weekend like im some cromedy crackhead because i totally did this was just the right balance of predictable and unpredictable the stories in both seasons were excellent the cinematography superb the acting ok hold up who in their right mind decided to cast selena gomez in this are you guys serious is that part of the joke dont get me wrong i love selena as a person but the girl has literally one facial expression and her voice does not change pitch throughout all episodes she just cant act and thats a fact no im not a hater i think she got the job done but she wasnt a joy to watch the way that it was with the older gentlemen who were such a pleasure to watch on the screen selena was simply blah couldnt care less for her and that made me also not care about her character either anyway go check it out with or without selena its still worth the watch,POSITIVE,Comedy
3243,8.0,2 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",as a true crime podcast listener this is so fun i love seeing martin short and steve martin together again and adding selena to the mix perfection i cant wait for the next episode,POSITIVE,Comedy
3244,10.0,25 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this show could have been great if only selena gomez had not been in it her delivery is very flat perhaps the producers should have considered a different female lead oh wait gomez is credited with an executive producer credit,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3245,10.0,8 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the writing is just terrible and makes everything seem like a rick and morty dialouge but still trying to keep it serious the podcast theme just makes it less funny and whenever theres a single bit of interesting fact that you want to know about short comes and shoves the microphone in everyones face cant watch it with this terrible writing that tries to shove a joke everywhere even with the cliff hangers at the end of each episode its still a bore,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3246,10.0,22 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",only started watching it because im a big fan of steve martin martin short and of course selena i normally dont get into tv series my only but is the language its gets way out of control at moments wish this show was family friendly,POSITIVE,Comedy
3247,6.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",placing selma gomez sandwiched between two of funniest men in entertainment is genius martian and short bring a sense of comedy to the show that is often missing in modern sitcoms bravo hulu and the remarkable case,POSITIVE,Comedy
3248,10.0,21 December 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i honestly watched the first episode and thought what a load of crp im now on episode and so investedabsolutely fantastic show in fact one of my favourite series of looking forward to season so so much,POSITIVE,Comedy
3249,6.0,14 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this show is charming and so much fun truly a joy to watch short and martin keep getting better and better with every episode and while i have heard some complaints about gomezs monotone voice thats just what she sounds like with that aside shes also really good in this this show is different and fresh and the setting is so engaging,POSITIVE,Comedy
3250,1.0,4 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i must confess that despite being a huge selena fan i tried to keep my expectations for the series not too high because i didnt really know what to expect from the show i had no idea how it was going to play out as i never had seen one like that before but i admit that this strategy did not work very well i was very looking forward to the premiere seeing her acting again in a series and still alongside two legends was reason enough to hold my attention assiduous viewer of wizards since childhood i already knew his gigantic talent for acting for those who dont know it search for lisas giving birth scene in indubious battle on youtube breathtaking but despite not being surprised with the phenomenal work she does as mabel the character itself is a much bigger piece than i expected and i didnt expect anything but perfection oliver charles and mabel are a trio who dont trust each other very much but its been fun to see that dynamic unfold in the first three episodes they are very different characters but for some reason they work very well even when they go wrong mabel mora is not only the most intriguing piece on the show she really is the lifeblood of the show not only because shes connected to the case but because her personality is so interesting mysterious and above all relentless nothing escapes her gaze she always has an easy answer for everything making a meticulous and extremely surprising analysis seem obvious and inherent to her person maybe because of the personal curiosity she carries about tim i dare say that in a line that is very similar to sherlock holmes charles is lonely downtoearth methodical and clearly having trouble relating and bonding with others probably because of his anxiety preventing him from being open to new things or clinging to other people and then losing them its what makes your forays into getting close to mabel so interesting oliver is a born creative and dreamer who goes to great lengths to fulfill his desires or please others hes the opposite of charles and maybe thats why hes the part that completes him and makes them the smartest and most curious pair of grayhaired men in new york city the series balances the trio in a very insightful way separating them into different pairs each episode without us even realizing it the dynamics between the information that the characters discover and that we viewers manage to perceive hidden in the scenes was composed in a phenomenal way so that every time i watch an episode i come across things that i hadnt noticed at the previous time only murders in the building is a mysterious funny calculating intriguing and completely addictive series when we stick to the details it is not a show to be watched without your attention being on it at the same time it is a light work which amuses and distracts us in a delicious and extremely fun way tim kono may be the victim the characters lean on to understand his death but the protagonists stories become another mystery to be discovered by the audience and mabel without any doubt is the character the audience is most curious to be unraveled i strongly recommend it,POSITIVE,Comedy
3251,10.0,22 December 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",overall pretty good not great the biggest drawback in my opinion is selena gomez and her monotone voice reminds me of kirsten dunst in spiderman,POSITIVE,Comedy
3252,10.0,4 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",selena gomez martin short and steve martin did an excellent job its a complete mixture of comedy and suspense it really got me to think about what could their secrets be,POSITIVE,Comedy
3253,10.0,15 January 2024,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the first season was very good but the writing began to suffer in the second season although the tell is my favorite of all episodes the final episode of the second season was a total flop im surprised the writing was so bad they attempted to have twist after twist which ended up confusing and more importantly uninteresting i started watching the third episode but with the mixing in of all the new characters i lost interest sadly selena gomez has very little acting ability and spends most of the time appearing like she has some form of affective disorder with her blank delivery and deadpan look i know they can do better and i hope they do so many series start out great with the writers failing to top their first season all creatures great and small has suffered the same fate,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3254,9.0,3 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",putting selena gomez in the cast was the worst choice they made as an actress she is a great singer in other words disgusting terrible horrible she cant get a sentence right without looking like a drugged robot,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3255,10.0,20 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i thought it was great all ereformances were awesome selena gomez acting with seasoned actors really brings her game up i thought she did great in the dead dont die she had some really funny lines the aestetics were incredible the sets and clothing was amazing the mystery was solid it would be fun if it was a little more agatha christie style overall i recommend this to several people i hope others can enjoy it as much as i did thanks for the hard work everyone who made this happen,POSITIVE,Comedy
3256,10.0,1 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i love their chemistry inside and outside the set i think theyre great actors i love the way how steve selena martin portrayed the friendship between two old pals and a young woman,POSITIVE,Comedy

3258,10.0,4 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",so funny martin short is absolutely hysterical steve martin charmingly subtly funny the straight man adding to the overall humor selena gomez so far keeping up as the straight straight woman in this comedy trio loving it cant wait to finish the series pure enjoyment and entertainment,POSITIVE,Comedy
3259,6.0,24 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",some shows are just better then they have the right to be this is one of them a funny and entertaining whodunit the characters pacing and a surprisingly great performance by selena gomez all come together to make this one of the best new shows in a long time the mysteries are engaging funny heartwarming and sad all at the same time the three unlikely wannabe podcasters placed against the backdrop of nyc is a delight i cant wait for season three,POSITIVE,Comedy
3260,4.0,2 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",all the people saying this isnt a star show are wrong its amazing im already hooked episodes in and i cant wait for whats to come with oliver charles mabel and the murders in the building,POSITIVE,Comedy
3261,10.0,24 September 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",loved the first series of this show it was great combination of mystery dark humour and a bit of slapstick steve martin and martin short make a great duo selena gomez is okay she holds her own next to two seasoned pros i liked the idea of three random people who live in the same apartment building realising theyre all into the same murder mystery podcast and then suddenly finding themselves roped into a situation that inspires them to put their detective hats on and start their very own murder mystery podcast it was something different i really enjoyed watching the mystery unravel and getting a few good laughs in the process the second series was okay but i didnt enjoy it as much i just wasnt as into the mystery of the second series compared to the first it wasnt as polished as the first one was ill give series three a shot when it comes but im hoping the mystery will be more enticing and also that the comedy elements come back stronger i didnt laugh anywhere near as much during the second series,POSITIVE,Comedy
3262,10.0,19 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",just finished the first season and i have to say i love this show first of all im a big fan of steve martins writing from his books to his stage plays hes got a certain je ne sais quoi where his writing and humor are concerned this is right up there with roxane and la story that brilliant quirky humor of his and this show has his comedic finger prints all over it thats not to discount martin shorts contributions these two work very well together ive seen several of their live performances and im never let down this show broke new ground in a world where entertainment is so flooded with all the same stuff done over and over and over until its all so stale this show is a bright spot in an otherwise dull television landscape i cannot wait for season two in the mean time ill have to watch this show again,POSITIVE,Comedy
3263,10.0,21 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",its pretty good but for this selena gomez person i dont understand her appeal shes kind of average for her acting skills i guess not good looking not a good body a very unattractive voice i dont care about these things as much as hollywood does i care almost entirely about acting skill i get the weird feeling that one of her relatives sponsored this show the writing isnt bad its okay but nothing special,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3264,10.0,9 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",brutal show two great comedians deserve better than this id never heard of selena gomez before and she is just awful constant sulky face and monotone voice who thought to cast her in a comedy i watched four episodes and realized i couldnt care less about what happened,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3265,10.0,27 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",steve martin and martin short have graced us with their astonishing selves again selena you are doing fabulous darling keep it coming my family and i finally have something to look forward on tuesdays,POSITIVE,Comedy

3267,7.0,12 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",after the first episode i was hooked love the dynamic between the leads it works perfectly if you love a good crime caper i highly recommend this martin short and gomez are fantastic,POSITIVE,Comedy
3268,2.0,27 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i watched it just because short martin were in it but it really is an enjoyable show its a good murder mystery but also funny the language is too much and often not needed but thats the only thing wrong with it,POSITIVE,Comedy
3269,10.0,8 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",what a letdown after all the hype my expectations were so high but it just doesnt work steve martin is so not on im sure it is but he doesnt have characters who he can really engage with its just not funny,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3270,10.0,27 November 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i like that this show has three leads and none of them are meant to be a sex symbol it is a fun nongory whodunnit a modern agatha christie so many great character actors add to the experience that said selena gomezs voice is jarring and immediately takes me right out of the story when she speaks im not sure if the monotone adenoidal robotic vocal fry is her natural voice or just her portrayal of a quirky character but it is skincrawling nails on a chalkboard to me make it stop it isnt quirky it is annoying im fairly certain the character isnt meant to be annoying in a nonquirky way,POSITIVE,Comedy
3271,10.0,10 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",every shot feels unimportant selinas mabel is absolutely uninteresting i couldnt make it through the first episode sorry guys,NEGATIVE,Comedy

3274,6.0,27 December 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i kept seeing ads for this and thought and again and again selena gomeznahhh and again steve martin anything interesting since i cant even remember last martin short hmmmm same feelings finally watched it and the next episode and the next amazing very short episodes very amazing fun fun twists gomezs acting is better than i remember from that ethan hawke getaway movie years back still not great but doesnt matter because everyone else is and her performance is fine enough to be there quietly in ways among the rest steve martin does not age wow maybe cause he always had white hair but he looks great,POSITIVE,Comedy
3275,10.0,19 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",refreshing funny and gripping true crime has to be one of the most used themes for tv shows this show has done what many shows in the future will do truecrime podcast loving neighbours take on a case of a murder inside their building the arconia the trio is unexpected but just work the atmosphere and the music set up for the show is truly something else simply cannot take off a star for any reason whatsoever if there is anything i could critique i would have asked for more content in ep thats about it a mustwatch for anyone who loves a detective story,POSITIVE,Comedy
3276,7.0,24 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this satisfies sides of you crime suspense and intrigue and then the part that just wants to laugh and feel good best show ive watched in a long time easy,POSITIVE,Comedy
3277,1.0,19 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the main actors have an amazing chemistry selena gomez unexpectedly stole the series by her brilliant performance steve martin and martin short killed it with their light hearted old comedy which combined very well with selena for everyone who likes murdercomedy series this is the series for you the ending was pretty good and leaves you on the edge of your seat cant wait for season,POSITIVE,Comedy
3278,10.0,17 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",season was as fresh as they come great comedic chemistry tongueincheek fun and a budding new star in selena gomez to keep company to messrs short and martin season unfortunately is quite the clunker the chemistry is gone selenas act turns stale and while visuals and score are as good as ever the writing has turned putrid unfortunately we are invested and are therefore committed to finish watching this mess,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3279,9.0,14 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i really loved this show the feel of the show took me back to growing up in the s listening to radio whodunnits fun quirky silly playful not always pc beautiful music that was arranged perfectly the writing the sets the acting the story the journey were all well done and i was happy to see steve martin again in this great show people seem to love it or hate it and i was one that loved it for so many reasons it didnt take itself too seriously and thats what i prefer to spend my time watching,POSITIVE,Comedy
3280,9.0,23 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this show has some funny moments but i think it is a bit overhyped the story is very generic something we have seen done a lot of times dont get me wrong martin and short are good but i dont think its anything career changing i enjoyed their clash and characters more in father of the bride also as much as i adore selena she cant act i understand that her character is the more serious one and has a dry humor but it comes off as though she is trying to sound monotone i would like to see another actor in this role someone who has a bit more chops,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3281,9.0,3 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i was looking forward to watch a what should have been great show but seriously its a complete waste of time i dont even understand who would authorize this show to be played on disney selena acts and looks like a dead cat the story makes no sense at all and in short sorry for the spoiler the show is about taking the elevator up and down so for me its just a if you compare it to major shows like got walking dead breaking bad come on guys,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3282,10.0,10 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",each episodes wants you to yearn for the next i think thats the definition that its working and having the mystery vibe its like you want to share with them the journey of the mystery and gets so exited for thw next episode,POSITIVE,Comedy
3283,8.0,20 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this series is the most fun ive had watching tv in a long time ive just finished the first season and cant wait to watch the second its so quirky and different to any other show and the characters are written and performed so well if you like crime shows but also like something a bit lighter this is perfect a good murder mystery a great friendship and beautiful new york scenery what more could you want,POSITIVE,Comedy
3284,7.0,5 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the series has a very powerful crime story that the different parts and puzzles of it are well matched and the viewer enjoys following it what is very brilliant in the film is the very good acting of the actors who are good at both the drama part and the comedy part and they make the viewer laugh in a big way the lovely characters of the series which is due to the powerful script and good characterization of the series the more the viewer communicates with the characters of the story in general the series is both a powerful crime and a happy and funny comedy that completely satisfies the viewer and puts the viewer waiting for the second season with its enigmatic end,POSITIVE,Comedy
3285,10.0,30 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",im im not a selena gomez fan my review is real not fakei absolutely adore martin short steve martin and this show is clever funny lighthearted entertaining just what we need during these weird times i dont mind selena she does a decent job as mabel its not difficult to shine when two of the funniest men alive are your costars i love olivers old hollywood glamour apartment that he cant afford along with the social awkwardness of charles throw a young girl with no friends into the mix add a murder and youre set great theme tune too just a wonderful show,POSITIVE,Comedy
3286,6.0,9 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",brilliant story combining the grumpy old men with the eccentric old playwright reuniting steve martin george martin short franck in their respect for true crime fresh and sarcastic intriguing selena gomez alex wizards to bring different sides to this amazing comedy i cant wait for season,POSITIVE,Comedy
3287,9.0,24 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",martin short and nathan lane are masters of their craft as are the guest stars like sting jane lynch tina fey shirley maclaine steve martins a bit too mellow for me in this his zany physical comedy is so great i wish there was more of it but selena is just a terrible actress her words barely come out of her mouth and are so monotone every scene she is in i find her annoying and its distracting with the right casting of the female lead this show would have been a,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3288,10.0,6 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this show does a great job of balancing comfy drama and mystery the finale has such a great cliffhanger i cant wait to see what happens next the amount of guest stars and foreshadowing is something that cant be replaced cant say this enough i cant wait for the next season,POSITIVE,Comedy
3289,8.0,16 December 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",selena should be called pinocchio because she seems to be made of wood except that her face is some kind of turgid soft sculpture involving botox and facial fillers not that there is anything wrong with tweaks to ones face its justshe just doesnt belong on television i think she would make a good dentist or dental assistant but actor no i can just imagine the hilarious late night discussion between martin and steve where the two argue to each other against their better judgement that the need her because of her name recognition and because she adds a youth factor i guess no actresses found the project interesting or none with the name recognition of sg even she was probably about to walk out of negotiations until they promised her a producer credit i was shocked at how much i enjoyed steve martin and la short kudos guys,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3290,9.0,19 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i feel bad for martin short and steve martin mostly because they are paired with selena gomez who is a terrible actress i dont understand how her team didnt step in and get immediate help after a table read steve and martin are absolute pros and carry the show selena is monotone and uses the fbomb throughout the show in really weird instances and out of context im guessing to show that she is a mature actor and not a disney kid overall terrible just terrible,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3291,10.0,4 October 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this is such a delightful show it actually makes me feel good after having watched it it is so good seeing steve martin and martin short together in a wellwritten funny and always engaging show selena gomez is great as well not to mention all of the wonderful cameos and guest appearances by some pretty famous celebrities like mel brooks matthew broderick sting amy schumer nathan lane paul rudd and even meryl streep there is a reason why these celebrities sign up for the show it is all due to the writing i like how they give back stories for the residents of the building some of the eccentric characters are very well developed and their behavior makes sense given their backstories this is just a good oldfashioned type of show and i have found myself laughing out loud on several occasions the dialogue is spot on and i hope to have many more seasons of this show i didnt know if i would like it at first after watching the first episode but i really got into it and now it is kind of addictive and i cant wait for the next season it definitely is deserving of all of the emmy nominations it has received i hope it wins something for acting with the main characters oh and i really love the opening theme song as well,POSITIVE,Comedy
3292,9.0,2 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",never saw a steve martin project that was bad and this proves it plus i gotta crush on selena,POSITIVE,Comedy
3293,6.0,18 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",selenas voice wasnt bothering me early on but now by episode its really grinding by bloody gears she is supposed to be some sort of singer isnt she if so why does she talk out of her nose for chrissake maybe the script is partly to blame at this point it seems to have her doing a lot of navelgazing wallowing in selfpity but still its bloody annoying at the moment i may have to turn audio off and subtitles on to get through this if she keeps talking through her nose,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3294,10.0,2 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this a great show to watch twists and turns thru out not much of a fan of martin but getting to like him selena is playing her role as a girl who lost nearly everything dear to her and slowly coming back to life in the same building she lost everything i bet a few will agree amy schumer needs to go she is not funny cannot act,POSITIVE,Comedy
3295,6.0,6 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",wow the most best movies of our legendary hero only murder in the building is epic thrilling and quite suspenseful but mostly entertaining if watch with families on christmas eve,POSITIVE,Comedy
3296,2.0,24 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",a finale is all you look up but when it comes to second season we always have the expectations that can it be as good as its previous seasons sometimes somethings come and made you believe that it will be getting better than her pervious season that is only murders in the building,POSITIVE,Comedy
3297,9.0,15 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",but the acting is meh selena gomez might just be the worst actor ive ever seenim sorry,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3298,10.0,13 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",character development unfolds as a function of the protagonists relationship to a murder the singular goal of the story is told piecemeal within a contemporary yet nostalgic nostalgic new york city setting that makes you want a trip reaaal baaad this show is off the hook,POSITIVE,Comedy
3299,9.0,19 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",its a decent show the beginning is interesting but towards the end it starts to get frustrating because of logical errors and just being unbelievable acting is good except for selena gomez who clearly does not know how to act at all i simply dont get why was she cast in this ill probably at least try to watch the second season once it gets done but i fear its gonna be disappointment,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3300,10.0,29 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",first i thought maybe year olds but then there is so much swearing and crude sex comments i got an sti sing so then i thought maybe adult but its so hoky broadway musical bits are boring and nonsensical bugs bunny is really a terrible addition to the script could have had potential after episode but went off the cliff i love selena but she is so monotone it is distracting like another commenter stated overall plot ends up boring and predictable skip it,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3301,10.0,23 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",you could never get enough of steve martin and martin short with a touch of selena gomez this show is brilliant such an original idea in an original concept im only minutes into the first episode and im hooked i knew i would be this is the stuff at hollywood is missing,POSITIVE,Comedy
3302,10.0,6 December 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",dont take it seriously it was fun to watch the series was well writtenhoping for a second series steve martin and martin short best buddies in real life who have worked together many times were as always fun selena gomez was good too her dry humour matched the guys comedic wit and the cameos were unexpected and funny,POSITIVE,Comedy
3303,6.0,28 December 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",first of all selena gomez looks so amazing in the show it was like watching alex russos updated version with the same humour and sarcasm the first episode makes you think if its worth your time or not but then you kind of get addicted with the unfolding murder mystery and comic timing of martin short and steve martin giving one more star for the background music making it a great show waiting for the next season,POSITIVE,Comedy
3304,10.0,25 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",wasnt sure if this was for me im so glad i gave it a watch its phenomenal you wouldnt immediately think of steve martin selena gomez would go together but it works im loving all the untold backstories especially selenas the title is only murders in the building so im hoping there will be more seasons,POSITIVE,Comedy
3305,6.0,1 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i love this show martin short and gomez are an unlikely pair but share one thing in common their love for true crime podcasts they get together over a real murder in their building and try to solve the case its not completely different but the execution definitely is i was hooked and rooting for them i am really looking forward to seeing whats next,POSITIVE,Comedy
3306,1.0,31 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",only finished episodes and this is one of my all time great shows there are few pure mysterycomedy shows on tv if you liked knives out you will very much like this classic whodunnit with satirical elements the characters are also extremely likeable selena gomez is also a standout in her breakout role and very attractive,POSITIVE,Comedy
3307,10.0,2 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i love martin and short but the reviewers giving this a need to go back and look at what these great comics have done in the past this is not close to their best work it is a solid so i will continue to watch and hope it gets better,POSITIVE,Comedy
3308,10.0,4 December 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",selena gomez grounds the whole cast with her adorable snarkiness in this series teaming her up with steve martin and martin short was pure genius the backdrop of a classic building in ny is charmingly populated with interesting though fleeting supporting actors adding to the true new yorker vibe the original premise of a podcast being made about the events taking place within the show makes this more than just another whodoneit its fun clean and cozy it takes some bold artistic risks in how it tells the tale that i thought paid off giving us a glimpse of the life of others by letting you live it for an episode i cant wait to see what happens next season,POSITIVE,Comedy
3309,10.0,2 December 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",he best part of the show is the press interviews between the odd trio of steve martin martin short and selena gomez unfortunately thats not part of the show itself which is surprisingly mediocre its a shame because martin short and steve martin are generally cantmiss propositions and the idea of three amateur podcasters solving a murder plot involves a healthy degree of serialization so why is this so boring for one the actual murder isnt something thats particularly engaging the idea is that one of the three members gomez of this makeshift sleuthing team was a childhood friend of the murder victim but the show only commits to that angle halfheartedly another problem with the show is that it feels awfully insiderish only murders in the building is set in a pretty insular manhattan world and two of the three characters are aging showbiz archetypes im on record as feeling pretty sated by sitcom characters who are in show business so this isnt drawing me any closer the show tries to mine pathos from martin and shorts characters as two old men looking back on their lives from the perspective of their twilights but there are character arcs are pretty predictable as for reasons to keep watching amy ryan plays a love interest to steve martin and the chemistry is genuinely sweet between these two additionally theres a very high probability that steve martin or amy ryan will do something funny considering thats what theyve been doing for most of their lives,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3310,10.0,16 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the new season feels like they just phoned it in they switched to half hour shows steve martin already said this last acting gig and you can tell he just wanted to get it over with selena gomezs debbie downer attitude makes watching her painful martin shorts carries the show on his shoulders which is the only reason ill each anymore they really had a good thing going but this second season is boring and has a nonsensical plot i literally laughed out loud during season they just couldnt recreate the chemistry between the characters from season,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3311,10.0,24 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this is probably the first quality show that has been oroduced in the last years great show great actors original story line finally a show that isnt woke and doesnt bring politics into the show,POSITIVE,Comedy
3312,10.0,11 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",oh this is my first review like everi loved every second og it the launch score the setting the premise the jokesthe dialoguesthe humour this is great there has to be a second seasoni cant get enough,POSITIVE,Comedy
3313,7.0,24 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",there are no flaws in this show its funny clever original and light every time when there was a new episode i was like a child waiting for his presents on the christmas night,POSITIVE,Comedy
3314,10.0,28 September 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",finally something actually worth watching such an original idea coupled up with a great cast great writing great actor performances great location finally something new and so good you can watch every episode again and again and always find something new you had not noticed before shall we also talk about that great and smart sense of humour the comedy timing the perfect casting the brilliant direction s i just love love love this show favourite character theo my only hope is that there wont be too many seasons cause that usually spoils the goodness of any show but at the same time we all long for more,POSITIVE,Comedy
3315,6.0,12 September 2024,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i was aware of the show but didnt watch it as i thought it wasnt for me im now up to series and absolutely hooked brilliant scripts steve martin and martin shirt are just nuts and selena gomez who i didnt know is hilarious its like an adult scooby doo but with lots of show biz in jokes and sly references when bunny was crying martin short says i didnt know bunny was a wailer bunny and the wailers reference pay attention great fun love the new york location because ive been several times and just love the city strongly recommend for all ages will make great xmas viewing,POSITIVE,Comedy
3316,2.0,24 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",complete entertainment great characters super writing some real laugh out load moments if youre looking for some light entertainment with some laughs then watch this excellent series highly recommended,POSITIVE,Comedy
3317,10.0,6 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this show reminds me of woody allens manhattan murder mystery it would be a perfect if it werent for selena gomez i just dont understand the casting choice everything else is so perfect i cant help but wonder if her dull delivery is what the director was going for she over articulates every word nothing feels spontaneous its like i can hear her repeat her lines in her head before she speaks her character has depth but she is unable to portray them luckily martin and shorts performances are so powerful that they make up for her cringy acting but i am so frustrated as this could have been such an amazing show maybe theres something im missing and she is right on point thats the real mystery for me,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3318,10.0,9 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",a fun exciting series with lots of twists best series ive watched in a while,POSITIVE,Comedy

3322,9.0,19 December 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",she definitely killed the role it was so good her character in nyc the opening lines needed some regard atleast overall it was pleasant cant wait for season or only murderers in the building um some scenes definitely were not that great like the scene of imagination but by the end of the episode their were whirls or twists it was funny actually helped me give up the bingeing habit and made this habit where i should wait for an episode every week,POSITIVE,Comedy

3325,10.0,20 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i dont know what direction theyre headed to add it meryl streep for some weird odd reason she doesnt fit into the series why is she there selena gomez i wish she would pick a path instead of going all over the place this tv show will define destiny of selena gomez legacy why she shouldve stood out of this this series i dont understand what youre trying to do now and the more they add additional cast the worse it gets one of the main regulars in it is no longer in it for some reason please dont mess with success by terribly adding merrill street youre asking for a disaster and it shows why did they mess with success for the first two seasons now its turning into chaotic junk i would have never started watch this mini series the lesbian seen looked out of place all picture perfect clear now see why her gay lover doesnt fix the plot at all so much wondering what they were doing all is clear now it was put in without meaning to the story a nice series but a terrible was to push personal biases why was selena gomez a co producer to start with she have no abilities and it shows it brought down the efforts of the other stars that seems to know more what going on then selena gomez does ty read,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3326,10.0,22 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",selena gomez is terribly miscast i read she is a singer she should stick to what she knows monotone voice and leaden facial expression are her major characteristics no way she belongs here why,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3327,10.0,29 December 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",refreshing different interesting with just the right amount of comedy styled with agatha christie plot twists and with use of some unusual film techniques borrowed from chicago grand budapest hotel it stays fresh short and martin have great chemistry with selena providing a slightly flat but solid third musketeer it works so well great overall casts with a few well known cameos with a number of newer actors as well we totally enjoyed the episodes and often watched several in one evening so good its was hard not to binge watch and we finished the first season in a week loved every minute of it,POSITIVE,Comedy
3328,9.0,21 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the crime thriller fans need a little patience with this series because the real tension only builds up after a few episodes but the series is definitely not real crime entertainment because it is more or less comedy what their two male protagonists play out excellently well worth seeing especially for tough fans of steve martin and martin short,POSITIVE,Comedy
3329,10.0,3 October 2024,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",season great funny interesting engaging season pretty good not quite as funny but still interesting and engaging season meh okay i love short and martin could do without gomez the writing is getting a bit repetitive and predictable and stretching due to so many victims being killed in the same building season really a drag not funny not very interesting stretching to find something new with new characters that are more ridiculous than interesting its just grasping for ideas after seasons although ive been watching season its no longer a show which i eagerly await a new episode its become one of those when theres nothing else to watch shows without spoilers season has one huge logic fault as well the motive is speculated to be due to season of their podcast but the podcast only started due to the murder so uhm a preemptive motive chicken or the egg forgetful writers or writers hoping viewers are forgetful stretching to make a th season work so much great talent in season four and someone forgot to actually review the plot,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3330,10.0,16 December 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",what more do you need than steve martin and martin short in a comedic murder mystery genre film selena gomez holds her own but i am purely watching for the interaction and dialogue between these two amazing actors that i have grown up with and loved the cliff hangers are great and the cinematography is wonderful its fun and playful and i even came on here to see what others had said hoping no one slated it because there is absolutely no reason to i have only watched season and i couldnt stop watching im hoping season will be as good but tbh i am happy to have found this gem of a series enjoy,POSITIVE,Comedy
3331,7.0,25 January 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",im usually not a crime series person but the storymusic and general atmosphere of the series makes you just want sit back get cozy grab hot coco and enjoy your self honestly this series is one of the biggest hidden gems,POSITIVE,Comedy
3332,10.0,9 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",finally got around to watching hulus only murders in the building and i must say the series was well done with acting chemistry and well written with sharp wit and one liners set in manhattan at an upscale apartment building after a murder occurs three strangers in the unit charlessteve martin an ex tv star olivermartin short a stage director and mabelselena gomez a young pretty twenty something meet up and start their own podcast while they investigate and look for clues it like a classic who did it the suspense it brings with drama as each episode has character twist no one is whom the seem overall excellent work from excellent actors in short martin and gomez a must watch series if you like comedy and dramedy that blends with real like suspense feel thats an ongoing twisty like mystery,POSITIVE,Comedy

3334,5.0,27 September 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this series has a great atmosphere which is created by the interaction between the main characters the setting crazy plots and really interesting personalities huge talents who really give something to their audience there is such and undeniabel charm humor and sophistication that i simply cant wait to see the next episode the main characters become people you feel you know and they are joined by a cast of incredible talented people who all contribute to that particular vibe of the show difficult to compare it to anything else but the vibe i am geeting is akin to grand budapest hotel and similar movies and series with a strong narration and quirkiness love it,POSITIVE,Comedy
3335,10.0,7 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",just such a fun witty old school vibe show with great actors steve martin and selena are fantastic with cool scenery ny the apt building etc love the opening theme and song just all around fun my husband and i had to not binge so we can savor the episodes cant wait until the next season,POSITIVE,Comedy
3336,9.0,2 October 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",first off we really like the show great premise great writing great guest stars steve martin and martin short as always are superior comedic actors but even they are clearly struggling to continue dragging the dead eyed animatronic that is selena gomez holy crap she is not only terrible at attempting to act shes hard to look at shes sucking all the oxygen out of the room through the tv she makes kristen stewart look animated id rather see a muppet in her spot at least their faces show expression anyway im going to close this by saying we just cant watch the show anymore as long as the third person is a corpse,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3337,9.0,17 December 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",season i stumbled onto this series and im so glad that i did its incredibly funny and there is some extremely creative stuff going on here very good cast i like steve martin but martin short is just a gas here and is a blast to watch ive never seen selena gomez in action and shes doing a far better job than i expected shes a great straight woman here playing off the two old codgers weirdness support cast is also very good i enjoyed season start to finish its very different and i like it season i just finished watching the season and i have to say that the first half of season has too much nonsensical fill material it meanders a bit and the smart humor of season wasnt as good but the second half of the season was excellent much to my relief i have to say that the acting in this series is absolutely spectacular now it will be a long wait for season but im thoroughly looking forward to it update i just finished the last episode of season the entire season was a massive disappointment the best thing about it was the last seconds of episode acting was fine as expected but the writing was absolutely terrible i read that it has been renewed for a th season lets hope that the writers get back to what worked during the first two seasons then i can hopefully come back and give it a higher star rating,POSITIVE,Comedy
3338,10.0,8 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i dont think ive ever written a review for imdb i watch just about everything and can usually find the good in any show or movie but these star reviews are obviously false and its upsetting because i use imdb reviews and ratings to pick new things to watch this show is only okay i find the characters rather awkward and uncomfortable with each other the story isnt that intriguing i hope imdb can fix these ratings,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3339,9.0,8 March 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this show is great on details in pictures and propping first of all it is hilarious has good twists and merges multiple generations of viewers with the cast which is pretty genius by having selena gomez sidekick steve martin and martin short belittleing them in rando speech of her generation at times and telling them not to go on tiktok some jokes are a bit obvious standing next to sting in an elevator what song comes up but overall the journey the three of them take to pursue a murderer manage their podcast and come to terms with their individual lives is just a joy to watch it has inklings of woody allen maybe it is just neurotic new york in the storytelling and it summarizes a feeling of a generation growing up with few tv shows thus remembering those heroes along with living next to young people and trying to stay put with them in language which can be learnt and behavior which as we see does not differ much it is a triumph to and over ancient morals and functions as the parentheses to exactly that gap many fear in modernism vs preservinggoodoldays,POSITIVE,Comedy
3340,7.0,21 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",so excited to see the next instalment each week very confused about the selena gomez choice though,POSITIVE,Comedy
3341,9.0,27 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i can not wait each episode the story keeps you laughing interested and all while your waiting for the next episode this is wtf entertainment is supposed to be,POSITIVE,Comedy
3342,3.0,1 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this show is a breath of fresh air and i laugh out loud every episode i never review shows but im reviewing this because i want people to watch it its so funny and engaging thank you hulu,POSITIVE,Comedy
3343,9.0,28 December 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",after so much wait finally we have something fresh and binding in only murders in the building its all other things than boring sometimes not so unpredicatable but still enjoyable brazzos and ollie are the life of the show mabel gomez too did justice to the character of an aloof arrogant girl i really liked the ending of every episode those literally begged you to click on next episode button a rare comic murder mystery done fantastically well,POSITIVE,Comedy
3344,10.0,7 October 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",only murders is in exercise in frustration there are so many aspects of it that should produce really outstanding content and yetits watchable im still watching seasons laterbut this show is like an engine with a timing problem its never quite maximizing itself the first and biggest problem is the writing the murder mysteries generally arent that well done you as the viewer are not presented the information you need to play along and try to figure the mystery out for yourself which is part of the fun of mysteries especially multiepisode mysteries where you have time to speculate and talk with friends critical information is withheld until the final episode the second problem is the comedy for a show with steve martin and martin short as regulars and with guests like tina fey and paul rudd youd expect the comedy to take a front seatbut it really doesnt the comedy is pretty tame in terms of how funny it is yet the characters often are very over the top lets talk acting you will see both spectacularly good acting and spectacularly bad acting on this showsometimes in the same damn scene the worst offender is selena gomez this was my first exposure to her and my godshes terrible this woman cannot act not even a little she drags down every scene she is shes often given the wittiest linesand her timing is dreadful and the jokes dont land its honestly painful to watch steve martin is solid throughout but seldom spectacular martin short starts out very schticky playing an over the top broadway producer and i found him repellent but the good news is that he tones it down over time and as he does a surprisingly good actor emerges from that short plays so many of his character loud and big that i was surprised to get quality acting from him the guest stars are hit and miss nathan lane and meryl streep were the best by far streep is streep lane has never been a favorite of mine like short everything ive seen him do he played so big but this was excellent but some of the others i thought were pretty forgettable tina fey was solid in her role but nothing memorable paul rudd was supposed to be annoying as the victim in season and he was annoying but not in a way that was fun or interesting matthew broderick shows up for seconds to play a bizarro version of himself that was basically one gagand not particularly well executed now one of the things the show does really well is red herrings every season is just a shotgun of red herrings that feel like almost every side character has motive means and opportunity but after a season or two of seeing that the show is really going to withhold critical information until the end it actually becomes quite easy to eliminate suspects anytime they actually seem to have strong motives this wasnt as bad with season the best mystery but it very much was with seasons and and is something i wish the show would avoid in future seasons i really hope they start playing fair and presenting the audience with the information they need to solve the mystery and form reasonable hypotheses im sure its not possible to replace selena gomez at this pointbut man nothing would improve this show more than deemphasizing or flat out recasting that character shes really dragging the show down martin and martin bring so much energy to their scenes and then her line arrives and its just recited in the lowest energy way possible i could get more personality out of an ai bot reading her lines anyway overall a solid showbut uneven as heck,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3345,10.0,20 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this was truly funny and silly i thought it was done well didnt really like selena i think she talks weird but the dynamic between the main characters was great i laughed alot the sting thing was hilarious,POSITIVE,Comedy
3346,10.0,11 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this series is superb the locations the building the decorations are impeccable martin short and steve martin are veteran actors i am just having euphoria as i am watching them they are just delivering the outstanding performance that they delivered for decades supporting actors are all veteran theatre actors they are just delivering a craft as well just masters of their work but why on earth selena gomez whose idea was it to select her for this role a robotic fridge would deliver the same cold inhuman performance as well i would vote it if it was not selena gomez in that role she is such a performance killer she is so poisonous she is just killing every scene she is in such a terrible performance,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3347,10.0,15 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",steve martin and martin short were amazing to watch but selenas performance left a bit a bit too stilted overall plot was good but some of the actors came off wrong,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3348,8.0,3 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",it seems i am the among the minority of people who think this series really sucks script is tired and old acting of the two guys is over the top and you dont know why gomez is casted in this series you really want to watch a murder mystery in a manhattan apartment watch woody allens manhattan murder mystery i wonder where are the s are coming from its hard to finish even one episode,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3349,6.0,16 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",a very smart funny show great actors and acting where all compliment each other so well you will love the old guys still on their game you will enjoy this way more than youd ever imagine especially if of a certain age range lots of good chuckles from the old days especially in season now that were three seasons in its clear that martin short is the one holding it all together hes the strongest the funniest cutest cast member by far i love all the cameos they work so well in season three that would be meryl streep i wish they would either completely avoid the political advertisement commercials which may be a hulu thing and not an omitb thing or advertise for all sides candidates because the flat out lying joebiden ads are more than i care to deal with when watching such a good show as this one is,POSITIVE,Comedy
3350,10.0,16 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",a real gem a feel good murder mystery done excellently martin short and steve martin are just amazing in it great writing too,POSITIVE,Comedy
3351,7.0,19 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",so ive waited till the end to give my review and belive me it wasnt easy i wanted to after every episode just spoil it but no i waited why beacuse this show is beyond interesting filled with wit humor murder and intelligence unlike any show has presented in a long time steller cast gives seller performances but steve you have truly aged well and not since the ending of planes trains and automobiles have you touched me in a way that says more please cannot wait for the next season for thoes on the fence just do it its a adult show for adults and its down right perfect enjoy yall,POSITIVE,Comedy
3352,5.0,27 August 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",to be totally honest the writers of this show of such thoughtful attention to detail they know their characters voices so well that everything in it works even when i am feeling like some plot point or character quirk might not come together the writers figure out a way to have it work organically steve martin and martin short after all these years still have it martin short seems right at home in this role and provides the most laughs for me personally selena gomez is also killing it throughout the show she represents generation z quite well but also has a wink and nod to some of the funnier aspects i really enjoy the interplay between her and the olds as she calls them well worth your time,POSITIVE,Comedy
3353,8.0,19 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",hell of a show perfect amount of mystery perfect amount of comedy and even perfect length of episodes which i like this series introduced me to the legendary steve martin and martin short also the title sequence and score is just plain awesome,POSITIVE,Comedy
3354,8.0,24 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this was a funny little murder mystery with plenty of red herrings acting was superb and production excellent it is funny that the best joke in series is saved for last well the last episode well done looking forward to the next season,POSITIVE,Comedy
3355,9.0,11 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",first of all this show has amazing production it is really nice to see the vintagelooking building and interestingly decorated new york apartments and basically every shot looks like it was very well thought out secondly steve martin and martin short are pure joy to watch at first short strikes as the most entertaining character an optimistic ageing bohemian director who faced a series of failures but have not lost hope of directing his next big thing and later on steve martins character develops in such a way that allows him to showcase some of his best work playing a neurotic and selfconscious but gentle kind and at times hilariously confident actor at some point he stole the show from short for me since his character is so interesting to watch as for selena gomez she is ok a tellitlikeitis modern girl with not much of a background story lacking personality but that it is screenplayers fault not selenas and here is what the shows problem is the screenplay is not more than out of it is kind of slow paced characters lack motives for some of their actions there are very few background details and because of this you may wonder every now and then how come this is a murder story but i feel no sympathy to the main plot whatsoever and do not even care who the murderer is you surely get involved when short and martin steal the scene but other times the show feels just boring add some bright sparkly dialogue to it maybe i am being obvious but the whole thing would become alive if some woody allenlike kind of conversations were there give the main female character more background story and actual words to speak add some interesting secondary characters to fill the building with life and it would have been a out of currently by episode it still feels empty i would call it only steve martin and martin short in the building because i havent noticed anything else,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3356,10.0,12 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",steve martin is really the only good actor on the show all the other characters have a flat monotone performance and the timing for jokes just seems off i liked the chemistry between the characters but the strange acting was unexpected being that the cast is well known that being said i really enjoy the plot for the show as its a unique take of a whodunnit its all very quickly and at times cartoonish but ive been enjoying the mystery the whole time side note it seems that the reviews are being bombarded with selena fans the star reviews are a bit over the top haha,POSITIVE,Comedy
3357,10.0,5 September 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i loved season sting as himself as a murder suspect steve marty with a gal pal what could be better once well respected somethings director marty and steve actor once famous for a popular police detective show with neighbor young vivacious selma marty decides to do a true crime podcast only murders in the building to revive his career season still loved it a nd murder in the building so excited yes really for season some of it eally misses for me maybe id rather rewatch season steve matry play off each other the situations are funny but than there are one liner gems smart funny the star is bec i loved season and was just disappointing,POSITIVE,Comedy

3369,10.0,9 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",when i saw the ig ad for this i knew i would have to watch this steve martin and martin short have always been some of my favorite comedic actors and the combination of them two along with selena gomez is so adorable i absolutely love the show it is so intriguing and funny i seriously havent laughed out loud this much in a long time besides the language a little too much on the profanity for my taste i am hooked i also love amy ryan she is such a likable actress i was happy to see her role in this as well as tina feys character the show has so many great characters all the building tenants with so many funny scenes its my new favorite and i recommend it i believe this show is a hit,POSITIVE,Comedy
3370,6.0,28 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the writing in this show is incredible not only does it play off the different personalities of the characters but it realistically and comedically captures the forming friendship of neighbours who are essentially strangers but are closer than they know steve martin selena gomez and martin short are brilliant and both bring you to tears and laughter the shorter episode length keeps you on your toes but keeps it refreshing and exciting brilliantly funny who dunnit mystery,POSITIVE,Comedy
3371,5.0,25 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",great combo of comedy and mystery got some really funny laugh out load scenes scrabble game starts off slowly but as the episodes are shortits easy to binge and enjoy although not a huge fan of either comedians i really enjoyed this light hearted show and am looking forward to the next one,POSITIVE,Comedy

3373,10.0,14 September 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",let me tell you something its been a long time since a series or a movie got me so hooked everything seems so done before and so unmemorable the past years omitb is so refreshing interesting plot humour good pace good acting and chemistry is everything perfect of course not does it matter hell no everything works so well together that you get swooped in without realizing even selena gomez is better than i was expecting you would think that it would be an issue for her to actually connect with steve martin and martin short but they actually click the bottom line is that this is an upbeat spunky murder mystery that doesnt weigh you down and keeps you wanting more,POSITIVE,Comedy
3374,10.0,19 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",only murders asks a lot from the audience because none of the plot is plausible and so to enjoy it you need to be willing to accept the invitation to go along for the zany ride often it is explicitly meta when it breaks the fourth wall and subverts genre expectations but sometimes it seems to slip back into a conventional show so is a little confused here but if you do accept the invitation then you are rewarded for the investment with some really enjoyable chemistry between the mains some one liners and gags which make you laugh out loud and a nice reminder of the joy of not taking things to seriously and a murder mystery entertainment for its own sake short and sweet min episode are welcome for such a show and make it easy to watch them either here and there or all in one go without much effort,POSITIVE,Comedy
3375,10.0,4 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",steve martin is perfection in this especially in the last episode i laughed so much all the famous people who kept popping up was a brilliant touch dont miss this one just loved it,POSITIVE,Comedy
3376,8.0,19 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",very disappointed by the end of this series and am amazed they are going to try to stretch this out into another season one season was enough and instead of trying to milk this for all its worth could have ended on a high note it was an interesting collection of people and for thirty minute episodes it was fine it certainly was not something worth repeating or seeing again the writing was not very good and the cast has really worn out its welcome season two will probably be a ratings disaster even for hulu,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3377,6.0,2 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",its too awesome funny thrilling great directory great way to visualize everything too good supporting actors main casts are terrific in a good a full entertainment pack,POSITIVE,Comedy
3378,10.0,19 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",unlike anything else on at the moment this unique show stands out with a great cast smart comedy and quality writing offering an immersive feel bringing fun and current stories to each episode,POSITIVE,Comedy
3379,6.0,8 November 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i started watching only murders in the building after seeing a trailer for it and at first i was a bit doubtful but as the season progressed and i got to see and learn more of each character and their traits i fell in love with it the build up to the climaxes are so enjoyable it really leaves you wondering whodunnit its a refreshing take on murder mysteries and i love the cast they gel well together and honestly without mabel and her guys the show would not be what it is it is funny thrilling and full of drama which i absolutely love i binged all seasons and cannot wait for a th season what i really liked it that it was not predictable there were many characters who could have been the murderer and so that was quite nice even if there are more seasons but they keep the writing and storylines just as great i will keep watching,POSITIVE,Comedy
3380,5.0,11 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",edit just finished season two just gets better and better i wrote earlier review before i finished season one this is a highquality show with fantastic set lighting and wallpaper its extremely well written acted the music is great it always keeps me guessing it doesnt help that two of my favourite actors are the leads bravo it is not a show for kids it does not have a childrens rating its for older teens and up so if anyones upset about that they just didnt do their due diligence when it came to the rating my new favourite show,POSITIVE,Comedy
3381,10.0,17 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",amazing cast great scenes intriguing and well directed the comedy is awesomeness very smooth only murders in the building is easy to binge the main leads are exceptional i see why it was nominated i thought i was gonna hate the series but its quite good id tell anyone to give it a chance even if it doesnt win much its fun,POSITIVE,Comedy
3382,10.0,21 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this one of the best refreshing series i enjoy it very much all thing in this series are so organized story acting music comedy casting are perfectly done i recommend to it everyone to watch and enjoy thanks to all for creating this series looking forward for more refreshment in season,POSITIVE,Comedy
3383,9.0,23 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",great concept the writing and directing works well though the constant cursing does nothing but damage the dialogue writers go with lighter slang language and throw out the real trashy expletives yeah a lot of people curse in real life however constant swearing is never cool and adds zero,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3384,10.0,16 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",completely devoid of any psycho political nonsense classic faces being funny constantly what a breath of fresh air im halfway through the series now and have enjoyed every episode im a tiny bit sad this is missing the third amigo i would have cried tears of joy im not joking to see all three in same filmtv show side by side chevy chase and everyone else please figure out how to get along with each other again dont get me wrong though selena gomez is great as part of the trio nothing against her just my ageism showing through,POSITIVE,Comedy
3385,10.0,1 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",all is said the boys are doing a great job but not chemistry with gomez stop casting her shes no actress,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3386,10.0,2 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",ill admit i watched the first season but after the hype surrounding the show im baffled as to why its got such a high rating the writing is cringe selena is monotone and subpar and the over the top dramatics is almost too much it feels like a caricature the jokes hit only half the time and sometimes the music is corny honestly the whole podcast thing seems rather overused and some of the supporting actors are too much dramatic as well its an average mindnumbing show at best definitely not steve martins best shorts character is a hard pill to swallow i would like mable if the character was casted better she needs more animation maybe she could borrow from shorts over the top schematics to compensate there are better things on television this one doesnt quite fit into a true mystery or true comedy it doesnt know what it should be but it just doesnt work,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3387,6.0,19 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this show was an unexpected delight with a cast i came to love a story that had me excited for each new episode i was a fan almost immediately what i loved most about this quirky out of the box mystery solving series was the widespread appeal to various generations i watched this show weekly with my sister whos in high school my grandparents then me its something that brought us together each of us got a laugh we made a ritual of watching as the new episode dropped at midnight so excited for season definitely give this show a fair shake its clever on so many levels i hope we will see more like it highly recommend,POSITIVE,Comedy
3388,9.0,2 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i absolutely loved the characters and the show especially steve the screening and storyline is awesome worth every second,POSITIVE,Comedy
3389,6.0,26 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",apparently this was a vague idea that steve martin had for a while after he went to a function and saw several old show biz people together he thought what about getting them to solve crime roll forward and we have a show where we waited for each episode to drop the story is character driven it gives us a slice of a particular strata of new york they are not poor mostly and occupy an island of privilege but they are fascinating to watch the side stories are often rib crackingly funny yet there is empathy for even the most selfish antics of martin short this is a painting of new york as we want it to be,POSITIVE,Comedy
3390,2.0,1 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",hooked up after the first episode great comedy and great characters all dipped in a proper mistery plot awesome,POSITIVE,Comedy
3391,10.0,3 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",as said this show is simply amazing this is reflected in the overall public review and professional critic the dynamic between the three main actors is simply perfect selenas role and acting is what mostly gives life to the series and what makes it stand as one of the best series of the year she reaches the level of her two legendary comedic costars with ease and as executive producer she again has shown that she simply is one of the most talented people that the industry has ever seen i recommend it,POSITIVE,Comedy
3392,8.0,1 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",so funny and mysterious very entertainingmy husband and i were glued to it,POSITIVE,Comedy
3393,10.0,11 December 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",dont know why more people are not watching it or talking about it everyone should such a good combination of humour and mystery with two most compatible and talanted amigos storyline script direction acting all combined makes it worth spending every second on already waiting and excited for second seaaon oh and to add most bad reviewers saying selena fans giving it higer ratings is a myth or one sided opinion coz i am not her fan did not even particularly like her acting skills in this one but other two polished actors along with ride in the storyline cover up the kinks in acting skills of novices and so the team together works to bring the entertainment value of the show,POSITIVE,Comedy
3394,9.0,28 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",please do not confuse stellar cast for inane writing trying to be too cute makes it excruciatingly difficult to overlook the pain the actors feel in delivering their lines and that horrible noise playing while the deaf kid is on is actually worse than the third man theme,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3395,9.0,20 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i always liked steve martin and martin short but his show is dire selena gomez sounds exactly like the robovoice on my roku she has no acting talent at all no wonder hollywood is importing british actors to play americans the plot is senseless the lighting is terrible the direction is disastrous it makes me wonder if the actors could feel how terribly off this show is when they were making it on top of that hulu has taken over the reviews here and seems to own the subreddit on this show because every person i know irl cant figure out how they managed to make such a terrible series but everything online is an exclamation point star review praising selena gomezs fantastic acting and demanding multiple emmy nominations its like the entertainment industry is now tass in the old soviet union dictating reality its supposed to be a funny kooky fantasy but its senseless lifeless creepy dreadfully unpleasant hollywood has made so manymotion capture movies that actors and environments now have an unreal quality that attempts to convey reality but fails,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3396,7.0,29 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this is a delight the characters are well rounded and its an intelligent but cheesy premise its not laugh a minute but its not written that way each episode is short and rattles along at a decent pace its well worth investing a little bit of time,POSITIVE,Comedy
3397,9.0,23 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this show is a pleasure to watch due to the mood setting and charactersactors steve martin and martin short work great together highly recommend it so the positives out of the way the biggest negative for me is the formula they are using its essentially an intro episode then episodes of leading viewers to suspect its someone its not then in the last episode its someone where there is almost nothing linking them to it in the previous episodes season was even worse in that they didnt explain at the end how the killer was connected to many of the clues and how it fully played out you can essentially watch the first and last episode and have just as many clues linking the actual killer as someone who watches every episode another issue is the mabel character is almost always the same monotone and humorless moodpersona oliver martin short and charles steve martin are great though as are most of the other regular characters on the show,POSITIVE,Comedy
3398,6.0,17 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",heard the buzz and to began to watch liked the story selena gomez was surprisingly marvelous steve martin good but martin short was exceptional shorts character is the glue that holds the show together short was hilarious,POSITIVE,Comedy
3399,3.0,19 December 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i really like this show at first i didnt understand the hype but once i gave it a watch i was hooked to it i cant wait for season two im looking forward to see how season plays out with the cliffhanger the final episode had,POSITIVE,Comedy
3400,9.0,22 December 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",only murders in the building a splendid whodunnit story thats brought to life by its brilliant casting twists and turns are littered all through making it worth every minute the th episode is especially welldone with the unique styling absolutely deserving of the praise and accolades its been garnering thus far if only selena gomez had snag the golden globes best comedy actress nom but we have the critics choice and possibly the emmys to look forward to,POSITIVE,Comedy
3401,10.0,22 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i personally loved this show from beginning to end everyone did great in this series its funny intriguing and really pulls you in to where youre invested in the all the characters and the world overall just a nice really well done comedymystery show,POSITIVE,Comedy
3402,9.0,20 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",always enjoy martin and short the writing here leaves something to be desired and those critical of gomezs acting arent off base it doesnt matter though as its all just light fun the best part was the exchanges between the two leads have a question who put the im watching you sign on amy ryans door it does end on a terrific note a second season apparently is in the offing i suggest they lose the gomez character she adds nothing of interest,POSITIVE,Comedy
3403,9.0,31 December 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",started watching with the family and binged six episodes the first day as the show is well written and directed the acting by steve martin selena gomez and martin short is fantastic the storyline just sucks you in and keeps you wanting to know whats next or around the corner the main issue i have with this series and the reason i rated it just a six out of ten is due to all the added profanity the language feels forced and is just too over the top i can easily see the script being written where the fowl language is dialed back im going to keep watching as i enjoy this series very much and would easily give it a ten if not for the profanity,POSITIVE,Comedy
3404,10.0,1 July 2024,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",as much as i love steve martin and martin short two great comedians and as much as i was looking forward to this show after a few episodes i pulled the plug the plot is contrived unbelievable and silly i could almost overlook that just because i really like those guys but selena gomez was the deal breaker not only is she an untalented actress her nasal monotone and bland delivery was just too much to bear i cringed every time she said anything sorry to say i just couldnt continue watching i wish steve and martin all the best but this show just doesnt cut it i hope they try something different their talents are wasted in this show,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3405,6.0,25 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i was a little shocked to see selena as a main cast didnt expect a huge performance from her and maybe thats why i like what i got steve and short are just perfect for the role and they basically carried the whole show and to some extent selena too so trio is good and then comes the writing part writing was the backbone of the show and how they used meta dialogues are just crazy the music is a bonus because if i like the opening theme there is strong chance that i will like the show too the pacing of the show is really good i didnt get a lowbar in the show the mystery are good but not so shocking but i like how the keep bringing twist after twist overall its a good watch,POSITIVE,Comedy
3406,10.0,24 September 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i avoided this show until season was out i figured its just another disney show trying to capitalize on the sm mss legacy with sg thrown in for the young audience i was honestly surprised by how funny the writing easy and engrossed by the whole mystery its clear that the trio actors are having a blast doing the show the intergenerational friendship dimension is rather touching and very welcome especially their shared concern that they havent lived up to their potential season is stream of hollywoods whoswho that at first threatens to reduce the season to a string of cameos but this season packs a lot more genuine emotions curtesy of meryl streep this is honestly one of the best written shows around and as someone whos a fan of sm and ms this easily ranks among their best work for me,POSITIVE,Comedy
3407,6.0,15 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",some fans say that all who rated this who is selena gomez fans but lets see the greater sides of this show i mean you just need you all to see how incredible the cinematography or how the soundtracks is to well or acting from all actors especially martin short who is doing great mix between mr bean comedy with dialouge comedy and finally the story telling with every ep thats telling the investigation with different ways you dont excpect it selena is to well in this show and i find her very likeble for a darktone just relax hulu did great job you need to see if you want to cancel this from your watching list give it a chance its worth your time,POSITIVE,Comedy
3408,1.0,4 September 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this is way better than you would think it is the plot which is the most important thing is good not agatha christie good but good steve martin always the most tolerable of the lookatme im funny north american funny people is really good because he is not playing it for laughs martin short is obviously irritating and obviously not a good actor but i think that is the point of martin short selena gomez is good i like her the supporting cast are great as are the sets and the rest of it except cara delevingne she is literally the opposite of acting personally i do not find her attractive but apparently there are enough that do so please find her modelling work please tell her that she is beautiful and does not need to act please her appearances have gained enough attention that she is on graham norton that is too far please stop cara delevingne please,POSITIVE,Comedy
3409,9.0,10 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i really wonder why it took steve martin and martin short so long until they play alongside each other in a major production again omitb is full of hilarious dialogue colourful characters and great comedy acting i was intrigued from start to finish there were a few minor grievances and a rather big one some story scenes were handled a bit clumsily especially when it came to reveals and resolutions the one constant and big complaint i have is selena gomez i am stunned how bad her acting was in this everytime she had to walk she walked very awkwardly her lines were wooden as if she had just read them for the first time after ten episodes we have barely learned any interesting character traits it was almost midschool level bad i have never seen any other work she has done but i am sure this cant be the same selena gomez who is a popular likeable actress i hope she gets better in the next season,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3410,8.0,24 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i knew from the first episode i would enjoy this steve martin and martin short together is a fantastic pair up im always weary of whodunit shows or films pretty much al the same containing a twist in that it wasnt who you were made to believe it was this programme though has been made so well i feel it contains enough humour and likeable characters to detract from the norm and make it a show you cant wait to see the next episode of martin shorts ditzy behaviour doesnt get annoying its genius the chemistry between all three stars really does work the screen time for each is well balanced meaning you dont get too much of a good thing all in one go and the spend the next minutes twiddling your thumbs great job i can appreciate this show may not be for everyone but its certainly one of the best light hearted easy going shows to be found in cant wait for s,POSITIVE,Comedy
3411,8.0,31 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",only murders in the building is an ingeniously crafted murder mystery with an impeccable script the comedy shines through the lead actors steve martin martin short and selena gomez on paper pairing steve martin and martin short with selena gomez might seem weird but works brilliantly their chemistry is palpable from the start and the camaraderie between their characters makes this worth watching from the getgo martin short oozes with charisma and his wit and zeal as oliver putnam might give him an emmy win if there is an emmy category for best trio then only murders in the building would take the top spot what i admire the most is its capacity to seamlessly mesh individual plot lines together and the ability to give the audience little nuggets of whats to come in each episode the series manages to foreshadow the outcome and the eventual reveal in a sleek and bold manner the storyboarding of the opening credits sequence and the overture intertwined with it pulls the viewer into the storyworld and entices them to keep watching whoever skips the opening credits sequence is not a true fan of the true crime podcast each episode is filled with an abundance of twists and turns every episode is immaculately crafted high stakes driven and offers the perfect blend of humor and mystery only murders in the building is one of the best comedies i have ever seen each episode leaves you wanting more it keeps the viewer engaged and in a positive and upbeat mood plus it is extremely addictive final verdict,POSITIVE,Comedy
3412,10.0,3 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",it was not what i sincerely expected it was a bit disappointing so i decided not to finish it maybe i will at some point but i dont think so,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3413,8.0,19 April 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",only murders in the building is a new comedic mystery series on hulu that has gained a lot of attention thanks in large part to its starstudded cast the show follows three neighbors in a new york city apartment building who bond over their love of true crime podcasts and become amateur sleuths after a murder occurs in their own building the premise is intriguing and has the potential to be a lot of fun but the execution falls short in several key areas first and foremost it must be said that steve martin and martin short are comedic geniuses they bring their trademark humor and chemistry to their roles as charleshaden savage and oliver putnam respectively and are easily the highlights of the show their banter and oneliners are a joy to watch and provide many of the shows funniest moments unfortunately the same cannot be said for selena gomez who plays mabel mora the third member of the trio gomezs acting leaves a lot to be desired while she has improved over the years her performance in only murders in the building is often wooden and lacks the natural charisma of her costars she struggles to keep up with martin and shorts comedic timing and falls flat in several key scenes its clear that shes trying her best but the contrast between her performance and that of martin and short is stark the direction of the show is solid with a clear vision and style that sets it apart from other comedies director jamie babbit infuses the show with a sense of whimsy that suits the offbeat premise and the shows visuals are often striking the use of split screens and other stylistic flourishes adds to the shows charm and helps to keep things visually interesting the acting of the supporting cast is also good with standout performances from nathan lane as a washedup actor and amy ryan as a grieving widow each of the characters in the show is given a distinct personality and backstory which helps to flesh out the world and make it feel livedin the story itself is entertaining with plenty of twists and turns to keep the audience guessing the shows central mystery is intriguing and the way it slowly unfolds over the course of the season is well done the show also delves into themes of loneliness friendship and obsession which adds depth to the characters and makes the stakes feel higher however the story does have some noticeable plot holes that are hard to ignore several key developments feel contrived and lack the necessary setup to make them feel believable the show also relies heavily on coincidences to move the plot forward which can be frustrating for viewers looking for a more cohesive narrative overall only murders in the building is a mediocre show that falls short of its potential while martin and short are comedic powerhouses gomezs performance leaves a lot to be desired the direction and supporting cast are solid and the story is entertaining but the plot holes are hard to ignore despite its flaws the show may still be worth checking out for fans of the cast or the mystery genre however viewers looking for a standout comedy or mystery may be disappointed,POSITIVE,Comedy
3414,7.0,16 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i tried to like this its got two legends which alone could carry the show its just s gomez wretched acting she had no chemistry with both martin and short her lines were delivered in this nonchalant i dont care monotone way every scene with her was cringe i tapped out at ep,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3415,8.0,25 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",a real treat easy going setting great characters full of warmth and secrets a real fan of steve martin and this serves up well for him will there end up being a hundred murdersers in one building i hope they do string out a few more seasons thats for sure great seasons deserves seasons more,POSITIVE,Comedy
3416,7.0,19 January 2024,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i love the quirkiness of the show and its obviously carried by steve martin and martin short im sure there arent as many roles out there for older comedians like them but they definitely deserve this chance to shine and its nice to see a series like this doing something out of the ordinary the premise of season three with them putting on a broadway show was a great choice meryl adds a lot as you would expect so does the supporting cast i laughed out loud at some scenes but i am so tired of selenas monotone voice and nonacting its so distracting i wish they could replace her with someone else and keep the show going,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3417,3.0,26 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",really hulu amy schumer this show was almost perfect shes a terrible comedian and actor please please dont do that again i just cringe whenever i hear her speak anyway the rest of the show is amazing selena sometimes looks awkward with her acting but i love how her mellowness tones down steve and martin they are all perfect together and play off each other well steve is a quiet funny martin is much more obnoxious and silly but in a good way and selena is quippy and chill the cast is perfect i love the comedy the mystery the storytelling and how it is all weaved together its not overly thrilling but the writingstoryline is interesting enough so the thrilling part doesnt necessarily have to be there its one of my favorite shows i wish the episodes were longer im afraid we are going to binge watch this way too quickly and i dont want it to be over,POSITIVE,Comedy
3418,10.0,19 June 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",martin short and steve martin make the show as well as some of the other actors why selena gomez was chosen for the part i will never know i am certain there are other more talented young women out there her constant monotone whiney voice never changes the entire first season that ive watched so far hoping she improves during the second but based on some of the comments on here i guess not she has no personality is extremely rude bitter and not in a way that makes one empathize with her character she grates on ones nerves but i try to ignore as much as i can bc i love the writing and of course stave martin martin short and nathan lane loved how finally the armenian and greek genocide is getting some attention in a hollywood showfilm among a couple other surprises just some little things ive noticed that make it a bit more desirable to me but overall love the mystery and hoping selena works on her acting and becomes a little more engaging as the show progresses,POSITIVE,Comedy
3419,10.0,14 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",it has everything it needs selena was awesome theyre were jokes which had no sense but had humor totally awesome i dont know the pg but i think its because even its a murder its not that scary and hulu man can u please give the episodes quicker like seriously by the time i see the next episode i forget the last part,POSITIVE,Comedy
3420,9.0,1 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",steve matin is great martin short is rocking it love it feels good if you want to make it great replace gomez sadly she has no personality you can not mix blame with lively huge personalities sorry but itss a freight train moving along and gomez is the mud that slows and drags it down,POSITIVE,Comedy
3421,10.0,20 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the first season was decent in fact mostly enjoyable to watch although it could get a little frustrating at times so hence the fast forward comment season two is not decent its hard to watch and the fast forward gets used a lot more which is a shame the reason for the negativity of season two is simple amy schumer she just does not fit in fact id go as far to say her character and performance is cringeworthy for the love of me i cant understand where the idea came to put her in any part of this show sorry but the proof is in the viewing selena gomez is actually the star of the show she holds the balance of the three main characters and makes it work steve martin plays to his strengths and you get what you expect from him martin short can be frustrating at times and at other times he can be really funny but he fits into the chemistry of the show i honestly think only murders in the building could be a real winner it needs a little help with the storyline and script but it has real potential also some of the other characters could come into play a little more bunny was a great character but unfortunately season two kind of put a crimp in that idea there are others though that could be capitalised on such as howard teddy detective williams i really like her plus the podcast critics are all really good characters to play on,POSITIVE,Comedy
3422,10.0,22 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",as a whodunit its predictable but thats not the point this is all about having some fun along the way about finding humour in awkwardness about pushing some shallow characters beyond breaking point and enjoying watching them bumble their way through never far from disaster its a classic diversion and accomplishes this very well so put the magnifying glass away sherlock and have some fun steve martin is at his best when he cant stand up and martin short is at his when hes obnoxious in this show they make fun of themselves to good effect,POSITIVE,Comedy
3423,10.0,7 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",but selena gomezs speaking voice is really putting me off i like martin short and steve martin im ok with selena gomez to be fair i have only seen one episode so far i dont want to give it a like most reviewers who get put off by a little summin on any show and after mins of watching they rate a show thats just ridiculous im on the fence because of selenas voice same thing happened on a movie she was in woody allens a rainy day in new york but i got through it because of timothee chalamet but this is a series can i manage to get through it i dont know,POSITIVE,Comedy

3425,10.0,1 September 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",everyone will talk of the obvious stellar star cast their captivating performances but i would like to adulation their tonal quality which is simply supreme dont know who did what with the sounds but their voices are so distinguished and the way they deliver their dialogue is just so powerful wether its any apartment cafeteria every minute detail is visible to the eye this one would be loved by generations to come a classic has been created all the three protagonists are so comfortable with each other they give room for mutual betterment and no one is into one up mode,POSITIVE,Comedy
3426,7.0,17 December 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",its like they combined kimmy schmidt with a wes anderson movie you might not always be in the mood for it but when you are its perfect also if you like me are a podcast geek you will love some of the references like how the successful podcaster says her line and then goes into a squarespace ad i kept waiting for someone to say they put the pub in public radio anyway highly recommended,POSITIVE,Comedy
3427,2.0,4 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",a true crime podcast born from a murder in the building shared by a seemingly lost young woman living in her aunts apt a washed up sitcom star still holding on to the past and a wishful wannabe struggling to make ends meet as the plot twists and turns it fills you with just enough dark humor to express wit and enough subtle drama to keep you glued with anticipation must watch good for selena gomez to get teamed up with of the amigos,POSITIVE,Comedy

3430,10.0,1 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",omitb is a misterious story each one of the residents have its own secret and the series executed that really well however it is quite funny and enjoyable to watch steven martin martin short and selena gomez did a outstanding job this time,POSITIVE,Comedy
3431,10.0,14 March 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",if you want to see a very creative smartlycast visuallystylish amazinglymusicallyscored atmospheric superfunny comedy with a neat murder mystery look no further than only murders in the building its very pleasant viewing just a delight to watch and listen to my opinion is also that its dramatic elements range from inspired and excellent to lame and paintbythenumbers and the acting slips on occasion now my culturalgeographic and agerelated demographic profile means that i only know selena gomez of the three leads ive listened to a few of her songs and i like at least one good for you with adollarsignap rocky shes a perfectly decent singer shes a pretty decent actress too as it turns out but she stumbles at times and needs to develop a bit more range people sometimes seem to think that playing an emotionallyreserved character means being a bad actor which is absolutely dumb but selenas not entirely without fault here to be fair i also would say that about steve martin and he has decades of experience and as such fewer excuses in the meantime while martin shorts character has cringier moments for the most part hes an absolute joy to behold a charming jovial aesthete and wheelerdealer of the art world a formidable theatre director past his prime he outshines the other two a little bit for me i guess im a putnut by the shows own terminology this series is in a way a loveletter to new yorks elite classes scene where intelligentsia and bourgeoisie mix im not sure whether ill ever watch through russian doll which taps into the same captivating surroundings while a seemingly worse series but this one surely sates my appetite for a while the premise is as follows three bohemian layabouts if you know you know two of them very elderly live in a big housing complex the arconia they share a passion for true crime podcasts and befriending each other by chance decide to launch their own when a murder occurs in the building they wont cover any other murders only murders in the building see in a way the tidal wave of podcasting is presented as a modern reimagining of the classic american dream or conquering new york where even your average jane or some havebeen downontheirluck losers can have a shot at grabbing a huge audience and captivating peoples minds to be fair the podcasting stuff is more of a backdrop it informs a lot of things but the series is very liberal with assumed timeskips so we mostly see the sleuthing not the recording and a lot of events happen offscreen but this unlikely trio not only desperately tries to solve the case or figure out whether there is at all a case they also legitimately develop chemistry and help each other grow here the show loses me a little bit mabels story is interesting zoe is a great character with a very cool plotline mostly told in the most creative episode of the show with minimal spoken dialogue but is executed a bit handwavily and charles story occasionally is quite lame and cringy the actual central mystery is however pretty neat even if there are some simplistic clicheish parts something to fix for the upcoming season hopefully they have a true jewel with this series it just needs more refinement finally as to the overall presentation of the show the colourful stylised intro sequences and outro stills are great and the music that plays sporadically throughout the series and during some of the outros is absolutely euphoric outros of episodes and especially brought me total bliss i really gotta find the ost on youtube additionally a neat little detail is that episodes typically begin with some abstract ponderings by a character typically a supporting one new each time its not a hugely important detail but i found it a nice bit of flair,POSITIVE,Comedy
3432,7.0,30 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",ive just binged this over the last or so hours and for the most part it was great i really enjoyed the characters the actors playing them the directing music literally everything to do with the production up until the last two episodes dont get me wrong the last two episodes did still hit all the boxes except one it was two episodes too long for the story things could have made more sense if ep was a round up but i think they could have done it on ep ironically i think the money men got involved to leave it needing a second season personally i kind of hope there wont be another one because of how wrong and cliched the ending was it was fun while it lasted if this had been a stand alone episode show it would have got a,POSITIVE,Comedy
3433,10.0,1 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i watched the first three episodes and really really hoped to like this series the first episode was good the second was okay and by the third i was catching up on social media emails and texts instead of watching the show the characters are shallow boring and uninteresting what a shame considering the abilities of the cast and writers,NEGATIVE,Comedy

3436,10.0,4 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the show is really interesting and i find it fun to follow along and figure out the clues throughout the show i see a lot of hate about the actors but i think that the comedic trio of martin short steve martin and selena gomez is gold all three bring different things to the table and i honestly think most reviewers just hate selena because thats what i seen most reviews focusing and not really on the show its self it appeals to both older and younger generations the one character i actually dont really enjoy is jan i find her a slightly boring but still intriguing nonetheless the whole idea behind the podcast is really fun and i like that it allows them to pursue different suspects in each episode i also enjoyed the mysterys that are being revealed throughout it gives the audience a thrill trying to chase down the killer along with them plus the title sequence is amazing really cool and creative plus it incorporates a cluenod to something in each episode definitely worth the watch,POSITIVE,Comedy
3437,9.0,18 September 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",season omg this is the best thing i have every watched till now meryl streep you are a queen of cinema theater all kind of art this is like a lesson of acting episode final scene i really cried this is really really best show i love it dialogues also super season final update excellent from the beginning to the end costumes drama funny elements characters story cast perfect i am looking forward to rd season this is the best show of for me till now i watched episodes and i can say this is really really good i love the characterizations much this is not only about solving a mystery series also very nice story telling about older people life at least i did take the story like that selena gomez is big surprise for me she is so cool and good choice for her role so far i love everything i hope it continues in that way till the end sting is another good surprise on and th episodes i think this series give me everything what i want mystery fun curiosity a little drama and really good actors i highly recommend to watch,POSITIVE,Comedy
3438,9.0,9 January 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",ive never wanted a next season of a show so badly as i want this this series completely surpassed expectations i mean its hard to go wrong with steve martin and martin short anyway but i think this is the best thing theyve ever been in and everyone else is excellent with some great cameos the dialogue and plotting is second to none with twist after twist i love murder mysteries and this can teach all the others a thing or too even the british ones its a fantastic cross genre of mystery and dramedy im not usually a binger so i took about a week to go through the series but now please bring on the next series immediately it is insanely brilliant,POSITIVE,Comedy
3439,9.0,27 May 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this show is despite selena gomez monotone voice and lack of acting abilities surprisingly good the plot and story line are enjoyable its fun this isnt brainteasing stuff its simple easy wholesome entertainment but theres too little of that nowadays yes its carried by steve and martin hah hah and would be better if it featured more steve martin or martin short funny skits ideally both or just less monotone dreary moments featuring gomez surely they could have found a skilled actress to act in this rr,POSITIVE,Comedy

3441,9.0,28 June 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",decent whodunnit with great comedic actors that we really havent seen much from in the last ten years i like anything with steve martin so if you like him youll like this selena gomez is nothing special in this basically just used her fame smartly i might add to bring relevance to this worthy show worthwhile watch you wont be dissatisfied or bored,POSITIVE,Comedy
3442,7.0,25 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i really like steve martin and martin short so i really wanted and expected to like this show its just not good and they totally mispronounced the name of the oklahoma town chickasha not chickasaw i think that one glaring mistake just destroyed the whole illusion for me,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3443,8.0,12 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",steve martin martin short and selena gomez are so good together,POSITIVE,Comedy
3444,2.0,31 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i really enjoy this show its funny and has a good mix of mystery and twists in it as well sure some of it is a little cliché but when i want to watch a mystery story i expect certain themes and actions to play out as they do in a mystery story the mix of the comedy is great the leads have great chemistry gomez feels like the third musketeer to steve martin martin short i enjoyed watching those three build a relationship throughout the show the other tenants performances and the apartment building meetings are fantastic comedy scenes that gave me legit laugh out loud moments if you want to watch a fun show then give this a shot,POSITIVE,Comedy
3445,9.0,9 December 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",so i thought ill just watch the first episode then get to bed a somewhat reasonable hour for a change that is not now going to happen already i can tell this show will be a joy to watch as others have already pointed out in the comments the writing acting directing pace music setting etc etc are all much above the usual standard broadcast streamed or downloaded to and by us this show is a bright and beguiling treat now dear friends on to episode,POSITIVE,Comedy
3446,8.0,31 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i dont ever write reviews but i had to fit this incredible show this is one of the best shows i have seen in a very long time great cast and great story steve martin martin short and selena gomez all have great chemistry together the murder mystery storyline is awesome and really keeps you guessing i really hope they come out with more than just two seasons,POSITIVE,Comedy
3447,10.0,25 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",nice to see steve martin and martin short back together again and with selena gomez to boot ive been around for over fifty years so martin and shorts older stuff is right in my wheelhouse as to the show it is a slow burn but very enjoyable there is no kneeslapping laugh out loud comedy here so dont go into this thinking you are going to see humour such as you find in the man with two brains or the jerk but there is great subtle humour as one obserbes when spending time with friends as of episode six there are twists and turns but most are not obvious and keep me genuinely interested in where the show is going i am enjoying the gradual revelations of the characters backstories and the stories of others as they become more important to the plot my one hope is that this is all leading up to a payoff that makes sense and has a destination that is worthy of the journey,POSITIVE,Comedy
3448,9.0,1 October 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",when i first started to watch only murders i couldnt get into itafter a few days i went back to it and glad i didit really got better and i was hooked steve martin and martin short have worked together and have been friends for decadesthey play off each other effortlessly selena gomez was very good and fit into the crime solving trio perfectly i found myself watching episodes over again because i enjoyed them so much and found them extremely entertainingi could have done without some of the actors they introduced as cameos ill let you decide that for yourself the murders they solve are interesting as they unfold and you will find yourself surprised im all caught up and on season ive enjoyed watch this show so much and it is one of my favorites hope there will be more seasons,POSITIVE,Comedy
3449,8.0,2 March 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i had this show recommended to me by a few people but i procrastinated over watching it because murder mystery whodunnit shows are not my favourite genre i find that generally they try to hit too many targets without nailing one well i mean do you really want a show to be a comedy crime drama mystery thriller make up your mind anyway despite those initial concerns i actually really quite enjoyed this easy to watch the cast bounced off each other well the humour was thankfully not over the top i found selena gomezs dry delivery that some are complaining about here to be spot on and steve martin martin short played their characters well although together they will always be two of the three amigos to me plus i didnt pick the ending of season one easy watching and i can see why its been a hit if that was allowed for me,POSITIVE,Comedy
3450,6.0,10 December 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",even if you have nothing to watch avoid this great acting but the show itself is drawn out dry and boring moments theyre trying to be funny its actually cringe worthy because it feels like the actors are forcing themselves to be funny,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3451,10.0,2 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",like wt why why did you end it here my baby me neeeeeed more of that when is it coming back,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3452,6.0,20 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i started watching omitb on a whim because i had nothing else to watch but i wasnt expecting it to have such a grip over me in short time that i started to eagerly wait for its new episode every week it starts off pretty slow and some might even find it cliche and boring in the beginning but once i embraced how zany and colorful these characters are and what they could bring to the table in terms of storytelling from different points of views i got hooked even the finale did two things right that shows these days struggle with it gave a satisfactory ending to a wellbuilt story and successfully teased a new one for those interested without feeling forced or awkward but in the end this is my opinion its up to you if you want to give this a try,POSITIVE,Comedy
3453,9.0,30 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",first off my cup of tea is some action blood and fantasy and yet this show blew my mind never thought i could enjoy small set mystery investigation so damn much point one just watching the intro and listening to the music puts all my days work behind me and lets me relax and enjoy what is coming point two the fun and jokes in the show are enjoyable noncringy and sometimes let you spray drink on you screen from the sudden laugh ehm point three the characters are truly lovable can stir your compassion and make you care lastly all in all the story is fun and not very predictable though it grips you and makes you want to binge watch the whole thing it is just perfect for turning everything off and just enjoying the ride of relaxation better than a a massage or jacuzzi,POSITIVE,Comedy
3454,8.0,1 December 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",thanks to the cast it was such a fun watching the twist and turns the building the flair of manhattan and all the different personalities living in the arconia made the plot looking forward to a all ready announced season,POSITIVE,Comedy
3455,9.0,3 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this show is great in that steve martin martin short play differentpersonality amateur sleuths its generally lighthearted and is meant to be what i find distracting and detracting is the amount of fwords used mostly by selena i get that she is supposed to be a third personality type in the trio a sarcastic youngergeneration versus two older guys but the frequency and ease with which she says fword iterations definitely takes this series out of the sweet classification that some reviewers are calling it and her i wonder if she talks that way in real life or if its mainly because the writers wrote it that way or maybe both thumbs down to the writers for trying to spice it up in this manner and pointsoff from selena for going along with it unfortunately it seems that its currently in vogue for folks to talk this way in public online social media etc believe me i have heard every vulgarity in the book during my social services career jobs and have been called every foul name but that doesnt mean that it should be considered okay normal acceptable for people with any amount of class to talk that way,POSITIVE,Comedy
3456,10.0,5 October 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",wow yes you need more words than that but its pretty concise if this show was wonderful for the first seasons then this season has been elevated to extraordinary getting to see the team back together is only the beginning to see paul rudd a good bonus the other real treat is martin short playing opposite the queen of hollywood meryl streep we know he has always been a phenomenal talent hes comedic talent spans decades but to see his dramatic talent go head to head with meryl streep wow he is a true master not only will both the emmy and golden globe committees be nominating meryl streep but martin short for sure moreover this season was a showcase of many talented singing artists steve martin meryl streep selena gomez martin short it brings back davine joy randolph who is a joy pun intended to watch the show is a winner with a winning premise,POSITIVE,Comedy
3457,9.0,3 October 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",season one was hilarious it seemed original enough and the cast really clicked im a huge fan of anything steve martin does and i also really like martin short selena gomez was reasonably good as the kid but it was really the martin short show the nd season just seems to drone on like the writers were worn out from season one there are plenty of decent gags oneliners from martin short but the rest is annoying filler schumer was horrible she must have paid someone off to get in this they also had to play the yawn woke card in season just like every other product out of hollywierd today too bad it had alot of promise at the start,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3458,7.0,25 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",good lucking thinking sctv snl or of the classic steve martin movies make for good pressthey should but this is cry boring pretend theyre not even there as it is hangyourselfnow levels of dull i and the other reviewers have got your back here you will never get that time back,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3459,10.0,4 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",steve martin and martin short are great in this selena gomez cant really act and has to always be carried in pretty much every scene she can do thingslike walk around be sneaky or do some action scenes but when it comes to actually acting she cant really do facial expressions you can really see that in the scenes with oscar and her mom where it feels like a crappy cw show i dont know how she got past audition the writing directing and sound design are all great but man selena gomez really adds nothing to the show thankfully they dont have too many scenes focusing on her face while she is acting so we are spared a bit,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3460,7.0,26 January 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",and already made a connection with it only murders in the building is a great action comedy with a very good finale that sums up the first season and leaves you on the hook for the second one the pacing is good soundtracks also and the mute episode is a great episode some actors were not so great unfortunately but the rest nailed it,POSITIVE,Comedy
3461,2.0,14 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i am thoroughly enjoying this show selena gomez is not a name that i would have come up with to put with martin and short but she is a great foil for the older actors i find it refreshing and in a definite change from most of the latest mysteries that i have seen unpredictable,POSITIVE,Comedy
3462,10.0,27 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",in a growing sea of mindless garbage television this show is a gem a cozy murder mystery the show is intriguing funny and at times heartfelt the characters are all unique and well developed steve martin and martin short bring some of their best work to the show selena gomez is a surprising standout the chemistry and dynamic between the three main characters is a rare and delightful treat the show does a fantastic job balancing mystery and comedy and is wholly enjoyable truly a delight,POSITIVE,Comedy
3463,8.0,19 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",please never stop making new episodes i love this show its a mix of everything i love and its literally perfect i love the characters i love the concept i love it all,POSITIVE,Comedy
3464,10.0,10 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",in style not story has similar feel to it kinda quirky and mysterious with glimpses of warmth and deeper themes while i doubt it will be a series i remember long after finishing it i will enjoy the ride while it lasts and look forward to the next episode i suppose thats ill im looking for an entertaining distraction that has something more to talk about than just sex and violence i recommend giving it a try it will be clear in the first episode whether or not its for you,POSITIVE,Comedy
3465,10.0,10 March 2024,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the writing is fantastic the chemistry between the lead cast is surprising brilliant while the supporting cast have their characters so well developed which then leads back to outstanding direction very high production values the story lines twists and witty lines coupled with lot of slapstick makes sure you aint regret it martin shorts high energy comedic timing is perfectly offset by steve martins more controlled comedy and selena gomez is totally brilliant to watch be it her deadpan dialogues or her acting as someone with troubles of her own she is a pleasure to watch if you are like me you will know mins in that this is gold must watch,POSITIVE,Comedy
3466,8.0,23 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",fun series to watch especially for anyone who grew up watching steve martin comedies he and martin short have such great comedic chemistry butas much as i like the character of mabel selena gomez acting and awkward monotone voice are hard to watch shes a talented singer but good god she has zero expression obviously the producers wanted a well known name to appeal to younger crowds but selenas inability to convey any type of emotion is horribly distracting from the show aside from her performance and the awkwardly placedforced sounding fbombs being thrown out left right and center its an amusing easy watch with some very impressive guest stars,POSITIVE,Comedy

3475,6.0,27 October 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",so all in all its a out of i was looking forwards to season two but it was stretchy and boring and kept on dragging i watched the first five episodes over the course of three days and i was just be done so i skipped all the other episodes six seven eight and nine and watched episode ten that was enough to get it wrapped up without having the feeling you missed something besides selena gomez being a snooze fest throwing other stars to a lame story for season two doesnt work the budget should have gone two story writing and a six episode final season be gone murders leave my building,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3476,9.0,5 February 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",only murders is a really good show the premise is interesting i know martin and short have been friends for many many years but gomez has slotted in nicely and the of them have an easy chemistry martin short is hilarious steve martin is solid as usual and selena gomez is great mothering them with their old fashioned quotes and ways and trying to be hip it was a great idea to have different generations in the mix to keep it fresh and open up the comedy options the supportive cast have been excellent as well each person is perfect for their role the final ep of season is a classic with the party some great lines from everyone kept the laughs coming weve binged both seasons and its kept us guessing who done it each season looking forward to season with paul rudd and meryl streep,POSITIVE,Comedy

3479,10.0,7 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",drives me crazy to watch shows that have a character who is pregnant constantly hold onto their belly is this something that the directors are asking the actors to do seriously holding onto their belly like its a ball about to drop i find it so distracting it seems to be the thing nowadays not just in tv and movies but social media too enough already,NEGATIVE,Comedy

3481,10.0,20 August 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",fun serious hilarious and goofy great actors and storylines the characters are so fun and interesting and all of the cameos and multiple sides of each character that are revealed make it feel like a mix of a book series theater and movie the theater theme is intertwined with every part of the show and it often feels like watching a play the funny parts are sometimes laugh out loud and sometimes just a smirk or a chortle some parts are truly sad some are so curious that its hard not to keep watching even when its way past bedtime martin short and steve martin are amazing together after years of a professional and personal friendship which is obvious in this series,POSITIVE,Comedy
3482,9.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i love steve martin but this is so lame and contrived for wealthy new yorkers i feel like im watching an old peoples version of nancy drew in an rccentric hotel i started watching for great actors but not so great in this seies,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3483,10.0,13 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this is odd to say but this show feels funny and gentle and wholesome to me even though its about murder i think its the friendships at the heart of it not only is it somehow soothing to watch its also one of the few shows that can consistently make me laugh out loud each week i have loved steve martin and martin short for years and selena gomez makes a perfect dry straight woman to them brilliantly written with an emphasis on character and heart and always funny without trying too hard the direction and music are stellar too and the episodes that focus on one character are amazing little polished jewel character studies that also move the entire seasons story arc forward so great that the show has the confidence to mix it up like that those episodes are true works of art this has become my current feel good show yes a show about murder,POSITIVE,Comedy
3484,9.0,14 January 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i had fun all the way also it has great flow and ofcourse the actors are masters the murder misteries never got so fun and intriguing and what makes it more artistic is that it happens in new york and you have other artists that are related to the story cant wait for season if there will be,POSITIVE,Comedy
3485,7.0,9 December 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",season one was great amazing chemistry between steve martin and martin short selena gomez is good not great season two is also very good but amy schumer is in several episodes playing herself and man she is just difficult to look at disgusting outside and in sooooo unfunny a terrible actress to boot not sure why they chose her you cant look at her without puking a bit into your mouth i really hope shes in as few episodes of season two as sting was in season one sting is a far better actor than schumer and though hes not a comedian like schumer hes far funnier and though im straight i find sting far more attractive than schumer,POSITIVE,Comedy
3486,7.0,7 March 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",in an episodic world that seems to be dominated by romance themes only murders in the building revitalizes the thrill of mystery steve martins mannerisms timing and energy is inspiring not to mention the intro design the music and writing i was on the edge of my seat the entire time martin short youre an inspiration truly truly sensational,POSITIVE,Comedy

3491,8.0,18 May 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i havent actually seen any films of steve martin and martin short before but after this show i watched every clip of them on youtube and they really are hilarious the show is about a trio of true crime podcast fansoliver martin short charles steve martin and mable selena gomez the three of them started bonding over a murder that happened in their building and decided to start their on podcast to investigate the murder the characters are very wellwritten selena gomez really brought a great balance and the chemistry between the three is amazing the storyline has some twist and turns the pace is just right the mysteries are not too predictable and the show keeps running in a quirky engaging funny atmosphere looking forward to the next season the producers really did a great job casting selena her interviews with the duo are funny as well its like a genz babysitting her grandparents lol p s there was one episode when martin short visited his son when he walked out of his sons home depressed and hopeless then he recieved a text lighting up his hope his facial expression in those few seconds were incredible what a great actor,POSITIVE,Comedy
3492,8.0,8 August 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",im minutes into the first episode of season the picture keeps going from sharp to blurry its definitely in the filming theres nothing wrong with my television who was the cameraman and how is this allowed to air with this quality of work its already obvious to me that both the storyline and quality of acting are of high caliber but the filming is truly awful and completely distracting from the story itself im hoping that as the season progresses this problem doesnt repeat itself in future episodes i did pause episode to write thismaybe this only happened in the one scene hopefully if so still one scene too many,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3493,10.0,29 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",a trio of true crime podcast enthusiasts investigate a murder in their building comedy murder mystery starring steve martin martin short and selena gomez plus lots of great cameos throughout this is a really fun show its modern fastpaced and wellscripted with strong leads good chemistry a decent whodunnit plot and with nice twists throughout a great concept for a tv show the second season continues very much in the same vein but is not quite as good its less fresh less exciting with a weaker plot overall i enjoyed this show but season is somewhat more entertaining worth a watch,POSITIVE,Comedy
3494,7.0,14 August 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i really like this show and im not a fan of too many ny city movies or shows i think ny is generally overrated and not nearly as interesting as new yorkers seem to believe it is but this show depicts it perfectly and is interesting fun and has one of my favorites in it steve martin i like martin short but a little bit of short goes a vey long way they seemed to utilize his skills perfectly in the first season but he is a bit much in season im on episode and in episode he was wearing my nerves i hope they reign him in it is nice to see that martin short and gomez are all exec producers however overall the show is fun and has a wonderful feel to it is timed perfectly edited vey well and hulu did well,POSITIVE,Comedy
3495,10.0,28 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",im enjoying the series fun and something to look forward to when another episode drops a lifelong fan of steve martin i must admit martin shorts character is amusing also is it just me or is the building the real star i seriously want to go and visit belnord apartments,POSITIVE,Comedy
3496,6.0,29 June 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",it was supposed to be funny witty and engaging but i couldnt even finish the first episode its forced its bad chemistry and its terrifying how many fake reviews give this insert your favourite insult piece of garbage stars its truly the essence of bad writing bad casting bad target audience jokes that could make it in s in one avoid,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3497,2.0,29 March 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the trailer made this look like one of those desperate highconcept made for tv movies or a bad reunion show but its fantastic a tight topical and insightful script both comic and melancholic bringing to mind planes trains and automobiles beautiful locations and cinematography all the technicals are top notch as is the casting and acting nothing about the show feels dated or out of touch the chemistry between martin and short is something to behold so much so that martin and short might as well be admitted to the pantheon of martin lewis etc and its great to see the singular martin short in a major role again actually thats not true it ought to be martin short gomez i was baffled to see her name in the cast ive not seen much of her work but she not only fits in perfectly with martin and short but i think her stoic hard and sort of sweetness balances the combination of the two other leads a mix akin to kirk spock and mccoy nothing about her presence seems obligatory a great bit of casting and the show wouldnt work without her looking forward to season,POSITIVE,Comedy
3498,10.0,30 April 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",wonderful on all levels i only deducted one star because i wish there werent quite so many expletives but im a brit and thus somewhat inured to bad language but everything else about it is just fabulous,POSITIVE,Comedy
3499,10.0,24 May 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i kinda fell across this one sunday and was hooked by episode a good story made with a great cast didnt expect the ending which was a bonus cant wait for the end of june for the next instalment,POSITIVE,Comedy
3500,9.0,25 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i enjoy the premise but selena gomez doesnt quiet fit the bill for me she seems bothered and compared to her co workers drab im excited to see it progress,POSITIVE,Comedy
3501,10.0,4 October 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",omitb is really special and while i understand that selena gomez was likely cast to incorporate her largeyounger fan base as viewers she is ruining this great show martin short and steve martin do the heavy lifting entertainmentwise but selenas severely nasal voice and desertdry acting is more than terrible its extremely distracting and offputting if not for the magnificent aesthetics of that gorgeous building and the magic of the shortmartin chemistry i wouldnt be able to keep watching this show my husband and i started watching it together but selenas voice was a dealbreaker for him he does keep trying due to our love for martin and steve but he can never sit thru any mabel scenes i barely get thru them myself i understand the deadpanmoodyyouth character she is trying to play but she is failing miserably better examples are jenna ortega as wednesday or lisa kudrow as ursula phoebes twin on friends its not the character as many selena fans would argue its selena the acting is sub par and dry her voice is way too nasal and even her body language is constantly awkward it also seems like the costume designer is working against her most of her looks are either illfitting or just hideous short and martin cando carry this show on their own i dont anticipate the showrunners will replace selena at this late stage but i do hope they reduce her lines in season to reduce the cringefactor a bit this show has such charm and true hollywood showmanship in the more mature members of the cast while i can appreciate the dynamic of the generation gap between the stars of the show mabel is quite immature in the way she responds to the olds the writers have her behaving like a moody teen but she is nearly this was a misstep i hope they smooth it out in future seasons overall omitb is a breath of fresh air amongst the massive quantity of garbage shows that keep showing up if they stick to the mysteries and the relationship development between the stars vs incorporating sociopolitical themes this show could go the distance ie grace and frankie,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3502,9.0,2 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",when selena is in the scene your eyes will get fixed on her she is an amazing talent martin and short are spectacular as expected the story is fun and interesting i cant wait till the next episode i love everything about it,POSITIVE,Comedy
3503,8.0,4 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",we decided to try this show out by starting season episode because it featured steve martin and martin short and because of the biggest star of the show new york city on location started out wonderful although in my opinion selena gomez didnt belong too bad amy ryan couldnt have had her part but i digress the language was too crude for our family i later read the parents guide and found the f word was used over times during the first episodes i have to ask why was it necessary to propel the plot the policewoman using gods name to curse why the city and the stars minus selena gomez would have been sufficient for us to watch and catch up with the episodes youre right for thinking im just old fashioned but i believe no one would have noticed if there had been an absence of profanity given steve martin and martin shorts talents not to mention having my favorite city as a backdrop,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3504,7.0,28 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i liked the season more and became a bit cliched which is why a else a for season netflix needs to learn to make such series every thriller doesnt have to have grotesque scenes and a abuse scenario making it impossible to watch with your family this series was engrossing had a thrill element good locations good story and cast the building is beautiful in its own way and the costumes were also quite pleasant though i kept wondering how does the lead character mabel afford them as a jobless person overall it works very well martin short and the lady who plays the bassoon were the best actors in the series they went a bit overboard in season and hope they tone it down in next season,POSITIVE,Comedy
3505,9.0,1 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i like the first eps so much maybe because its my favorite genre but their acting is so good too i know alex russo feeling so proud right know the series gives a good vibe to me i love it,POSITIVE,Comedy
3506,6.0,1 April 2024,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",a murder mystery drama sitcom driven by the movie stars matin short and steve martin in the apartment building they live in with special guest stars appearing in the show to add extra flavour watch it if you have nothing better to do you could waste your time watching something much worse the killer is not obvious so it is a true mystery there are seasons to date with special guest within these that add flavour to the show to name a few mathew broadwick of feris buller and meryil streep and sting the british pop star selma gomez is a great beautiful addition to the show she is the meat of the short and martin sandwich there is no swearing no hardcore soft core sex scenes no nudity no violence or visually graphic scenes of murder its a mildly amusing sitcom tv show that is for over year old watch it for the ageing steve martin,POSITIVE,Comedy
3507,1.0,1 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",but i struggled to get through the first ep and tapped out in the second,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3508,9.0,15 August 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",how does it keep getting better i heard that meryl streep was the big guest star for this season and while i love her i kind of thought oh no shes such a star theyll put her ahead of the regular cast shell outshine everyone well wow of course she is perfect and what a strange coincidence that in episode three the theme runs to one particular actor outshining the others streeps performance as an actor in a show within a show was so poignant it left me in tears tears steve martin marty short and selena gomez are as ever perfection the guys do a bit in ep where they welcome her back telling her shes what makes up their sandwich that without her they are just two pieces of white bread great analogy they are best together no doubt in addition to the stars of the show we have the seasons victim no spoiler here as it was revealed in the final episode of season paul rudd hes superbly cast in the role of ben who can be a jerk but underneath is a vulnerable guy who occasionally demonstrates a acting genius in the show within a show then reminds us why we thought he was a jerk and just like that we are off on the latest crime solving adventure with the amateur sleuthpodcasters of only murders in the building absolutely my favorite things on tv right now big stars,POSITIVE,Comedy
3509,10.0,11 September 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i love love love this show i want it to never end it is so witty silly and pure fun i laugh so hard i snort just about every episode amazing cast amazing writing amazing acting it is just pure guiltless fun even for the family do not be discouraged by the tv ma rating its pretty much for the murder that you really dont see its honestly a fresh fun show that pulls you in for more who did it follow the clues try to guess either way its so much fun to watch every week love love love everything about this show pluses watch and recommend to all of your friends they will not be disappointed,POSITIVE,Comedy
3510,10.0,9 September 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this feels like a lowkey arty indulgence but it has a wonderful comedic and addictive presence that worms and warms its way into your heart as the seasons unfold tenants in a building end up deep in a murder mystery and make a podcast about it the only thing that leaves me a little sad about this is that steve martins energetic and hilarious comic genius is played down and suppressed probably so everyone else has a chance to shine selena gomez really shines like the star she is such beautiful and natural talent she plays a cynical and somewhat acerbic millennial that confounds the ageing characters of steven martin and martin short,POSITIVE,Comedy
3511,9.0,1 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",im finding it very difficult to understand the reviewers who choose to give this show star ratings and call out selena gomezs acting selena gomez is amazing in this show as are steve and martin i love the mystery surrounding the story i love the acting the comedy this show deserves all the praise that it is getting cant wait for season,POSITIVE,Comedy
3512,9.0,20 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",great show if you are fun of mystery combined with comedy hillarious scenes actors play well their characters which can be further built though i think only martins character has been evolved more if you liked knives out and generally this kind of films you will binge watch this too,POSITIVE,Comedy
3513,10.0,11 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",great murder mystery with a heavy hitting cast tons a laughs and gags exactly on par with martin short its enjoyable enough just to see the cast all in one show with such a high budget but the story has twists and turns that really keep the audience guessing a ton of fun characters and new faces throughout the building too,POSITIVE,Comedy
3514,6.0,15 March 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i love the entire series i wanted to give too bad the ending ruined it for me it was silly i know this is a comedycrime show and it supposed to be silly but not like that wasnt funny at all it doesnt matter if there will be a season and well see how they are after being arrested its still gonna be silly,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3515,10.0,5 September 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",martin short is absolutely brilliant steve martin is awesome but why what who salena gomez doing in this she truly cant act it would have been wonderful to have a feminine woman play the part it would have been so much fun with the oldies but instead we have a tomboy boring onefacial expression gomez really really really poor casting chosing selena gomez her voice is deeper than the men in the show howard lol it detracts from the show but we endure as it might be medical anyway i still enjoyed the show and give it a seven out of ten would have been more without gomez shes definitely off my towatch list,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3516,7.0,23 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i originally decided to watch this solely because steve martin was in it with the bonus of martin short i was worried when i saw selena gomez was part of the cast not because i had any particular issue with her i just had never seen her acting before and her music is not my preference as it turns out it those three work beautifully together dont expect an out an out comedy and dont expect the most taxing thriller what we do get is a gentle comedic mystery that leaves you with a big smile on your face at the end of each episode together with a little teaser of whats to come it draws you in and makes you yearn for the next episode ive seen a review where a minor gripe was the length of the episodes i see the point because you are always left wanting more however most podcasts are released in short but size episodes and this replicates that feel bear in mind it is an homage to true crime podcasts and not intended to be a complex thriller though you do need to pay attention to keep up with the twists a regular flow different characters of guest stars some appearing as themselves keeps it fresh this is one of my favourite things out there at the moment and am really pleased it looks like there will be a series its close to a but a few red herrings are a bit too obvious then again that may be deliberate,POSITIVE,Comedy
3517,2.0,22 January 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this show has a great premise talented people and a good setting unfortunately the writing could have been better you get the feeling there was a lot of improvisation a lot of the bits could have been brilliant but went another way its still worth watching ive watched five episodes and will watch the rest as far as where to watch it these are options as of late january its a hulu original series so you could subscribe and watch it there but they ask for your birthday and gender your birthday is sensitive information and none of their business once i gave a fake birthday to another nosy company they reported it to a credit bureau and caused some issues due to this i tried subscribing to disney because they said they had this series that was a waste of time first it was hard to tell which subscriptions had it i guessed after they got my money i learned i had to download an app then i still had to sign up for hulu the hulu sign up process malfunctioned it might have demanded my gender and birthday but i never got that far amazon doesnt currently have this series that would have been my preference and to watch it on a browserinternet instead of downloading and no app,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3518,10.0,22 December 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this show is so boring combining genres which dont go together the dialogues and acting is too cliche comic timing completely off characters unidimensional exciting momentszero,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3519,10.0,11 September 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",so to be clear i am not from new york not from the us over and not a selena stan this series is absolutely brilliant and really does something differentn imo the main cast members worked well together and i found that surprising with one of them selena gomez the additional ensemble cast is excellent and they have some really gem parts normally i find certain series cant hold a story like this for the whole set of episodes but this definitely does just started the nd series and am looking forward to it martin short and gomez really have pulled this together and made themselves look very good the writing has also been an extremely important part of the success and lifted some of the support characters out of just being there for dressing,POSITIVE,Comedy
3520,9.0,20 September 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",we love this show it is intelligent funny and full of surprises the writing and acting have us continually coming back for more we are big bulldogge fans and love seeing the adorable dog the combination of steve martin martin short and selena gomez is brilliant the amount of incredible actors in the supporting cast enriches the constant twists and turns everyone is complicated and complex this show does a great job of showing people in their best and worst moments and all of the inbetween every episode is another reason to stay up way too late and keep watching once it gets to the end of the season its depressing while waiting for the next,POSITIVE,Comedy
3521,10.0,17 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i love the interaction between steve martin and martin short and was honestly surprised by how much i liked selena gomezs character great plot twists kept we watching all episodes in about week another season please,POSITIVE,Comedy
3522,8.0,18 December 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",laugh out funny proving why steve martin and martin short are huge stars selena gomez brings the youth and is the perfect choice being a genuine person perfect casting all round its gentle comedy with a whole lot of normal language anyone complaining have you been to ny have you left your house recently the script is sharp witty and delivered across the board by the great actors theres an air of arrested development around this but for a us comedy to actually be genuinely laugh out loud funny a very rare thing indeed its in a very short list,POSITIVE,Comedy
3523,7.0,4 October 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",both seasons are really good i enjoyed the second one more though characters and story is very well written lead trio is so good as well the secondary characters comedy and thriller is very well balanced in both seasons really excited for next season show keeps you on the edge till finale episode in both seasons i also liked the story telling in every episodes feels so fresh do watch it whenever you get chance episodes are not that much long so it feels convenient too steve and martin sir with selena is team to watch out for i dont want to spoil the show go watch it and judge it yourself,POSITIVE,Comedy
3524,10.0,14 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",you might see high ratings and posters everywhere but this is not a super good show or even a great one ill say its average good production questionable artistic touch light and sometimes fun im at episode and will not continue,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3525,6.0,23 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this has to be one of the best shows that ive watched in quite some time it has mystery murder dark comedy and steve martin and martin short along with selena gomez who is the smartest one of the bunch this trio just works along with the others that live in the building and wondering if they done it youre in for quite a ride,POSITIVE,Comedy

3528,9.0,23 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this series is perfection and i have to give it my only ever most people enjoy classic detective stories such as agatha christie or hardy boys this series deliberately pays homage to elements from these stories but mixes it with humorous characters and modern settings the beautiful building and the secrets it hides is a perfect way to tie everything together mixing the old hands of steve martin and martin short with younger actors was a master stroke to widen the appeal of this series the gentle digs at the misunderstandings between the generations is especially lovely without being disrespectful looking forward to series my suggestion is to limit the show to series so they dont over milk it,POSITIVE,Comedy
3529,10.0,10 January 2024,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",only murders in the building seems like a really strange combination of elements actors i would not have thought to put together except for steve martin and martin short of course genres i would not have thought to put together but the elements all come together to create a very unique and interesting show thank you for showing only murders in the building on abc and for starting at the beginning i really like it so far by the way i have not seen justification for the tvma rating so far oh maybe the profanity but it is censored im not even sure which genre id put it in,POSITIVE,Comedy
3530,10.0,8 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",nice drama nice mystery nice twists and just enough comedy made this an absolute winner i thoroughly enjoyed each episode and highly recommend honestly i am not a giant steve martinmartin short lover but they were great in this and so was selena gomez didnt figure out the killer until episode,POSITIVE,Comedy
3531,10.0,2 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",a different series from the usual cliches the series makes you wait for the next episode when its especially with a twist of murder mystery and comedy drama the episode flipping pieces where it shows the past of mabel was one of the best episodes in season,POSITIVE,Comedy
3532,7.0,20 March 2024,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",only murders in the building embarks on a delightful journey blending fantastic writing surprising chemistry among the leads and welldeveloped supporting characters with high production values and witty dialogue peppered with slapstick humor it promises an enjoyable watch season introduces us to a trio of murderpodcast aficionados investigating a homicide in their upscale apartment building steve martin and martin short shine with their comedic prowess complemented by selena gomezs refreshing performance despite gomezs nasal voice the trios dynamic keeps viewers engaged making the series bingeworthy the first season captures the essence of new york city with its quirky characters and witty banter its a lighthearted romp with a sprinkling of mystery and drama reminiscent of classic comedymystery series like monk and jonathan creek while not groundbreaking it offers good honest fun that earns its star rating however season struggles to recapture the magic stumbling with clumsy humor and a jarring guest appearance by amy schumer although it eventually finds its footing it treads familiar ground failing to match the originality of its predecessor season unfortunately sinks further losing its charm and coherence steve martins character becomes caricatured and selena gomezs performance lacks the spark of earlier seasons the onceengaging mystery devolves into nonsensical motives leaving viewers disappointed despite its uneven trajectory only murders in the building remains a commendable effort buoyed by its standout first season while subsequent seasons may falter the series initial brilliance ensures its a mustwatch for fans of comedy mysteries offering a tantalizing blend of suspense humor and quirky characters,POSITIVE,Comedy
3533,10.0,22 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",its nothing ground breaking but its highly likeable and amusing stuff with a relatively intriguing murder mystery that has kept me coming back for more what makes the show though is the chemistry and banter between real life long term buddies steve martin martin short they clearly had a great deal of fun making this which shows through in the final product the only thing that i wasnt sure about is who exactly they are aiming this at it would be quite a family friendly show if it wasnt for the ton of swearing in it,POSITIVE,Comedy
3534,7.0,19 February 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",a local comedian mentioned it on a podcast i heard steve martin and thought meh ill give it a try so here i am am mind blown wishing i could unsee it so i could watch it again for the first time,POSITIVE,Comedy
3535,2.0,8 August 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",after season ive enjoyed this more at beginning than towards the end it was more endearing following true crime aficionados getting things hilariously wrong while lying through their teeth to their tightknit buddies branching one mystery into three was too ambitious and the branches resolved in sort of predictable ways each story was cut abruptly as a result the trio got too competent or lucky to my taste saving the day all by themselves some parts were funny and some were forced i also wasnt entirely swept by acting the characters never break their mold selena is too mild for snarky young woman set on uncovering the truth,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3536,10.0,24 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",boy was i disappointed steve martin did a superb job of publicizing this one it does not even vaguely live up to the hype the story is simply not that interesting and moves unbearably slowly the part for martin short seem to be made up just so he would have part of his friend steve martins film i made it thru e and just quit,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3537,9.0,30 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",not meaning to diss steve martin short but i didnt expect too much from this but i am pleasantly surprised at how good it is well written good acting by the martins and especially by selena gomez its no sopranos but definitely worth watching give it a try,POSITIVE,Comedy
3538,8.0,23 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",im very particular about series i watch really all tv in general i was delighted to find only murders in the building when it started i found myself waiting more and more eagerly each week for the newest episode and went full withdrawal waiting for season i love the twists and that the story line isnt obvious i do hope the series continues because youve got two legends with martin and short a beautiful blossoming actress with gomez complete gems with lane randolph and creighton the entire cast with the exception of schumer are all great sorry ive never seen any work by schumer that i can stomach shes just not what i call a skilled actress kudos to martin and hoffman for such a brilliant series wishing you success for years ahead i know the great steve martin is retiring but i do hope its not too soon the series would not be the same for those reviewing gomez as being too monotone and boring have you watched the series if so you should realize this is the persona of her character and with reason shes acing it her character is not some chipper high strung millennial the character has been through a lot and is very deep much mature for her age so give gomez a break she is nailing the character,POSITIVE,Comedy
3539,9.0,18 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",in the beginning when selena came on the scene her prophanity was ridiculous thankfully it got better the show is fun well worth watching like all movies and shows the mains get listed as exec producers for even more money the experienced actors i can easily see they have great input but selena please she didnt ruin the show so i do recommend,POSITIVE,Comedy
3540,9.0,4 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",selenas acting as mabel mora proves that she can take any role and eat it down oliver and charles characters go handinhand with mabels character to fill a void between various generations of audience this show is better than expected tbh and the scriptwriters and costume designing dept did their job perfectly,POSITIVE,Comedy
3541,9.0,4 October 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",one of the best shows i have seen these last years selena gomez is one hell of a great actress her role as mabel is what makes the oliver putnam martin short charledhaden savage steve martin and mabel mora selena a fantastic trio of goofy funny investigators the stories are brilliantly written always surprising and never boring the secondary actors and actresses are amazing and bring so much depth to the whole combination having meryl streep jackie hoffman jayne houdyshell tina fey or jane lynch just to name a few to complete this already great casting makes the show one of the most refreshing serie to watch highly recommended,POSITIVE,Comedy
3542,8.0,25 December 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the story is actually quite good as murder mysteries go taking you on a journey before finally revealing what truly happened i found the characters annoying to begin with and wasnt sure about the chemistry between them but they grew on me over the course of the season and i would happily watch more i personally wasnt a fan of the boy from b episode clearly a very divisive episode looking at the reviews which is done almost entirely through sign language or through alternate means of dialogue such as scrabble words or texting i get what they were going for as the focus of the episode is on a deaf guy and there is nothing wrong with being more inclusive of people with disabilities but the silence feels forced in some scenes where it makes no sense not to talk and above all its a tv show and this episode was not as entertaining as it should have been because of the lack of sound,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3543,7.0,5 September 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this show is very well done season is even better than each episode keeps you captivated until the end and then you want to binge the whole season im a big fan of the main actors and they deliver above and beyond with their excellent acting skills depicting quirky characters that get caught in various crazy situations spoiler murders i dont think there is one normal character in the show but that is what makes it so memorable and hilarious its hard to define what category this falls into comedymysterysuspense with a little bit of romance it can be dark at times as the characters sort their way out of the catastrophes but there is enough humor to lighten it cant wait for season,POSITIVE,Comedy
3544,5.0,19 February 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",had no idea this existed until the gf wanted something similar to knives out and clue over the course of a few weeks we watched season very solid worth the current review score and season sloppy mess feels more like a star season review dont bother the ending is almost pointless and feels like a rushed rewrite when everyone realized who the real killer was supposed to be by episode it feels obvious by the script as well as selena gomezs massive weight changes throughout that the second season went through massive reshoots to its detriment the only highlights are really steve martin and martin short hamming it up season review steve martin and martin short are back together with the same chemistry they had in the old days my gf having only just having seen three amigos for the first time shortly before we learned about this commented on the duos comedy chops which are still quite strong selena gomez unfortunately is far more one note in all of her acting her speaking mannerism is this odd grumbly flatness and she rarely shows emotion or acting range and often just stands there and says her lines in her flat monotone voice shes not exactly bad but she definitely is not good her lack of acting make steve martin and martin short shine by comparison the trio stumble their way into each others otherwise secluded lives via their shared love of true crime podcasts the story is engaging and often fun and funny though there are also some very real moments sprinkled throughout the first season gave us enough information to go on that you could absolutely figure out whodunit while throwing in ample red herrings to throw you off the scent no such luck for the second season when it feels like the revealed killer comes out of the blue and feels messy and disjointed there will inevitably be a season and i hope that they have a better script than what they put us through from season,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3545,8.0,9 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the show would have had potential but the cast is very much confusing to me as well as the whole selena gomez onscreen career the girl obviously cant act every scene with her makes me cringe the story could be better the jokes could be wittier and funnier its just not good i could barely finish two episodes,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3546,8.0,12 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",honestly i wasnt too sure about this when i first watched it but it hooked me so i decided to continue then came season two and by the first episode my socks were blown off and they flew around the world i now love this show and put it as one of my favs,POSITIVE,Comedy
3547,9.0,25 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",only halfway through season but it is great so far the backstory and relationships that are established in the first season provide depth and a nice segway into the nd witty suspenseful and intriguing thoroughly enjoying it,POSITIVE,Comedy
3548,9.0,11 August 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i must say i find this show fascinating and entertaining however that said the amount of foul language feels excessive and completely unnecessary i do not feel it caters to or benefits the storylines in any way whatsoever im not sure why they felt this was more entertaining because it rather feels offensive and turns a fun show into something a bit too crude it in my personal opinion distracts from the story so much i almost cringe when the characters do it now i think i personally would have lived the show had it not had the use of offensive language i still enjoy it dont get me wrong i just dont think it was necessary for good storytelling,POSITIVE,Comedy
3549,10.0,17 October 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i mean selena gomez can be very sexually attractive but she doesnt need to be another female objects under male gaze like those bonds girls she turned out to be a quirky female lead who earns her place in the series by her intelligence not her look and sometimes she gets to take charge she also doesnt need to do nude scenes to attract eyeballs how good is that also this show is funny makes musical theater addicts very happy and contains strong human themes although the crimes and motives themselves are usually flawed but who cares about that im not here to watch criminal minds anyway,POSITIVE,Comedy
3550,10.0,26 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the first season of only murders in the building was great it was funny well paced and tense at points season was fine everything between the first and last episode of the season was painfully slow hopefully season retains the magic of season,POSITIVE,Comedy

3555,9.0,27 March 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this was a pretty interesting show in season but after season it was not as great the series features a cast of diverse characters with their own unique personalities and motivations which helps to keep things interesting however the pacing can sometimes be a bit slow and the twists and turns can be a bit predictable that being said the show does have some redeeming qualities the production values are solid and the atmosphere of the partyturnedmurderscene is wellcrafted the show also captures the essence of a murder mystery party pretty well with clues hidden throughout the scenes and red herrings sprinkled throughout the plot in conclusion only murders in the building is a decent murder mystery series that may be worth checking out if youre a fan of the genre if youre looking for a lighthearted and entertaining show that doesnt require too much concentration this may be a good option however if youre looking for something truly groundbreaking or deeply thoughtprovoking you may want to keep looking,POSITIVE,Comedy
3556,8.0,19 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this isnt the that some ppl have made it out to be but its not even the low marks that it has been given there is certain type of noir something you would have possibly seen in the early ss movies to it each character had their own arc and niche a great cliff hanger at the end bring on season,POSITIVE,Comedy
3557,9.0,10 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",loved this series was fun and with a greattt cast super funny to watch a sherlock holmes series with this trio the characters developing was really well made too to sumup was a great first serie for me,POSITIVE,Comedy

3559,8.0,17 September 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",a witty and breezy comedy perfectly executed with a well written story and full of twists you cannot expect but what keeps you hooked the most is the wholesomeness of martin short steve martin and selena gomez their chemistry is something amazing actually the second season gets even better as the mystery keeps you on your toes i just love how all the characters work perfectly together even though some episodes may seem sluggish to some people as you get to know the characters better the curiosity grows looking forward to the third season this show is much more than just murder mystery,POSITIVE,Comedy
3560,9.0,23 October 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",fantastic cast but i cant believe the producerswriters didnt write selena gomez out in season two she absolutely ruins the entire show her acting is so awful every time she speaks in her monotone voice i cringe she has zero emotion and feeling in her acting and next two extremely talented actorsactresses she sticks out like a sore thumb steve martin and martin short have stellar performances and the story line is very compelling its just such a shame they gave her a main role and so much air time maybe in season three theyll be able to get rid of her so we can actually enjoy the show,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3561,7.0,13 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",many shows these days are have this weird cheap tint to everything about it it might be the curse of the streaming age and will lead to people losing interest in low quality massproduced garbage with overpaid alisters which is why i rarely watch shows anymore enter only murders in the building this rare gem of a show mixes humour and mystery weather or not this is your kinda show you must accknowledge the objective quality of this show the sets the lighting the characters the evermoving plot references acting and costumes my absolute favourite show of the last years my only hope is that it wraps up before it becomes too much of a messy scramble and that it can tie up loose end or even better end on a few cliff hangers well done to everyone involved this is an instant classic,POSITIVE,Comedy
3562,10.0,3 February 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",im not a fan of podcasts or true crime but i loved it his show it is one of the better shows out now the chemistry between martin short and gomez is great and shows on screen a fun ride waiting for season two,POSITIVE,Comedy
3563,7.0,4 May 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this trio of main characters are such a delight to watch the writing is witty clever and smart steve martin martin short and selena gomez are brilliant together and deliver each line with perfection the chemistry between them is amazing not to mention the phenomenal guest stars each season the setting is a character all its own between the enchanting building itself and the magic and aesthetic of new york city it embraces and encompasses wrapping everything up into a cozy comedic mystery the stories are engaging and the twists are always a surprise and fun to watch unfold the end of each season leaves you wanting more,POSITIVE,Comedy
3564,10.0,3 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i loved the st season and i was excited for nd season but after a couple of episodes its clear this show is falling short of the original creativity going off on unnecessary tangents the cast of supported characters also falls short with the acting level not very convincing i think the nd season is disappointing compared to the st so far hopefully maybe they can get back on track,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3565,10.0,17 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",who doesnt love steve martin and martin short together the casting and writing are excellent somehow season is better season and i seriously cannot wait until the next episode comes out,POSITIVE,Comedy
3566,9.0,1 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i really enjoyed this seriesyep steve martin still has it but you know what bugged me on the first episode you have the main characters going up to their apartments in the elevator together and martin short exits first the series intro however shows steve martin below martin short in the buildings windows i know a strange thing to mention in a review but hey its an inconsistency that bothered me on every episode otherwise fabulous writing and acting so a big thumbs up,POSITIVE,Comedy
3567,8.0,21 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this is the best series ive watched in a long time if you love murder mysteries comedies and a stellar cast this ones for you steve martin as dried up actor charles haydensavage and martin short as disgraced director oliver putnam play off of each other beautifully and provide some legit lol moments in season one at first selena gomez seemed like an odd choice but she grows on you as she accurately portrays the depressed and cynical millennial mabel mora the series isnt perfect though for instance true crime aficionados who keep touching vital evidence without gloves will make you cringe also the choice of narrator for each episode doesnt always make sense however the writing and the acting are the best ive seen in a long time the quality makes me think of a blockbuster film rather than a minute show everyone has their own tastes and opinion but if you are the type of person who appreciates great writing talented actors or just a cozy mystery youll enjoy only murders in the building,POSITIVE,Comedy
3568,9.0,19 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i waited until i knew it was getting close to the final episode and then binged it over days i think that helped me enjoy it as much as i did because i didnt have to wait im not a big fan of selena gomez but her character started growing on me in the last few episodes i love steve martin and martin short so they are the reason i wanted to watch and i enjoyed watching them have fun of course now i have to wait for the second season but i will be looking forward to it,POSITIVE,Comedy
3569,9.0,27 March 2024,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",for me by far the highlight of this is martin short in series and hes simply dazzling series still decently good steve martin has good chemistry with him but he feels either a bit flat or a bit d just a dash of ss martin to pep things up would have made such a difference everyone else has their moments but they really feel like glue connecting short and martin when the glue is strong as it is in season the show is excellent there are clunky sections especially episode but the show just zings along frothily very enjoyable season the glue isnt quite as strong and it feels to me like too many hands wee involved muddying things and so detracting from that central pair season was really disappointing the joint screen time not enough to make the show more than interesting should have been better and the side stars simply distracting short also seems flatter less energetic i hope they dont make a season and dilute things yet more if they want to do anything please make it one off specials or movies kept nice and tight and really really focus on keeping the on screen together,POSITIVE,Comedy
3570,5.0,17 August 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i absolutely love this genre and only murders in the building does exactly what its meant to its fun and camp and silly and the plots just keep getting better and better season two was brilliant it goes into all the typical murder mystery themes cast of suspects theatre murder mystery parties i just love love love it season three opens with a murder in stage how perfect and the addition of some big name faces just feel like yiu can stitch of and become absorbed in the fun the mysteries are always complex and you just have to follow along for all the clues as they do love this show,POSITIVE,Comedy
3571,10.0,24 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",short and martin are close friends but their onscreen chemistry sucks and thats nothing new ms gomez saves this show anyone watching steve martins early movies knows what he can do this is not it,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3572,9.0,5 January 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",its hard to understand how she was cast they wanted someone young with a following i didnt know anything about her except she used to sing and now i know that she really can not act at all its kinda of embarrassing,NEGATIVE,Comedy

3576,7.0,13 October 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",only murders in the building is one of the best shows ever my children i have waited anxiously every tuesday for the next chapter have thought about the plot all week long all the different possibilities and have really lived this show we cant wait for season the cast is all excellent brilliant funny cool and the writing is absolutely superb suspense friendship manhattan murder of course family theatre art different generations romance many interestingly wellwritten characters a fantastic plot and wonderful music all in one terrific awesome show bravo to all thanks a lot for this masterpiece please make more seasons,POSITIVE,Comedy
3577,10.0,1 February 2024,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",so i had been wanting to watch this show for a while having not watched much on hulu but i decided to watch the bear after all the success that show had received and loved it and needed something more light hearted after that so i thought id try only murders in the building and i just loved this show the characters are really well written and although its based around the three main characters it really does have a good ensemble cast that add new additions each season howard is defiantly a standout bunny and uma are also great and i love how they flesh out the characters and they arent just there for the sake of it sometimes they do glaze over certain things which i do find a little annoying but its usually basic things like why is that character there because before they were in jail etc not saying who to avoid spoilers i also love how inclusive this show is without hitting you over the head with it i would like to see more from the podcast fans cause they are funny and add a fun angle to the stories its so rare to see a person in a wheelchair on tv so its nice that you have a show with deaf physically disabled and what seems like a few mental health issues characters in a show and it not be about their disabilities i do find it fun that the murder mysteries are always twists but not ones that you find unbelievable this show has made me laugh out loud multiple times which is rare for comedy shows but it just keeps up in quality i hope this show does end with the next one why because i think it will get stale if they mare more and end it when its on a high learn from the british we end our best shows after seasons of usually episodes dont go on till people say oh it was great till season end on a high,POSITIVE,Comedy

3579,2.0,4 September 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",love the premise the story line and the talented colorful cast love the setting and the scenery it is a fun series with amusing twists and turns the many varied quirky characters are portrayed by outstanding actors overall of course martin and short are superb unfortunately selena gomez spoils the show with her bad acting she is flat flat flat whenever shes in a scene she pulls the watcher out of the story because she is not believable as a character you realize youre watching selena gomez give a sub par performance it is painful to watch mabel could be a strong interesting clever character,POSITIVE,Comedy
3580,9.0,21 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",three very different people in a halfimagined investigation of a you guessed it murder in their nyc apartment building twists slides sideslips and poor decisions make for a dark comedy the wide spectrum of oddball characters adds humor and tragedy heartily recommend this accompanied by a good pinot,POSITIVE,Comedy
3581,10.0,10 September 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this series has interesting characters and a compelling concept and it moves forward at a leisurely yet engaging pace however the marated components mostly fwords and some sexual content and the progressive content seem inorganic and they detract from what otherwise be very engaging and entertaining perhaps series with a tv rating arent moving the dial any more so the producers feel compelled to toss in a boatload of gratuitous fbombs progressive sexuality and as one example creepy conversations among senior adults about sex toys but to me at least these elements seem artificially added in order to merit that coveted rating of ma this series could easily have been tv it would have been the better for it and its audience might have expanded aspects of it are still quite enjoyable but on the whole only murders in the building strikes me as a great concept sullied in pursuit of vulgarity,POSITIVE,Comedy
3582,9.0,22 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i thought the first season was pretty fun but i never even made it through the first episode of the second season im not really sure where they were going with everything but it didnt seem like the same sort of mystery story going on like the first season i wound up turning it off with the introduction of cara delevingnes character just really was awkward and didnt seem to add anything to the series,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3583,9.0,25 February 2024,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i relate and love oliver hes so funny i really enjoy this black humor this is a great series with great actors not one is out of place for casting it separates the rest of the other mystery shows and movies when you add humor into it selma has brought her inner dark alex larusso out a bit i love martin short and steve martin these two have great chemistry with humor i hope this show never ends this is better than you the opposite character mannerisms reflect the fun in the show having same characteristics in every character is boring this show doesnt disappoint in that region,POSITIVE,Comedy
3584,9.0,13 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",only murders in the building follows a trio of tenants as they try to solve a murder that took place in their building i was not at all expecting to like this first season as much as i did the show was something i looked at but was never really interested in i saw it as more of a parody of sorts so it didnt appeal to me that being said when i saw a critic i deeply respect praise the second season i figured i should give it a go what i like most about the first season is the mix of genres this is through and through a dramedy but it takes that genre and blends it with a murder mystery so not only does it take you on a roller coaster of emotions it continuously keeps you guessing at who killed tim kono the core trio of steve martin martin short and selena gomez have some of the best on screen group chemistry ive seen in a modern day show each one of them plays off of the other extremely well and its a lot of fun to watch in terms of gripes i dont really have many the only thing that slightly annoyed me was that their were certain subplots that i feel couldve been explored more so that when they came to and end it wouldve felt more earned overall only murders in the building season is fantastic with a stacked cast and a extremely talented group of writers this show is far better than i expected a after another murder occurs in the building our core trio are under the spotlight as the prime suspects this season is just as good as the first and honestly i feel the exact same way as i did the for the first season so ill keep this short the core trio of selena gomez martin short and steve martin are what make this show their chemistry is off the charts and its awesome to watch the story unfolds in a very well structured manner the twists and turns keep you on the edge of your seat while the character development is strong throughout this show does have a theme of underdeveloped subplots which isnt a big deal because they are subplots but something to mention overall season to is just as good as season its filled with great chemistry and quality writing a,POSITIVE,Comedy
3585,8.0,4 January 2024,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i havent laughed this much in a long time martin short and steve martin together in a show omg they are hilarious we need more shows like this that make you laugh i hadnt seen selena gomez much she really does a great job in this series she knows how to handle the two neurotic and selfcentered comedy duo and she plays her part very well she is funny serious beautiful and lovely all at the same time its a unique show there is so much funny stuff and hilarious antics yet murders are taking place and the murder investigations are very intense and serious in their process so you have both things going on martin short and steve martin are amazing they shine through with their incredible comedy they are so funny true actors who have withstood time and no one could do what they are doing they are great i have watched all three seasons and cant wait for more every season had intricate and complex story plots and anyone could be a suspect with the quirky neurotic and crazy people that they come across every day you keep trying to guess who did but something keeps leading you to another and another wow really keeps you guessing great writing for sure cant wait for season update i agree with some of the other reviewers amy schumer really was terrible in this show i have no idea why they thought she would be a good fit couldnt wait til she was done and cara delevingne was not a good fit either there are so many other wonderful actors andor comedians who would have been a much better choice,POSITIVE,Comedy
3586,6.0,27 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",why does everyone say selena gomez is so great in this i am sure she is a very nice person and people want her to succeed and all that but she is definitely the weakeat link monotone dialog emotionless face unless they make her the killer in the end which she is not i can not honestly in good concious say she does a good job she does not and this has been obvious to me from the first episode the actress playing steve martins daughter is a way better actress imo,POSITIVE,Comedy
3587,9.0,7 November 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",some other reviews are a bit overboard and have no substance my personal view on this series is it kept me calm and relaxed at difficult times in my life i love steve martin the cast are great and the synergy is on point i love the story of each season the calming music and funny lines i feel like many of the characters resonate with our own lives at some point im glad there is a season as the series story suggests the show must go on despite potential negativity its true to its own words whoever put this together is very artistic and has helped created amazing characters i hope this continues for many years to come,POSITIVE,Comedy
3588,6.0,31 August 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the series guys is really good i found it by accident in a period where i was looking for a series to find to make me laugh a little because i was bored the series is about two random people who live in a building and have only one thing they like to listen to podcasts about unsolved crimes and one day there was a murder inside the building they live in and it brought them together by chance i wont say more to make you see it we believe that it is not a waste of time to see it what you will be that i never expected that selena gomez would play so well i say this because i have never seen her act in films about steve martin and martin short i dont need to say anything,POSITIVE,Comedy
3589,4.0,19 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i hated this show because it was repetitive and boring it had two huge names in the comedy business but nothing new and drags too long and to mention selenas annoying voice,NEGATIVE,Comedy

3591,8.0,23 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i love steve martin martin short they work so great together steve martin is an amazing writer as well which is why i assume that many of the things that seem out or sorts were pushed by producershulu wanting to bring in a younger audience i also assume thats why they brought in selena because she reaches a younger demographic and has a huge fan club hence all the reviews it has potential to be a great story if they stop with all the check the box woke stuff i also feel all the profanity takes away from good dialogue when did profanity become the norm to prove your an adult show i hope the show improves but i feel the association with hulu will hinder rather than help this production they want to be edgy just to push edgy they dont really care about story content,POSITIVE,Comedy
3592,10.0,11 September 2024,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",we loved the first three seasons of only murders in the building they were fun and engaging episodes steve martin and selina had such great chemistry together so we were looking forward to season four what happened to season episodes were so very boring that we had decided not to continue watching we relented and started episode but half way through we looked at each other and said still boring we turned it off their acting was forced and lines were no longer compelling what happened to the writers whats with the diversion to a totally different location the introduction of new characters and changing the direction was just to forced and unbelievable we just cant watch it any longer the storyline went over the cliff for us which is too bad because we were fans until season four ugh,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3593,10.0,19 March 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",all thanks to the recent drama and selena gomez showing meryl streep and paul rudd that i decided to check into this show as a true crime listener too this show has everything that i love a great puzzle and question great cast and characters spot on humour and just an all out charm it is not too dark but it has the mystery set out perfectly the puzzle is not too hard but not too easy either season pilot was really well done it hook you in introduce the characters and set the mystery perfectly season has some sloppy bits the mystery is still great but some set setting is a bit off shout out to theo s ep was a standout i really like how they switch up the narrative a bit and see from other characters perspective even the dead one it makes the series a lot more interesting and less monotone episodes are perfect length too not too long or too short i also really like selenas voice in here that deep cool voice just gets me steve martin is a standout too and i dont think i see much stuffs with martin short but bunny is adorable his relationship with his son is such a breath of fresh air the son is a vet too also their a lister connection really shown here keep on bringing the other actors please im looking forward to s,POSITIVE,Comedy
3594,8.0,1 March 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",in times when tv shows are written on the wheels of political correctness this show delivers some much needed oxygen to our almost collapsed lungs not only was this a tv show i truly enjoyed watching it is filled with gems of jokes that make you lough out loud like theres no tomorrow i suspect my neighbors think im on something and i dont care i applaud all the creators for this great very human piece of work,POSITIVE,Comedy
3595,6.0,1 November 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this series is fantastic with excellent writing and a cast of characters who fit perfectly into the story line being a new yorker there are tons of people all around me who are living versions of these characters their reactions attitude and delivery is classic nyc the single exception to these assets is the inclusion of martin short the man have always been way over the top in every role he has ever attempted and this role is no exception the character is obnoxious and severely irritating which is exactly what he is supposed to be but that is precisely the normal persona of martin short every line he delivers is like fingernails on a chalkboard and makes we want to scream for the love of god please shut up,POSITIVE,Comedy
3596,8.0,3 September 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",its a show about three weirdos getting hyped on a murder which happened in a building they live in steve martin and martin short do a great job playing those two nuts they are vivid and memorable its a great duo selena gomez plays their young serious and snarky counterpart to balance it out the pacing is great narration well thoughtout every episode absorbs characters in a tiny substory revealing bit by bit the whole puzzle so even when things go sideways it pins it on personality quirks supporting characters are great too played well sell the whole story nicely its a whodunnit story made properly,POSITIVE,Comedy
3597,6.0,27 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i am a huge fan of steve martin when i was a little girl in the s i wanted to marry him thanks to the movie the jerk this show is amazing and refreshing i love all the characters i love their dynamic together martin short is hilarious he always adds such zest to whatever he is in selena gomez is actually really good if you get what kindtype of person she is portraying she will be both funny and understandable to you this show is a rare type in that i can watch multiple episodes in a row and not even want to stop binge watching as the kids call it usually i dont like watching tv at all but this show sucks me in and i cant stop watching wanting to know what the next episode has to offer the second season was as exciting as the first it was great to see shirley maclaine though i do hope that we wont be seeing any more of amy schumer there is something about her that just gets right on my last nerve i cannot wait to see what next season and any following seasons will offer,POSITIVE,Comedy
3598,1.0,15 August 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i find only murders in the building to be a fun watch a little over the top at times but that is to be expected if you have both steve martin and martin short in the same show it was that casting got me interested although the truth is i did not expect much so i was very pleasantly surprised now lets talk about selena there has been a lot of criticism of her limited acting skills and her lack of screen presence she is certainly a very famous artist for younger viewers who probably do not know the two martins so she would widen the viewer net however casting selena works on another level for me almost all the other characters in the show are almost cartoon like while silenas character is quite the opposite wooden maybe but the casting works for me i like to see her in a scene she seems to average out the energy levels of the two male leads,POSITIVE,Comedy
3599,10.0,18 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i watched cuz i like steve martin and mart short it is an amusing story with some very funny moments i loved the passive aggresdive exchange btwn the the m short character and the president of the apartment abot his late fees but i personally do not like the very slow pacing basically they are takingvthe time to give bak story for character development this will not appeal to somebody that wants to get into the mystery clues right away i wstched episodes and probably will not continue i admit tho once we kno the characters there might be a very big enhanced payoff but not gonna invest that much time however it might appeal to ppl that like the leisurely detective pace and want to really digest the dialogue,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3600,9.0,4 November 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",what a fantastic performance by the lead actors each role had its own arc and different from each other thats what it makes so interesting comic timing of lead actors are impeccable its very fun to watch and hilarious all seasons had great story lines and performance was very consistent expected the unexpected any time screenplay was excellent i am eagerly waiting for season to release hope they release early hope they make season even more interesting in solving the murder music is very suitable to all the situations and does not feel strange at all finally a great watch,POSITIVE,Comedy
3601,10.0,29 January 2024,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i liked the two first seasons the first one is still the best one but the third season is really exhausting to watch oliver is the most annoying character i have come across in a really long time he is really ruining the show for me and after episodes into the third season i had to drop watching the show the narcissism selfentitlement and lack of respect for other people are just too much however i think selena gomez does an amazing job and has the most interesting character but unfortunately her performance is being ruined by loud and attentionseeking oliver its really sad the show has potential but it should focus more on solving the crime and less in olivers shenanigans,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3602,10.0,10 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",these reviews are obviously fake i love martin short and steve martin but this show is bad i like them in it but selena gomez is seriously the worst actress ive ever seen she is a so very boring in every scene with no expression and no intonation in her voice initially i thought it was supposed to be a joke but it never got any better at all there is no chemistry between them and her then the story itself is not very compelling its too slow,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3603,9.0,30 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i wont spoil this for anyone this series is just brilliant two seasons in and season two finished just as strong as season one ive always loved steve martin and as usual he is brilliant but i think that martin shaw just about steals the show with his brilliant eccentric character however all three of the leads selena gomez really shines and is equally as funny as the other two and the supporting cast are equally great there isnt anything like it around at the moment and i think thats a very good thing a breath of fresh air and its great to see martin and shaw still at it comedy geniuses cant wait for season three a must watch,POSITIVE,Comedy
3604,10.0,23 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",loved this so refreshing to finally watch something that made me smile and laugh out loud classic steve martin and martin short witty humor plot was also fun and kept me interested steve martin and selena had great chemistry looking forward to season,POSITIVE,Comedy

3607,10.0,2 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",ive seen the first three episodes and this is a show for everyone very enjoyable so far its easy to watch with a nice tone and upbeat storytelling and of course the three main actors are excellent they play really well off each other and including selena gomez was smart i get some alex from wizards vibes here which is a good thing that was why we all fell in love with her to begin with rating it an as i binged all three available episodes it kept my attention and made me feel general happiness which is a bonus in todays world i like the main mystery and i am wondering more about the story they could move a bit quicker with actual pieces of the mystery though a few more twists would be fine its not laugh out loud funny but i had several chuckles btw the reviews here a bit much the gushing bestevershow ratings are all from oneshow reviewers which is suspect of course im sure hulu had to put some money into paying three big name actors so trying to push this to a higher rating perhaps for popularity it happens on here for most shows but this seems to have more of those kinds of reviews than usual fyi watch out for the only one show reviewed reviews i wish they would let this one speak for itself its doing just fine,POSITIVE,Comedy
3608,10.0,8 September 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",only murders in the building is trying to ride the relatively recent booming fascination with true crime stories specifically those told through the audio format i did enjoy the first few episodes the surprises and twists were well timed and kept me engaged and then the entire middle of the season slowed way down and i got bored steve martin carried the show he did a great job and seemed to be having a blast in his role selena gomez was enjoyable to watch as the new york millennial but goodness does she have a monotone voice ill never know how shes such a great singer with a talking voice that is as flat as kansas finally martin short perhaps he was doing an excellent job perhaps his instructions were be the most annoying neighbor you can think of so annoying that you even irk the audience but either way i did not enjoy him or his character in the show ill stick around for a couple episodes of season or maybe ill just listen to a true crime podcast,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3609,10.0,2 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i felt like i was watching paint dry with this show it felt so fabricated underwhelming and annoying and the actors were nothing special,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3610,9.0,2 February 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",there is some really great comedic acting and that includes not just steve martin and martin short who is overthetop as usual but in a great way but also selena gomez who surprised me as being an equal partner in the effort the straight man is the hardest part and while shes not always in that role shes quite brilliant,POSITIVE,Comedy
3611,7.0,30 June 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",but god is the cara delevingne character just completely cringe and kills the whole vibe of the show horrible edition i could really do without amy schumer too,NEGATIVE,Comedy

3613,9.0,31 August 2024,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",so i just started watching this show on thursday and i started watching it at the beginning season episode and i am now on season episode i know that i am behind as season just started but i be caught up in no time i love this show so far it is really funny oliver is always so random and mabel or charles is usually so excited to join him in what hes doing i also like how the dead characters are part of the story and they have their own episode telling their own life stories giving background information on them along with helping to let the audience just exactly how these people ended up living in the building and how they all tie into the story and how they began to know each other selena gomez martin short and steve martin make a funny team and with a huge difference in their ages along with the randomness of short paired with comebacks from gomez are just hilarious i would recommend anyone who hasnt watched it to watch it you because you wont regret it,POSITIVE,Comedy
3614,10.0,16 March 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",with everything thats been going on i recently found out selena is on this new tv show i was extremely excited but im not gonna lie the character they created in this show is a bit dry like wendy adams vibes but in the worse way script for this character is dead inside each episode everyone is great but mabel just seems extremely depressed and medicated i dont know if thats part of her character yet im only on episode but its just so hard to watch i literally just want to wrap her up in a cozy blanket with a bunch of snacks surrounding her watching great classic films maybe this show could bring in a character from the past a best friend who was forced to move away and now shes come back to help mabel with the podcast each day she brings mables charter back to life i would love to see that would love that for mabel would love to see mabel get therapy and have a break through in getting her life back it would be great to see her character blossom into something beautiful finding meaning in life team selena you shine brighter than all the stars team taylor,POSITIVE,Comedy

3616,8.0,1 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i was expecting more from steve martin didnt expect much from martin short or selena gomez tbh but it was all the same steve martinmartin short bashing each other with selena gomez trying to balance the act with her over the top dramatic face expressions and lack of comedy timing when needed this was expensive production so they could have invested in better writing at least but no the story flow is hectic with change of rhythm and pace all the time dialogues are lacing point and timing al the time it looks like somebody really neglected post production and paid ratings with score and with same format of a title and text are over the top and tasteless imdb should remove those especially if they come from spam accounts three star out of pure generosity sorry steve,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3617,9.0,18 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this is a great woody allenesque mystery but cmon im not at all familiar with selena gomez and probably for good reason she is way out of her league along side martin and short im sure they could have found a better young actress for the part,POSITIVE,Comedy
3618,1.0,27 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the best show in the history of modern television clean and yet absolutely hilarious i cant find any fault in it except for selena gomezs acting she her dialogue delivery in particular is annoying to put up with but the rest of the cast help you ignore her season one is flawless season two doesnt start as promising but by the finale youd see the genius they outdid themselves in the final episode martin short is amazing throughout the series there is no moment in the show with him in it thats disappointing in a nutshell if you are looking for some fun family entertainment that will lift you up this is the one to watch,POSITIVE,Comedy
3619,7.0,23 February 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",as of lately out of the things there is to watch this show have some good acting so many things out there with horrible acting makes it seem like good acting is no longer a criteria for being in movies and shows the acting in this is superb thank goodness,POSITIVE,Comedy
3620,10.0,9 July 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",believe me when i say the series is worth watching as soon as i watched the first episode i knew that its gonna be good i have been a true crime fanatic for a long time yes they are usually more serious but this is weird in a good way and can i say its really cute watching the guys steve martin and martin short are legends for a reason im a big fan of selena gomez but shes completely different here but she does add some class to the series the episodes are not long but they really hook you up a perfect binge i watched the two seasons twice so definitely worth the buck waiting for season,POSITIVE,Comedy

3629,10.0,13 August 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",only murders in the building hasnt been extremely popular with the people i engage with i can name exactly one person that watched it who made me watch it ive came across this show a few times i hadnt read about it or seen any trailers but the cast made it interesting enough for me to try and give this a chance and then i finally did the show has a whats going to happen next or who is going to get killed next vibe but set more in modern times through their podcast i must say i loved it from the first episode but i got instantly hooked after episode i have a very short attention spam and for me to binge something it has to be really good which i think this show was steve martin is great martin short is absolute brilliant and brings such a great dose of humor to the show and i got an unexpected crush on selena gomez who is just great in this without spoiling too much youll have thoughts and suspects throughout the show you suspect the show to be a funny dark comedy but the storyline is actually written very well might not be for everyone but im a fan will probably rewatch season soon as i called my mom last night after i finished the last episode of season just watched the trailer for season and i very excited a bit afraid its not going to be nearly as good as the first season was but i guess were just going to have to wait and see,POSITIVE,Comedy

3631,5.0,9 August 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",only murders in the building is a fun show that prioritizes entertainment over whatever is going on with most current shows the chemistry between the lead actors is super fun to watch the humor works for me and the mysteries albeit sometimes a bit farfetched are truly interesting and compelling i dont really know anything about selena gomez but shes really good in this show i love her characters dry sarcasm and her facial expressions are gold i cant wait to watch season right away i truly hope the show will not be milked until the quality starts to decline and instead gets a thrilling and worthy ending good endings these days seem to be a relict of the past,POSITIVE,Comedy
3632,9.0,2 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",lower rating for this really fun show is because of two things one is the darkness seems like it was made during a power outage second the volume it was necessary to put the volume up all the way but when the commercials came on it was earbreaking loud other than that a great fun show,POSITIVE,Comedy
3633,9.0,13 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",love everything about this show my husband and i literally count down the days until a new episode drops i will say the first season was a little predictable but oddly i didnt mind that very much with this show definitely recommend thai show,POSITIVE,Comedy
3634,10.0,10 May 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this is a fun binge worthy seriesthe story and acting was super until the rather contrived and downer of the last episodethat ruined it for me it seems martin went overboard for a trick ending that was pointless,POSITIVE,Comedy
3635,10.0,2 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i tried to like it i really did it is so slow and drags the dialog and plot is very repetitive especially selena gomezs frequently ill timed dropping of the f bomb just for shock value cant see how they are dragging this out over episodes the plot seems to be going nowhere,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3636,9.0,4 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",like the opening credits imply this show feels like a love letter to new york and what happens when they dont mind their business the characters are fun and it strikes a good balance between mystery and humor steve martin and martin short give standout performances and the story will keep you guessing until the end,POSITIVE,Comedy
3637,7.0,20 December 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the only bit i didnt like about this was martin shorts characters state of life that plot has gotten old in every sense of word that out of the way everything else was just amazing the title of review meant that i could watch it thrice once for chemistry second time for drawings and third time for music oh so music do enjoy,POSITIVE,Comedy
3638,10.0,10 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this show provides an old school whodunnit mystery series the story is lighthearted and entertaining it narrates the story without the usual cliché features of popular murder mysteries these days have martin steve and selena form a perfect trio with a good chemistry there characters are very relatable though the show is advertised as a comedy the characters are portrayed in a very realistic way with naturalistic acting overall it is a very entertaining relatable light hearted mystery series,POSITIVE,Comedy
3639,6.0,25 August 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",finally more us shows with heft good acting etc i do feel the use of profanity feels both unnecessary and actually distracts from the quality of the show it doesnt feel right and certainly doesnt contribute to the entertainment value i guess what im saying is it feels gratuitous that said im enjoying the story lines characters and of course seeing two faves from my teen years martin and steve icons to be sure but they also work so well in this show i wasnt sure about it at first but was hooked by the the third episode selena does a nice job too although maybe a bit lacklusterthough i dont have any experience with her talents to base anything on,NEGATIVE,Comedy

3641,10.0,4 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",im suprised of how entertaining it was for me since im not that much into true crime and i could say its one of my favourite shows to watch currently the characters are very interesting and fun to get to know i would recommend the show especially for those who are into solving mysteries,POSITIVE,Comedy
3642,10.0,17 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",both the writing and the dialog are superb i wish all of hollywood would spend this much time and effort on the craft i had to pull my wife who hates obscenities into the room to watch teddy dimas threaten oliver at the elevator so many movies overuse the fword that it loses its punch but in this case it was so perfect,POSITIVE,Comedy
3643,8.0,28 March 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",wouldve given this show an easy but selena gomez has so little emotion in her acting and doesnt seem to put any effort into her lines however if you can pretend gomez is as good as everyone else it makes for a highly entertaining show,POSITIVE,Comedy

3646,10.0,11 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",im only watching it because martin short holds my interest and has some good scenes steve martin is decent in this they could have written more witty banter between these two though to help this show but my goodness selena gomez cannot act shes just horrible just vapid with a monotone weird voice that never varies tone she acts medicated she has absolutely no spark about her whatsoever very dull actress and i use the term actress loosely here even her timing and physical movements in some scenes are just off and very unnatural looking it would have been better had they cast her role to someone better shes definitely the weak link in this one and unfortunately shes a big part of this show they also swear a lot in this show in certain parts and it seems out of place and forced like oh lets drop in a bunch of f bombs to look hip and cool it was completely unnecessary and got tiring,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3647,7.0,23 April 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",in a time of rebuilding after the pandemic were all under a lot of stress theres alot if garbage on streaming that promises you an escape but just disrespects your time and intelligence only exacerbating the ptsd were all struggling with this show is that much desired escape its smart and funny with acting that effortlessly pops off the screen the chemistry between steve marty and selena is perfect its truly an ensemble piece the endless line of cameos and amazing side characters leaves you hungry for the next minutes the mystery is actually intriguing and unfolds at just the right pace do yourself a favor and watch this,POSITIVE,Comedy

3650,10.0,25 October 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the cast is amazing the dynamic of the characters are so unique and beautiful some of the comments mentioned how selena was not quite right for the part and how annoying her character sometime was etc well i think thats the whole point that make the friendship of the three so unique and funny i personally think selena has been great at portraying mabel she is fun moody quirky a bit annoying a bit ignorance and yet very charming and most importantly the character is very so relatable to the current demographic saying that though i do want to see the character evolved more season seems to be different from the first two and i can see its not everyones taste but again the whole cast was amazing,POSITIVE,Comedy
3651,9.0,3 September 2024,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i absolutely adore only murders in the building each character brings something uniquely delightful to the table steve martin as charles showcases brilliant comedic timing with his deadpan delivery and hilarious expressions especially that confused look he gets when he realizes hes in a murder mystery his attempts to be cool often lead to adorably awkward moments that are just pure gold martin short as oliver brings a whirlwind of energy with his snorts and exaggerated expressions making every scene entertaining he balances being hilariously selfabsorbed with genuine care for his friends selena gomez as mabel adds a refreshing touch with her dry humor and relatable cynicism keeping the guys grounded while delivering spoton comebacks together they create a charming dynamic that not only keeps you laughing but also makes the show feel uplifting and engaging unlike typical crime stories the mix of humor and real themes makes only murders in the building a delightful watch what sets this show apart from typical crime stories is its lighthearted approach it manages to keep viewers entertained and uplifted even as it delves into serious themes like friendship and loneliness the chemistry between the three leads is fantastic creating moments that are both hilarious and heartfelt their quirky personalities and comedic timing elevate the mood making the show feel less like a standard crime drama and more like a fun adventure each season introduces new mysteries and twists ensuring that it never feels boring the clever writing and engaging plotlines keep you guessing while also making you laugh proving that crime can be both thrilling and enjoyable,POSITIVE,Comedy

3653,8.0,19 January 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i love steve martin martin short and selena gomez period beginning right from naming of this series it is a sheer work of geniuses as the name suggests it is based on murder mystery and with the top names to the tag one can expect nothing but a masterpiece the story is pretty slow in the beginning and picks up in around th episode but let me assure you that it keeps you glued throughout because of the cracking jokes and amazing acting done by martin short steve martin selena gomez nathan lane amy ryan and the rest i personally feel that there should be more cracking jokes added to the story which will make it definitely more appealing plus a more challenging plot would be welcoming as i had already guessed the murderer and just like me other people would too the writing is wonderful and i give credit to the directors who have done an amazing job with the twisting plot and keeping the things moving it is a refreshing series and i highly recommend to watch it with a mug of hot coffee snuggled together with a loved one on a comfortable couch at night i am giving it stars as there is still a potentiality to improve to make this show skyrocket up up and away bravo,POSITIVE,Comedy
3654,10.0,22 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the storyline is good but i enjoyed the character interactions as much as the plot which has a few twists and turns great chemistry between the cast steve martin and martin short play their parts perfectly with gomez masterfully pulling off the difficult snarky mean loner who is actually very likeable role i wanted to know about the characters from the very start perfect pacing makes this an extra joy to watch cant wait to jump into season,POSITIVE,Comedy
3655,10.0,13 September 2024,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i loved the central place of the heritage apartment building called the arconia in the first two seasonsit is like a character in itself that seems to drop off somewhat in season when another venue begins to steal the show i was pleasantly surprised by meryl streeps singing ability demonstrated in season everyone knows her acting talent but i hadnt known of that extra talent in her back pocket i have to agree with reviewers who have commented on selena gomez performance her nasal and expressionless voice especially bringing down the shows quality i just finished season and have found her increasingly irritating as time goes on unfortunately with the three amigos scenario built into the series there just wouldnt be a way to replace her i have assumed gomez is in the cast to add a little youth appeal because steve martin and martin short are older actors but wow this performer is a distraction because she isnt up to the level of the rest of the cast i have continued watching despite her seeming like a fish out of water or the elephant in the room i will watch the season episodes that are out already and decide if i want to spend another months streaming subscription fee to watch it to that seasons end,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3656,6.0,26 September 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",my expectations were high after all the positive reactions almost a hype that arose around the series but unfortunately this series absolutely could not ignite with me and it does not even come close to the hype i tried to like it and almost struggled through the episodes it was supposed to be fun funny and engaging but unfortunately everything seems so forced to make it extraordinary creative ways are taken the suspects are put on a stage or there is an episode that takes place completely without speech only background noise and sign language with subtitles but all this doesnt help make it more entertaining because the overall pace is so slow that it was just insanely boring the three characters charles oliver and mabel already seem to harmonize with each other but honestly it seems like a last desperate gasp for relevance for martin short and steve martin sadly it ends up being ridiculous and cheap selenas one dimensional acting adds nothing to the series she has a single facial expression and i could not detect any acting talent in her in this series she delivers her lines so monotonously that she lacks any comedic timing the plot is nonsensical and swings awkwardly between boring drama and flat comedy the action is slow and the dialogues are stilted an arc of suspense isnt built up as everything is talked over and over again the focus is too much on the three characters with their backgrounds and the podcast project the resolution at the end seems very farfetched and not comprehensible the series commits one of the biggest writing mistakes possible it explains too much it even explains the comedy instead of being funny it all comes together jokes that could still make it into the s poor casting tired terrible script that tries to fit a joke everywhere even with the cliffhangers at the end of each episode its still boring and dialogue that could be from a school play in addition music that goes in the direction of musical with which i can not do so much the story progresses unbearably slowly becoming uninteresting over time the last episode of the first season ends with a cliffhanger that you have to watch the second season if you want to know the resolution i have only watched half of the second season so far and will not continue unless i have to in addition fans of the first season are disappointed by the second and third and the reviews are getting worse thus it will probably not get better for me conclusion annoying not funny not exciting its not even particularly interesting but was a disappointment,NEGATIVE,Comedy

3662,8.0,14 September 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i love this show so funny in a mature sophisticated way its great to see martin short and steve martin together and selina gomez really holds her own shes much better than i expected the other characters in the building are so diverse but feel real and kooky there are so many great actors in the show and they keep bringing in more i was not expecting it to be so enjoyable and after the first season i didnt expect the second to be as good but it is the writing is quite clever the show even has excellent sound tracks they find the perfect songs for each episode even my yo son likes the show its nice we can still share a show together,POSITIVE,Comedy
3663,8.0,4 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this is no doubt a great cast of characters however selena gomez has zero layers of emotion or depth if she is playing the straight women she is too straight annoyingly so which is disappointing because she is so cute and i find myself waiting yearning for some display of likability amy schumer ugh worst casting ever this women exhudes pertension in everything she does the second season is quickly disappointing but ill keep watching because steve martin and martin short are everything,NEGATIVE,Comedy

3667,10.0,19 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this team couldnt be better together the holes in the plot can easily be overlooked by the chemistry of the three lead actors i am overly concerned about the end i was a little distracted by the herpes on the face of one actor playing a minor role,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3668,7.0,27 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this show is so well written and every week has yet another turn ive always found martin short to be annoying but he is absolutely prefect in this role i do believe like so many others have stated that the role of mabel is better suited for another actress selena brings no life to the part at all and then theres steve martinand who doesnt love him from metaking one star off for the monotone and lifeless portrayal of mabel,POSITIVE,Comedy
3669,9.0,27 November 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the series is about a murder in an expensive piece of residential real estate in new york called the arconiaor at least our three strangers turned podcasters think its a murder the police think it is a straightforward suicide the three strangers played by steve martin martin short and selena gomez all live in the building and are brought together during a fire alarm because of their love of a true crime podcast the podcast is done by a character played by tina fey everything is not ok in oklahoma when the three of them discover there has been a death in the building they decide to come together to solve itand naturally do a podcast about it amazing cameos and wonderful melancholy storylineseveryone seems to be hiding something which is a great set up for a whodoneit i loved the characters and i thought the casting was excellent i had never heard of selena gomez but i loved her in this it is very light going with a scattering of jokes and mild drama there is the odd speciality episode like the one without any spoken dialogue other reviewers have stated that although alright this is not as great as people make out technically they are absolutely right it isnt ground shattering stuff but as a fan of the likes of monk jonathan creek rizzoli isles it feels like there has not been anything new in the same vein for quite a while this is good honest light sleuthy fun and the smile on my face as i watched every episode justifies my star rating alone edit season season starts of very shaky with some clumsy attempts at humour that dont land and amy schumer stomping through the middle of the plot like a bull at a tea party but by episode it is all back on track well done out of found this helpful,POSITIVE,Comedy

3672,10.0,1 February 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i have the utmost respect for martin short and steve martin class act witty humour they are the old wine and caviar in this show and next to them a bag of chips because thats what young people eat they brought selena because they wanted to expand the target audience she was pretty good in disney has some nice songs but here or maybe who knows she is supposed to act that bad her character is so bland and she had to act it the same then damn she nailed it anyhow the weight of the show is carried by the precious stones of the classic comedy steve martin short and because of them im rating this show stars,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3673,8.0,3 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",martin and short are fantastic but selinas voice ruins it i dont know if this is how she always sounds but it just grates on my nerves when she talks the storyline is good i just wish theyd found any other actress,POSITIVE,Comedy

3676,7.0,4 August 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i havent quite made it through the first season yet what caught my like most im sure attention was the age old martinshort team coming back together it was great to see some comedic heavy hitters in something a little different it feels like mystery of the show is just as much who the murder is as it is what famous person will show up next although i realize we live in an age where so many ideas have already been done i couldnt ignore what felt like an obvious nod to the first season of sarah koenigs serial podcast the music tinas feys character the idea of regularish citizens making a podcast attempting to get to the bottom of a murder mystery its pretty clear and it felt a tad played out if youve heard the podcast given that we seem to live in an age where good ideas have mostly been done and feesh takes can be difficult to find each episode being presented from a different characters perspective i thought i was clever the show was very well done but i couldnt quite seem to get completely sucked in from the start like i imagined i might but ill keep watching out of curiosity,POSITIVE,Comedy
3677,8.0,8 December 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i loved the humour and the warmth you feel watching the characters interact our detectives are an odd ensemble of very different personalities all of them keeping their painful past experiences secret from one another but as they are bound together by the mystery they are trying to solve they end up helping each other heal i feel this series really could have been a if only well if only the actual crime mystery was a bit more compelling the rare combination of warmth and comedy with crime brings to mind the film knives out and its not a favourable comparison to only murders in the building in my opinion whereas knives out was an agatha christiestyle whodunnit where everyone was a suspect for the greater part of it only murders in the building dumbs the mystery down by tackling only one piece of the puzzle at a time and mostly resolving it before introducing another lead resulting in a structure thats rather linear and not particularly stimulating to the viewers brain cells regardless i am looking forward to the second season if it improves on this one aspect the show may become something really great,POSITIVE,Comedy
3678,10.0,17 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",martin short and steve martin are comedic revelations in this i could care less about selena gomez i think she wasnt bad for the role but anyone could have replaced her and it would have been fine but the two geezers they show every wannabe supposed comedian out there how its really done so damn funny they are brilliant and im so glad they did this show,POSITIVE,Comedy
3679,10.0,21 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i swear like a sailor i often have to check myself but the profanity in this show feels like the writers were trying to squeeze them in at every moment like yearolds who just learned how to swear and dont think there are any adults in hearing distance its forced and unnecessary and just plain awkward at moments quite distracting unfortunately the storyline and acting itself ehim just in it for steve martin and martin short i just love em,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3680,8.0,25 November 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this just came up as an auto play on after something else i was watching so i thought id give it a go im so glad i stumbled upon this cause its one of my favourite shows ive ever watched i loved it as soon as i watched the first episode everything about it is just so great the perfect soundtrack the excellent acting the extremely likeable and comical characters and the cosy feel of old architecture and poirotesque mystery solving seamlessly blended with a modern setting and storyline i love it this is definitely going to be something i watch multiple times due in large part simply to the cosy and familiar feel it has to it and its extremely loveable characters,POSITIVE,Comedy
3681,10.0,22 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",as many have already pointed out the story is ok there are fbombs left and right are totally unnecessary too bad it would have been good clean family fun,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3682,6.0,14 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",not interesting at all watch it only if you like the people in it,POSITIVE,Comedy

3685,2.0,23 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i really enjoyed this steve martin and selena made a great ragtag trio lose the forced swearing and i would have given it a seriously it didnt add anything to an otherwise great comedy,POSITIVE,Comedy
3686,8.0,15 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this review is written after watching episodes of the show from season and from season i cant pick out more than one or two flaws from this show everything is very well done especially loved the chemistry of the main trio the intro scoreif you have listened to serial youll know the production design and the cinematography the plot is more than just good enough and it keeps you guessing im definitely looking forward to the coming episodes,POSITIVE,Comedy
3687,10.0,4 March 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",very enjoyable indeed in the same vein as the aniston sandler murder mystery with the nods to the genre and the current craze for true crime this is a fun drama the three leads are excellently carved out by what seem like an unlikely trio but which works even better for the pathos generated for the lead characters you like them pity them envy them at times all of which make this a very watchable programme the many cameos enhance rather than detract it does seem like a whos who of tv and film which makes it feel like a weighty piece of tv not as frothy as it might seem which everyone wanted to be a part of enjoy,POSITIVE,Comedy
3688,10.0,9 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i love this show steve martin and martin short are such a great pair and to add a rockstar like selena gomez is absolutely brilliant season one will have you guessing and season two is just as good extremely well written the actors hit their mark everytime and the feel of the set is very cozy the only thing about this show i dont like is amy shumer she is disgusting horrible at acting truly isnt funny and does not mesh well with anyone one this show she unfortunately ruins every thing she is in,POSITIVE,Comedy
3689,9.0,30 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",its very obvious that selena gomez is the star of this show i am not a fan of her but i just love her there her voice and everything about her just seem well fitted there despite the popular stars this overall show is not a star yet well the plot is actually pretty interesting and i keep waiting more suprises so it would be more attractive but after completing all episodes i must admit this is only an average show its not bad but its also not something that you must add into your watch list,POSITIVE,Comedy
3690,10.0,17 June 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",that if you want to take your series to the next level go with seasoned pros who can deliver their lines better than amazon delivers parcels awesome,POSITIVE,Comedy
3691,8.0,25 February 2024,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",like martin short in only murders in the building i too have an uncomfortable relationship with dips haha love these two together on and off screen and selena plays well off of them as a voice of reason and to remind them of their age the mysteries themselves are great but its the characters and one liners that keep me coming back to this show i cannot wait for season and and hopefully steve martin doesnt decide to retire earlier than that steve do not do that to us please have enjoyed all their press theyve been doing together and i get a sense that they are both like this with each other in real life make more of these as soon as possible,POSITIVE,Comedy
3692,7.0,30 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",they should have not dropped the f word so needlessly or made an entire episode just about lesbians if they hadnt this would have been a really fun family show but as it is i would not watch this with children,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3693,8.0,1 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",wholly detestable snobs as main characters out of touch with the real world if this is what you think it is to be a new yorker then you have never been to the city all three characters are mary sues there only problems are in their own imaginations fairy tale tripe im saddened by the rave reviews,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3694,7.0,28 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i love it i long for it every week once a week cruelty in its most brutal form i have no idea why i love it so much but its like delicious macaroni cheese not the best meal every created but one thats full of flavour and makes you feel comfy cosy and full thanks team,POSITIVE,Comedy
3695,9.0,23 March 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this show is excellent and i knew it would become a big old comforting friend from thje moment i saw the trailer its so hard to find gentle comedies these days that the whole family can curl up and enjoy but murders hits the mark straight on and has become such a firm favouritre in our house with us and our kids i like plenty of dark drama just come off euphoria and started swarm but stuff that the whole family can watch is thin on the ground the only comparable show i can think of that does the same as murders is ted lassoo and given hom much we crave a bit of time out from the world of stress and worry i do wonder why the tv companiesstreamers dont give us more of this sort of content the cast are amazing and ther writing is crisp and clean and often hiolarious its the perfect binge watch for anyone who needs a bit of time away for anyone who loves a good detectivecrimemystery story but cant handle too much darkness this is the perfect bingewatch,POSITIVE,Comedy
3696,8.0,28 November 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",when i signed up with disney to watch doctor who i was very keen to watch always sunny and only murders i gave up watching the former but binged three seasons of the latter its difficult to explain whats so good about it because on paper it probably shouldnt work but i think its got something for everyone a little drama with a load of goodnatured humour there is obvious longstanding chemistry between steve martin and martin short but selena gomez fits very nicely in their clique i like how some actors play characters eg meryl streep while others play themselves eg matthew broderick and they all do a wonderful job of it i was also very impressed with performances by nathan lane and james caverly,POSITIVE,Comedy
3697,8.0,14 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",season one was a bro it was wellbalanced with suspense wellthoughtout plot character development and great comedy but season idk the guest actors were mostly a different vibe and it seems theyre spending too much attention on just goofing around and not advancing the plot anymore,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3698,8.0,9 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i wished they could tone down the profanity just a bit i mean they are not necessary it is such a great show even if the profanity was toned gown or removed completely anyway thats just an opinion great tv series with a great cast im enjoying it,POSITIVE,Comedy
3699,10.0,12 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i dont understand the rave in the media was promising first few episodes i had hope as first episodes usually start off rocky sometimes but it went into a flat dull not clear mess im shocked that it was allowed further how come were hearing about season waste of money and screen time in my opinion,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3700,10.0,21 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",love the characters and roller coaster story line very disappointed with the continual crude language its hard to believe that anyone cant talk intelligently without using fuing this every other sentence,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3701,7.0,19 February 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",great show but what the is greek holocaust hollywood please dont invent holocausts to get investment from minorities its a fun show great acting nice story but why do you have to implement a made up subliminal message into it whats the historical document or legal backings of such hoax as greek holocaust hollywood is very enthusiastic about lies blaming any country that not christian,POSITIVE,Comedy
3702,9.0,23 January 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the show has a nice but selena ruined it at the beginning i thought that her character was supposed to be the way she acted but eventually it was just bad acting,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3703,7.0,8 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the first episode was a decent draw to the show with the martins a colorful new york palette and a titillating mystery however as the episodes have gone on you realize there is really nothing of substance there the murder mystery isnt sold well enough the characters arent that interesting it flipflops awkwardly between boring drama and flat comedy the plot is slow and the dialogue is stilted to add insult to injury selena gomez is terrible im not sure how much the critics are getting paid to praise her performance but she is completely wooden monotone and emotionless she cant even muster up as much energy as her yearold counterparts im not sure who made the decision to cast her but she is definitely wrong for the part and wrong for the acting world this shows only saving grace is that it has brightness and color unlike most shows within the last decade and the martins do manage to make me smile at points,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3704,3.0,14 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",if anyone ever doubted the acting power of martin short this will blow you away he is full of character and all emotions made me truly feel what he was feeling steve martin has always been a favorite of mine and hes brilliant in this too selena who ive followed since waverly place is good too as a hearty listener to true crime podcasts i can appreciate the timing of this show and im invested in the murder,POSITIVE,Comedy
3705,10.0,8 September 2024,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",wow this is awsome but i had to give it a second try i gave up after episodes the first timethis show has evrything its funny twist and turns drama and murder mysteries and so many great caracthers and guest rolesi am also a huge steve martin fan thowso i gave this a because i could not stop watching it not that often a tv show do that to the viewers anymorei hope for many more seasons only negative was it starts a little slow beside that perfectalso a perfect cast dident know who selena gomez was but she is very good topepole behind the camera to did a great job with this one,POSITIVE,Comedy
3706,9.0,1 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i have no idea how police in this universe is able to convict anyone when this trio is constantly touching and sharing evidence other than that ive enjoyed season one a lot binged it and was excited for season two but its not as exciting i dont know if they should have kept this show as a mini series or if its because im not a fan of amy schumer also selenas relationship with caras character is awkward to me theres no passion between them,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3707,8.0,12 March 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this was super entertaining and the trio was perfect steve martin as always hilarious and perfect timing the whole plot was interesting and hooked you from the first episode the whole aesthetic and the background music was the highlight of this show its a light murder mystery without showing much violence or gore scenes but still with all the twists and thrills even the light hearted can definitely give it a try those who dont like murder mystery thrillers might find this an exception cant wait for season,POSITIVE,Comedy
3708,9.0,2 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i just started to watch it and its a very charming series i love the humour and style story is great and it really just feels like home to watch steve martin and martin short doing comedy together,POSITIVE,Comedy
3709,9.0,22 April 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",you will remember the comedy possibly for life but will forget the plot who the murderer was and more importantly the godawful acting more of a comedy show than a murder mystery i only remember laughing out loud especially at steve martins and amy ryans love story plot which was soooo funnyscant believe steve martin is still funny i loved him since i was a kid watching pink panther so im glad to find that i still love his comedy even as an adult the acting otherwise in the series is very questionable feels like were watching a nickelodeon show but since the show is lighthearted i feel like perhaps that was intentional to have bad performance like selina gomezs acting looks like she is still acting in wizard of waverly and that can also be said about other actors in the series as they all were terrible as a whole which could also be down to the implausible plot which made their acting even less convincing however all of the horrible acting and even the plots with so many holes were saved by the genius comedy that has been written into and laced throughout the series i laughed out loud literally so many times than i could count in this show even though the story and acting was below average i will return for future seasons just for the comedy,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3710,10.0,22 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",so this is a light crime drama that doesnt follow the same formula that every tv show follows the dynamic between the main characters seems to gel better as the episodes progress im keen to see where this goes and how much life it has for future seasons selena gomez wasnt someone who i thought would have taken this role but i think its a good choice for her as for the two legends not a disappointment at all im throughly enjoying seeing these guys back on the screen again,POSITIVE,Comedy
3711,6.0,29 January 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i love steve martin short this show had so much potential just not quite good enough story wasnt wellwritten enough to be a solid mystery the comedy wasnt onpoint enough to be a solid comedy also does selena gomez have another facial expression i didnt hate it just was mostly disappointed about how much better it could have been,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3712,5.0,26 August 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",omitb is just so entertaining i binged watched season and these last few days and im so eager to watch season i see there are only episodes out and i stuck between wanting to wait till all episodes are out because i dont want it to end and wanting to jump right on to the next season because i just cant get enough of it and i cant see myself in the mood to watch anything else funny thing is i dont usually enjoy murder mysteries or even podcasts but im loving everything about this show the main characters are so entertaining to watch i find myself laughing and laughing and laughing chemistry between actors is on point and oh the soundtrack the soundtrack theres just something about it that i enjoy so so much,POSITIVE,Comedy
3713,8.0,5 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",its simple and its good really enjoyed it a different kind of genre a light hearted funny suspense thrillerwould be looking forward for season,POSITIVE,Comedy
3714,10.0,5 November 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i resisted this show because i have never been a big fan of martin short until now dramedy seems to really fit him i have found myself laughing out loud many times at him his delivery is impeccable and his humour is clever not his typical slapstick humour though in fairness i havent seen his full repertoire steve martin is quirky and likeable and selena gomez is fascinating to watch she can act and her unique voice understated persona and irresistible outfits are all captivating if youre out of things to watch as i was give it a try you may be pleasantly surprised too you may even binge it,POSITIVE,Comedy
3715,8.0,22 June 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i dont know what it is about this series that works but it does its not solely a mystery and not exactly a comedy its like a cozy mystery the kind of show you can curl up with on a cold night and a cup of hot chocolate i cannot wait for season,POSITIVE,Comedy
3716,9.0,2 October 2024,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this is an amazing series it perhaps is a bit of a mood thing but the interplay between the three leads short gomez and steve martin is brilliant martin short is particularly spectacular in it and the selena gomez eyeroll and tech savvy young lady is golden its just a sensational series brilliantly acted and brilliantly filmed and it strikes me as a whos who of broadway actors i havent done the deep dive on the background of a lot of the actors and actresses sensational dialogue and very quick witted with references to other people actors you cant make comedy better than this really really great its superb,POSITIVE,Comedy
3717,10.0,1 February 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",one of the best tv shows ive ever seen and ive seen many it had me at the edge of my sit the entire time i binged the whole thing in one night of how caught in the plot i was the acting the cinematography the character development the outfits everything was amazing,POSITIVE,Comedy
3718,7.0,22 January 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i enjoyed this a lot i love that the rowdies are short which is rare these days steve martin and martin short are hilarious and work so well together selena gomez was good and the three of them together have great chemistry i laughed out loud a few times and giggled a lot so many great one liners mostly by short the mystery was good with lots of twists it was a fun ride a few tiny plot holes but nothing worth noting the supporting cast were all quite good too with lots of fun cameos that i wont ruin in case you arent aware yet this is a cute funny show with mystery thats easy to binge watch,POSITIVE,Comedy
3719,8.0,28 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",ive been wanting to watch this for a while and im so glad i have started it ive never found steve martin so funny this is a must,POSITIVE,Comedy
3720,5.0,1 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",if you like silly fantasy plots cool set design and scenes of nyc then you might enjoy this good cast for sure but they cannot compensate for lame writing i only watched the first episode but that was enough to put me off i cannot bear to watch episode maybe it is trying to be a wes anderson type production if so its a miss as i did not even chuckle once the only justification i can see for watching this is that there is so little to stream now that is new because of covid,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3721,10.0,21 November 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",only murders in the building is an american comedy mystery television series created by steve martin and john hoffman the plot follows three strangers played by steve martin martin short and selena gomez all with a shared interest in true crime podcasts who become friends while investigating suspicious deaths in their affluent upper west side apartment building and producing their own podcast about the cases its three episode seasons premiered on hulu in august june and august in october it was renewed for a fourth seasonplease watch enjoy the laughter ride,POSITIVE,Comedy
3722,10.0,30 October 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",great show starts abit slow but then it really picks up it is also corny at times but lessens up after a few episodes the story keeps you interested as it is a good mystery you never quite know who did it or how and the cast did a great job of course big names actor that pulls the show not a fan off selena but after this i am happily surprised nice life story of people living together and overcoming their personal life difficulties the show has several layers baked inside the murder mystery it is totally worth watching this show as it is easy to watch and follow look forward for more,POSITIVE,Comedy
3723,8.0,10 January 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",what a treat this was wasnt aware of its existence until recently and being a huge steve martin and martin short fan i dove in its a very creative take on a whodunit murder mystery with interesting characters good performances and cool twists and turns and what a joy it was to watch both steve martin and martin short have a fun time with great performances the secondary cast was mostly great as well some memorable scenes on some great episodes martin short had me laughing out loud regularly with his shenanigans and outbursts the only things i didnt really love and the reason why my rating isnt higher are a couple of outlandish cameo inclusions and a very monotone ultra bland selena gomez maybe her inclusion was aimed to appeal to a particular audience or have a bigger range but i just felt she was way way out of her league and apart from a few of the later episodes where she was better her acting was not good looking forward to a season,POSITIVE,Comedy
3724,10.0,29 January 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this was so interesting and witty the story comes together perfectly with humor suspense and great acting cant wait to see what the next season brings,POSITIVE,Comedy
3725,10.0,17 January 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",while the series has numerous typical nyc characters coming and going the core three of martin short steve martin and selena gomez are what makes this series tick its beautiful watching martins character come alive after suffering some lonely elderly depression same with martin shorts character while he obviously portrays his life as something much more you get to really see how much his new friends mean to him selena gomez is perfect in her role and especially how she interacts her youth with there age i think a lot of people are underestimating her role she is supposed to sound monotone she like her two male counterparts is doing some soul searching herself and it is warming when she finally admits how much those old guys mean to her,POSITIVE,Comedy
3726,6.0,23 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this is a cool take on the murder mystery genre with a lot of twists and turns that seemed to never end its really satisfying to peel all the layers and watch the main characters go through the same detective like thought process as the viewers just a fun way to explore an otherwise dark topic turns the true crime genre on its head not the best for bingeing because it can get tiresome at times,POSITIVE,Comedy
3727,9.0,26 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the cast is amazing the comedy is spot on not overkill just enough to enjoy it the mysteries were great w a few twists the setting is fun i cant wait and hope there is a season steve martin and martin short are so funny together and throwing selena into the mix was genious this makes me want to live in nyc in a big hotel w a lot of quirky characters i keep trying to post this but it keeps telling me my review isnt long enough but i dont want to say anymore bc i dont want to give anything away i will say this watch it and you wont be disappointed i promise ugh tried to submit again and it wont let me because my review is still not long enough i binged the first season in one night and im in the middle of bringing the second season as we speak,POSITIVE,Comedy
3728,10.0,21 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i honestly didnt know what to expect from this series when i first started watching it but i thought it was fun and enjoyed the quirky humour whilst steve martin and martin short were pretty ubiquitous in s comedies i havent seen anything theyve done since then so it was refreshing to see them together again and in something different didnt know selena gomez beforehand but i liked her character as well although i couldnt work out if that was her normal voice or just part of the characters deadpan delivery the rest of the supporting cast were equally engaging i dont follow true crime podcasts so i have no idea whether this is a legitimate take on them or not and it may be that a number of injokes passed me by as a result but it was straight forward to follow and a lovely contrast to some of the darker stuff we tend to get now i look forward to season and can recommend,POSITIVE,Comedy
3729,9.0,4 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",so wonderfully manhattan plus comedy plus murderwhat more could you ask yes the language is a bit over the top but thats part of its personality these three main characters are equally my extreme inner doppelgängers of course martin short is my dream neighbor lots of cozy murder startling revelations and upscale neighborhoods yet downtoearth realness to boot watch and love,POSITIVE,Comedy
3730,10.0,31 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",a very smart series full of content well written original with continuous twists the comic scenes are brilliant they are almost always funny in general during the episodes you smile very often the thing i liked the most is that oldfashioned sense of inquiry that pervades the story without ever falling into easy laughter perhaps not the best series of the year but probably the one that surprised me the most,POSITIVE,Comedy

3741,8.0,7 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",weve been told a story happens in one of the never expected places in the city the arconia an upperclass residency that only has had a bunch of wealthy unsurprisingly and mostly old boring residents that know nearly anything about each others lives which is a perfect start point for an unusual friendship to be formed two wealthy at least they used to be old white men in their s actually one of them is in their early s and a pretty loner girl in her late s along with the mostly believable storytelling some aspects occasionally get in the way of the series after a few episodes making it hard for me to look at the story as serious or applicable to reallife and returns these justified expectations that formed in the first few episodes upside down overcaricatured characters that stretch boundaries of their characteristics even more with every encounter they make with our trio is not being helpful to this out of the blue murder mystery to be more believable or more genuine it does not make the series worse but doesnt add up much to the tone they were trying to give twists turns and surprises are the main elements and the touchstones of murder mysteries but id like them to be wellplaced to the story that doesnt show up just because the writers wanted them to be out but more out of from a natural track there were a lot of twists in the show and most of them were not even the subject of being believable or not no they couldve been seen as believable all day long that was not the real problem with twists they were believable quite applicable most of the time but the incidents which make these twists occur usually made me question the analytical and deductive skills of our main characters going onto pieces of evidence to discover new leads every episodes just to be in shock and go into a whole new direction was on the edge and was hardly acceptable for my taste and i know that a good twist actually any twist is hard to write and the watchers basically dont want any murder mystery to be solved with the first lead the detective police or a solver got hisher hand to so still a good job on the writers part to make this story more intriguing and worth watching overall it was a fun watch,POSITIVE,Comedy
3742,7.0,5 October 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",selena gomez is a magical elf she has managed to bring the two old geezers back to life in the best thing they ever did but i still like dead men dont wear plaid i loved the musical it tied into the story in a literary yet silly way at some points like the white room it was even genius season one was clunky and i hated the frozen cat and poisoned dog part they just couldnt give up cat abuse in season two with the allergy thing which was the low point of the otherwise much better season where they were more accustomed to their characters season three was a tour de force of buttkickingness martin shorts efforts also did not go unnoticed update i forgot to mention the baby elephant abuse in season i did not like that boyfriend the magical elf deserved better moving on i was pleased with the season premiere even though i dont like once upon a time in the west i dont have a huge amount of respect for the western genre but still there are a few i like once upon a time in the west is not one of the ones i like it is pretentious and unfulfilling i hope season does not continue with this malarkey but i remain hopeful even if it does but they should just drop it the incinerator scene was incredibly dramatic,POSITIVE,Comedy
3743,7.0,22 September 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this is a pretty enjoyable show to watch its bingeable the two male actors are really talented but selena gomez ruins the whole show with her absent acting im tired of this habit of using an actor or actress for an audience obviously she was used as a hook for younger audiences there are really talented actors and actresses on the market aubrey for example would have been a good choice apart from selena gomezs terrible acting i almost enjoyed the show but to be honest i quit two times to continue again because i wanted to know the end i hoped that her character dies somehow or gets in jail so we wouldnt see her anymore or less but shes a bait for young adults so of course they wont make this i did not watch the third season this was too much to suffer,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3744,1.0,11 February 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",what a cool show i had no idea what to expect when i started it was quite sceptical but it really surprised me the trios comedic timing is on point we get selenas intense acting skills that make you feel things you didnt even know you could feel steve and martin hilarious but also bring so much soul to the show story was enticing a few cameos that made me excited too hi miss tina well made chapeau,POSITIVE,Comedy
3745,8.0,28 June 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i adore the offbeat show and for me this is up there with twin peaks and the x files casting is superb except for amy schumer in season i love that the quirks and history of the building itself plays a role every episode of season one was gold and with only two episodes in season it continues to deliver this will stand the test of time,POSITIVE,Comedy
3746,10.0,21 November 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i absolutely love this series if you want a bit of fun and intrigue than this series is it every episode hooks you in with something new and exciting you wont be able to stop watching steve martin martin short and selena gomez bring this to life with their amazing dynamic i love that there is this age gap between the characters it creates some beautiful moments while also being hilarious as these old men try to fit in with the younger crowd this rd season has been incredibly exciting with a new major setting and even more drama and who better than to bring in hollywoods best actress meryl streep and suspected vampire paul rudd to star in the show honestly if you want a bit of a laugh an easy to watch show that gets you thinking who could it be than this is it you will most certainly enjoy yourself and honestly who doesnt love it when you put martin short and steve martin in a room together,POSITIVE,Comedy
3747,9.0,24 November 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",some barely plausible characters end up starting a podcast on a murder that happens in the tower block they live in i loved the characters and i thought the casting was excellent i had never heard of selena gomez but i loved her in this it is very light going with a scattering of jokes and mild drama there is the odd speciality episode like the one without any spoken dialogue other reviewers have stated that although alright this is not as great as people make out technically they are absolutely right it isnt ground shattering stuff but as a fan of the likes of monk jonathan creek rizzoli isles it feels like there has not been anything new in the same vein for quite a while this is good honest light sleuthy fun and the smile on my face as i watched every episode justifies my star rating alone edit season season starts of very shaky with some clumsy attempts at humour that dont land and amy schumer stomping through the middle of the plot like a bull at a tea party,POSITIVE,Comedy
3748,8.0,5 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",its pronounced chickashay ok with a long a fun show but a little research goes a long way,POSITIVE,Comedy
3749,9.0,27 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",great fun the two veterans short and martin do their thing one over the top short the other more dull than he have to but selena gomez make this series really good with her deadpan acting and smartess she can handle the most wooden lines with panache and get the rendos on their toes to keep up with her,POSITIVE,Comedy
3750,6.0,24 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this is the first time my husband admires new york through a series its take on the chaotic but beautiful scenery of new york is fantastic love the view the plot is interesting enough to get me hooked the directing is not so much though the story jumps around a lot and the pace is quite slow it does give you a bit of clue along the way but not enough to make any educated guess so its a mystery frankly because they keep it that way not because its that hard to crack about the cast im so in love with the dynamic duo brazzo and the passionate stagedirector they are fun classy and yet chatoic and problematic just like the city itself the only off thing for me is gomezs acting i know shes going for the tough and snarky and notthatemotional character but it came out plain stiff and very confusing to watch all in all the show is cute worth your time on a slow evening but i wont put it next to the top murder mystery shows,POSITIVE,Comedy
3751,9.0,27 November 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",was actually surprised by how much i liked only murders in the building theres a reason that both seasons have been nominated and won so many awards the cast selena gomez steve martin martin short and writing is what makes this show so special martin and short play off one another like the legends they are and gomez is a lot better actress than i expected the three of them are just so likable and easy to root for in this series this show was so good and every episode is so entertaining that i binged both seasons over the course of a weekend its a murder mystery show that have been,POSITIVE,Comedy
3752,7.0,20 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i was very excited to watch this due to the cast i felt the first episodes were very slow and boring it took me about months to get through those i felt it finally got exciting at episode and i watched the last episodes over about days looking forward to a second season,POSITIVE,Comedy
3753,10.0,17 February 2024,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i really love martin short and steve martin selena is great in anything she is in i would have rated it higher but the profanity seems senseless its just stuck in there for no reason i guess to appeal to generation z just insert beeeeepppp every time you hear a word that offends you anyway the story revolves around three people that lives in the same building trying to solve a murder of someone they all knew for some reason its up to them to solve the crime without any police intervention none of them seem to be crime fighters but still they have been enlisted to solve the crime part of the fun is that there are many cameos by stars that you dont expect but do know from many other shows you may have watched in the past if you like humor of martin short and steve martin you will enjoy this,POSITIVE,Comedy
3754,9.0,18 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this show is an example of how unprogressive and outdated television can be they should should have used every opportunity to be as a woke as possible shame,NEGATIVE,Comedy

3756,10.0,20 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",just commenting because im annoyed by all of the recent reviews this show is great its a farce its a play in tv series form expand your willingness to embrace theater and for the folks older than me in my s calm the f down sexuality is a spectrum and its weird if amy schumer occupied that much of your mind like really get a life,POSITIVE,Comedy
3757,9.0,16 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",before viewing this series i had no prior experience listening to true crime podcasts after episodes of only murders in the building im satisfied that this show was a first real taste for me in the world of truecrime the light hearted note of the show which over arches some serious themes gives this show a unique flavour production value is impressive but it all comes down to the iconic duo steve and martin great delivery of their respective characters also it was throwback for me seeing selena back on tv screen i found her to be reasonably well for her acting but some spark was missing in her overall i would recommend this show the first to episodes will either make or break this show for the viewers update season so this show has taken jump from to considering both the seasons together wonderful and beautiful cast,POSITIVE,Comedy
3758,6.0,5 September 2024,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",funny and entertaining series with a quirky style the new york building set up is interesting and most of the characters are engaging the story is told from different points of view and has a lot of twists and turns and that keeps it from getting boring even if sometimes it gets too much acting is all very good with the big exception of the mabel character that girl can so not act she comes out as almost expressionless its such a shame because the character could make a great trio with the two older guys was it really so hard to find a fresh funny face to compliment two great comedians it bothers me in every episode because it could be so much better with a better female protagonist,POSITIVE,Comedy

3760,6.0,22 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",im only half way through the first season but i am really shocked by how well short martin and gomez work together usually the boomermillennial discourse jokes never land well but this series managed to create such a refreshing dynamic between the three leads martin short plays oliver an eccentric theatre directorwriter who hasnt been able to catch a break after many failed projects while steve martin plays a former dlist actor called charles who cant seem to let go of the past selena gomez then rounds off the trio as a much younger guest of her aunts in the building that oliver and charles live in all three characters share a passion for a whodunitstyle murder mystery podcast hosted by tina fey before starting their own podcast following a shocking death in the building even though theyre working together its obvious that the three leads all have separate agendas associated with solving the mystery and creating the podcast short and martin are particularly engaging in this series as the trio interview the buildings tenants to try and find the murderer gomez does seem a bit flat in her acting style initially but i just choose to attribute that to the characterisation of mabel i found that once i got over that mentalblock i really started to enjoy her character and i cannot emphasise enough how surprised i was to see short martin and gomez have such good chemistry all of the characters seem to have a great backstory and many secrets that come to head as the show progresses theres definitely some good laughs in here too and i was delighted to see a fan favourite from the office amy ryan show up in the last few episodes i watched as someone who gets easily freaked out by true crime stories i find this series much more digestible with its lighthearted humour and heartfelt relationships between characters this is probably the only feel good murder mystery series ive seen thats actually of good quality i really like the idea that you can create a pseudofamily within your community and only murders in the building really hits home with that sentiment,POSITIVE,Comedy
3761,1.0,31 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",not a comedy neither a thriller nor a investigation just bunch of mixed stuff here and there and the ending what the heck is that could have done better,NEGATIVE,Comedy

3766,9.0,19 February 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",not going to play it down and be cool in my review this was absolute perfection in my opinion i loved it if like me you have a penchant for true crime podcasts or the genre in general this show nails the current love and popularity and in some cases downright obsession the modern world has for theses stories mix that with the true legendary hollywood and comedy talent of steve martin and martin short and then add a splash of the gorgeous and ill confess truly delightful selena gomez and youve nailed it yes at first i was concerned that steve martin and martin short might be a negative aspect as i havent really seen them in much since their hey day movies of the s and s but i was completely wrong they both gave for me such personable and likeable portrayals of their characters they were funny weird campy and vulnerable in all the right places i liked selena gomez too and was fascinated by her super deep sexy voice they all have great chemistry together and couple that with a lovely set location and it really worked me for i liked the format used with narration overlay by the characters in the style of true podcasting shows and add some quirky music and youve got a nice authentic feel to the episodes story arc was good and well mapped and supporting characters and characters side stories gave it some real heart nice twists and turns heading into the season finale and youve got me ready and waiting for season,POSITIVE,Comedy
3767,9.0,23 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i found the story entertaining martin shorts character is a mess not my favorite selina gomez acting is mediocre and flat not sure if thats the character or not i do like the idea of her character and im neither a fan nor a hater of selina herself my biggest gripe is the constant use of the fbomb in every episode and by so many characters im just not a fan of that word or swearing in general its not so commonly or frequently used by most people in life in general and those that do make themselves sound ignorant why the writers feel the need to put it in is beside me its absolutely not necessary not only does it not add anything it takes away im not likely to continue watching nor to recommend for that simple fact too bad,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3768,6.0,10 January 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",when i first heard about selena gomez starring alongside steve martin and martin short i was hesitant to pull the trigger on watching this series however i am glad i decided to watch a couple episodes on a whim because my wife and i were immediately hooked each cast member brings a unique quality to their character and they do a tremendous job of keeping every scene interesting this was the best new series i encountered in all of and would recommend to anybody looking for a new fun show to watch especially for people who love mysterycomedies or true crime seriespodcasts,POSITIVE,Comedy
3769,8.0,18 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",edit the last about minutes in the show knocked it down from a to an for me the ending kinda ruined it for me it just didnt make much sense looking forward to seeing how everything is resolved in season proves that a show can be silly while being socially conscious absolutely brilliant very hardy boysnancy drewesque laughed cried whole yards think the supernatural episode where they go to the samdean role playing convention,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3770,6.0,25 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the the boring and the saddest actors ever together for the most boring comedy ever i dont even get why the girl was casted she should play some sad drugs addict,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3771,5.0,19 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",just a really good oldfashioned murder mystery with original storytelling love the quirky hilarious characters that make up the tenants of the arconia buildingsuspect roster each season not to mention the amazing stellar stars of the show that bring so much charm and so many laughs i should point out that writing reviews is not something i do in fact i think this is my very first one in the years ive been coming to imdb but i just love this show so much and sadly hulu doesnt do enough to spread the word i just had to leave a review who knows though maybe ill start learning more reviews of showsmovies,POSITIVE,Comedy
3772,8.0,12 May 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i was very pleasantly surprised as how good only murders in the building was it actually got better as it went along mainly because martin short is just excellent brilliantly caustic lines delivered with exquisite timing well worth watching if just for him,POSITIVE,Comedy

3776,7.0,25 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",in an era when everything seems to be a remake reboot or based off a graphic novel only murders is a breath of fresh air the characters are engaging and well developed and the story itself is well paced each episode moves the plot along which is someone unique normally over episodes theres at least one episode that really just spins its wheels the cast is great steve martin martin short and nathan lane all shine and the supporting cast all bring something fun to the table the only ones that stand out in a negative way would be selena gomez who just cant hold up against her peers in such a key role and detective williams who came off as flat as far as the whodunnit i wont spoil it but this is not an out of left field answer where the killer is shoehorned in at the minute the clues are there and mystery buffs should be satisfied with the conclusion im looking forward to season,POSITIVE,Comedy
3777,8.0,31 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",its a bit of fun and a bit of mystery some characters didnt have to exist some storylines dont make a whole lot of sense kudos for keeping the episodes rather short though and individual acting was excellent and it had its funny moments im not sure a second season is needed though,POSITIVE,Comedy

3779,3.0,6 December 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this show is amazing its funny quirky and best of all original the interactions between the main characters oliver charles and mabel seems a bit odd in the beginning but just gets better with each episode sometimes the show has a moment of absurdity but after a while you just take it as a cool quirk the build up to the unraveling of the crime is well done and thewhodoneit part was exciting and fun the second season involves another murder but somehow they managed to make it all somewhat believable the first episode can seem bit much but hang in there its totally worth it im going to watch it again that says a lot,POSITIVE,Comedy

3796,10.0,8 June 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",lets face it the murder mysteries premise is a cover for comedy with martin and short why waste your time too bad selena is then left to be the straightman im glad a season is not episodes because murder mysteries do require a lot of characters to produce a lot of red herrings and that would have to be really dragging the plot out to spice up season many returns and connections was made to season that is reasonable but it also seems to just to pad and fill the building setting restrictions came into used a bit but for sure it need to branch out of the clausophobia i wish it could be a little smarter like the other great show mrs davis,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3797,6.0,10 April 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",im amazed at how high this is rated here but i guess its just not for me comedy mystery is one of my wife and is favorite categories so we thought it would be a perfect match to our taste i love steve martin and martin short and going in had no real opinion on selena gomez other than her being easy on the eyes ive watched three episodes and have found the pacing to be slow the style much too artsy for my taste the story to be more about character drama than the mystery and most unfortunately selenas acting to be quite bad i really wanted to like it but dont think ill be watching it any further my wife isnt as bored with it as i am but shes not in love with it either i expect shell see it through during her workouts,NEGATIVE,Comedy

3804,2.0,6 November 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",its been a while since ive watched a tv series and smiled at the end of it what a thrilling colourful creative warm and smartly written piece of dramaticcomedy the martin short duo are always a hit for any audience but for me a previous admirer of both their projects respectively it was truly enjoyable to see them on screen united again id never watched selena gomez in film of tv so now i think she is an excellent addition smart grounded staunch yet her story added delicate and tender moments to the plot i was thoroughly entertained by this mystery i couldnt fault anything about it,POSITIVE,Comedy
3805,4.0,21 November 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the movie reveals between three persons who live in same apartments the persons were be as to each other they didnt know that they will e revealing in the murder later it was a perfect movie which entertains many around us the applause to the movie was good it was very nice and good through out the movie is good to watch but the strangers met in the struggle sets were they were involved in the murder and not able to come out if that the movie was action to many people in the world the movie was entertaining audiences well comic sense was missing in the movie but it was good to watch movie,POSITIVE,Comedy
3806,2.0,21 December 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",ive watched the first seasons it should be funny given the cast steve martin has done some great work over the years unfortunately it just isnt funny its barely amusing one assumes its being made because of some sort of emperors new clothes scenario where the studio just dont want to admit its a bit rubbish because of the names involved maybe us audiences do find this funny after all they loved friends and the us version of the office and someone keeps adam sandler in work i keep expecting a laugh but have watched more in hope than expectation a waste of talents and a waste of my time,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3807,4.0,17 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",stumbled across this as i needed a new comedy to watch whilst this is funny in places i wouldnt class it as an all out comedy this is a drama firstly with a few comedic scenes thrown in but it is definitely worth watching,POSITIVE,Comedy
3808,3.0,25 November 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",charles oliver and mabel are one of the best created characters on tv right now i really love how they pull each others leg and keep annoying each other i loved all three seasons but the rd one is by far the best one the whole musical theater scenerio with a huge side characters was so perfectly handled this show is unlike any other professional type detective shows out there charlesmabeloliver are as flawless and normal and quirky as anyother normal human being the humor is top notch there are so many scenes which make you gag and laugh hysetrically i havent found any episode dry or boring every episode is superbly written and well crafted a must watch for crime junkies,POSITIVE,Comedy
3809,4.0,7 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",only a few episodes in but i love this ive always been a steve martin fan and he delivers i love how the trio of character balance each other out with the conflicting ages personalities and lifestyles that are all drawn together by their love of true crime the twist at the end of the first episode was enough to draw me in i also grew up watching selena gomez on disney so its nice to see her act in a show for an adult audience,POSITIVE,Comedy
3810,4.0,7 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this show is very good as the episodes go the story gets more interesting with a very modern podcast wrapped in it and doesnt make it bad for the story itself usually a bit lacking if you bring the current set of stories good acting only sometimes they dont feel good in some episodes it depends on the rating respectively and selena gomez not bad hope its better and puzzles in season,POSITIVE,Comedy
3811,2.0,31 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this was a fun show and the low reviews are wrong selena gomez took some getting used to but martin short is just absolutely fantastic its worth the watch,POSITIVE,Comedy
3812,1.0,18 November 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",only murders in the building swiftly captures attention with its mix of comedic detective thrills the shows play between mystery and humor hooked me from the start and kept me engaged throughout initially drawn in by the first seasons opening episode i found myself not compelled to return to the series after the pilot this could be because of the low emotional connect although the notable strength of this series lies in its pacing ensuring there are no dull moments however this brisk rhythm sometimes hinders the development of emotional connections with the characters as discussed earlier there was an attempt in the latest season to address this shortfall but it slightly altered the thrill factor affecting the gradual buildup that some viewers appreciated less but it didnt affect me i found it good enough the writers faced with a challenge striking a balance between emotional resonance and a fastpaced narrative finding this in a balance is tricky ultimately the series leans more towards the thrilling detective elements delivering a wellwrapped mystery bundle only murders in the building excels as a multifaceted production blending thriller comedy detective work and drama its broad appeal resonates across various audiences marking it as a mustwatch i just want more of it keep it going recommended,POSITIVE,Comedy
3813,3.0,4 February 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the plot of this series is a good one some unsuspecting characters stumble into a murder investigation the characters are well acted and the writing of their backstories is excellent the one thing that sticks in my craw is the way the writers treat true crime podcast fans its kind of obvious that they have never listened to a true crime podcast in their lives as they depict true crime podcast fans as something like modern day trekkies i dont doubt that there would be a podcast about the crimes in the series or that the characters themselves would try like they do to make one but that they would have fans camping outside the building or stalking them in restaurants absurd,POSITIVE,Comedy
3814,5.0,2 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",boring doesnt leave you wanting to see more just a total waste of time i do not recommend it at all and i would hope that they could improve the characters that are so mediocre,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3815,4.0,29 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",a is more like it first episodes were unfunny glad i kept watching martin short is an absolute delight last episodes he had me in stitches other than him script can take some major improvements,POSITIVE,Comedy
3816,2.0,18 August 2024,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this was one of the most boring shows i saw in the recent times i cannot understand what people saw do not watch it and help increase its view count or ratings the acting is bad all the three main people give average performances the storyline is nothing special just a few guys trying to do a true crime podcast music is okay pretty classy and different actually so are the modern graphics the cinematography is cool but nothing out of the box the suspense and build up is mediocre no edge of the seat moments or cliffhangers i just dont see whats the big deal there are no witty one liners or any humor to make up for the lack of entertainment i saw some people commenting that the ratings are courtesy selena gomez you fans should not mess up the ratings and misguide innocent happy people to watch these unhappy shows listen to sherlock co on apple podcasts instead its way better and actually deserves these ratings,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3817,4.0,6 May 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",after watching the first episode of season i dont think i can go on slow boring wooden acting and really just not worth the time there are much better shows out there others say skip season i say skip season also if season is this bad i cant even begin to imagine how bad is and whats with the annoying music i dont know much miss gomes singing but i have to assume she is a much better singer than actor so i would say stick to singing as a huge fan of the other two i am disappointed they both can do better they both have done better but i guess we all need money at some point and will just what it takes to collect a pay check this show is it,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3818,2.0,21 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",isnt selena gomez happy with what shes good at doing singing please why her her wooden face just remains the same no reaction on top of that the nasal tone maybe reese witherspoon or zoe saldana couldve been the third person in the team,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3819,2.0,17 May 2024,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",big fan of beloved steve martin and i watched all his films up until s theyre all outstanding flicks that i enjoy revisiting martin short is also an unforgettable iconic comedian his saturday night show sketches are unforgettable so i was so psyched to watch this show when i saw the cast unfortunately i barely made it to the end of the first episode im a mystery fan and nyc is my second homeso again in the beginning i was so excited as both genre and location felt so close to heart for me major disappointment is the plot i mean the mystery element appeared too manufactured and imposed upon viewer even if it is not gripping enough in essence just not engaging enough it lacks the level of sophistication required to make it intriguing dialogues are less than witty and humour falls far from sarcasm mostly sounding corny perhaps i found it flat because im more of a black comedy lover mystery factor faded away underneath sitcom appeal plus selena gomezs poor monotone performance didnt help,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3820,2.0,8 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the waning of past talent two comedians whose time has past and are no longer funny or even slightly entertaining,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3821,2.0,6 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i really wanted to like this show but its pretty much impossible for me the main characters are all loaded with baggage that just takes away from the story in fact as i watched each of the three episodes so far i liked the main characters less in every episode martin shorts character is just a revolting human being steve martin isnt the least bit funny and his performance is flat selena gomez is cold and overly judgmental they just dont seem to be people that can come together successfully as a team i find it hard to care about any of them and i think thats essential for the series to be successful frankly for martin short and steve martin it seem like a last desperate gasp for relevance sad im obviously an outlier on this one glad so many of you like it but its not for me,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3822,4.0,19 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i love two martins but selena just cant act she is just saying the lines with a monotone voice premise is good and it had a potential but with some other female character in her s it would have been a way better,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3823,5.0,3 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",unless you want to be shocked by selena gomez dropping fbombs every other sentence two episodes was as much time as i will waste,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3824,1.0,5 September 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",after revealing that shorts character doesnt lock his front door gomezs character supposedly makes a hilarious quip i guess old white guys only have to worry about coloncancer and societal change before you label me whatever you will i actually have called people out on white male privilege more than you think but when it makes sense doing so when it does not weakens its meaning and impact have these two old white guys said or done anything dated or offensive in this show so far no it might make sense if one of them was more like archie bunker but obviously short or martin could not pull that off it also doesnt make sense regarding race unless you invent a problem of people of color being targeted more often for home invasion in such a neighborhood it may actually be the opposite if they simply left it at male privilege without the unnecessary adolescent and outofnowhere ageist insult it would have fit with gomezs character background better and at least made some sense yes you forget about ageism you supposed knowitalls its almost as if some clown made them add white to the line because thats just the thing to do horrendous writing and storytelling lastly watching a mediocre actor like steve martin trying to act as if he is a bad voice actor is just not funny and boring,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3825,1.0,17 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",gomez kills the whole show they would have been better off if they went with an unknown actress that actually has talent,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3826,5.0,12 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",sorry folks definitely doesnt deserve a its barely funny barely intriguing and barely thrilling,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3827,1.0,13 October 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",enjoyed season but season has lost the plot i would agree with other posters too much use of the f word this has really made it tacky plus the singing theme omg just plain boring also the over acting from martin short meryl stink and other nobodies i dealt with meryl stink by fast forwarding every time she appeared the only good parts are selena gomez and steve martin except for their over use of the f word use the f word sparingly for maximum impact but when used every second sentence just plain tacky very tacky no class the director is a moron and just following the idiot trend set by the other morons,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3828,3.0,2 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this should have been a fun show but is unfortunately is pretty dull steve martin plays a tired old actor as a tired old actor martin short is annoying playing an annoying theatre director and selena gomez plays a nonactor well as a nonactor,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3829,3.0,16 December 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i love martin short and steve martin so was looking forward to watching this i only got as far as the second episode before i picked up my phone as started surfing internet as i was bored stopped watching after that,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3830,1.0,9 January 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the writing is just so bad couldnt make it through the first episode they immediately share deep life stuff and want to solve true crime stuff together no,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3831,5.0,9 August 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i was looking forward to season but i could barely get through the first two episodes there are way too many f bombs so many f bombs that it seriously distracted from the show itself plus the innuendos in the script hinting to the show actually being a show were way too many and again took away from the show it was so annoyingly bad bad and distracting that i must have stopped and restarted the episodes or times and im still not finished with the first two episodes and its only a show also sorry only murders in the building is just no where near as good as the first two seasons far from it,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3832,1.0,14 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",each week less and less information is revealed jessica fletcher could have had this all buttoned up in an hour instead we have an actress who sounds like a muppet and whose emotional range is from deadpan to bored but swears to let us know theres some passion somewhere inside her steve martin is not far behind her martin shorts goofy overthetop performance is the shows only saving grace the storyline is so slow that i no longer care who killed tim kono and instead hope heshe kills the remaining cast as well,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3833,2.0,10 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",in the golden age of television this should have aimed higher with laughs for starters since this is supposed to be a comedy the dialogues are good and the mystery unfolds nicely my biggest problem was with selena gomez who im sure was brought to balance the old timers which they didnt need and brings absolutely nothing to the table she emotes nothing communicates nothing and gives no clues as to what mabel is thinking feeling or even saying since her deadpan delivery is just dead i was drawn to this because it felt retro and fun but its just uninmaginative and takes no risks,POSITIVE,Comedy
3834,4.0,11 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i was really looking forward to this and was hugely dissappinted i see how they were trying to develop a murder mystery theme and the podcast was a nice modern twist seen how we are all on social media these days but it was just missing something and fell very flat i liked the two males but selena was so one lifeless i dont remember her acting being this stiff however i last watched her on the disney channel so my reference point for her acting skills is not the strongest lol maybe if she was cast with someone else it wouldve created more spark between the three but this aspect really put me off getting past the nd episode the show is also quite boring it doesnt flow i cant see how the reviews have been so positive and it got picked up for a second season but i suppose when big names are backing the show anythings possible,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3835,1.0,29 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",might like this show is not for selena gomez she doesnt even seem like she wants to be there her voice sounds like a kazoo her whole attitude is blah she ruins every scene i dont understand why she gets casted in anything sorry,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3836,2.0,21 November 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",it is not for every one but for a fan of old school review comedy you dont see much nowadays this is a pinch of nostalgia that works some of the time steve martin and martin short is doing vaudeville and dadhumour as only they know how and the various guest actors are fun to see i do not understand selena gomez however she has a hard time with the acting and her face sadly doesnt emote at all i get that martin short found it fun and perhaps necessary to inject a current actress into the series in order to snare the younger viewers and i am sure gomez is a nice person but as an actress she has a lot to learn all and all this is an ok show mostly for people who remembers the good old days,POSITIVE,Comedy
3837,2.0,4 September 2024,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",my wife and i have tried watching this twice the only reason i know that we have tried it twice is that we decided to start watching it due to all the adverts that were coming on and rave reviews on instagram on firing it up it turned out that we had already watched up to episode of season presumably when it first came out but neither of us could recall a thing from it on the second attempt we realised why its a total mess the storyline is jumbled and there is a total lack of humour so we just gave up maybe you need an american sense of humour it reminded me a bit of the us copy of the office which isnt a patch on the original uk version i gave it stars because the set looks good,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3838,1.0,11 February 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",martin short and steve martin are charismatic and easy to watch but that seems to be all this show has going for it and even this pair are dull apparently without good writing selena gomez is wooden and only serves to lower the average age it feels like somebody threw together a list of names who are wellloved or fashionable and were so confident that their personalities alone would carry the show that they didnt bother to get a writer the show just drifts along sideways without generating any sizzle or laughs whatsoever i dont think ive ever cared less about who did it if i can say something positive about the show its the beautiful set design and the incredible openmouthed nap i just had while it played in the background,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3839,4.0,2 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i really cant say because after first episode it just went down actors play is very flat and again there are main characters that are unlikable and annoying i guess it is just another show aimed at twitter people,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3840,3.0,3 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",it was somewhat funny at the beginning with the interplay of conversations between steve martin and martin short and its amusing premise in fact i signed up for hulu specifically to watch it as it was well publicized anticipating something really good and funny the monotone gravely or is it nasal voice of selena gomez with her flat expressionless face was that supposed to be funny and her character to me add nothing to the series i dont find her the least bit interesting or amusing i guess one should give her credit for at least having lips that moved i quite enjoyed the first weeks episodes they were somewhat amusing and martin short occasionally said something that made me laugh out loud but by the second group of episodes it just got both really complicated and really boring at the same time i think when the selena gomezs mother starts speaking and going on about her daughterwont give any further details of the plot except to say it was in new jersey or was it long island it just got unbearably boring and lost me given that only murders in the buildling seems to have gotten rave reviews from both critics and viewers to me it is actually a bit of an emperor has no clothes situation i dont see it deserving stars it certainly is being well promoted yet it seems highly overrated perhaps this is occurring because audiences love the actors so much and are expecting great things from them so they dub it great and are in a sense blinded by their expectations its working really hard to be funny and cleverbut for me really just petered out and became more like an amateur high school creative play writing attempt my perception is that it went so downhill in terms of script and even the acting of the secondary characters to the point i stopped watching it all together compared to the recent series the white lotus which was well written and very funny this just seems disappointing,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3841,5.0,17 September 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i only watched the first two episodes and i did not fall in love with the series i love steve martin and martin short but this just doesnt grab me selena gomez is a great actress but even this doesnt do her justice the language is also a huge turnoff ive heard so many fbombs that its not even funny alsoi know new york city is a great place to tour but isnt it kinda overused i keep thinking that hollywood needs to explore other big average and small towns i think you would find more material for future storylines if you didnt over use the giant cities like nyc when you look outside the usual places you can find unique personalities,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3842,2.0,7 June 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",three true crime podcast enthusiasts and tenants of the arconia witness a murder in the building and take it upon themselves to solve the case by of course producing their own serial like podcast as they haphazardly search for clues created by john hoffman grace and frankie and steve martin and starring steve martin martin short and selena gomez i honestly had much higher hopes for this series its fine but i often get the sense that martin was really trying to tiptoe the line between a real crime drama and a satirical comedy but martin short continually pulls hard towards the comedy side while selena gomez basically plays straight drama it creates friction from scene to scene often not in the best ways making the series swap tones ungracefully i honestly thought gomez had the best acting in this series and i didnt really find any of it laugh out loud funny maybe except whenever tina fey shows up but also ive never really been a fan of true crime podcasts which this show is of course heavily based on mocking wasnt bad but wouldnt necessarily recommend,POSITIVE,Comedy

3845,3.0,9 October 2024,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",splitting the trio up is perhaps the worst thing that happens as the season goes on gets completely away from the narrative of the actual mystery and essentially makes a spoof of the first season bringing in characters to play themselves doesnt make any sense because the thought they would have gotten big enough to have people play them after a podcast is far fetched picking characters to develop first requires them to be like able at first talking about people we never meet doesnt help seems like they are getting away from the main narrative just for an excuse to add well known characters to their cast list to drive viewership,NEGATIVE,Comedy

3857,2.0,18 July 2024,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",sorry folks this is horrible references to old stories outdated clichés and dreadful acting by otherwise talented actors makes for a very boring and cringe worthy and embarrassing effort its like the writers threw in every aspect of modern life and current social issues and tried to connect it with nostalgic situations and stories from the th century steve martin looks like a stick figure stuck in the middle of real characters and martin short is trying to save the day in each scene and painfully overacting the story is dumb predictable and thin it is sad to see such a waste of great talent perhaps they can save it with a grand banjo performance by steve and some good old comedy from martin,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3858,2.0,18 January 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",after seeing so many high praise for this show and also a fan of steve martin l have high expectations for this show but its so boring and unfunny l dont know how you can calls this a comedy all the main characters are so unlikable especially that martin short never liked him as an actor and hes extremely annoying here just because hes a friend of martin doesnt mean he should be on the show,NEGATIVE,Comedy

3861,2.0,9 September 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the only good thing about this show is the intro who ever thought selena gomez would be a good cast she cant act and ruins almost every scene her voice always has the same dull tone showing no emotion at all i have to give credit to martin short and steve martin who did make this show somewhat watchable some scenes that force politics also dont make it a better show what was that with the armenian genocide scene a very touchy subject which was so out of place in one of the scenes of episode six and i really did not care about the whole relationship problems of detective williams lesbian houshold these are just some examples why this series is a mess,NEGATIVE,Comedy

3864,3.0,18 September 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",season was a joy to watch but it looks like steve martin caved in to the woke mob for season what was the point of throwing selena gomez into a lesbian love story other than to show as martin short so nicely explained it that bisexuality is a very progressive mindset nowadays i waited until the entire series was over just to see if there was a point to it other than proving your woke street creds and there wasnt there was a love story in season that actually added to the plot but this was nothing more than a bone tossed in to keep the baying woke hounds at bay if the series needed filler there would have been far more interesting plot twists to pass the time steve you let us down,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3865,5.0,9 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i have skipped parts wasnt this supposed to be funnyi love selena but her vibe is meh well the mystery is good also the only reason i am continuing this but still overall a because i mean its not funny and all the emo stuff is not interesting gripping fun to wtach,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3866,4.0,19 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",so much potential was wasted in this show two of my favorite comedians but they fell flat i think with the writers cramming as much innuendo and cursing it just felt awkward hearing it come from steve and martin they even looked uncomfortable with their lines most of the time the story was fun and i enjoyed it what i didnt enjoy was the underlying message that ive seen with many actors and writers trying to come backand draw an audience the feeling that there is a need to include things that just arent really appropriate for the show or for television you dont have to include sex or the discussion of such to be funny or move a plot you dont have to throw in fwords to appeal to crowds or to appear fresh and popular if there is a second season make it appropriate for as many ages as possible leave out the language change the dialog and i guarantee that there will be a larger following and no one will even miss it,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3867,5.0,25 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the show is a little fun sometimes too much sometimes silly the two last episodes for example i could be fine with all this but selena gomezs acting it is awful horrible just a statute reciting literally no emotion stiff face stay away from acting please or go take a decade learning how to do so,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3868,4.0,7 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the writers try too hard to be cute id hate to have dinner with these each is boring and when you combine them you get boring cubed there is not enough difference in personalities between the to create any interest i like the idea of the show but the execution falls flat,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3869,1.0,26 February 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i realize im in the minority butthis is not comedy i barely smiled a couple of times i dont know what they tried and what their intentions were but martin fall short and selena was lets say she should go back to being a singer i love the duo steve martin short but this was almost unwatchable and not funny at all no idea how it got such a high score everywhere,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3870,3.0,14 August 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i truly dont understand the reviews i found it boring and after ep i skiped directly to ep from season i just couldnt watch episodes to find out what happend with that man killed in ep i didnt find it funny nor brilliant how many say but is just my opinion needless to say i have no interest for the following seasons the character interpreted by selena gomez is likesooo boring i dont have another word to describe it first ep from season i watched fast forward just to not fall asleep during the movie im sorry because i like all the main actors but thats it,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3871,3.0,18 December 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",just so you know this isnt like the usual crime stories its more like high school detectives i laughed twice throughout the whole st season and it wasnt interesting either as normally i would be engaged in piecing the clue together to find out who the killer was but it just didnt invoke that within me try watching mindhunter clickbait or mare of easttown and you will know what i meant,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3872,4.0,20 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",steve martin and martin short were great them and selena gomez made a likeable unlikely team the bits where she helps her two elderly friends navigate the modern world were funny and touching likewise for the bits where the two men try to be protective and caring of her despite not quite understanding why millenials act the way they do martin and short are funny and charming and tina fey was great in a cameo but the weaknesses outweigh the strengths the story feels like it was written by first time writers it has a very sophomoric feel to it it is boring and weak this is a mystery story but that plot is kept more or less in halt till the very end the middle episodes are full of extraneous and frankly boring backstories and subplots selena gomezs acting was another weak point of the series the story needed to focus on the mystery it needed some colorful suspects some suspense and a lot more fun scenes of the three leads investigating together instead we get a lot of cliched donetodeath subplots involving each character there were glimpses of a hella fun show but it got buried by the bad writing,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3873,5.0,7 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the show started out good entertaining funny suspenseful but then it started getting a bit odd and even boring which is too bad because im not sure now that ill finish it,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3874,1.0,6 December 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i loved watching the series but until the last moment there is a scene in the series about the turks committing genocide did you seriously make a scene like this without shame why dont you do proper research shout out to you screenwriter so shame,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3875,4.0,9 September 2024,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",perhaps i came into this show with the wrong idea but im half way through the first season and i just cant get into it you can tell that it is artfully and expensively made with high production values the odd moment of visual fantasy and a big name cast but i thought it would be fun its not and that is a bit of a problem when you have steve martin and martin short in the cast there is the odd moment of wit and humour but it is spread pretty thinly the tempo overall is slow almost tragic and i dont mean because of the murders in the building i mean because of the protagonists own lives another issue for me is selena gomezs performance she is really lifeless and distracted and has this flat tone of voice that kills every scene she is in i dont know what she was aiming for but she doesnt hit the mark at all omitb ticks the boxes as a murder mystery show but the casting of martin and short is wasted,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3876,2.0,19 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",im genuinely so confused by all the positive reviews this show falls so flat in every single way the acting is so unbelievable the three main actors quarter ass their performances the only one who was delivering was nathan lane and hes barely in the show the plot lines are so hollow and lacking in any suspense or drama or even logic i really wanted to like this cause i like everyone else in the world love steve martin and martin short but this just wasnt it a truly horrible show that looks beautiful,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3877,1.0,14 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",are we back to the era of silent movies how does this help does it make things funnier over the last or something years there is a degradation decline horrible decline in the quality of movie making its in every aspect of it mediocre scripts bad acting bad editing period,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3878,1.0,3 October 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",a nice show overall martin and short are entertaining plot is ok but selena gomez is absolutely awful unfortunately her acting is bad and very slow she is hard to understand when she talks she has a boring monotone voice and she is not attractive like a robot without any emotions in a thick cotton sweater and no sense of humour i wonder why they picked her there are thousands of actresses out there who would be a much better fit and would have improved the show massively but selena probably bought her way into this show maybe there will be another murder in the building in season and well get a new female lead or her sister arrives and takes over or she has a new girlfriend and vanishes for the season there is still hope,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3879,5.0,8 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i really like steve martin and martin short but i stopped watching after a few episodes i think the writersproducers are so focused on being politically correct that they forgot to make a good show at the end of the day this could have and should have been entertaining but it fails at that dont believe all the exclamation points theyre just there to trick you,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3880,1.0,26 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",if your not a fan of steve martin martin short or selena gomez i honestly dont know why you would want to watch this i watched five episodes and got more and more bored tired old guys try and fail to make funny andor intelligent observations about younger persons andor society totally uninteresting characters theres really no reason why i would want to know more about them quite a lot of embarrassing andor pointless scenes that doesnt add anything like the suspects audition poor and really slow handling of the plot eg what could have been interesting suspect twists are discarded after about two minutes with oh heshe admitted to be lying alright then no longer a suspect maybe drop some clues here and there eg in flashbacks that may make the viewer think and draw hisher own conclusions no a lot of cameos unfortunately quite pointless i cant think of anyone who actually added something more than the physical presence the most fun i had was counting the number of times i thought was this supposed to be funny but of course if all that sounds appealing to you then youre in for a treat,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3881,2.0,15 January 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",lets be honest trying too hard to be funny always flops the two old guys were well written the girl was mehbel im familiar with selenas acting so it was no surprise that it was mild and underwhelming i had guessed all the plot twists maybe episodes in kinda insufferable those people that like watching romance kdramas will probably enjoy this because it is a very feel good show and now who wants a feel good thriller we want a mind thriller,POSITIVE,Comedy

3883,3.0,2 August 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",if not a manhattanphile avoid this the cast sounded intriguing the plot sounded cringe cringe won it turns out gomez cannot act at all and martin panders to whatever cringey wokeism he thinks will keep him semirelevant the result cringe i lived in manhattan this is a bow to manhattan by martin having lived there that ends up being the only temporarily watchable aspect but having lived in manhattan i can never understand why anybody wants to watch stories about nyers just miserable if woody allen made his worst effort ever and he made some bad ones hed put out something like this,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3884,1.0,14 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",lots of predictable dialog with characters that are too unrealistic to relate to a few good laughs unrealistic situations maybe its a matter of the creators and actors not being settled on whether its supposed to be a comedy a mystery a crime show or a drama,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3885,1.0,23 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",selena gomez is boring and pedestrian and martin short is way over the top and annoying as hell to the point of distraction shorts character is stupid and unlikeable everything he says and does is so wrong and ridiculous that it actually isnt funny there is no reason to believe the other two would have anything to do with him after episodes im seriously considering giving up on it,NEGATIVE,Comedy

3887,4.0,6 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i watched one episode i cant believe the likes of martin and short would pair themselves with a singer that cant act besides her nasally voice its hard to watch her trying to act no thanks,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3888,3.0,26 August 2024,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",why why does every new series have to be tvma dont you writers have vocabulary that contains words with more than letters stop it already its ignorant and immature and lacks creativity i watched fred macmurray in murder he says last night screwball comedy funny clean entertaining i have watched steve martin and martin short make clean funny movies for years parenthood father of the bride three amigos mars attacks those were good movies cmon man give us something decent to watch do you talk your mother like they talk in this series i mean i can handle a word or two here or there i dont live under a rock but when people talk like potty mouthed teenagers i call them out on it i was looking forward to something new and creative so tired of this grow up will you,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3889,2.0,5 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",there may be a good hour movie in this but its stretched out over episodes it makes fun of true crime shows drawing out the drama and yet it does the same thing its always fun to see steve martin and martin short and they do pretty good riffing off of their charisma but chrissy metz is just a bland robotic third wheel here and somehow as beautifully produced as it is the whole thing feels lifeless and im not prude but whats up with the abrupt vulgarity like the f bombs and the long island cousin finger thing its like some hollywood producers note that new yorkers are really vulgar make sure to get that in,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3890,4.0,20 September 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i cant for the life of me understanding the extreme adoration for this show the pacing is lethargic and inconsistent the supporting characters with only a few small exceptions are painfully unlikable the few likeable supporting characters are shoved to the sidelines selena gomez is an awful expressionless actress with the charm and charisma of a mossy log martin short is great and steve martin is solid though it just makes me want to watch better material from them the plot twists are half telegraphed to the point of self parody and half nonsensical to the point of absurdity the one legitimately great thing about the show is the score i think if youre from new york city this show is probably funnier since its riddled with winking injokes about the city but even then the humor is one note there are countless better mysteries comedies and steve martinmartin short content out there dont waste your time,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3891,2.0,19 January 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i expected to love this and although i like martin short and steve martin in this i really dont selena gomez in this i loved her in wizards of waverly place and expected her to be great in this she isnt good at all and i really dont understand the glowing reviews she brings the show down for me she is completely wooden like kristen stewart woodenexcept on an antidepressant or something she is entirely unfeeling and shows no emotion whatsoever almost robotic she speaks in a monotone voice and her face is fairly expressionless is there a chance that her character turns out to be a cold murderersure maybe id have to continue watching to find out is she intentionally acting this way because thats what will happen i dont know but shes pretty awful in this and should try to make her character less guilty seeming perhaps i expected to love her in this and now i dont see myself watching anything shes in,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3892,1.0,3 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i happened upon this show accidentally and when i saw all of the star reviews i thought i happened upon a masterpiece the first episode was good but it still had me on the fence that one scene where things happen in reverse put me off and made me rethink my expectations of the show and the second episode quickly ruined it altogether it isnt funny to me and the dialogue and character dynamics come out as awkward i see too much of the actors in their characters and lines and the delivery of them the little amount of originality within them thats left is boring i might continue casually watching it if my current opinion changes ill make an edit if not id recommend sitting out on this one,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3893,1.0,24 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",it includes a conversation whis is incorrect and has false information in it about turks commiting genocide they even write greeks in there which is a never case in history it is obvious they did not use any historian to consult about this it seems that they write the scene just by their opinion which they lack so much about it,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3894,3.0,16 February 2024,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i seriously think ai bots must be giving this lousy series high ratings and glowing reviews hard to believe sentient beings could feel that way about this steaming pile the premise is good but thats it the casting is a joke only steve martin has some redeeming qualities along with some of the extra characters but the main cast is mainly awful esp selena gomez and martin short who go together like oil and water selena may have talents but acting is not one of them and martin short not sure if he was ever funny but hes not now i can assure you the rest of the show is mainly used to develop its hollywood diversity bona fides,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3895,1.0,24 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this one started well and expectancy levels were high considering the names involved but it goes downhill after episode a total let down in terms of script and the pretext for the murder was rather lame so with the ending perhaps preparing for s selena gomez has the same stoic stare and monotonous voice throughout the old men are tolerable though not the dialogues i actually fast forwarded many of the episodes hoping for some thing sane somewhere there was none,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3896,3.0,6 November 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i have seen this show on my hulu constantly as it has steve martin and martin short i was doubtful when i saw it received high marks i decided to watch what i got was exactly what i expected unfortunately both actors trying to act funny when neither of them are funny martin is funny when he plays the straight guy short just tries way to hard insert selena gomez she is good enough but they make her swear just for the effect of seeing her swear conversation twists old people young people old people dont know the current lingo and the deaf episode i can only imagine how everyone was patting themselves on the back for that episode self important lazy and simple a waste of time,NEGATIVE,Comedy

3898,5.0,13 October 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",we have been fans of the show since day one the interaction between martin short and steve martin is phenomenal i wasnt sure about selena but they are match made for that building the amount of profanity in season deterred my husband from watching it at all i did watch the entire season and enjoyed the story line but it was painful due to the language it is so terribly sad the writers felt the need for all of the foul language when it is sooooo uncessary maybe next season only murders in the building as for now i have to tell my teenagers they will miss this season again it is so completely unnecessary and we feel good about our review because we are not the only ones that were extremely disappointed in the profanity used throughout the entire season,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3899,3.0,4 February 2024,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the first episode is promising but it gets more and more monotonous with old jokes and scenes i love steve martin but selena gomez and martin short are totally the wrong actors for this series steve has that subtle black humor when he wants to and maybe a better counterpart would be hugh laurie instead of the slightly boring martin short who cant even make the necessary grimace to raised the mood of the scene selena seems disinterested and her acting shows how bored she is and probably only the generous fee contributed to her socalled role in this nonsense of a series that should be like a comedy in my opinion it would be better to hire a new actress instead of catering to the younger audience generation z or whatever those tik tok lumens are called with selena gomez i love comedies but this is well thought out but disastrously written with disastrous actors who cant wait to get back to their trailers instead of dying of laughter we just got that ha ha moment when something funny comes up i understand that a black woman was needed as balance but at least you could have thrown in whoopi or retta instead of the disinterested selena in series like this the actors facial expression is also very important but apart from steve who tries something everyone else is sterile for someone who literally grew up watching comedies this is barely two stars,NEGATIVE,Comedy

3920,4.0,12 April 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",after seeing it wondered why these actors didnt share a cast before in a similar genre steve martin and martin short together in an understated elegant detective comedy well more like comedic series with accents of good old times times that apparently did not exist before since they never shared a similar cast but the feeing that this is so spot on that it must have existed before does not go away the setting is good the story captivating the atmosphere great escapist series with people living a sheltered life although they make sacrifices for it and they embelish reality because they arecartistical personalities this is worth watching and hopefully will keep the same tone for the following seasons it manages to be beautiful in various ways and it is more than just a detective impromptu detectives story tje building also has a role the city too,POSITIVE,Comedy
3921,1.0,21 February 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",selena gomezs acting confuses me here some times she gets it right and some times its like she doesnt know how she wants to convey herself is she a secret villain or someone that just doesnt have energy in the first season she was called shifty by martin shorts character hes incredibly right mable mora is as confusing as it gets not mysteriously enticing the whole idea of one young girl being besties with two old dudes is cute but after a while it makes you think if its realistic enough for these old men to have that much energy to be running around with so much murder and drama speaking of the first season ended in a dramatic way and you mean to tell me someone wants to leave another dead body so early on in the season to kick start the plot its too rushed too inconsistent too unreal plus points though i love their fashion and the interior is beautiful it gave off the expensive vibes gossip girl reboot wished it could convey,POSITIVE,Comedy
3922,5.0,6 June 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",five episode in and the shows kind of a let down the story feels like it has too many extraneous tangents feels like writers need to fill ten episodes selenas acting is flat martin shorts energy true to form carries any scene hes in and wheres the ineffable artistry of our beloved steve martin certainly in the writing but on screen time meah,NEGATIVE,Comedy

3924,3.0,25 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",slow to start with a general year old comedic preference throughout an ok show tbh the younger cast keeps it going would be good if not for the racial slurs against irish people by the older cohort why is it still acceptable to do that irish flu in e and in e rainbow crafted by a drunken leprechaun is ok because hes irish with a drinking problem although i probably answered my own question with its year old comedic preference,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3925,4.0,31 August 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",everything about this screams too much money too many yes men and not enough talent or self awareness a lot has been spent on costumes and sets and they look great and cast they look good but apart from martin short arent bothering to act whilst it appears no time or thought has gone into the story script or editing additionally theres the occasional bit of light disablism racism poor bashing and ageism dropped in apparently for laughs as a counterpoint to the extreme privilege of the whole setting but its really jarring and unnecessary,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3926,5.0,14 March 2024,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i made it through the first episodes and thought it was pretty good but slow moving episode killed it for me first after an opening commercial they spent nearly minutes showing the same scenes they showed in the earlier episodes why obviously they were just stretching it out because everyone had already seen them then more commercials that were too dumb to watch then they spend several minutes with a policewoman and her roomie talking not moving the story ahead at all then more blather from a supposed super blogger that also did nothing to add to the story episode was over minutes but only included less than minutes of anything that advanced the story from the end of episode it felt like something interesting was going to happen but i was too bored to wait through more hours to get to it too much spam i dont even care how it eventually ended,NEGATIVE,Comedy

3932,3.0,2 November 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i find all the characters annoying and largely unbelievable maybe theater lovers see something i dont the writing feels pretentious and so desperate to be funny that it just becomes awkward selena gomez doesnt feel natural and is more suited for music than film cant fault her for taking this opportunity though also i never realized how annoying martin shorts voice can be if i had to pick a favorite it would be steve martin he gets star and the theme song is catchy so for it overall everything put together feels like a waste of time and like all of these amazing resources wouldve been better spent elsewhere,NEGATIVE,Comedy

3936,3.0,18 September 2024,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i understand that she can bring audience to watch the series but she has a single expression for all emotions and expressions and a dead fish voice she just spoilt and wasted a great lead character bu acting in it that role could have been acted by a well deserving actor who had spent years learning acting she should stick to producing the show and leave teh acting part toa ctors numerous times i felt a irritation whenever selena gomez came on screen with her voice and expressions these people should know what is their strength and stick to doing only that part of the show business and leave the actual creative process to experts,NEGATIVE,Comedy

3940,3.0,31 December 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",its not entirely her fault its clear she was badly miscast presumably to help fulfill some ethnicdiversity requirement and she sounds as if she was poorly dubbed her lifeless beadyeyed expression never changes the two male leads are considerably more fun to watch but martin shorts agingshowbizloser character animated garrulous bubbly and soft comes off as gay thats what he would be in real life so its weird to see him visiting his adult son and even weirder that the son is another example of nonwhite casting implausible steve martins character makes more sense but hes also the series creator and so its probably his fault that from the start the story tends to drag even for example in the first episode an episode that really ought to hook us the camera lingers on him as he delivers a tedious uninterrupted monologue about his past gomez is given one too equally tedious and well put it this way when larry david in the latest season of his own series gets bored and impatient with what someone is saying he begins humming the music thats played at the academy awards when an oscar recipients speech drones on too long he even whips out his cell phone and plays it on that all too often i had the same reaction hearing gomez and martin i genuinely wanted to like this series partly since it was filmed in my neighborhood but as with other disappointed viewers on this site i feel as if my time has been wasted,NEGATIVE,Comedy

3942,2.0,30 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",we watch a lot of murder mystery series so were attracted to only murders in the building the attraction was mostly due to the three lead actors weve always liked steve martin and martin short it is great to see selena gomez in a series role too and she is doing a fine job the story line is quite different quirky which we like the comedy is fun but not overwhelming based on all ive written we would stay with the show except for one thing the director must live in a different existence than we do the swearing interrupts the flow for us and is completely unnecessary it could be simply cut out of the script with no loss whatsoever,NEGATIVE,Comedy

3944,4.0,22 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",look im totally fine with bad language in the right context im all in for a tarantino movie or eddy murphy raw or anything like that in this it seems way out of place and its jarring lost interest after the first few minutes of episode also selena gomez is so blah there is so much potential here but its wasted on her and the poor attempt to make classic comedians relevant by bad writing,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3945,3.0,14 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",finally martin short is back and hes back together with steve martin the magic duo from the s they have always had a great chemistry and that hasnt changed a bit selena looks more lost and i have to say her acting couldve been better it all started out great with an interesting plot and drive but then apple products started popping up everywhere it felt like watching a very long apple commercial maybe its just me but i have no interests in watching whats obviously product placements in a series or film even if steve and martin headlines it so after episodes i found something else to watch,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3946,1.0,12 August 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",a pretty awful vanity project for steve martin and martin short i watched the whole of the first season on disney in the uk and that was as much as i wanted to see my biggest problem with the first season is that oliver putnam played by martin short is such an appalling human being with absolutely no redeeming qualities clearly much of this is down to bad writing but martin short and his directors also need some of the credit for not toning down what was written and i just couldnt believe that oliver putnam had ever been a functioning director of musical theatre i just couldnt suspend my disbelief and as a male who is closer to steve martins age than selena gomezs i found the sexual relationship between his character and amy ryans character to be rather vomit inducing and another instance of my not being able to suspend my disbelief all in all this seems a rather muddled production it should really hang on the chemistry between the three investigators but there is little actual chemistry there so give this one a miss unless youre really desperate for something to watch,NEGATIVE,Comedy

3954,4.0,17 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",martin short and steve martin havent been funny in years and selena is just mediocre in this shame because steve was hilarious before say in the jerk i have never understood why new york seriously believes it is the best place on earth especially with so many people moving out of it the excessive cursing may be normal for new york but it is not for the rest of us its okay if you have nothing better to watch,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3955,5.0,28 June 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",how is this a good clean series when practically every character drops a million fbombs i swear too though as ive gotten older ive really cut back cuz ive realized its just not an attractive trait to have especially in the office or out in public sorry but thats my top complaint about this series who are they trying to target with that kinda language anyways when i asked my yo mom if she liked this series she didnt like the swearing and said it was too boring as well too many times hell shouldve been said instead of fbombs or ht the sentences didnt make sense with how they were said this just isnt a funny lol kind of series like it was being hyped up as a few sorta funny moments in episodes does not make up for the boring tired writing thats being played out i grew up on steve martin records king tut rules movies snl even got a im a wild crazy gal tshirt with the bunny ears and arrow going thru it from my sister when i was wore it proudly loved most of his movies and liked some of martin shorts too many were too overthetop for my taste like clifford but i had much higher expectations from them both though sad to say im not actually too surprised at how lame much of this is i wanted to like selena gomez but like others have commented her monotone voice and acting like shes so bored during her scenes has been a huge turnoff i guess thats how they wanted her character to sound act all are executive producers so if she wanted to not act bored she couldve said or done something about it im on episode now and do like seeing the guest stars like nathan lane and even sting so far and ill most likely watch thru the remaining season just to see more of the background storylines maybe thatll help me like it and to see what happens to the killer who ive already guessed by episode but i wont be watching anymore seasons of this sadly and mom refuses to watch anymore of it too she only made it thru the first episode,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3956,1.0,21 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i found myself binging the show i wanted to switch off numerous times i was so irritated and annoyed by this show many absolutely stupid things happen you can forgive them because the whole show is light and doesnt really care all that much there are some decent elements to the show it is quite fun in some ways but its mind numbingly bad in others most of the jokes are cringe worthy some of the events are downright nonsensical and either written like that because who cares its a light comedy mystery show with big name stars or they really are stupid and dont care the police in the show are stupid i guess if you want to switch off and not care and just have some light fun it could work for you if you want something a bit deeper with some realism and decent jokes id suggest passing on it,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3957,3.0,17 December 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i cant quite get attached to this having grown up on sherlock holmes hercule poirot and murder she wrote i wanted a murder mystery that had some semblance to these shows and i was hoping omitb would live up to that initially i did have my doubts how could two comic actors provide the edge needed for such genre im thinking how effective benedict cumberbatch was in his take on holmes well doubts are proven true omitb feels more like a vehicle for martin and short built with trademark comedic elements peculiar to both of them in which the murder mystery feels more like a support act rather than the framework on which the show ought to be built upon theres also too much introspection on the part of characters some of which doesnt add anything substantive to the plot and that part with sting what is that how was his character even necessary to the plot it just gets mired in silliness im surprised the legend from the police was even willing to take part in such a portrayal he certainly doesnt need the paycheque the actings generally ok you get what youve always expected from martin short and nathan lane on that even sting pulls his weight through despite the limitation on his self portrayal for a singer who hasnt acted much after his dune days his timing remains spot on on the other hand selena gomez looks and feels lame its like she could only come up with a single expression delivered in a monotone in each episode you wish shed take up some acting lessons to at least convey a modicum of emotions instead of looking blank nope i wont venture into s,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3958,5.0,27 June 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this is a show for those with simple minds that are either nostalgic for the simple investigation shows of the s or those who have never in their life watched a murder mystery show or a comedy show or any show that can be considered good selena gomez is just such a terrible actor and she cant even play a character that has basically no character and then theres the mysteryyoull never guess whobecause they use the tired bs trope of pretending the character doesnt exist until much further in the seasonwow such a mysterynot reality is this is just so cliche bland and boring but maybe thats all the gereatrics can comprehend,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3959,4.0,23 February 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",hello this series which i watched and followed with love made me sad with the last one i watched in some of the lines in the th episode there were sentences that gave wrong historical information about the citizens of turkey and greece as a turkish citizen i condemn the creation of a different perception by distorting and distorting history in such tv series i find it meaningless and unnecessary to try to create polarization by giving such false information about the turkish and greek peoples thank you,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3960,4.0,13 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",its too silly and how can someone really produce and watch thisand produce this dram is easy to make but comedy is a challenge pity to see such excelente actors doing so stupid things but i believe thats a issue,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3961,3.0,2 December 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",not bad especially compared to the horrid crap currently on tv the acting is good the writing decent and i like the mystery within the mystery although im not sure it has a lot of longevity,POSITIVE,Comedy
3962,5.0,23 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",a cool relevant concept but its just not interesting enough a lot of fluff not enough intriguing content love steve martin in this but thats about it i could not stay focused on this show selena was not a good fit for this role shes monotone no expression dry seemingly emotionless robotic kind of feels like a missed opportunity unfortunately potential is there but sadly there seems to be too much going on for me and not enough of that seems purposeful for the actual story a bit boring the mark was missed,NEGATIVE,Comedy

3964,5.0,28 December 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i still get amazed at these zealot fools who write negative reviews because of language they didnt like are you that dumb you cant see its rated r or ma for coarse language why are you watching stuff you know youll cry about like knowing theres gay sex and you watch it then complain lol if youre such a prude and your beliefs suck why bother watching anything talk about entitlement anyways the show is ruined by selena gomez the two dudes who are supposed to be actual actors arent much better here either so you know this is a stinker father of the bride theres a true comedy with steve martin martin short,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3965,5.0,5 November 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i was looking forward to this show but unfortunately martine short overacts and his acting is eerily like his parody work on sctv it is distracting and very disappointing you cant help but wonder why is steve martin continuing to collaborate with a shill martin and gomez are very good and appropriately restrained short acts like he is in vaudeville show replace short and its passable or at the very least get him to tone it down the locale is amazing what a beautiful building which is clearly a feature but it is a bit distracting to the storyline i have only watched the first few episode so hopefully it will improve,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3966,7.34,29 December 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i cant believe this show averages over on imdb and for the life of me i cant even begin to fathom why it sucks so much at being funny really you laughed here where when why the jokes are terrible they systematically fall flat it reminds me of those outdated burlesque plays those buffooneries where everything and everyone is over the top all the time and which are just pathetically lame grimaces and smirks that make you laugh come on steve martin and martin short are constantly hamming it up and god its exhausting to watch ive always been a huge fan of steve martins speeches but found his onscreen performances mostly boring that show is a new low for him same for martin short their acting is as subtle as an elephant in a china store dont get me started on the socalled whodunnit wtf is that farfetched plot its halfbaked clumsy unrelatable and most of all not interesting in the slightest i honestly couldnt care less about their podcast the murder itself and to think that some really incredible and bold shows are being cancelled after one season while this lukewarm broth has been renewed several times,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3967,7.34,16 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i cant believe some of these reviews giving this show high ratings and it is absolutely terrible an rating i love steve martin but this is very badly done couldnt make it past the second episode,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3968,7.34,23 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the show is ok mediocre at best the martins are the most enjoyable part of the show its a pts for steve martin and pts for a low rent mystery suggestions for s st drop the monotone boring emotionless gomez leave her in jail nd find someone older than years old to help insert the vulgar language it just was so unnatural and out of place most of the time in s,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3969,7.34,23 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",it was a series that i loved watching at first but the th episode contains errors please youre not reporting history objectively the turks didnt commit massacres or genocide you can not portray turks badly in the media you should apologize,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3970,7.34,16 September 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",but three episodes were all i could take slow and predictable,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3971,7.34,26 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",the best way to describe how it feels trying to like it is if you ever tried lifting of your maximum weightlifting load its extremely difficult and those moments when it seems doable are so deceptive the plot and the lines are horribly bland like i literally have a feeling that funnier lines wouldve been more expensive to make so here i am wasting my time because i couldnt afford something better to watch by the th episode i got even angry at them because its now clear they just made a show about themselves to themselves and imaginary fans because if they didnt theyd actually have to try harder,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3972,7.34,28 October 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",there was a murder in the building and no one looked worried or scary it looks like everyone was having fun and didnt care not even the police cared they were trying to solve the murder mystery but instead they are doing podcasts and recording everything like a funny joke i wanted to feel like there was a murder and they would be worried and find the mystery with suspense instead of charles dating jan oliver family history etc they are showing oliver putnam a mystery from childhood but oliver has an month rent due how come a man does not know how to earn money get a job and pay rent but knows everything about murder cases and the podcast fans were waiting on the street for days that werent funny to watch the mystery was good but the way they found it wasnt good i would give if it was an art thief mystery,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3973,7.34,15 September 2024,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",in only murders in the building season episode i noticed a portrayal that seems to touch on a recurring theme in some u s productions turks being depicted in a negative light particularly in relation to greeks i find it curious as historically after the events of the early th century the turkish and greek nations have maintained a relatively peaceful relationship mustafa kemal atatürk the founder of modern turkey is even known to have shown great respect towards greece famously refusing to step on a greek flag today turkish and greek cultures are incredibly similar and many people from both nations regard each other as friends so it makes me wonder why certain narratives continue to portray conflict between them it feels like these portrayals might be missing the nuanced relationship these two nations share perhaps its worth considering the broader impact of such portrayals in popular media especially when it comes to fostering understanding and peace between nations its always important to question the motives behind recurring stereotypes and their influence on public perception,POSITIVE,Comedy
3974,7.34,10 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i was very dissapointed and thought it was a cheesy show there was a lot of language and that was part of the reason that i had to stop watching it i love comedies but did not think the show was that funny at all i thought the storyline was clever but would not recommend it,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3975,7.34,13 September 2024,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i love all the actors but i dont know if i will continue watching so sorry you need to consider that not all the fans are democrats it is now more of the same im sure selena who is the worst on the series suggests this selena gomes why in all your pics on instagram you look so thin and on the series soooo big please take some acting lessons and try not to use politics on the series with your insignificant self is enough congratulations on the rest try not to suck i grow up with all the cast and i love you guys except on the insignificant selena please please please leave the politics out of the show,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3976,7.34,14 September 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",only murders in the building season delves into intriguing mysteries yet again but this time not without some notable shortcomings one aspect that marred the viewing experience was the portrayal of interactions with the deaf character theo its evident that the show failed to conduct thorough research into how deaf individuals converse the countless instances of mable turning her back to theo expecting him to understand her without clear lip movements were a cringeworthy oversight effective communication with deaf individuals relies on exaggerated lip movements which was notably absent here furthermore the performance of the character mable left much to be desired whether its due to apparent botox or plastic surgery work her lack of facial expressions became a significant distraction scenes involving her felt monotonous and lacked the emotional depth needed to fully engage the audience however the saving grace of the season lies in the performances of charles and oliver their chemistry and charisma shine through elevating the show if not for the offensive representation of the deaf community and mables limited facial expressions this season had the potential to be a perfect instead it stands at a middling stars held back by its missteps in these critical areas,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3977,7.34,15 August 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",no issue with the story here but like a lot of programmes they have relied heavily on showing notes and texts on screen i have a slight vision problem not enough to stop me enjoying watching tv but enough so i cant read text on my tv from my sofa constantly having to pause playback and get up and walk across to the tv to read the texts shown on the screen completely ruined it for me particularly the episode which focused on the deaf character and was pretty much completely reliant on subtitles if i wanted to read a book i would add to that the fact that most of selena gomezs lines are mumbled and it wasnt a great viewing experience for me,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3978,7.34,12 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i remember when blazing saddles came out one critic condensing his review to saying it was some wellliked stars using vulgar language wow the fword was only mouthed just once i didnt like that they joked about rape which seemed to be a thing in s comedy here we are in the series began last year i had only seen the first episodes when it began and got sidetracked this weekend i decided to catchup after learning the nd season had begun but seeing stars i once thought highly of along with unknown middleaged senior actors reduced to speaking like poorly educated street trash what trump era gave us i just couldnt stomach it glad i didnt buy the dvd or bluray set years ago i learned and still believe that people who resort to using gutter language are too poorly educated to think of any other words to express their feelings more precise would be they are too morally poor and as demonstrated by the applause when late night host use the fword although censored on tv they use that language to appeal to the segment of society that thinks it cool for their fav celebs to talk dirty,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3979,7.34,21 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",great story and acting too its a shame they feel everybody talks or appreciates garbage language wonder how many complaints theyd get that there just arent enough f bombs in the show too bad they limited their audience on this one,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3980,7.34,13 October 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",each episode lasts approx minuted and but only minutes are related to a dead person in second episode first episode has more talking and events about deal person but in generally we see only talking in only murders in the building almost nothing else thats why its boring maybe other episodes are better but i dont want to watch them there are many offtopic events for example n actor goes to his adult kid asking him for help his kid doesnt want to help him another offtopic event is showing memory or female actor since not related to murder in hotel i dont like it looks like offtopic events are used to delay finding murderer is murderer found in the last episode of the first season there are also many monologues we dont see who is talking which are introducing situation like in many other series and movies i dont like that either,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3981,7.34,7 October 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",really seriously folks this show started out just ok i can forgive the terribly bad acting by selena gomez and that for a show with all time great comedy actors there is not even a scene that can make anyone laugh seriously why have the last episodes had no sound just subtitles because the main person is deaf that is a total insult and slam in the face to both deaf people and the ones that can hear the show does have some promise though there are some cons yeah slap in the face to disabled people i mean really slap a whole episodes with no sound just subtitles it is a total fu to deaf people really bad acting i mean really bad acting you can watch youtube videos with better acting by a toddler and yeah for a comedy it is not funny pros the story aside from the very bad way it is being told is actually interesting it has selena gomez steve martin and martin short they are actually great actors i just wish they would step up the game they totally stink in this,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3982,7.34,7 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this is a delightful show except for the nasal voice of mabel which sounds like some autotune contraption has been shoved down her throat i think it would have been even better if it was a couple of episodes shorter but overall a mustwatch,POSITIVE,Comedy
3983,7.34,12 July 2022,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i have no idea what people give it stars i find it barely watchable and as usual martin short is very annoying maybe if they had a better cast id enjoy it more,NEGATIVE,Comedy
3984,7.34,31 August 2023,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",most older viewers will go in to this to see steve martin and martin short team up while younger viewers are likely here for selena gomez you will certainly get your fill as far as screen time goes but not quite the best as far as performances go all three are fine enough in their roles but we are talking a spoofy murder mystery here steve martin gets more humor and drama than the others and does well with it and generally being a lot less over the top than we are used to seeing him which i found refreshing martin shorts character works more an annoyance that lets others be funny although he does have some funny lines but much less than we normally see selena gomez is a bit uneven she works best when she is investigating and not so good when she is supposed to be emotional it cant be easy holding your own with this cast but i do think she held her ground pretty well the story is a spoof about crime murder podcasts and manages to go through many different phases during the episode run it started strong and then ambles along very pleasantly until it,POSITIVE,Comedy
3985,7.34,10 May 2024,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",so many good things about this show great cast who knew they would have chemistry steve martin and martin short are comedic geniuses and then add in selena banter between them was classic show is wellwritten and the dialogue is witty lighthearted and funny the story has twists and turns and best of all it captures nyc people dynamics so well meetings between random people paranoia about your neighbors eating at the local deli mingling with artsy types its all true and hilarious at the same time i discovered this show while sick with the flu and i highly recommend watching its just what the doctor ordered,POSITIVE,Comedy
3986,7.34,26 February 2024,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",so how do i start telling everyone i like the show oh well i like it it is a light crimedetective show like a board game filled with other funny events i have to admit i was looking for something else but i did not get disappointed after the first episodes i cannot remember when i saw steve martin and martin short last time to be honest i did not even know they were still in the business both of them are so genuine and natural and so refreshing totally worth spending time watching it and also loved the fact that they attached various artists to the show like sting and meryl and paul,POSITIVE,Comedy
3987,7.34,3 January 2024,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",this series of minute episodes is a hulu original it just completed its rd season in there are episodes in all we had not watched any of it because we are not subscribed now as begins the abc network which we catch via antenna in our attic has started to broadcast episodes starting with season episode the first night they broadcast the first episodes with commercials over a hour time slot same a week later then also the next week now the last night january rd is the single last episode the show is from a steve martin idea here he plays one of the three main characters actor charleshaden savage and in the s played a character a new york detective called brazzos what a curious name most likely a result of martins sense of humor back in he was born in waco texas a city on the brazos river and his character brazzos is most likely an homage to his birthplace the second main character is another something martin short as stage director oliver putnam who seems to have fallen on hard financial times and now is in danger of losing his prime manhattan apartment not a big fan of the actor his variety of humor rarely connects with our sensibilities the third main character is ish selena gomez as mabel mora so far it isnt very clear what her job is but she seems to be renovating her aunts apartment she is a good addition to the threeperson team who were all mutual strangers at first against expectations the three of them develop an interesting and entertaining chemistry right away motivated by a podcast they all admire they decide to solve murders but only the ones that take place in their building it is interesting being a tv broadcast they bleep out all profanity and it demonstrates that profanity is absolutely unnecessary if you have a good story so as with most crime entertainment shows as things develop the audience is led to suspect a range of different characters as the murderer at the same time led to not believe certain characters could be and some twists at the end are designed to surprise my wife and i enjoyed it as light and interesting entertainment i especially like steve martin we may or may not watch season two if it is broadcast on abc,POSITIVE,Comedy
3988,7.34,29 November 2021,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",when i saw the ad for this on hulu and decided to give it a chance i turned on the first episode and then got hooked steve marty and selena have incredible chemistry cant wait for season,POSITIVE,Comedy
3989,7.34,4 March 2024,"August 31, 2021 (United States)",i loved the characters and i thought the casting was excellent i had never heard of selena gomez but i loved her in this it is very light going with a scattering of jokes and mild drama there is the odd speciality episode like the one without any spoken dialogue other reviewers have stated that although alright this is not as great as people make out technically they are absolutely right it isnt ground shattering stuff but as a fan of the likes of monk jonathan creek rizzoli isles it feels like there has not been anything new in the same vein for quite a while this is good honest light sleuthy fun and the smile on my face as i watched every episode justifies my star rating alone edit season season starts of very shaky with some clumsy attempts at humour that dont land and amy schumer stomping through the middle of the plot like a bull at a tea party but by episode it is all back on track well done,POSITIVE,Comedy
3990,1.0,27 November 2011,"November 2, 2011 (France)",do not look at this through the prism of foreign films youd be wasting your time and miss something far too important hollywood does scale like nobody else leaving the competition gasping in its wake france does intimacy and brutality nothing is sacred and rather than try to revive the new wave or emulate hollywood like most widely seen french films of late intouchables harnesses its core strengths ease with intimacy willingness to ridicule anything and brutal honesty and delivers one of the funniest most honest and touching films i have ever seen sy is a failed robber going through the motions and playing the stereotypical jobless émigré cluzet is a romantic and melancholy mind trapped in a useless body the circumstances that bring them together are too funny to spoil here but meet they do and an awkward relationship quickly blossoms as they bring out the best in each other the films simplicity is delightfully misleading the script is a masterpiece of comedy writing and however good the rest of the cast is the central duo is magical sys comic timing will have you in stitches but it is his honesty and vulnerability that make you fall in love with the character cluzet isnt your typical sadsack instead much of the finest pleasures in the film consist in watching him use his keen mind to mess with the world around him a subplot about an abstract painting really takes the biscuit youll know it when you see it this is one of the most unique beautiful and honest friendships ever committed to film it will make you laugh it will make you cry a delightful celebration of everything in life that makes it worthwhile,POSITIVE,Comedy
3991,1.0,10 January 2012,"November 2, 2011 (France)",i am now trying to find words to describe this movie for an hour i couldnt youve seen it or you havent its monumental and outrageously good the cast is brilliant the jokes lovely the story and the idea behind the movie is beautiful especially when youve workedlived with handicapped people the music is such a perfect choice it is unbelievable i hope this movie makes a plenty of people think about how good their life is and how bad it could have been bottom line oscarworthy period,POSITIVE,Comedy
3992,1.0,17 January 2012,"November 2, 2011 (France)",in less than two months untouchable became the second most successful french film by number of spectators such an event by itself that people went then to see it not because they thought it was good but to see what was so good in it thats the virtual circle of success my biggest disappointment in was with the tree of life a movie i sincerely wanted to love but couldnt and i left the theater before it ended with a bitter taste of frustration proportionally my greatest positive surprise came with untouchable because it was the opposite expectation i was sure i would dislike it figuring the movie manipulated viewers through the overused device of the improbable friendship why such preconceived negativity well when a young black guy from french suburbs darkly depicted in mathieu kassovitz hate and infamous for its occasional riots befriends a rich quadriplegic i immediately think of good feelings mainstream populism unaware that i apply to myself a cynical judgment that can undermine my very way to enjoy not just this film but any film after all why getting ready for hatred when its so relieving to give the benefit of the doubt and get ready for appreciation especially since more than millions of french people from different ages and backgrounds liked it so i saw it and loved it the story of untouchable is the kind of unintentional masterpiece that only movies can provide every once in a while it has no other pretension than to depict a magnificent and inspiring friendship story starting as a simple job a young man with a senegalese background omar sy as driss only needs a signature to prove that he attended an interview for a livein carer job for some strange reason paul the rich man played by a wonderful françois cluzet gives him the job with a onemonth trial period the reason of this choice is smoothly handled by the script the film starts with all the job applicants every one of them unnaturally posing and getting mixed in prepared answers then driss casually enters without waiting for his turn or knocking on the door hes got enough problems to deal with unemployment an experience in jail being a pariah for society and undesirable even in his own family especially her adoptive aunt driss attitude pleases paul because after his paragliding accident he cant feel his body from neck to toes and needs caring almost hours per days and days per week so he really doesnt have time for bullshit either and this is a remarkable aspect in the script written by the two directors eric toledano and olivier nakache it doesnt waste time cementing the friendship the two leads rapidly get fond of each other a feeling illustrated in the poster with both posing with natural smiles the film shows omars struggle to learn how needy paul is which provides some priceless comedic moments but untouchable goes immediately to the core an eyeopening message about the life endured by a handicapped person making all the wealth in the world pointless and the richness of heart and mind priceless through driss and pauls interaction the film explores the real needs of people in life respect and understanding acceptance and love maybe if it was handled by other directors it would have been predictable but in untouchable the complicity between the two heroes feels absolutely real theres one scene when driss shave the bushy beard of paul well i wont spoil it for you but the part was a clever mix of realism and comedy because anyone would have done what driss did at one moment and thats the secret of the film it feels real some movies can work with a good story but they need good performances in untouchable its almost impossible to determine who carried the film both cluzet and sy were great and i dont get the complaints why they didnt respect the original story where the carer was an arab or how they sugarcoated the handicap i even heard that in america they were accusing the film of racism because driss was portrayed as a sort of i quote helper monkey seriously this is getting old the way handicap is approached never flirts with an exaggerated pathos nor the opposite which is the most intelligent achievement theres a sort of hearts intelligence in the way omar teases cluzet with his own handicap and the film provides the extraordinary message that pleasure and thrills have unlimited media whether they come from pot an earmassage or even paragliding many of pauls friends criticizes the presence of driss in pauls life but paul doesnt care omar is a man full of life big tall and strong and when he uses violence to teach a man the respect of a parking sign paul admits this is the right method both are in the same wavelength i wondered if the title untouchable referred to the lowest caste in india echoing the two mens conditions both outcasts physically and socially but i guess their relationship evolves into a friendship precisely because theyre both strongminded and together they become even stronger until getting untouchables in the noblest meaning of the word there are real people in untouchable nothing works as plot devices even if some situations are so cinematically appealing omar inviting everybody to dance during pauls birthday his learning of the aristocratic world the art of abstract painting and the way he breaks the conventions with an unconventional charisma reaches a level of energetic comedy that reminds of the greatest days of eddie murphy with cluzet as a perfect straightman not deprived from a sense of humor untouchable is simply an inspiring story of friendship with whatever defines this beautiful virtue and yes its one of the best french films ever and certainly one of the best of,POSITIVE,Comedy
3993,9.0,14 November 2011,"November 2, 2011 (France)",being french and a film maker myself i have high standards for ratings and this one definitely deserves in ive not seen a film showing our world with such humour in a long time the jokes are absurd and possibly with a touch of british humour to them the directing is beautiful the acting is incredible the shots are somehow truthful if i can say that about a shot it may be omar sys first time in a leading role for a major production but he really delivered and not just in the funny parts the delivery of emotions was just spotless francois cluzet was also just as brilliant as he usually is i will be recommending this film to everyone and seriously hoping it will be released in the uk soon enough for me to see it again only negative aspect the americans are thinking of doing a remake why do they always have to i mean would you reconsider remaking the joconde or the sixtine chapel to american standards film is an art like any other it travels the world as it is no need for remakes,POSITIVE,Comedy
3994,1.0,28 December 2011,"November 2, 2011 (France)",it has been weeks now since intoucblaes has come to the movie theaters i did not give it much thought at first but the universal acclaim i have heard convinced me to go see it i dont overstating the universality of the acclaim people of various races classes colors countries told me it was a must see i had no expectations and i was floored intouchables directed by eric toledano and olivier nakache starring francois cluzet and omar sy is possibly the best french movie of the year this is not because of a lack of worthy contenders but truly because intouchables is that profound it touches on themes of presumptions social class difference health and as naïve as it may sound the universality of humanity the story is not as important as is the relationship that is displayed between the two protagonists philippe played by cluzet a rich aristocrat that loves adrenaline rushes finds himself a paraplegic after a paragliding incident driss played by sy is in appearance a typical hoodlum from the ghetto the two are brought together and wonders happen the audience then sees how the men affect one another as they engage in a truly honest relationship driss is charismatic lighthearted and funny helping make philippes life enjoyable again in the process the traditionally cold french aristocracy around philippe warms up and lightens he is like a hot knife through cold butter again it is not so much the story that is important as is the social commentary the commentary is not judgmental and is very subtle revealed only in the contrasts the director chose in the story and its contexts his method reminded me of a sort of zen approach to comedy one example you can catch from the trailer alone is the contrast between the able bodied black driss and t the crippled white man etc the audience is also given wonderful sights of paris and france as we go through the pyrenees cabourg and the various streets of paris on paper the review does not make the movie justice it is hilarious in a way that is true honest and by which anyone can relate to most importantly it is revealing and comforting in its reminder of the essential in life love its approach is simple pure and honest and that makes it worthy of the title of best movie of the year i cannot say more the film must be experienced my friends tried they failed so i trusted them and i saw it it floored me go and be floored ps i heard american studios have purchased the rights for the film they will need a brilliant director screenwriters and perfect actors to make the original justice in the way the departed did for infernal affairs,POSITIVE,Comedy
3995,1.0,20 November 2011,"November 2, 2011 (France)",well ive just got out of the theater and i must say that all the reviews are right this is an amazing film the actors are simply the best omar is not only a great comic but also a great actor the filming has a certain touch that brings to mind whats eating gilbert grape in the way the director was able to capture not only the suffering of phillip but also the joy not wanting to spoil the film for others i highly recommend seeing this in the theaters and with a loved one it is also a good film for teenagers as it holds a few wonderful life lessons enjoy,POSITIVE,Comedy

3998,8.0,11 December 2011,"November 2, 2011 (France)",its not because im french that i appreciated this movie which ive seen twice too give the really infamous appreciation of the reader from toronto to the french public qualifying us of a segregationist country is difficult to gulp especially coming from north america which has not a very glorious past on the matter even in recent years perhaps the commentator should see the movie the help to refresh his memory but what id like to say here apart of praising the fabulous interpretation of both leading actors is to remind that this is a true story it did not come out from the directors and scriptwriter heads philippe pozzo di borgo born in got a dramatic paraglider accident in the french alps in being totally deprived of movements from the base of his neck to the tip of his feet years later his wife died and he was helped out of his depression by abdel sellou his lifeaid assistant he published his terrible story in under the title the second breath in french le second soufflé the directors have had the compliments of di borgo for the way they adapted his story if in any way this was biased he would never had accepted the film to be left in that state the di borgo family is a very old and wealthy family whose origins goes far back in the history of france and their residence in paris is considered to be one the jewels of the capital at the same level as the hotel de sully in paris what is shown in the film is exactly what happens everywhere in the world as far as handicapped are concerned tendency to overwhelm them with pity which is more diminishing them as if their fate is not enough for them to swallow every minute or second each day the way the racial problem is viewed is properly demonstrated the police behaves in different ways depending of the color of your skin or your countrys origin and sorry to say north america is a very good example of this so perhaps is not a proper judge on this matterthe authors had the courage to state this straightforwardly the film shows on the contrary how a man with a very limited education at the beginning a former convict is capable progressively to change his views and find in himself at the same time the good samaritan aspects and help with humor and punch his handicapped boss to find a new belief in his shattered life at at the same time the boss demonstrates an openmindedness which was not obvious to get not only because of his handicap but because of his origins and his wealth at first lets not illusion ourselves on the matter everywhere in the world few wealthy people would accept to have as an aid an ex convict whichever color his skin should be its a fantastic lesson of tolerance and friendship for just those reason this movie would deserve an oscar or golden globe awards ive just seen that under crazy credits is mentioned that of the revenues of the film will go to an institutions caring for disabled persons i just dont see whats crazy about that i find this kind of remark particularly shocking and insulting both for the producers and the actors especially in this case where the story told is a true onei suggest the administrator to delete that remark or change its qualification,POSITIVE,Comedy
3999,7.0,19 October 2011,"November 2, 2011 (France)",i have seen this movie tonight at a preview session as the official french national release is set on november nd eric toledano and olivier nakashe accompanied by the lead actor omar sy were meeting the audience and cheerfully answering questions the movie is very well written although opening on a flashforward it is fairly classic comedy about the meeting of two opposite people who were very unlikely to meet the first one is a paraplegic white middle aged very rich and lonely man the other one is a young black poor unemployed coming from poor suburbs and a very large family what makes the quality of the film beside the humour present in every scene in which omar sy appears actually most of the film is the emotion you can feel through increasingly attaching characters the story is based upon a true story and real characters if you want to watch and enjoyable comedy with very touching moments this is a must go there are interesting insights about arts as well paintings classical music and funk music what is art what is its use,POSITIVE,Comedy

4005,8.0,6 February 2012,"November 2, 2011 (France)",this was for sure one of the top or top movies ive ever seen the actors the ambiente the story simply everything was in a perfect combination this film is for me in a league with films like the elephant man but for a much wider audience and as the title say after this film i really have to consider to reduce my ratings for several films because it seems a bit unfair to put them on the same level as this film although i dont have anything to criticize on them at all all the persons in the film are very authentic played and both main characters surprised me with a brilliant performance i would say that both actors are really what they are playing in the film if i would see françois cluzet in the street i would be surprised not seeing him in a wheelchair the emotions shown in the last sequence of the film are so brilliant,POSITIVE,Comedy
4006,6.0,17 January 2013,"November 2, 2011 (France)",the intouchables three and a half stars out of five a french comedydrama film that has become the third biggest foreign film and biggest foreign language film of all time its also received rave reviews and a great deal of award recognition but no academy award nomination due to the fact that the foreign language division was afraid it would win the film is beloved the world over but perhaps just a little overhyped its a good movie but it is clichéd and somewhat simple and unoriginal its been criticized for being another tale that revolves around rich white people being enlightened and finding happiness through poor black people it does seem like the type of movie eddie murphy might have starred in in the s perhaps with dustin hoffman because the lead white actor in the film bares a striking resemblance to dustin hoffman the film stars francois cluzet as an aristocrat named philippe who was paralyzed in a paragliding accident hes somewhat depressed and has lost most communication with his adopted daughter elisa alba gaia kraghede bellugi he also has phantom pains which keep him up at night and still mourns the death of his wife greatly who died before they could have any kids of their own he maintains romantic relationships with women only through written letters and fears actually meeting or speaking with them one day hes looking for a new caretaker and a man named driss omar sy enters his home just looking for a signature so he can continue to collect welfare checks driss lives with his large family in a small flat in a parisian suburb so when philippe actually does offer him a job as well as a room in his mansion that has its own large bathtub in it its quite a culture shock for him of course philippe is inspired by driss and both mens lives are forever changed the film was written and directed by olivier nakache and eric toledano it is nicely directed and looks beautiful it also has a nice combination of both comedy and drama and both elements are done well its just that the film isnt that funny or that emotionally moving the performances are fine it has some good laughs and its a good well intentioned story but its nothing we havent seen before and far from anything spectacular its enormous success does puzzle me a little but id much rather see a movie like this do really well than something like twilight so its definitely a decent crowdpleasing film just not a great one watch our movie review show movie talk at,POSITIVE,Comedy
4007,2.0,18 March 2012,"November 2, 2011 (France)",its quite rare to find and have the pleasure to enjoy a genuine movie blending comedy and drama with such naturalness thats why intouchables is undoubtedly a rare authentic picture and the fact that the story is inspired by a true one helped make the movie more involving funny and touching at the same time the picture evolves with simplicity but strong pathos with the merit of avoiding every pathetic or melodramatic attitude theres brutal honesty in representing the real condition of philippe as well as drisss initial uncompassionate attitude there are touching moments there are true amusing moments both accompanied by a forceful soundtrack acting proves brilliant to say the least and the pairing between francois cluzet and omar sy sparkles and captures the viewers attention i was swept away by drysss genuine smile as well as by philippes melancholic eyes and the moments when they are together filled me with an authentic feelinggood sentiment definitely a mustsee picture,POSITIVE,Comedy
4008,9.0,4 November 2018,"November 2, 2011 (France)",i feel like i need to say something not only is this in the imdb top its very close to the top sitting at this means its higher than das boot the shining the pianist and more than of the other incredible films on this list i dont think every movie in the top is a masterpiece but most of the ones ive seen attain a certain level of quality that sets them apart from your average movie i rented this movie hoping it would at least be good but i didnt even get that theres not much to say other than every aspect was competently done but nothing exceptional that goes for the story performances production value and direction my only real complaint would be that our two leads are a bit one dimensional why are rich people always stereotyped as loving classical music and listening to nothing else driss is a bit too erratic and clueless to be believable but thats just me clearly im missing something because everyone seems to love this movie if you want to check it out i wont stop you its put together well enough to be enjoyed but for me personally it left little impact and i can think of literally hundreds of films more deserving of such a high spot on this list i give it a and a generous at that,POSITIVE,Comedy
4009,1.0,3 April 2012,"November 2, 2011 (France)",a comedy like that is tough to master balancing the funny and the dramatic stuff and still keep enough character development inside and while i wouldnt say that both characters really redeem themselves wholly it gives them nice touches touches that include quite a lot of nonpc behavior be alert and do not watch if you are sensible to that sort of thing it is a french comedy with heart and it was a sleeper hit in germany word of mouth made this a big success a bit of credit has to go to the people who dubbed it i guess i watched the original version with subtitles because they must have done a phenomenal job it is not perfect but that fact makes it even weirder and more adorable,POSITIVE,Comedy
4010,1.0,2 May 2012,"November 2, 2011 (France)",this movie does not really need another review but after seeing what daily beasts marlow stern and varietys jay weissberg critics have written about it i feel that one thing needs a serious clarification it is somewhat disturbing and at the same time really telling a lot about usas culture that american reviewers see this movie as racerelations feature ive read all of the reviews written here on imdb until now and i would suggest to both stern and weissberg to do the same maybe they could learn something most of the reviews here were written by nonamericans and tellingly most of them do not even mention race or race relations or anything similar to me that shows how deep anything to do with a difference in color of skin has been intertwined with usa culture when even in this film where nobody from lets say the rest of the world does not see any racism or anything similar the only thing usa critics do see is the difference in color of skin sad very sad im therefore afraid that if it shares sterns and weissbergs opinions most of the usa audience will not see the real beauty of this film and will probably also under the influence of critics reviews see the movie as a racerelations feature when thats the only thing its not and what it is it is i cant believe im gonna write this a carefree comedy about a quadriplegic and his personal aide the movie does not at any moment come even close to apathy or pathetics which is a success on its own the movie also has just about the perfect amount of black humor and political incorrectness and does not cross those borders at any time i think this is the only movie about a disabled human where after seeing it you will go out of the theater laughing and i cant remember any movie which approaches such a difficult theme with such ease additionaly the soundtrack both einaudis score as well as selected tracks is fantastic a lot has been written here about cast and i would just like to add that along masterful performances of both sy and cluzet the rest of the actors are equally great especially anne le ny and audrey flerot,POSITIVE,Comedy
4011,1.0,24 July 2012,"November 2, 2011 (France)",my my where do i begin to start with i did not want the movie to end at all its becoming more and more rare for movies as this one to come by this movie completes the circle as far as movie going experience goes the movie has left me with a sort of warm feeling in my heart that cannot be said in words alone there is something about the way french movies are made when they get it right they are simply par excellence hollywood kisses concrete anyway i feel most of us humans are quadriplegic though not physically but emotionally in someway or other but what one may agree is that when you cry you cry alone but when you laugh the whole world laughs with you if just by the word quadriplegic you are expecting it to be a dark heart shattering emotionally overloaded movie then i would passionately defend against such a prejudiced opinion one is not the physical form alone one can have a beautiful body but a black heart and viceverse a very well written full bodied script and an exceptionally well directed movie characters cannot become more real than this on the silver screen omar sy in my opinion has done a very good job he lived his character and not played it to contrast him we have françois cluzet who kept the sparks flying omar sys comments on bach vivaldi etc classics had me in splits and also do not miss out on the singing human tree the very mentioning of which is having me in splits wow that was some movie go get this movie guys and see it today no now,POSITIVE,Comedy
4012,8.0,23 March 2012,"November 2, 2011 (France)",i love french movies so different from typical hollywood stuff full of special effects but often with lack of depth in stories this movies is so simple humane deep its about what should happen more often great friendship between two so different persons who are able to go beyond prejudices and stereotypes its not a sad movie at all like it could sound to some people and its absolutely not racist like i have read somewhere else in the comments i suggest to all people to go and watch this you will go out of the cinema with something great you have learned and seen its definitely the best movies i have seen this year so far,POSITIVE,Comedy
4013,9.0,17 March 2013,"November 2, 2011 (France)",according to imdb the intouchables set all sorts of box office recordsthe second most successful french film in history in france as well as the number one film for in germany so because of this very impressive pedigree i was perhaps expecting a little more now this is not to say its a bad filmits wonderful it just didnt seem quite that wonderful but it is well worth seeing as for the plot this movie is a truelife account of a quadriplegic man françois cluzet in search of a new aide however all the folks who apply for the job seem the sameboring and sterile on an odd lark he chooses an unqualified man who doesnt seem interested in the job at all omar sy and oddly they form a friendship that seems to reinforce the old adage that opposites attract while the plot is amazingly thin and seems to be missing chunks of the story the film is masterful in several ways the acting particularly by sy is just terrific but even more terrific is the artistry of the film itself it takes a somewhat ordinary story and injects it with classincluding some wonderful cinematography and one of the nicest soundtracks i have ever heard it is a lovely film,POSITIVE,Comedy
4014,6.0,20 July 2012,"November 2, 2011 (France)",this is the story of friendship between a quadriplegic phillipe and his black attendant driss at the surface one has the impression that the film will be a tearjerker with oodles of sentimental scenes coming one after another being from india and having witnessed such films of dying person or disability which are meant to titillate the sentiment of the weak to my mind i perceived one that of a contrived loud excessively melodramatic gujarish which was also about a quadriplegic person but as i started watching it how i wished to see such a film being made in india the movie is a lesson to live life with full vigour amidst adversities the film starts with two persons in car with one in the wheel driving it crazily through the busy roads of france when they are stopped by the police driss challenges philippe that the policemen wouldnt arrest him but on the contrary would escort them thus they put a bet of eurosdriss faked a drama about how he was taking quadriplegic philippe to hospital for emergency and thus he had no option but to opt for rash driving they succeeded in creating guilt amongst the policemen thus assuring them to escort phillipes car as they start the car again there is an immediate smile in my face that this will be film full of life from there the movie goes back to where the hiring process is on for a caretaker driss an outlaw leaving in the black community of suburbs took the job unlike the other caretakers philippe become connected to driss easily because of the drisss lack of sympathy towards him in fact the film works at this level which makes us feel that people with certain problem needs affection rather than sympathy driss is an outlaw rude and brutally honest and somehow there seem to be a connection with phillipe who is a rich loner losing his lower half to an accident the zeal for life is still there but the support is missing from having food to shower to everything he needs someone elses hands not out of sympathy but out of compassion and he found it in driss driss on the other hand learns the art of living from phils quadriplegic existence he learns to respect life family and more than that himself he gains confidence in life and tries to induce that to phillipe by trying to remarry him to his lady love the climax is one of the best i have seen in recent times it is honest sweet touching yet there is no forced melodrama the simplicity brings down tears of happiness as we learn the real characters that inspired the reel version are living a happy contended life overcoming their individual short comings at physical as well as psychological level there have been several films on friendship between a black and white but there is nothing contrived in the plot director duo olivier nakache eric toledanos intention is as pure as the friendship portrayedtheir success lies in their usage of subtle humour to tell this touching storythe wide angle of camera reflects a contentment which the protagonist is having with his surroundings the gradual bonding has been kept subtle with small sequences like driss taking phillipe to open air around am and then offering cigarette these are the small things which help in taking the bigger step the usage of light has been apt as the shade gradually shifts towards brighter shade dorians editing gels with the character transformations the long cuts in the initial reels changed to short cuts reflecting the happiness and youthful exuberance within ludovicos soft background score suits the mood of the film the occasional use of orchestra uplifts the mood after prolonged calmness which fits phillipes characterization françois cluzet and omar sy as phillipe and driss respectively are flawless veteran actor cluzet fits in perfectly as phillipe and brings out the hopelessness yet the desire to live with perfect conviction the clumsiness of a quadriplegic comes from his mannerism and then there is the young talent sy whose comic timings are more than perfect his range of expression helps in showing the change in the curve of his character as he softens down on his basic mannerisms his initial mockery to the aristocratic existence to his understanding of their behaviour and thus a change in his own expressions are put across with perfection intouchables celebrates life and the reason it works is one can identify with the basic emotion someway we all are saddled in our existence fighting all odds and struggling to overcome adversities of life this film brings in hope it throws light to the darkness in our existence it teaches us to love through tales of true friendship a virtue that is losing its value in this materialistic existence it tells us to believe in our strength and never lose hope which we tend to even in minor setbacks without trying to sympathise on bygones the film subtly teaches to look forward and use every precious moment of our life to be happy the movie is a must watch for everyone who can breathe ps this year a great tragedy happened in my life for which i was mentally down but this movie really helped me to have faith in life and all to a certain extend i really want to thanks the director duo for making this film,POSITIVE,Comedy
4015,4.0,29 April 2013,"November 2, 2011 (France)",the actors give good performances here but the script and the movie ultimately is ridden with clichés and not terribly sympathetic anyone paralyzed in this manner deserves sympathy but if you have a vast fortune an army of caretakers and every imaginable comfort and resource you may need less sympathy than some others why did the filmmakers transform a north african muslim caretaker into a senegalese why is this black africans conformity to every cliché potsmoking violent rap music he even dances well supposed to be refreshing either to philippe or the viewer so much was simply artificial dressing philippe like a doll playing with his beard and hair the caricature of the other applicants the behavior of the adopted daughter or further clichés eg the police mildly amusing at times way too long just watchable,NEGATIVE,Comedy
4016,1.0,31 May 2012,"November 2, 2011 (France)",this movie so easily could had become a forced and melodramatic one but luckily its one that got made with lots of tact and skill making this one fine drama with a comical touch to it as well guess that i really like contrasts in movies the two main characters are complete opposites of each other in about every way imaginable driss is poor philippe is rich driss is vibrant philippe is a quadriplegic driss is black philippe is white etcetera they are a complete mismatch on paper but yet they become best friends which forms the central point of this movie and works out so well because it gets made believable they dont just become good friends they also learn from each other and i believe that they also become better persons because of that this is were the movie its warmth and soul comes from in my opinion it doesnt ever dwell on it that philippe is bound to a wheelchair and can only move his head or that driss is poor and also has a poor relationship with this family if anything this movie is a celebration of life rather than than a movie that will bring you down the effect of these sort of movies often is that it actually strengthens its drama because you feel far more involved with it also since the movie doesnt shoves its drama down your throat constantly there are some small sideplots in the movie but the good news about them is that they dont distract from the main theme and storyline of the movie and the movie never puts its emphasis too much on any of the sideplots or its secondary characters it keeps a great and effective focus on its main subject throughout pretty much the entire film its a great movie in every way it has a good look to it that isnt cheap or rushed its a respectful and professionally made movie which all paid off for it also the acting is just great everybody seems perfectly cast in their roles and know how to handle their characters and manage to fit within the style and tone of the overall movie of course françois cluzet and omar sy carry most of the movie and they did a more than great job with this its just a movie i cant say anything bad or negative about its well made and effective which makes this one of the better genre movies out there,POSITIVE,Comedy
4017,1.0,30 December 2014,"November 2, 2011 (France)",a frenchlanguage based on a true story drama the intouchables is touching but not as good as it likes to think it is in the mind of its creators it seems to be a comic drama of immense human significance in reality it is powerful and affecting and funny at different times its also clichéd patronising and predictable its the story of a rich privileged quadriplegic man who needs to hire a new carer he picks a young man with no qualifications and no experience from the paris housing projects what follows is a predictable but still effective clash of cultures and expectations with mutual learning taking place on both sides of the divide the films seems at pains to not offend with its sensitive subject matter the overall effect seeming to be at times patronising to the poor and the disabled alike all poor people like hiphop it seems all the rich classical music the quadriplegic man struggles to feel you see yes really all a bit trite at times at others is affecting though it chimed with me at points it encourages an engaging counter cultural lack of safety and wisdom the better to actually build meaningful lives and relationships to break artificial barriers and selflimitations its encourages a kind of holy recklessness on its viewers that you suspect will get lost amidst the worthiness for many if only the film itself had shown a little more danger and a little less safety we could have had something more special and less crowdpleasing,POSITIVE,Comedy
4018,1.0,29 September 2012,"November 2, 2011 (France)",its a harmless clichéd ridden comedy its identical to hollywood films in pacing plot and structure its well executed and may be entertaining for someone who doesnt have a sophisticated taste for movies the fact that one of the main characters is quadriplegic doesnt affect the basic plot by any measurable degree its a traditional story of a rich guy meets a poor guy and the two become friends the rich guy likes classical music the poor guy likes pop music the rich guy likes art the poor guy prostitutes etc the cliché goes on and on only someone who has watched few movies will be impressed by this story its extremely conventional the jokes can be funny sometimes specially the ones where the characters exploit the fact that he is quadriplegic since one cannot find these jokes in other comedies but overall the film is okay but not good and is not worthy of being viewed in a theater,NEGATIVE,Comedy
4019,1.0,21 October 2021,"November 2, 2011 (France)",i totally didnt expect that i really cant believe what i saw least thing i can say its a masterpiece omar sy is just incredible he took this film to a legendary level with his legendary performance he is absolutely a great actor great comedy great story great sequence great music great acting great fellings great film this film overwhelmed me if its the goat movie or the second,POSITIVE,Comedy

4022,6.0,12 May 2012,"November 2, 2011 (France)",im and have lived in france nearly all my life my cousin recommended this film to me and when i saw that omar sy was one of the main actors i just laughed for those of you who dont know omar sy is one half of a famous canal sketch comedy show called omar fred to sum it up it is very light hearted even silly comedy however to see him perform at this level and with such ease simply amazed me the relationship chemistry created between the two characters in the film would make you believe that omar françois cluzet were best friends in real life françois cluzet is also excellent in this film to a certain extent his performance reminds me a bit of dustin hoffmans in rain man this role shows how versatile he is as an actor the last film i saw him in was ne le dis à personne tell no one and his role in that is literally the complete opposite yet he pulls off both wonderfully i have seen my fair share of touching movies but this completely blew me away if you have hour minutes of your time to spare please use it to watch this film you will not regret it,POSITIVE,Comedy

4024,2.0,5 August 2012,"November 2, 2011 (France)",the intouchables out of terrific comedydrama from france about philippe francois cluzet a rich man who was left paralyzed from the neck down after an accident and driss omar sy a man from the ghetto who hasnt had much going on in his life until he gets the job of taking care of the handicapped man the intouchables has been breaking box office records around the world but i decided to stay away from it because of some rather lukewarm reviews im certainly glad the trailer kept telling me to go see it because no matter what the critics say this here is a complete winner and its easy to see why so many people have fallen in love with it im really not sure why so many critics have bashed it for being a crowd winner or too happy because neither makes much sense i thought the film was quite remarkable because the precredit sequence is just so touching and funny that you cant help but fall in love with these two characters and the journey of their friendship that follows was incredibly touching and best of all is that it felt real a lot of credit has to go to the two leads who deliver remarkable performances and id be willing to bet that youre not going to see better from anyone the rest of the year if so more credit to whoever is better cluzet and sy are simply so terrific in their roles that you really do feel as if youre watching real people with real issues the way to two play off one another is so remarkable to watch that once youve seen it i dont see how you could forget them directors olivier nakache and eric toledano do a remarkable job balancing the comedy with the drama and in the end they really create such a special atmosphere that its impossible not to get caught up with it the intouchables is without question one of the best films of the year and hopefully the strong word of mouth from around the world will get more people to check it out,POSITIVE,Comedy
4025,1.0,7 May 2018,"November 2, 2011 (France)",ofcourse the entire premise of the intouchables is a bit of a cliché these days with the strong black man helping the weak white man yet it is not a film of irrelevant political propaganda and steers clears of this subject quite well the better parts of the film is primarily that it has some great shots an incredible piece of piano notes music by ludovico einaudi some great acting by especially francois cluzet phillipe as the invalid aristocrat unfortunately however the bonding of the two cultures of the main characters make little sense driss omar sy does not seem like a particularly nice guy and even his family isnt all too keen on him for reasons that he has caused on his own somehow for reasons unknown this eventually changes causing driss to seemingly even care and freak out about things in philippes life that seem to be a bit out of character for him yet even though their relationship seems far fetched it does still have a certain charm to it which makes it convincing enough as a piece of entertainment the acting is mostly good especially by francois as stated before who does a great job of facial acting too omar sy is a bit inconsistent as driss due to some weird outbursts a couple of cringy scenes the dancing or the consistent flirting with the secretary becomes quite a cringe to watch featuring him which kind of makes me think he is the french chris tucker the film isnt as emotionally powerful as it would like to be the music by ludovico einaudi is a splendid emotional piece so that is not the problem the problem seems the movie feels a bit too much like a feelgood movie due to the buddy relationship that the mixes between emotion and light hearted feelgood scenes are hard to make however a couple of scenes especially near the end do manage to succeed in this aspect helped by einaudis score and some excellent facial acting by francois cluzet the movie is mostly quite grey and not very pretty and a lot of shots follow driss closely from over the shoulder resulting in quite an ugly bouncing camera kind of shots however there are a couple of shots where the cinematography really shines most of these shots come from the position of the camera behind the two men with driss left and phillipe right which is a pose used many times during the film especially the one right before the parachuting scene is a beautiful one yet this is followed with quite a weird shot in the parachuting scene itself from some kind of onboard camera like it is a documentary which is unfortunate since there truly are many great shots in the film but also a lot of uglier ones it is a film with some great acting and some lesser acting some great emotional scenes and some cringy scenes and some beautiful shots and some ugly ones while overcoming its cliché concept of a story on a splendid manner it is not quite as great as it wanted to be,POSITIVE,Comedy
4026,9.0,2 February 2012,"November 2, 2011 (France)",a typical wonderful french film full of surprises that grip the mind and the heart being an englishman living in france and having a good grip on the french language this film enveloped me like a cozy blanket on the sofa on a sunday the acting is marvelous the scripting is genius and the paris decor helps to give it a certain romance between the principal actors a must see even if you cant understand french get yourself an autotranslator or take some french student with you that can translate endirect go watch it,POSITIVE,Comedy
4027,1.0,19 April 2016,"November 2, 2011 (France)",one of the most wonderful things about the art of filmmaking is that it is incredibly good at getting an emotional response from the people that consume it now that was a really pretentious way of saying that films are great because they can make use feel happy sad scared etc i know for me personally that a lot of my favorite films are the ones that are able to make me cry and i think that we can all agree that it is truly a wonderful thing when a film is made with such devotion and passion that it is able to make its audience shed tears over fictional characters and events unfortunately filmmakers know that audiences love when a film makes them cry and some filmmakers will try and take advantage of that fact they will make films that are filled with overdone clichés and over dramatized actingdialogue in hopes of making the audience cry because if you can get someone to cry at your film its very unlikely that they will forget it and they will probably like it this is exactly the sort of film the intouchables is a cheap insincere artificial cluster of scenes that will do whatever is necessary to make the audience get emotional these cheap films that target and exploit sensitive topics just so they can receive acclaim and attention are in my opinion some of the worst films out there they represent all of the worst aspects in filmmaking and deserve to be called out for what they are and they are detestable piles of complete s im entering my third paragraph and i havent even mentioned the acting plot cinematography or really any of the actual specifics of the film yet and thats because regardless of whether youve seen it or not you can already predict everything that happens in the entire film the plot is so structured and formulaic that it feels like it was copied and pasted from a textbook the cinematography is at best dull and at other times so bad i actually can not believe it was in a film with a million euro budget which comes out to roughly million dollars all of the actors give exactly what youd expect from a movie like the intouchables and honestly i cant even remember a thing about any of there performances which is a compliment for a movie like the intouchables the intouchables received mixed reviews from critics and was nominated for best foreign language films by the golden globes even though critics were split on the films quality general audiences loved it at the time of writing this review it is the th highest rated movie on imdb coming ahead of films like apocalypse now a space odyssey the seventh seal ikiru vertigo and even citizen kane and i wont lie this upsets me at least more than it should the idea of a film as terrible as the intouchables coming ahead films like the ones previously mentioned not to mention the dozens of other better ones in the top and hundreds out of it just really destroys my faith in the film industry i can not recommend that anyone watch this film ever but even though ive been basically calling this film an indefensible offense on cinema there are things out there that are much worse than it so i wont give it the lowest rating possible,NEGATIVE,Comedy
4028,1.0,14 September 2012,"November 2, 2011 (France)",i was almost unknown to french cinema until two years back watched tell no one one of the best thriller i ever seen and i become fan of francois cluzet the intouchables is an excellent movie to watch the acting from all leading roles are really good they lived their characters movie has emotions jokes funny situations gives positive thoughts to look at life one word go and watch the movie for movie to francois cluzet,POSITIVE,Comedy
4029,1.0,5 June 2012,"November 2, 2011 (France)",sometimes you have to reach into someone elses world to find out whats missing in your own intouchables is a remarkable feel good french film mostly about friendship but there is a little bit of drama and a love story included as well this film with relatively unknown directors and actors has managed to make some big noise in europe and especially in france where it has become the second highest grossing french film of all time the key to the success of intouchables relies on the great chemistry and performances from francois cluzet and omar sy they are just absolutely great in this film and their friendship felt authentic and real the movie mixes the drama with the comedy really well and it works better than most films have in the past when combining two different and sometimes opposite characters together sy and cluzet play totally different characters who come from very different backgrounds and although weve seen this play out in hundreds of films in the past it works really well here thanks to their terrific performance and a great script from the directors olivier nakache and eric toledano cluzet has a sort of a dustin huffman vibe and he says so much with his expressions without having to say anything at times while sy plays a more outgoing character who isnt afraid to speak his mind this odd pairing reminded me a lot of another film which i really loved goodbye solo which follows a similar premise at times intouchables is a feel good movie but it transcends the term at times and becomes much more an absolute must see especially if youve ever had to work or live with a handicapped person philippe francois cluzet is a very rich quadriplegic who lives in his mansion with several servants and his teenage daughter he is hiring a livein carer once again since most only last a couple of days with him driss omar sy happens to be applying for the job but actually just wants to get rejected so he can live on welfare without having to work hes been in prison for the last months and away from home but philippe decides to actually hire driss for the job considering he is someone different who doesnt look at him with empathy and actually treats him like a normal person driss and philippe come from very different backgrounds but they seem to complement each other very well philippe is a millionaire whos interested in art and classical music while driss comes from a poor african background whos interested in pop culture mostly and in bands such as earth wind and fire driss is really outgoing and becomes really close friends with philippe together they share various stories about their past and end up helping each other solving some present conflicts there are some other secondary characters whose names i dont even remember because they are not very important to the story but mostly revolving around other house servants intouchables is actually loosely based on a true story involving a quadriplegic and his arab carer who ends up befriending him the directors actually came across a documentary about these two men and decided to film a movie about it one of the greatest things about the film beside the inspiring story was the casting omar sy and francois cluzet were really the perfect match and they had me laughing real hard at times and at the border of tears during others it is truly an emotional and powerful film a story that will stick with you long after the film ends and by the time the credits role you will have a smile on your face it is a feel good movie but never feels cursi or anything like that i was really surprised with omar sy and hope he gets many more roles this is really a great french film very different from le prophet but just as good i had a really good time watching this movie and recommend it to everyone,POSITIVE,Comedy
4030,6.0,9 June 2012,"November 2, 2011 (France)",i saw this title and i was really skeptical to the storyline another comedy drama that will neither make you live the story alongside the characters feel their emotions nor will it make you laugh that is what i thought but men was i wrong i love the way françois cluzet and omar sy play in this movie so natural so good i lived every second of the movie like it was my life i came to like driss and philippe as real characters and now at the end of the movie i wonder where did they go that is the kind of emotion this movie generates it has everything you could expect from a great movie story characters laughs and cries tension and so on you wont regret seeing this movie alone or with someone i appreciate great work when i see it and this film made me take into consideration seeing more french movies as it improved my opinion on them enjoy this movie and every frame of it d,POSITIVE,Comedy
4031,6.0,19 October 2012,"November 2, 2011 (France)",this is my first time stepping to the other side from been a viewer to been a reviewer this film made me do it it shook me and made me realize that when you have nothing to lose then you have all to earn it start with two mans that are in the lowest points of there lives they are so different yet so connected it will show you that you dont need to judge by look or by color and anyone can have a chance to influence the life of the other i will not say any more but this go and see this movie this is a once in a lifetime,POSITIVE,Comedy

4033,1.0,4 September 2012,"November 2, 2011 (France)",without giving away too much this was simply one of the best movies i have seen in a very very long time it has humor life lessons friendship love etc there are so many emotions but mainly laughter and humor that really touches you the acting is superb and all people of all ages genders backgrounds can really enjoy this movie you would be foolish not to see this film i have read that they want to remake this movie in america however i dont see why they should do such a thing it is perfect exactly the way it is nothing about the movie needs to be changed one bit absolutely oscarworthy saddens me that it was made in and this is the first i had heard of it it leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling inside dont miss it you will be sorry,POSITIVE,Comedy
4034,1.0,27 April 2019,"November 2, 2011 (France)",western filmmakers tend to make stories where someone poor who has zest for life meets someone really rich but tired of life and turns their life around in such movies one often sees the impact that the poor person has on rich persons life but seldom do the filmmakers try to tell the story from the poor persons point of view the focus is the rich man and his boring life and how it can be turned around by a poor person who sees it in a different light towards the end of the movie the poor person gets little or nothing out of the exchange but the rich guy walks away with deep insights and a newfound will to live its really unfair how such films portray poor people recurring trope of them being awestruck by bathrooms and paint them as incapable of doing anything unless aided by the money from the rich person i think thats because the target audience is rich people who will pay to watch a movie which gives them some hope,NEGATIVE,Comedy
4035,1.0,12 August 2012,"November 2, 2011 (France)",this french film starts with a dustin hoffman lookalike actor being driven by a black driver omar sy who is fond of earth wind and fire music and has a swagger made popular by many a black hollywood actors including eddie murphy in the typical hollywood fashion he comes from the wrong side of tracks think of murphy in trading places but ends up living in a paris mansion again echoes of trading places taking care of a quadriplegic françois cluzet somehow he learns to take care of his patient and in fact becomes quite an accomplished male nurse the transition is mildly amusing and wont bother you if you checked your skepticism at the door before entering the movie theater if you have any doubts about whether or not this film is in the genre called hollywood fantasy you have to see what our tough man with heart of gold does next he decides to teach his boss how to be a good father and ultimately becomes cupid for his boss the film plays on the obvious disparities between expectations and attitudes of the privileged and under classes in ways that are funny if you wish to enjoy this film please keep your expectations low and ignore the obvious visual and other tricks one of the early scenes shows a row of shoes and socks of the candidates waiting to be interviewed for the nurses job as the camera pans all candidates are wearing shiny shoes with clean socks but one pair stand out for being dirty and incongruous of course they belong to omar sys character and he gets the job at this superrich household how fuuunny i predict that in two to three years there will be a hollywood clone of this film with dustin hoffman and chris rock playing the main characters and it will be a box office hit,POSITIVE,Comedy

4040,7.0,28 April 2012,"November 2, 2011 (France)",its been a while since i wrote a comment for a movie i rarely find the luxury of time praising a well crafted movie that doesnt give a damn of any social issues and its totally rare for me to have the lucky chance finding a foreign movie that doesnt need to tell its masterpiece beauty first of all all the time i was watching the movie i thought i was staring at dustin hoffman playing well a disabled nobleman being taken care of by a straightthinking commoner i know the overreacted dire issues this movie is being pestered but i dont really care what other people say how the movie should have been its an obvious sign already that this movie topped and may still elevate in imdb top movies that a lot of sensible reviewers appreciated its simplicity the reason indeed probably why the crew casted a black man instead of arabian to portray the character because maybe simply omar sy just had the skill to fit in to the characters delicate vessel why so locked with the racism issue other may had been suggestive but its not an extreme case to horribly condemn the movie of its simple choice i just dont understand people who cant keep their bloody mind open well either way the movie had its story straightforwardly rendered and its worth approving rather than condemning i even laughed so hard when driss omar just naturally cackled all over the man dressed like a tree singing at the top of his voice man that was really a humorous punch the drama well done ten stars would be more than it deserved,POSITIVE,Comedy
4041,9.0,4 December 2013,"November 2, 2011 (France)",im not sure how i came to be watching this film i had heard of it some time ago and added it to the queue without knowing too much about it other than it was successful in its home market supposedly based on a true story the plot sees a rich quadriplegic employ a rather colorful young man to be his new livein caretaker we open the film with a flashforward but quickly go back to the start of the relationship and quickly are let in on the ground floor regarding how this film will be basically philippe is uptight and locked within himself mentally almost as much as physically while driss is carefree and very different from those in philippes world will the oddcouple become friends and perhaps benefit one anothers lives somehow well only time and the genre will tell of course this is pretty much what happens but you know this from the oddcouple comedydrama feel that it has from the getgo and it is fairly shameless about doing it there isnt really a depth to the film but rather a superficial but entertaining pace and plot it feels cynical for the most part but yet somehow it works if you can get through some cringeinducing heartwarming moments a big part of it working is plain and simply the two actors in the lead roles neither gives a brilliant performance individually but together they have real chemistry and their banter and shared moments do have a certain genuine and intimate feel that is all down to the delivery by themselves cluzet is solid and sy clowns it up for all he is worth but yet both are quite charming and likable all the way to the end ultimately it is fairly shameless crowdpleasing fare which airbrushes life into a series of fun setpieces it really never touches a real nerve but it is still enjoyable thanks to the warm tone and strong chemistry between the two leads,POSITIVE,Comedy
4042,9.0,7 November 2022,"November 2, 2011 (France)",i have a feeling that im writing another short review here but we shall see the intouchables is a french comedydrama film based on a true story the movie follows the relationship between driss a young man with unstable life and low economic status and philippe a rich disabled man whos sick of getting looks of pity as time goes on we see how their bond tightens and how they manage to help each other grow and evolve ill say this the film is super straightforward accessible and simple the pacing is quite fast and solid the soundtrack is fun the cinematography is actually better than i expected beautiful shots here and there some of the jokes fall flat but some made me laugh out loud i had a decent amount of emotional investment in the characters though nothing truly moving just enough to keep me interested to get me to care yeah i enjoyed the movie quite a bit but its genuinely soi dont know basic that i dont have much to say here nothing in this film is truly special the way i see it at least but the intouchables still has solid amounts of charm and memorable moments just enough to make it a good movie actually its not an extremely rewatchable film but it was definitely a fun good watching experience overall with a couple of heartwarming scenes im feeling a on this one,POSITIVE,Comedy
4043,1.0,6 September 2022,"November 2, 2011 (France)",still struggling to understand why this masterpiece didnt receive a single oscar nomination not even for best foreign film and omar sy should have been nominated for best male actor as he practically stole every scene he was involved in it felt natural as if there were no acting involved if it was made today it would sweep the ceremony no question at times it made me laugh uncontrollably and the humor comes naturally rather than through telling jokes as with most comedies although this is not strickly a comedy it falls more under comedydrama it tends to get serious at times the fact that this is based on a true story makes it even more incredible this is an absolute must see if you havent already do it now and by all means stay away from the soulless american made remake called the upside this is the only version you will ever need,POSITIVE,Comedy

4045,8.0,18 October 2012,"November 2, 2011 (France)",after watching this beautiful film i felt two things shame at my prior laziness for avoiding any nonenglish speaking films and excitement for the wealth of films i am about to discover there is a film world outside of the uk and usa anyway i havent much to say about the film youll get a good incite into it by watching the trailer from the subject matter i assumed at some point during the film i would need tissues to dry my tears which would have made reading subtitles difficult but thankfully i didnt at times its sad but is also uplifting throughout its just a lovely film and may throw caution to the wind by watching it again without the subtitles,POSITIVE,Comedy
4046,6.0,10 October 2012,"November 2, 2011 (France)",it was very exciting to hear that untouchable would finally be shown in the uk after appearing in so many other countries first having read plenty of hype about this film i was preparing myself to be disappointed but luckily the film felt engaging from the very beginning and went on to be a wonderfully touching and funny experience there is also a fair amount of excitement and romance thrown in for good measure despite appearances untouchable is not really about race disability or class its about friendship the two main characters both feel disconnected from society for various reasons yet the connection between these two outsiders is so genuine and believable that you are drawn into their relationship in fact the performances from omar sy and françois cluzet are simply incredible the massive amount of meaning conveyed in the slightest look between them is acting at its very best on many occasions you find yourself laughing with them and the fact that one is a rich white guy in a wheelchair and the other is a poor black guy fresh out of prison ceases to be an issue one of the most interesting themes for me was the effect that drisss lack of pity had on philippe i understand that the film has been applauded by many disabled groups and i can see why pity is a very selfish and unpleasant emotion and i can imagine that the effect of such pity would be quite destructive on a person in philippes situation driss simply reacts to him in natural and honest way which is extremely refreshing to see and a lesson for all those who would look down on anybody with pity the film is not without flaws however it is a little lightweight in places and there are a few clichés here and there even though the film manages to avoid most of the more obvious stereotyping the subtitles are also not brilliant in places and some of the meaning is slightly lost on occasion but i guess that happens all the time overall i would have said that this was a lovely feelgood movie but the superb quality of acting easily bumps it up to a unmissable,POSITIVE,Comedy

4048,6.0,6 May 2012,"November 2, 2011 (France)",this flick is as touching as it is intouchable i rated it a ten and keep in mind that it didnt catch my eyes nor ears in the beginning however the overall feeling im having after having watched this rather lengthy masterpiece is a calm and thoughtfulness that i havent felt since i watched the almost six hour long italian film la meglio gioventù one would think that the main two characters philippe and driss had been living together for years before the recording of this movie the chemistry between the two of them is something extraordinary something intouchable together they complement each other in a way that is unusual in todays films driss who embodies a pragmatic african french youth with lots of temperament and a great deal of emotional luggage philippe being in the state that he is cant use his body language the way that driss can he has to rely on his facial expressions something he is mastering very well i didnt want the film to end i wanted it to continue as a tv series one can come home to and watch after a stressful day at work i dont want to say anything more about this lovely minute long touching movie without spoiling the experience for the ones that still havent seen it but who could not love this one yours sincerely kristoffer,POSITIVE,Comedy
4049,3.0,5 June 2012,"November 2, 2011 (France)",the intouchables is one of the best movies i have seen in a very long time there are no action heroes or goodlooking women necessary to make this film perfect its all about the story and the development of its characters francois cluzet and omar sy did a great job there their performances were memorable and well fitted the story as in the real life story has been portrayed in my opinion brilliantly of course we can expect a lot of things to have been added to the entertaining production but nevertheless a lot morally correct life lessons are included as well this movie makes you search for humanity within yourself as it illustrates how a guy from the low social classes in paris can be a true friend and ally of this rich handicapped person subsequently the writers and producers have creatively played with this and have covered the seriousness of the movie to seconds while the major events have been coated in a fun and inspiring way the movie is enjoyable for all ages and backgrounds so i strongly recommend all of you to watch this movie try to enjoy the jokes but also take note of the messages conveyed by the movie totally worth every second,POSITIVE,Comedy

4059,9.0,2 April 2012,"November 2, 2011 (France)",when i first saw intouchables it hadnt become the french box office hit it is now in fact i hadnt heard of it or watched a trailer before seeing the film members of my family who were there with me were absolutely enchanted when we got out but i merely shrugged i remember thinking early on in the film it seems they sort of know what theyre doing what with the very expressive visual choices in terms of setting and photography but as the movie went on all traces of artistic flair were lost for good the characters are flat and are only here so that the audience can have a good laugh and be forced to accept the old fallacy that a movie with disabled people can only be good then again i found myself smiling at various points of the movie but i only think it is sad that the movie abandons its interesting story and social context by the end it does not consist of much more than a long thread of random jokes francois cluzet is too distancing in the role of a jaded paraplegic but omar sy makes the most of his very limited part it is only through this character that the film manages to take a stand against prejudices without feeling divorced from reality or from the cinematic necessities of storytelling and character development lets sum things up this way the movie had a great beginning in which it properly introduced the world of the story omar sys performance is really engaging and yes the film is very entertaining and beautiful but it is not realistic enough nor ready to put its many jokes in context,POSITIVE,Comedy
4060,1.0,4 January 2022,"November 2, 2011 (France)",the intouchables took a tried and true formula tweaked it a bit and made a sensational movie the idea of the odd couple has been around for ages we see it most in buddy cop movies but it also rears its head in other genres i for one have gotten tired of the idea of polar opposites becoming friends its not that i dont appreciate or like the idea its just that it has been done so often the very thought of having to watch two people get to know each other and appreciate their differences makes me roll my eyes the intouchables takes the idea guts it and gives us a gem francois cluzet and omar sy star as philippe and driss philippe is a wealthy paralyzed white frenchman who is in need of a caretaker driss is a poor somewhat hood african frenchman who is just looking for a job driss has no passion for healthcare nor is he at all sensitive towards philippes condition he just wants a paycheck what you dont expect is that philippe admires this about driss philippe doesnt want a caretaker who feels pity for him he wants one that treats him like any other ablebodied human being and i think thats where the movie distinguished itself instead of us suffering through a contentious relationship that slowly transformed into something special they were practically friends from the start even if they didnt recognize it philippe wanted driss as a caretaker and driss wasnt going to pass up a good paying job their relationship grows over time from one of employer and employee to friendship its a funny movie that seems to hit all the right buttons driss is not so hood and criminal as to repulse you while philippe is not so steeped in selfpity so as to depress you i think their personalities were perfect for each other and perfect for the big screen,POSITIVE,Comedy
4061,6.0,22 February 2022,"November 2, 2011 (France)",how this is in the th highest rated position on imdb is beyond my understanding too much cliche too much recycled plot the wheelchair users performance is the only thing that can be saved this same type of movie has been made countless times and any one is better than this version why this is so highly rated is beyond my understanding,POSITIVE,Comedy
4062,6.0,2 February 2021,"November 2, 2011 (France)",i cant really pinpoint exactly what gives this movie the feel that it has its goofy and feelgood yet touching all without being a definite genre ive never seen a french movie before i watched this and i only watched it because its so highly rated prior to viewing i was minimally interested in the plot a little doubtful and kinda iffy about having to read subtitles but now im so happy i saw this just listening to the beautiful piano pieces at the beginning and end of this film fill me with emotion that isnt sad nor happy just one that gives me that feeling of a long quiet night on the road silently enjoying the company of a great friend this film doesnt have huge questions to ponder and it doesnt have melodramatic characters and subplots at least not too obviously this is a caring charming movie that can calm a restless mind bring a spark of hope and fun to anyones life and make you think about it a lot im glad i didnt give up on this movie just because its in a foreign language,POSITIVE,Comedy
4063,3.0,16 January 2021,"November 2, 2011 (France)",take some comedy add a little understanding throw in some earth wind fire and you have a wonderful superb top five movie i promise i watched this film with my daughter and now every year we have our moment together losing ourselves in this so uplifting movie its a movie that is so warm to the heart and serious but also very funny squint your eye and for a moment you might think you are watching dustin hoffman but thats not being fair to the wonderful french actor francois cluzet who gives an outstanding performance omar sy is excellent playing the rough and ready driss whose character makes you laugh so much honestly im probably waffling on too much but this movie is in my top five enjoy,POSITIVE,Comedy

4066,1.0,18 April 2021,"November 2, 2011 (France)",this is a film that works very well at the core its true that many scenes were crass and felt played up for massmarket appeal i can see why some film critics gave it a lower rating that however seems to me to be missing the forest for the trees the acting is superb from both sy and cluzet they deliver force touch and humour and have strong chemistry although they act out stereotypes frequently they never become the stereotypes i think this handling is the correct way both to acknowledge and overcome stereotyping which is something that is all around us and cannot simply be wished away but must be overcome through force of character the leading duo and for that matter the supporting characters are both believable and likeable intouchables is full of lighthearted humour and adventure aside from keeping up the flow and entertainment level theres also a strong life message within life is something to be lived not passively observed themes of curiosity selfawareness courage and responsibility come across strongly in this sense the film is more than just a buddy drama about a quadriplegic and street guy if these guys can expand their horizons find joy and adventure laugh a little at themselves and take charge of their life and families then surely we all can finally there are strong metaphorical elements in the storyline old aristocratic france is stuck and relies on immigrant france to keep it moving literally and perhaps to bring some life and liveliness too the two dont often come into such intimate contact or invade each others space but if they did lots to think about,POSITIVE,Comedy
4067,9.0,13 February 2018,"November 2, 2011 (France)",the masterpiece of directors olivier nakache éric toledano a story of a ghetto black man omar sy who ends up getting a job as the lifein caregiver for a wealthy quadriplegic aristocrat françois cluzet and what do you know the black man ends up teaching the aristocrat some fantastic new things about life think driving miss daisy in modern day paris this film feels and looks nice the cinematography all the technical aspects really look sound and feel great its definitely a professionally made film i also have to praise the performance of the two main leads cluzets character is a very reserved very stoic gentleman which means that he doesnt have quite as much room to really let loose actingwise but even still he gives a praiseworthy performance but its sy whos the star of the movie with his boundless energy his everending optimism and his streetwise manners that give none and expect none all that being said the story is clichéd based on a true story sure but the fact still remains that daytime tv is filled with films just like this one this is no doubt better directed better filmed and better acted than any of those fluff films but you still end up feeling like youre being pandered towards still it just might be that im biased towards these kinds of stories it is a wellcrafted film after all if the premise interests you by all means give it a watch,POSITIVE,Comedy
4068,7.0,13 April 2022,"November 2, 2011 (France)",truly a great movie i dont watch a lot of french movies but this is just an ageless fantastic movie it touches lightly on some serious topics but also knows how to implement humour in it its a beautiful movie about an unlikely friendship which is even based on a true story too a mustsee,POSITIVE,Comedy
4069,6.0,13 February 2023,"November 2, 2011 (France)",other than screaming cant we all get along i really can see absolutely no purpose in this film what everyone else seems ti interpret as high comedy i am seeing only moderate amusement as we must know by now the main character is extraordinarily wealthy but as we all know nobody has everything except for those who do the protagonist is wheelchair bound a quadriplegic or worse as a result of a hanggliding accident which might have been predicted because he risked gliding in bad weather his wife is almost certainly dead of an unnamed illness i did not quite understand that part but that is doubly calamitous since she was the most wonderful woman ever to have lived he has a spoiled adopted teenage daughter who is involved in a bad relationship as we meet him he is interviewing for a caretakercompanion and the successful candidate is a senegalese man who has jumped the line in order get his unemployment form signed so he can leave the star tells him to return the next morning to get the signed form back so he leaves stealing a faberge egg on the way out surprise surprise when he comes back the next day he has gotten the job the perks include room and board at a paris home that jackie o would have been quite comfortable in the rest of the movie is so cliche ridden and cloying it is actually insulting to the viewer do not waste your time and the editing sucks as well,NEGATIVE,Comedy

4072,9.0,20 September 2024,"November 2, 2011 (France)",the fact that this has a on metacritic is insane to me who knew that having very weighted reviews was a bad idea i went into the intouchables with low expectations because i thought it wasnt my type of film but its obectively great for pretty much every demographic also the real life philippe died last year in jun abdel driss in the film is currently alive and is year old in a nutshell a very rich man gets paralyzed from the neck down and needs to hire a caretaker he chooses abdel because he doesnt give him special treatment and is more of a friend to him than a caretaker over the course of the film they become friends,POSITIVE,Comedy
4073,1.0,29 May 2022,"November 2, 2011 (France)",olivier nakache and éric toledano the duo who wrote and directed intouchables made a clever creative decision by setting the movies goals up right away in the first scene through a break of expectation the viewer is initially induced to assume that the pair of main characters driss omar sy and philippe françois cluzet is dealing with some kind of emergency but the soundtrack actors facial expressions and the general tone of the scene suddenly change when it is revealed that the characters were faking the emergency and merely having fun this is deeply related to what the film is about the lighthearted comic and happy moments of a friendship tale even though intouchables doesnt completely ignore melancholy suffering and tension it doesnt give excessive attention to them like most films about people with disabilities do additionally the fact that the movie is full of hilarious scenes makes it a fairly good option for those viewers who merely want to watch something for fun there are even some moments which mix sadness and comedy up in order to not make the story feel utterly depressing at any point besides that the plot also deals with some serious social criticism regarding privilegies and socioeconomic inequality a factor which is creatively enforced by the colours and scenarios ironically the films main negative aspect is also related to oppresion and minorities driss makes a few mean jokes about overweight people and other groups throughout the movie and frequently takes some annoyingly sexist attitudes towards a female side character however although such unnecessary moments might make the viewer mildly uncomfortable they dont even remotely ruin the full experience also sys character doesnt become detestable given the fact that he is presented with a lot of likeable and relatable personality traits in conclusion except for a mildly offensive line here and there intouchables is a great movie with a phenomenal and diverse soundtrack sympathetic characters splendid performances and a creative use of colours and scenarios so it certainly deserves to be watched,POSITIVE,Comedy
4074,1.0,23 April 2013,"November 2, 2011 (France)",this film is perfect players are very successful and natural as if scenario take from real life subject of film is a man who are millionaire meet and a man who lose everything these mans have different life and different characters but they have very a strong friendship day by day so film is showing their friendship and their good adventure and film is nice sample for showing should not be human and race distinction moreover every people can make friend with people who have got different life and race i am regretful for why i did not watch this film in more earlier time and i suggest this film to every people as permanently,POSITIVE,Comedy
4075,7.0,3 April 2016,"November 2, 2011 (France)",let me start off by mentioning what i liked about this movie the casting was great and both omar sy and francois cluzet did outstanding jobs and the relationship between them seems natural it was also a very funny movie though watching with subtitles i couldnt help but fall for driss charm and laugh out loud unfortunately the abovementioned just isnt enough to qualify this movie for being considered great i expected a sensitive understated french film what i witnessed was nothing but a feelgood hollywood movie with little to no substance where was the point of conflict philip and driss relationship which was i believe the point of the movie suffered no breaking points no hardship there were a few points of conflict in driss life which never really resolved themselves in addition the frequent use of jump cuts and short takes while useful for comedic effect blocked this movie from being anything but a group of amusing anecdotes about the relationship between invalid and reluctant caretaker and finally between two friends there was very little substantial storyline replaced by various amusing scenes i mentioned before that this was a feelgood hollywood movie and that in my opinion is the worst part the film was full of unrealistic scenarios and characters a sort of la la land where very little struggle is revealed to us look i did enjoy intouchables but i dont think it deserves to be in the imdb top and i believe it was a wasted opportunity,NEGATIVE,Comedy
4076,1.0,5 November 2015,"November 2, 2011 (France)",i dont doubt the reasons that people have given for liking very muchloving this film to the point where it became one of frances biggest hits in years and then not surprising in the least became a weinstein company release in the usa the intouchables is the epitome of a feelgood buddy movie the kind of movie starring a big black dude that you can show your year old grandmother and shell take a liking to it as well unless they have an aversion to say pot or faberge eggs its the case of a movie with the kindest inherently liberal message there is a man from the projects lucks into a job via earth wind fire and kool and the gang as his references at a brief interview and its taking care of a very rich man who is a quadriplegic over the course of this story theyll grow and become best friends and while the rich white guy can learn to relax a little more smoke some weed no really and listen to that kool the gang the dude from the projects gets some vivaldi makes an abstract painting that sells for grand and goes paragliding other stuff happens as well but suffice it to say theres no surprises in this movie that may not be an issue for most out there for me as the movie went along it was just a little too safe that may be a word that doesnt really give much critical credence to whats here and to be fair the actors really help to ground it in a number of scenes francois cluzet and omar sy keep things at a good even keel as far as making the material work for their equal levels of charm and sometimes dismay sy especially shows that he can take what could have been a supertypical magical negro stereotype and not let us forget hes from a slightly less educated background and a little rougher see his comments about the rich mans adopted daughter when she mouths off so on the acting front its perfectly fine and in the first half i was interested in where this would be going when i say safe i mean to say that nothing really dramatic is left out there for any of the characters any possible conflicts get swept up and resolved even before the third act begins it almost seems like driss gets some time off working just so he can resolve his small conflicts or those with his sortabrother and then come back even with the overriding emotional beat of philippes correspondentloveinterest i never felt any sense that these people would not be together by the end theres one little bump in this road maybe two though its only with the sense that hey im quadriplegic cant let her see that i get that its something to make us feel for him that he needs to overcome his fears but i think a big part of it is an overall light touch yes driss may have a criminal background and yes he has a big family to support in the projects not that we see much of them which seems like an odd choice that they just accept this and sure philippe has seemingly all the money in the world where does he get it from who knows rich family they never say so in other words there are stakes here but given that this man cant walk or move or that driss has an upward climb in life it all comes back to just silly jokes in a lot of scenes playful flirting between driss and a woman in the main house not having it life lessons learned in montage its a movie that has a heart in a good place i cant question that and being that its based on a true story and boy does the ending remind you its hard to say this wasnt credible in the sense of it coming from real life in a certain way it may be a certain feeling like its running through things i could see in a lessor tv movie the beats of conflicts that one might see on a sitcom even again the teenage girl plot where she never feels like a character just a thing that gets used from time to time to move little events forward even the moment where the third act gets into gear a little conflict as driss has to go away to fix some things and they call it quits its just ok if you love this movie im happy for you for me it just didnt win me over completely not so much manipulation or pulling at the heartstrings though it tries at times just an overall feeling like its missing some things that could make it feel more important more substantive,POSITIVE,Comedy
4077,3.0,25 May 2022,"November 2, 2011 (France)",i am not a big fan of movies in whole nevertheless expected me it turned out to be touching comedy drama that took place in real life besides film omar si stars nowadays is also popular and has demand the plot based on rich manwho name is filip whose body is paralyzed due to unhappily accident he needs in helper who must always be care with him every people who comes to filip gave up however one day someone comes ot him for an interview it is della former prisoner released from prison who needs work moreover they completely find common language and filip becomes see on life on the other hand i just found this movie absolutely amazing it expected me by plot by this history about two different persons who help each other to change outlooks on life it shows brightly how important is supporting in our live there are now effects no blood or exposions it seems to be very easy but we cant get away from the screen while watching this masterpiece the bright beauty of this film is added by the fact that it is based on real events that took place in real life and this makes this film even more attractive and interesting on top of that artists who played in this film are professionals of their doing omar si who played one of the main roles is excellent as always he is also hilarious sometimes sad for example when he asked another assistant to go on a date with him and she denyed sometimes even angry when he had arguments his family in particular a mother who didnot realy love her son for his criminal past fransua kluse also is very professional artist all in all i was amazed that that i like this movie because its realy rare thing i recommend this picture to everyone,POSITIVE,Comedy

4100,1.0,31 July 2012,"November 2, 2011 (France)",now here is a film that perfect defines the word wholesomeness the intouchables is a moving parable about a wise but poor black man who becomes the caregiver and mentor for a wealthy tetraplegic in a series of unlikely but not unbelievable events in modernday france the film begins by showing the mans assistant interviewing candidates for the job of being the mans hands and legs but as the man sits close behind her he becomes increasingly unsatisfied with the candidates due to their lack of motivation or their mundane nature the man named philippe played by françois cluzet is brought to a smile when he is acquainted with driss omar sy a man who has been through relentless struggles with money and socialstatus but still manages to push through it with a smile driss is only looking for a signature on his unemployment checks so he can continue receiving welfare benefits and has absolutely no ambition to get this job the next day he is called up to begin the trial period as the role of philippes caretaker and while driss is clearly unqualified for a job of this nature philippe casually accepts him because he finds the man to be charming and goodnatured while both men come from the parisianarea philippe lives in a heavenly mansion while driss inhabits the lowest end of the slums despite this setback the men have an incredibly easygoing friendship with deep touching talks of inspiration and motivation throughout the picture subplots involve driss demanding that philippe maintain better control of his only daughter elisa and trying to get the man back on his dating game with a digital lover im aware the story sounds like clichéaftercliché but the film perfectly abides by my law of films with a seemingly cliché premise the intouchables knows its story functions with moments of incredulity and utter sappiness but it doesnt try to overcompensate and milk those moments for more than theyre worth it also does more than give us contrivance but inflates its moments of sentiment with wit charm attitude style and poignancy making this for a very emotional experience on every level sometimes we are greeted with a film we know is relatively simple cliché and unassuming yet we are mesmerized unconditionally up until the final frame the film became a colossal hit in france selling over nineteen million tickets and is currently the second highest grossing film of all time in france due to its very minimal promotion in the us i could see some people going into this film expecting a somber relatively monotone film depicting the life of a tetraplegic tragically and with a numbing aftertaste the intouchables has a talent much like the alexander payne film the descendants which is depicting a relaxing environment which includes making a character out of the setting handling tragedy with a sustainable amount of poignancy and providing touches of extremely funny comedy throughout its entire runtime as of now french cinema is one of the strongest cinemas in the world as it has been for decades now rather than try to recreate the new wave it experienced many years ago try out a gimmicky selfindulgent style or even worse replicate hollywood formulas it is at a stage now where it can take even the most basic storyline and rework it into a magnificent portrayal with humanity and lavishness subtly and majestically the intouchables is a beauty that will definitely be taken for granted starring françois cluzet and omar sy directed by olivier nakache and éric toledano,POSITIVE,Comedy

4120,1.0,4 June 2012,"November 2, 2011 (France)",greetings again from the darkness sometimes acting elevates material to a level far beyond what a film might have otherwise deserved such is the case with this basedonatruestory effort from cowriters and codirectors olivier nakache and eric toledano despite the elements of truth the core material here is a sentimental tale that we have seen before francois cluzet tell no one as philippe and omar sy as driss turn it into an extremely entertaining story with characters we quickly connect with philippe is a wealthy quadriplegic widower who is interviewing candidates for a caregiver driss is a recently released from jail street hustler who is just trying to qualify for state benefits by going on the required interviews philippe is struck by driss direct approach and energy level and chooses driss over the room full of more qualified types the rest of the movie is really a buddy flick where the polar opposites bring much to the other philippe slyly gets driss to use his sharp mind a bit more effectively and driss taps into philippes hidden lust for life though the supporting cast is fine the films best scenes are those featuring philippe and driss this is a film from france and much as been made of the filmmakers decision to change the caregiver from the real life arab to a more cinemafriendly black man the earth wind fire dance may be a bit too much but i choose to believe the casting of omar sy was the deciding factor not his race he lights up the screen and draws us right into his world and his choices some of which are better than others the film shares much with the sea inside scent of a woman and the diving bell and the butterfly but this one has much more humor and bonding than any of those it doesnt shy away from the melodramatic moments and isnt above trying to generate tears in viewers there will be a us remake of this one but the two lead actors here especially mr sy make this one worth seeing,POSITIVE,Comedy
4121,8.0,13 April 2012,"November 2, 2011 (France)",my wife was frightened when i was suddenly burst laughing at omer sys spontaneous acting scenes i enjoyed watching this masterpiece omar sy is a great actor and he deserves an oscar for his role in this movie i found omar sys role much more challenging and unusual than jean dujardins of course few people make silent films today but the character itself was incredibly stereotypical as for the intouchables i really liked the film and found it entertaining and thoughtful at the same time the chemistry between the two leads is wonderful not quite as insufferably retro as it sounds the formulaic film gets a boost from the endearing performances of its leads particularly sy whose exconturnedservant instructs his cultured boss on the pleasures of s soul classics and potsmoking before cleaning up nicely the racial politics remain as sketchy as the sitcomstyle jokes and harvey weinstein smells a hit having bought both the movie and alas the rights to remake,POSITIVE,Comedy
4122,9.0,23 December 2012,"November 2, 2011 (France)",just as how jack neos ah boys to men part finally took over the box office crown held by money no enough more than a decade ago so did intouchables take over the french box office equivalent from the quirky comedy amelie which was the champ over about the last decade as the french entry for the oscars best foreign film picture next year i was glad i held out against watching this while on a flight patiently waiting for it to make its big screen bow here which it finally did outside of the nd rendezvous of french cinema earlier this month there were many moments that made it so easy for me to identify with the movie especially coming from caregiving which is never an easy thing to do those who have never done it im talking about full time real time on the job alertness and doing everything you can to make things comfortable for the other party theres no off button you can use and anyone in this for full time employment gets my utmost respect and watching how the characters here go about their routine bring back memories that are forever dear to me and needless to say these routines and close contact interaction bring about a new level in relationships lifting someone up from bed in backbreaking fashion it brings new meaning to he aint heavy hes my father tucking someone into bed did that too the gloves for the toilet visit nothing new gross that it may be at first wheeling someone out to soak in sights and sounds outside of ones home well it may be the most inconvenient but seeing someones face light up for the rare trip out is priceless and these lifeaffirming relationship building events may seem to stem from mundane tasks and tasks we take for granted such as bathing or just sheer presence to interact without distraction but to the physically infirm it means the world and this is what the intouchables is about the story of two men thrown together by fate in what would be an employeremployee relationship that develops into firm friendship a bromance even if youd like inspired by a true story francois cluzet plays the rich aristocrat philippe who is quadriplegic from the neck down from a paragliding accident and has to rely on an army of helpers and assistances to get through every day but his primary caregiver never lasts more than a week given his rather stiff pardon the pun ways until driss omar sy a young man with not the most polished resume he responded to the ad just to chalk up mileage to get welfare gets hired despite verbally crossing swords during the interview and soon a bet turns into whats lifechanging for them both bringing out the best in each other you can half expect writerdirectors olivier nakache and eric toledanos story to contain the usual clash of cultures and background with one refined in the arts and the other being quite the rough and gruff obviously no time to enjoy the finer things in life when one has to worry about bringing home the bacon for an extended family with trouble brewing when members trying to stay in line with the law but their story is tinged with so much sensitivity and truth that its hard to quibble with the loads of humanity on display going by the adage that one shouldnt judge a book by its cover or by ones background or resume one may be rich but getting someone else to wait on you even if providing him or her with a comfortable life is a different ballgame altogether especially when one is not kin or kith but throughout the story one cannot deny that life can still go on quite comfortably in a material way with wealth on display and if theres a minor grouse about this is how old money gets flaunted around with meseratis and private jets being part of the arsenal to enjoy life then again this is part of the true tale so its not debatable not forgetting the extended ensemble cast of assistants in the form of yvonne anne le ny and magalie audrey fleurot amongst others who pepper the scenery the former serving to fill in the blanks for driss as he tries to gather background while the latter coming in as an object for driss romance with a little surprise up in store theres no qualms the intouchables is a delight to sit through being a story of hope and friendship and in some ways even for the most able amongst us this is a tale that reminds us of the importance of humour which is medicine enough to get us through some of the toughest situations well encounter from time to time both francois cluzet and omar sy put in amazing performances and their delivery of their characters screen charisma and banter are more than reasons enough to catch this a definite recommendation,POSITIVE,Comedy
4123,6.0,1 September 2012,"November 2, 2011 (France)",ive never submitted a review before but this was absolutely outstanding the dialogue is excellent with many unexpected responses especially in the beginning the characters are exceptional especially in their social contrastbut when the inevitable social comparisons are made they are either handled with genuine surprize or else expertly buffooned some of the obvious exchanges are handled so well and so unexpectedly that there are guffaws from the audience the story is wonderfully touching without any syrup that it is a true story makes it even more surprizing and appealing i dont know which other contemporary movie i would rate a perfect well done,POSITIVE,Comedy

4125,1.0,20 October 2014,"November 2, 2011 (France)",the concept of popular cinema has undergone considerable change in france in the past it was a device used by film journalists to define films made by directors namely gérard oury georges lautner claude zidi etc in recent times one sees a new breed of directors especially dany boon michel munz thomas gilou etc whose films have had tremendous commercial success the team of eric toledano and olivier nakache is a new entrant to this group their film the intouchables can be classified as a feel good film with elements of popular cinema it sacrifices its elements of realism to portray an imperfect world of the haves and the haves not through the depiction of how black people are somewhat forced to live in suburbs whereas their friends live in expensive areas of paris as a character study of people from different areas it shows why only a handful of black people are able to mingle with white people intouchables has broken all box office records in france as it honestly portrays a poor mans entry in the life of a rich man,POSITIVE,Comedy
4126,9.0,3 February 2015,"November 2, 2011 (France)",everybody said that this movie was awesome so i gave it a shot iusually dont like france movies so i didnt expect a good movie and i didnt get a good movie the scenes escalated way to quickly why would the handicapped man want him to take care of him the acting is either overacted or there is no act in the scenes in short the acting is bad the writing its just off awful scenes either contain way to much information or no information at all and that confused me a lot it didnt feel realistic im pretty sure no one would react like that in real life situation my recommendation is not to watch this movie,NEGATIVE,Comedy

4131,1.0,16 November 2014,"November 2, 2011 (France)",rare do you watch a film where the energy just bounces off the screen leaving you with a warm glow i felt after watching this movie one of those life affirming moments a clear summer sky where the clouds are full loaded with health and the warm light that seems to last forever showing off the land about you typical of summer evenings this glow is because the principal casts are excellent i cannot direct a negative to any of the casts pinpoint a scene where the acting was forced or lacking in motivation omar sy is infectious as a performer he struts he dominates with his energy whoever cast him deserves praise as he is the right balance between cock sure attitude and understanding francois cluzet pedigree dates back decades and his assured but restrained performance is the right level of rebound compared to sys exuberance trust in a maestro to deliver a seasoned performance it would be easy and a major oversight to read the synopsis about the movie and believe the subject matter depressing funny moving idiosyncratic unexpected real intimate soul praisingly positive and many other adjectives could be used to describe this excellent film i stumbled upon this movie knowing little of its release or background and its a gem of a film one of them films you watch and yell yesssss to life the fact that its based on a true story is inspiring in itself the production value fulfilled the necessary parts to realise a wonderful and life inspiring story achieving for once the medium of film to rank in the spheres of great art an aesthetic tonic for the soul,POSITIVE,Comedy
4132,7.0,18 August 2013,"November 2, 2011 (France)",this went straight into my top films ever seen just such an evocative and believable storyline and masterfully crafted as only french films are there is an inexplicable beauty to some french films such as amelie and untouchable was of the ilk but so much more powerful given the context and nature of the two main characters i cannot recommend this enough i saw it alone then took my yr old son who also found it moving and wonderful nd then saw it with my boyfriend whose yrs as a hospital doctor have made him harder and more cynical than i but he too was moved by this delightful lighthearted approach to what many would see as a tragic story and is raving about it to his friends too i cannot recommend it enough it is a without a doubt and it is an absolute travesty that it has not received the acclaim it deserves,POSITIVE,Comedy
4133,3.0,10 January 2013,"November 2, 2011 (France)",i never post a professional review but now roger ebert reviewed this and said exactly what i felt and wanted to say about this film rather than trying to paraphrase his review i am simply posting his original review found on his web page since links are not allowed i have put spaces in the link you need to remove the space to follow the link appspbcsdll articleaid reviews it might help to think of the intouchables as a french spin off of driving miss daisy retitled pushing monsieur philippe a stuffy rich employer finds his life enriched by a wise black man from the paris ghettos and takes lessons in funky music and the joys of marijuana this is a story that has been told time and again in the movies and sometimes the performances overcome the condescension of the formula the film was an enormous boxoffice hit in france and indeed it is easy to enjoy philippe francois cluzet is a millionaire who was paralyzed from the neck down in a paragliding accident driss omar sy is a man out on parole for robbery who applies for the job of philippes caregiver only so he can be rejected and get a signature on his application for unemployment benefits as philippe interviews one boring job applicant after another we begin to understand that he needs not only physical help but someone to cheer him up driss cheeky irreverence is refreshing and philippe astonishes him and his own household staff by offering him the job the movie tells the story of a growing relationship between these two likable men based on driss confidence that philippe will improve if he escapes his stuckup lifestyle and samples the greater freedoms of an immigrant from africa there may be a certain truth in this but the education of philippe proceeds in a series of essentially insulting clichés driss you see has rhythm and soul and if only philippe can absorb some of that hell be a happier man hell still be a french millionaire surrounded by a protective staff hell still be paralyzed but hell be happier how many times have we seen the scene where an uptight square inhales pot for the first time and a smile slowly spreads across his face the intouchables has an element of truth that it never quite recognizes the role of a good caregiver is hardly limited to lifting bathing grooming dressing pushing and supplying medicines the patient is faced with a reality he finds it difficult to accept he has been deprived of all he once took for granted such as the simple ability to walk across a room a caregiver cant provide that but he can provide something more valuable companionship philippes wife is dead his teenage daughter is a snotty brat and his staff is preoccupied by their salaries and status driss comes from a different world the success of the film despite its problems grows directly from its casting francois cluzet who acts only with his face and voice communicates great feeling omar sy is enormously friendly and upbeat he reminded me of the african immigrant played by souleymane sy savane in ramin bahranis goodbye solo a film that avoided the traps that the intouchables falls into the appeal of a film like this and it is perfectly legitimate is that when we begin to feel affection for the characters what makes them happy make us happy caught up in the flow of events we allow many assumptions to pass unchallenged the writerdirectors olivier nakache and eric toledano are cheerfully willing to go for broad gags and their style is ingratiating but at the end by looking through the foreground details what were being given is a simplistic reduction of racial stereotypes that was also true of driving miss daisy but it was a period picture set in the south in the late s with older characters who had been shaped by their times there was a plausibility there the intouchables is more of a soothing fantasy by roger ebert may,POSITIVE,Comedy
4134,8.0,24 February 2013,"November 2, 2011 (France)",this is a dont miss film if there ever was one any age will find this film to be one of the best films they have seen in years even teenagers who typically only want to see action films will be drawn to this film one does not even remember the film was subtitled this is the story of a quadriplegic who continually needs to find new caregivers because of how badly he treats them he finally finds the most improbable candidate and hires him this begins a fantastic and very funny relationship that kept me spellbound for the whole movie as it did the entire audience when it ended the audience all clapped loudly see this movie if you want to laugh a lot and if you appreciate the development of a true unique friendship,POSITIVE,Comedy

4136,1.0,5 December 2012,"November 2, 2011 (France)",one of my favourite films is the intouchables with the famous actor omar sy who became popular because of the tv show sav a wonderful and emotional story about philippe a rich quadriplegic who requires a livein caregiver one the plus side the movie is funny and sensitive at the same time in this role omar keeps his trademark hilarious attitude he gets the job to work for philippe played by francois cluzet philippe loves cedrics behaviour and attitude omar sy because he treats him like a normal person without mercy or sympathetic in this movie you will discover a story of love and close friendship moreover this movie is taken from a true story which make the plot even more real and attractive go and see this film you wont be disappointed,POSITIVE,Comedy
4137,1.0,13 July 2012,"November 2, 2011 (France)",okay so my first concern why i didnt want to watch the intouchables was the story itself like it was scavenged from a hollywood studios thrash can a disgustingly rich quadriplegic guy hires a downonhis luck young man from the projects to be his personal aid the cool dude shows the stuck up old man how to have fun and in return the rich guy teaches him about arts manners and whatnot initially they have a few quarrels that mostly derives from the social racial and age difference and that the man is actually paralyzed from the neck down but in the end they grow close and live happily ever after that really sounds like something hollywood might cook up like scent of a woman or flawless but heres the catch this movie is based on true events not in the sense as titanic for example where the only historically accurate fact was that the ship sunk it really how it happened in real life as depicted in this movie philippe pozzo di borgo the real life billionaire who this movie is about personally oversaw the making of this movie to make sure it depicted the story of him and abdel sellou his aid as realistically as possible sure they took a little artistic license here and there but its mostly accurate the thing about cripples and terminally ill patients is that most people dont know how to handle them dr house said it best in the series that once people know you have cancer from then on everything will be about cancer people will feel obligated to feel sorry for you they will be overly attentive overly helpful to the point of annoying and will be really careful about how they talk to you they will never ever just be themselves around you even if youve accepted your condition a long time ago and sometimes you just wanna forget your debilitating disease youll be reminded every single time by these people who cannot not see the cripple or the person with the death sentence when they look at you what this movie offers is a unique insight into a relationship that defies this driss is brash brazen and completely disregards the notion of feeling sorry for phillip he acknowledges the fact that he is a quadriplegic and he slowly learns to take care of him but he seemingly refuses to be the gloomy ohimsosorry kind of hypocrite society wants him to be instead he makes fun of phillips condition on many occasions making even phillip himself laugh he introduces a fresh and invigorating energy into phillips life which makes him see the world in a new light instead of wallowing in the sad and painful past he starts to look to the future take chances and make the best of what he can of what he still has all in all the intouchables was a really positive surprise its not a perfect movie but its a perfect story,NEGATIVE,Comedy
4138,7.0,10 April 2012,"November 2, 2011 (France)",before watching my only expectation was that it really is a comedy not a drama with two laughs in it turns out it was a comedy with very subtle touch of drama it is a movie worth every second of your time does it have flaws i dont know i was too busy enjoying every minute of it captivating actors beautiful script and great sense of humor this is one of those very rare movies that make a tiny change deep inside you and youll know it happened when the movie is over watching this you can laugh at a tetraplegics shortcomings without feeling bad because it is in absolutely good spirit you can laugh at the serious things in life because they cant kill you and somehow can always find a way to have some fun no matter what,POSITIVE,Comedy

4140,6.0,5 June 2013,"November 2, 2011 (France)",the movie revolves around people a quadriplegic aristocrat and a black guy hired as his care taker the movie showcases the turmoil a quadriplegic faces in his life and shows how little things in his life bring about great joy it also stresses on the point that how the small things we generally ignore provide with relief n happiness in times of adversity when focused upon the acting in the movie is brilliant francois cluzet has given an outstanding performance as the quadriplegic as far as omar sy is considered i couldnt say he was acting at all it was as though i was actually seeing things happen in real life as they unfold he was deeply in character and has delivered an award winning performance overall the movie is thought provoking one rich in emotion n detail i give it a,POSITIVE,Comedy
4141,2.0,23 March 2013,"November 2, 2011 (France)",rented this film with no intention of watching it but in a moment of boredom decided to give it a go i didnt realise it was french and couldnt really be bothered with the subtitles but before i had time to turn it off i was already involved the films is truly amazing from start to finish with an amazing perfromance from everyone in it would put this in my top films to see before you die with it currently being at number i could sit through the film again now even though i just watched it the humour in it was perfect and had me cryin with laughter in more than one part definitely a must see star film,POSITIVE,Comedy
4142,9.0,29 July 2015,"November 2, 2011 (France)",the intouchables is a french comedybiography from and stars françois cluzet tell no one little white lies french kiss and omar sy xmen days of future past jurassic world samba it was written and directed by olivier nakache and eric toledano samba those happy days tellement proches this film is about a quadriplegic millionaire named philippe françois cluzet who hires a lowerclass man from the projects called drissomar sy with help from driss philippe finds humour in his situation and driss reminds him how to appreciate life again through setting him up on dates listening to funk music and even giving him a joint this film is propelled by the performances by françois cluzet and omar sy françois gives his performance purely through dialogue and facial movements surprisingly he gives a great performance filled with emotion and humour omar sy plays an incredibly likable character who can really make you laugh at points and at others make you feel very compassionate about his issues whenever the two are on screen together it is gold i would compare their chemistry to those of buddy cop movies although this relationship is a lot deeper another aspect of this film that i admired was the dialogue since there is no real plot other than the story of two men the film is carried by a lot of good dialogue for example when the two are looking at a piece of art philippe asks driss why he thinks people are interested in art driss replies with because its a business when philippe tells him its because its the only thing one leaves behind this film is basically the french version of driving miss daisy that is not to say this film is bad this films strongest points are writing and acting but after that its pretty thin directing or cinematography isnt anything special and the piano soundtrack sounds like something that would be added to an amateur short film yet this is still a heartwarming film it seems like it is a little overrated,POSITIVE,Comedy

4145,8.0,15 June 2012,"November 2, 2011 (France)",intouchables is probably one of the best french movies of the last few decades its not hard to see why it raised such a tremendous furor in europe and now its creating an even bigger fan base for itself in the united states its so utterly pleasurable and heartwarming dont look at it as a foreign feature though or you will miss ale the excitement its a movie simply made for the viewers to love and remember films like this one dont come out too often these days so just sit back and enjoy it while its still out on the big screen intouchables presents a truly touching story about an unlikely friendship between an older extremely rich but severely paralyzed white man and a black man who just got out of prison philippe is in need of a caretaker and as soon as omar steps into his house he realizes that he might be the right person for this specific role the plot doesnt concentrate too much on the way that those two guys connect over time but quickly shows how they got so fond of each other it was as if they were meant to work together and in the process become intouchable in a very profound meaning of the word and inseparable by any outer force its fantastic to see how people from completely different backgrounds are able to form such a strong bond and spend so many wonderful days and nights together even though at first it might seem that omar may be overly vulgar disrespectful ignorant and simply inadequate for this hard job philippe is still eager to give him a chance whats more many of philippe closest friends dont approve of his new companion but that doesnt discourage him it is simply remarkable how omar is able to bring warmth enthusiasm and so much fun into philippes life they actually operate on the same wavelength as it might seem sharing the same views and opinions on various topics through omar philippe understands that sometimes all it takes to achieve pure happiness is to let go and do what one feels like doing as if nothing really mattered even if you are attached to a wheelchair and with that moving tale the movie creates a very powerful message showing that all the wealth and money isnt capable of making a man truly happy when he doesnt have someone to share it with its the richness in heart and mind that really matters not the abilities of a body blessed with fortune and power through his brilliant funny and very real performance omar sy will probably give his career a fantastic jump start he is able to show the transition that his character goes through from a cold man living on the streets to a deeply compassionate and artloving protector in the most convincing manner the amount of clever laughable and sometimes insulting but timed very adequately jokes is simply overwhelming also notice the amazing mix of classic music and s soul and the way it enhances the visualization of this very peculiar friendship between the characters i dont think that if someone wouldve come to me with a script and said listen i got a story about a young black guy who makes fun of a handicapped man and gives him weed to smoke just to make him feel more relaxed i wouldve bought it its a simple exaggeration but through that straight statement i want to show that the movie has yet so much more to offer making the marvelous intouchables a true standout movie of the last few years highly recommended,POSITIVE,Comedy

4256,9.0,19 January 2022,"November 2, 2011 (France)",when people for some reason are limited in their abilities and cannot live their own lives they either begin to take an excessively active part in someone elses life or try to realize themselves through another person so for example single mothers act having one beloved child which becomes the meaning of their whole life or housewives merging into their husbands or thats why grandmothers at the entrance love to gossip so much or remember the hero of the movie the benefactor played by richard gere however it is possible to realize oneself through another person both in a bad and in a good way the paralyzed aristocrat philip whose life is not to be envied at all is sent by the lord god himself the gouging driss it is only in the opinion of others that driss is the least suitable for the role of a nurse a criminal past uneducated from the lower strata of society and generally colored maybe driss is not entirely attentive to details but he has an excellent sense of humor and quickly cuts what exactly philip needs namely fresh air literally and figuratively he is trying to restore philippes taste for life to diversify it with the help of such simple but important little things puffs with a joint a quick drive through the evening streets of paris erotic massage and philip needs such adventures much more than the close attention of other correct but boring to the point of toothache nurses who also feel sorry for him pity and treating him like a porcelain figurine do not give philip pleasure but rather only irritate him but he is delighted with the carelessness of driss who without a second thought puts a cigarette into philips mouth and rolls it at an exorbitant speed philip gets pleasure when driss treats him like an equal what a senegalese thug can do a wheelchair user can do this new life experience gives philip the opportunity at least for a while to escape from his sad thoughts he does not spend all his evenings in the living room dictating highflown letters to his secretary driss succeeds in changing philips life for the better helping him get rid of the fears and insecurities that prevent him from establishing a personal life charming driss wins the sympathy of not only philip himself but also other inhabitants of his house it is quite obvious that he does his job not just for money but also gets real pleasure from it quite naturally the relationship between philip and driss goes beyond the customerservicing staff and turns into a friendly one on the example of driss we are once again convinced that it is not always worth evaluating a person by his appearance and making hasty conclusions here we see driss in a sweatshirt and baggy jeans and we are immediately tempted to label him as a dimwitted bum but as soon as he changes into a suit and shoes he immediately transforms and when he incendiary dances to rhythmic music setting the tone at first for philips boring and official birthday party you cant take your eyes off him at all this is the talent of driss defiantly but organically deviate from the protocol giving philip the opportunity to truly feel alive what can i say driss is just a unique character for all his outward rudeness he has amazing plasticity and acting skills even such a boring and unloved activity by many men as shaving he manages to turn into something exciting thats why philip is so attached to driss because he breaks the standards that philip is already fed up with through driss the filmmakers are perfectly able to broadcast the installation to the viewer you should not feel sorry for philip he is limited in his physical capacity but not at all limited in his inner qualities on the contrary such a person is worthy of admiration he does not slide into depression misanthropy but on the contrary is very strong in spirit has optimism and retains human dignity of course we must pay tribute to the fact that philip has access to a lot that is not available to other people in his position constrained in their means because philip is very rich but as the french say se la vie we deal with what is the stronger the contrast of the main characters the rich and the poor the aristocrat and the uncouth resident of a highrise building from an emigrant district white and black and this contrast holds the viewer throughout the film as well as a very strict adherence to the framework of the tragicomedy genre the result is a very balanced mix with neither one nor the other outweighing the scales the untouchables made me associate with another film made years after the release of the untouchables namely me before you there we also deal with a paralyzed aristocrat who is hired a nurse only in me before you the role of nurse is not an africanfrench but a young flowering girl who also manages to do for the protagonist what was not possible before others the untouchables is the perfect movie for a pleasant evening viewing when you want something like that it is like the quintessence of everything french simple but elegant the film is moderately light moderately touches on social topics

4324,1.0,29 August 2012,"November 2, 2011 (France)",why the casting is magnificent simply perfect in most of the cases rarely does the movie uselessly linger the characters laughter is simply contagious and in many cases you feel like youd really like to be able to just somehow cross the line and enter into the movie and become part of it oh and its french which really adds to its flavor i didnt read anything about this movie before or after watching it today but if someone in the future will tell me from the director of the intouchables i would go for it the only thing i found redundant in this movie was the way the story flows a linear storyline structure would have suited me much better i think the script tried to hide the fakeish looking climax to the end of the story moving things in front only made it worse,NEGATIVE,Comedy

4327,8.0,1 February 2012,"November 2, 2011 (France)",far too often this film is discussed within the limits of the socalled political correctness why a black man instead of an arab as it was in reality and why must a black man serve a white man etc etc this film is about friendship of two very different persons no matter if they are black or white i think that the black man omar sy was a very good actor in this role and the white man francois cluzetwas a good actor in this role as well and i think that racism will be no more virulent only when people are no more interested in the question if a black yellow white or mixed person plays a certain role but only in the question if he she plays the role good or not,POSITIVE,Comedy

4330,1.0,28 November 2018,"November 2, 2011 (France)",i dont often get the chance to take in foreign cinema but in the case of the intouchables im reminded of why i enjoy every opportunity to watch something fairly magical unfold on the screen sure it sounds cheesy but i have to say the more foreign films i see the more i find that i truly enjoy the intouchables written and directed by olivier nakache and éric toledano is a total wild card and it works in ways that are completely indescribable the sense of purity and genuinity is evident throughout the film and is wholeheartedly embraced by the audience the intouchables is based on the truelife events of philippe françois cluzet a wealthy quadriplegic and driss omar sy a young man with a troubled background who philippe hires as his caretaker the film follows the interesting relationship that develops between these two men one of mutual respect and true friendship while the foreign reception of this movie has been overwhelmingly successful the stateside opinions of this movie have been fairly varied most of which find this movie to be racist demeaning or otherwise offensive i feel as though these opinions are somewhat ridiculous as the movie itself doesnt ever make race an issue unless you are trying to read into the fact that the white man is rich and the black man is poor these men are more peers that initially meets the eye the unexpected companionship of these two men results in fantastic comedic opportunities and not only are they hilarious but they are touching and emotionally raw the true magic in this film shines through by way of the incredible acting talent and their obvious fervor for their craft it is no surprise that both actors were awarded the honor of best actor at the tokyo international film festival additionally omar sys performance as driss helped him to edge out jean dujardin the artist for the césar award for best actor it is rare to find two individuals that have the connection that sy and cluzet share on screen and their interaction is wholly refreshing this and the remaining components of the movie all seamlessly work together to provide a satisfying backdrop for the heartwarming story at one point philippes lawyer displays concern over the choice of driss as philippes caretaker due to his questionable background philippe indicated that such was of no concern and he was merely grateful to be treated as a person not as someone with a disability while i understand that many american viewers will maintain a perception that this movie is offensive on some level i feel as though the way we as americans view race is severely different from those in other countries while i dont consider myself an expert or advocate for awareness of racial discrimination i find that the perpetuation of such through the media is unacceptable still i think that this movie warrants an open mind as it ventures beyond the obvious issues and touches on a level of humanity that surpasses the pulling of the racism card to be quite honest this movie was probably one of the best movies i have seen all year from a fantastic cast to an emotionally touching story that doesnt get lost or muddled in translation the intouchables has leaped its way to the top of my list for possible oscar nominations which isnt a far stretch of the imagination i would definitely recommend this as a movie to put on your must see list i dont think you will be disappointed,POSITIVE,Comedy

4333,1.0,7 May 2016,"November 2, 2011 (France)",a touching version of a true story that could have only been made by the french combined with a sweetness that only celluloid can deliver i chanced upon this movie on a saturday evening and having loved the language all my life i decided to give it a go and over a period of two hours my life my world view my sensibilities went for the lack of a better word boom the performances were not good they were subtle understated deep and so incroyably french while most say and i agree the movie rides on omar sys very capable shoulders the music is the horse that omar sy rides on ludovico einaudi could not have done a better job if he had the invisible hand helping him if you want a deeply moving movie that makes you laugh out loud helped along by a background of soulful classical music that gently intertwines with funk or if you want a movie that pokes fun at art while being deeply reverent of it all at the same time or if you just want a movie that simply ticks all the boxes and then creates some new ones this will be it and to the french sensibilities i once again take my hat off,POSITIVE,Comedy
4334,1.0,14 April 2013,"November 2, 2011 (France)",scriptwise the film follows all the rules but doesnt make an stiff movie or a collection of predictable clichés far away from that all the resources that are used in the movie are used in order to tell a story that it is the core of the movie the growing and life changing friendship between philipe françois cluzet the french dustin hoffman and driss omar sy the second has worked in previous movies of the directors and writers of the movie olivier nakache eric toledano it is a movie that can blend together perfectly humor and drama in many levels all the time it plays with that the spontaneity of driss is key to explain the force that drives through out the movie along with the intelligence and sensibility of philipe many of the scenes that we can find it funny and interesting in the movie it is under this blunt honesty socially we are under so much scrutiny and so much expectations of behavior of what it is expected that we can end up drowning in our skin and probably no one would realize how can we overcome our own fears the weigh of our own lives and really see one another friendships can do that and that it is the story of the movie two true friends brothers he laughs at the opera which i have been one time in austria and i would definitely agree with him unless you are over years old you will might like it though just dont forget to bring your pants they wont let you in otherwise he is able to look at philipe with no pity and with compassion they are both able to acknowledge one another and have fun movies are made of scenes of fragments of life the whole plot can only work because these emotions and moments come in high level into the movie true as for what can be recognized by our emotions moments of friendship it is so easy to see their intimacy moments of teenager joy when he gets to drive the car moments of real emotion for the characters etc some truths we think are so hard to face that we are not able to admit to ourselves but only a true friend can look at it and be able to help us out to be who we truly are we usually live with two lives inside our hearts and minds but things only really start when they become one and that it the whole story,POSITIVE,Comedy
4335,1.0,18 March 2017,"November 2, 2011 (France)",this was one of the first titles i watched after taking a deep dive into the foreign film market and as a result i have never looked back in the endless search for more and more foreign hidden gems the intouchables is a movie which comes out of france a passionate story directed by olivier nakache and eric toledano which ultimately would become one of the most successful french films to ever hit the box office you may also know there work from another film titled samba another hit which also starred omar sy has also played several smaller roles such as barry in jurassic world the general premise is that philippe has been a lifelong paraplegic who is searching for an everyday caretaker to help him with menial tasks such as showering shaving eating and any inconveniences that he may encounter on a given day driss happens to apply for the job desperately in need of a new source of income while many would have tossed aside driss on his past alone criminal record and seemingly never ending impatience for people philippe wants a person who will look at him as more than a handicapped man he wants a friend and someone who will treat him like he is just as capable as the next i quote a line from the film where philippe is approached by a colleague who is concerned that hiring someone like driss a person with a rough background colleague these street guys have no pity philippe thats what i want antics ensue i claim this to be one of my favorite films and gems for several reasons the chemistry between the two leads omar sy and françois cluzet is perfection you truly believed these two individuals from polar opposite upbringings had becomes the closest of friends having discovered the beauty and benefits had from learning about one another and quite frankly chemistry of this magnitude is a rarity in film nowadays the imagery was beautiful every scene from the nights at dinner or concerts visiting private art galleries together snowball fights that humor could be drawn from having a snowball fight with a paraplegic speaks volumes driss helping philippe with his everyday health needs all the way to merely feeling like hes just a normal person who also wants to have fun once in a while the story was told in such a way that keeps us wanting more both directors cleverly scatter humor throughout in order to offer the viewer some relief from the dark drama which is drawn out of these two characters with equally different struggles and rough pasts i think what ultimately made this entertaining for me was thus in situations where you have a helpless or handicapped lead in this case a paraplegic the first thing i wanted was for a physically capable person to stand up for them in situations where the other is not able to do so themselves for example early on in the film we are shown a situation where philippe has a neighbor who constantly parks in the front of his drive way it clearly bothers him but he cant do anything besides wait for the ignorant guy to move out of the way driss is now philippes right hand man and upon recognizing the situation jumps out of the car and gets in the drivers face yelling for him to move his car and never park there again you get a sense of satisfaction from this kind of relationship as well as the developing friendship these two develop for one another as they learn to depend on each other i wont ruin the ending for you but rest assured that it wont disappoint this is truly a hidden gem for any american and i cannot recommend this title more highly stars review by searsino,POSITIVE,Comedy

4339,9.0,23 December 2014,"November 2, 2011 (France)",the intouchables so lets start from the packaging of this movie it is very simple yet humble you can easily divide this movie into two parts first the story part it is my own term to call the conversation scene usually without music background or sound effect and this movie utilizes this part perfectly i mean it can make the audiences feel the melancholic sense of this movie the conversation story also delivered in a very natural way actually with some humble jokes too and the other part is the catchy part it is my own term too this part is when the soundtrack takes place in the scene very dynamic shot comedic scene or attractive act you know this part makes the boredom of audiences vanish and start to laugh as well also this is a kind of stimulant to make audiences keep watching the whole movie the intouchables mixes those two part with great sequence that makes synergy from each part the second point is this film combines two extreme paradigm of how we see the world philippe represents the upperclass people who admires art strictly enjoys expensive sport also follows the rich man ritualism the only weakness of this class is the lack of true love everything is blur with so many luxurious things that he has he can feel the beauty of painting and music but doesnt feel the art of life itself even after the tragic tragedy of his life he still in search in true love what i mean isnt a love from a man to woman more than that it is compassion and conscience from every human again even richpeople has a humanside when he feels cold in his plush property the other perspective is from driss an easy going man works as the caretaker of philippe of course such as a shameless and pastcriminalman mustnt be the keeper of quadriplegic millionaire this the very point of the movie the upperclass touch the low class in a very dynamic interaction both philippe and driss learn each others paradigm of how he sees life although driss has a dark track record he is a pragmatic and funny character it makes philippe conscious with all the ritualism he had done melancholic thats who philippe is learn the way of compassion throughout driss comical character so its just like a motivation show or inspiring talk show about a batch of social stratification but wrapped in a interesting comedy movie another view is this movie actually a satire movie an elegant satire i think lets say how can the upperclass buy an expensive yet simple paintings in the same time there are so many hungry people throughout their city what is the meaning of life for the lucky person such as millionaire is it just a place and time for them to throw away the money by temporal things their compassion is simply blur with all those things real human instinct of love is died by the greed yes a deep message one the feeling of fulllife as human thats what we all the human seek and unfortunately usually the lowclasshuman found out it in spite of the others just like what bibles said so thats all the implicit contents of this authentic work of art in cinema maybe the director writer or cast isnt to important but since the great idea of humanity is the main theme there is no way to say its a bad cinema simply wonderful,POSITIVE,Comedy
4340,1.0,4 October 2015,"November 2, 2011 (France)",as an enthusiast for film in every aspect i truly believe this french drama to be a masterpiece beginning with the incredibly well suited score by ludovico einaudi which captures the essence of the film i was initially unsure what to expect the opening scene was majestic and beautifully filmed with dramatic cinematography and introduced the clever comedy throughout the picture the true story that the script is based off may not at first glance seem relevant to many people however i realised that actually this film notes a lot on differences in culture and creates a character for driss the protagonist who is low in the socioeconomic scale that expresses a lot of ideas that we might not realise and shows that the ways of the wealthy are not only largely different on the surface but deep beneath are much like that of any class what really made this film get the rating i have given it is the heart that it has driss and his friend philippe have masterfully scripted conversations which have a beautiful mixture of melancholy and satire which gives the film a very natural sense and elevates the fluency of the pacing many scenes i found myself bursting with laughter as if i were having a laugh with close friends the film feels very personal because of this and the accompaniment of einaudis soft yet tenacious performance generates a homely atmosphere throughout the beautiful cinematography carefully mimics that of a persons sight with artistic blurring and intriguing angles these angles and camera effects bring you deep into the character of philippe whom is paralysed beneath his neck as it feels much like his view philippes character tends to stare out into the distance and the filming resembles this aspect finally this incredible film is accompanied by acting which feels very real and each actors style worked perfectly with the character that they played the film as an entirety felt natural and real and the superb acting was the heart of the greatness,POSITIVE,Comedy

4364,1.0,6 June 2013,"November 2, 2011 (France)",the french movie the intouchables is a comedy about a disabled aristocrat named phillip and his encounter with driss who is a young man who comes from the outsides of paris and is fresh out of jail phillipe decides to hire driss as his helper even though driss does not have any education or experience together they go on an adventure that will make them find the value of friendship even though they are totally different characters they learn to live and see life from a different perspective and at the same time complement each other perfectly the directors of this marvelous story are eric toledano who is forty to years old and oliver nakache who is years old both of them who have known each other since the beginning of the s were born in france and did their first their first short film in the directors were inspired to do this movie in after watching a documentary about the life of phillippe pozzo di brogo eight years later they decided to adapt this story and create the movie named the intouchables i will now analyze several cinematic aspects of the movie and whether they succeed or fail in these within the movie the title of the movie is suitable and adapts perfectly to the movie because thee friends are inseparable even though they are absolutely different when they meet they find happiness and become comfortable with themselves hey complement each other because phillip does not like a person that have pity on him which makes them the perfect duo due to the fact that driss treats him like any other person phillipe after a long time of not doing so laughs and smiles thanks to drisss personality on the other hand driss finds another way to live he learns to be honorable and to work hard to earn things for himself without stealing others objects when they are together they are unstoppable intouchable at the same time that the title adapts to the movie the cast is totally adequate omar sy interprets driss a tall and big man who is funny and always smiling this creates contrast with francois cluzet who interprets phillipe as a serious and elegant man the clothing is another success of the cast from the movie these reveal the different characterizations of each character when the movie starts drisss clothing are scarce and in bad state but as the movie goes one his appears to have more clothes and also more sense of fashion thanks to his new job and new lifestyle phillipes clothing is elegant all throughout the movie due to the fact that people that know him expect to see him dressed that way because of his social status he also dresses according to his age and gender phillipes maids have an elegant uniform to work with and his daughter has a tendency to dressing inappropriately for her age drisss family dress with dark loose and old clothes which reflects the type of life they have thanks to the society they live in the script is simple clear and adequate each character has its own way to talk and express themselves according to their characterization for example driss has a more informal way to talk than phillipe music is not a central point or focus of the movie but when there is music it is wonderful and helps create the perfect environment for the movie when driss and phillipe are paragliding the music is harmonious but moving at the same time it gives a sense of happiness and adventure which is the exact situation they are going through another moment in which the movie is important is in phillipes birthday party the band is professional and present famous songs that make the audience feel identified with the movie it makes us remember why music is so important in peoples lives the sound was low and high according to the situation the character where experiencing on phillipes birthday the music is loud as if it were the one talking instead of the characters on the other hand when driss is leaving phillipes house it is low and what is loud is actually the rain the scenography along with the photography is excellent it is different in each place including paris houses of different characters mountains etc the different environments are perfectly portrayed the photography is simple the framing is usually from the hips to the top of the actor or the whole actor one can rarely see the characters and their whole surroundings which creates emphasis on the characters and the situation they are in the movie achieves teaching us through infortune and humor that everyone is different and we need to help one another because not everyone has the same privileges or problems also that we need to enjoy life to the fullest because you only live once we have to be happy with what he have and not with what we do not have i recommend this movie to everyone out there it is entertaining for people of all ages and genres it maintains everyone entertained and interested every second and at the same it teaches a great lesson to the public there is romance suspense friendships and a lot more,POSITIVE,Comedy

4367,1.0,2 March 2018,"November 2, 2011 (France)",damn this has put me in a really happy moodwhich is rare trust me one of the highest rated french films currently untouchable is the true story of a rich handicapped man employing the assistance of a benefit scrounging man where the two make for an unlikely friendship whilst this does follow the ever so popular formula of poor man temporarily lives in rich lifestyle that now changes him for the better it is somewhat different in which simultaneously the millionaire is also touched by the lifestyle of the excon caretaker it is this balance of these glimpses into each lifestyle that makes these characters relatable and likeable they are down to earth they are just like you or me and i really admire that approach its a story of opportunities being able to give someone a job that they may not usually receive that not only brings them plenty of money but changes their way of life their way of thinking a story like this is the definition of a crowd pleaser i can say with certain that everyone will enjoy this what assists with my certainty is the outstanding performances by omar sy and francois cluzet sy was phenomenal a very grounded and understated performance and you can see he is having fun which really elevates the optimistic mood that the film conveys cluzets performance is rooted with honesty and a hint of sarcasm that makes the dialogue refreshing there were many moments where i laughed which again is a rare accomplishment in itself its does try to tug on your emotional strings a little too much and personally i dont think it achieved this it does enhance the character development but you can see that it does not quite reach those heights didnt feel like a natural progression in the story like the writers just had to throw some emotional conflict for the sake of it formulaic yes but this is one of the most uplifting comedies ive seen in a long time definitely recommended,POSITIVE,Comedy

4382,9.0,19 May 2012,"November 2, 2011 (France)",its not hard to see how intouchables become a hit its a crowd pleaser in the true sense of the word a movie that works to appeal to every sector of the audience and uses a familiar formula thats been seen many times before interestingly though it doesnt resort to the lowest common denominator nakache and toledano were clearly aware of the fact that theyre not offering any new revelations and instead focused on making the movie as entertaining touching and effective as possible and it works loath as i am to admit it the movie is fastpaced fantastically edited always entertaining sitting squarely on the border between comedy and drama the two leads françois cluzet and omar sy have perfect chemistry and make even the crudest jokes work more impressively they make even the most cynical viewer forget that they heard it all before intouchables is in fact one of those precious few films i can label as almost perfect in that its impossible to point out any particular flaws the biggest flaw and the only reason i gave it a less than perfect rating is simply how predictable it is its very easy to ignore while youre watching but intouchables is in fact a formula movie which doesnt really have anything that new or interesting to say and doesnt do anything that wasnt done before that doesnt detract anything though from the fact that its an excellent movie and practically impossible not to enjoy if only because the two leads are so incredibly likable and so much fun to spend minutes with,POSITIVE,Comedy

4384,1.0,12 September 2013,"November 2, 2011 (France)",the french film the intouchables is a very moving story based on true to life characters it is directed by olivier nakache and eric toledano and it is written by olivier nakache and eric toledano as well the story involves a wealthy quadriplegic man who is aided by a black man of little means the plot quickly evolves and is checkered with bits of comic relief as in many of shakespeares plays there are moments of tearfulness as well as outright laughter interspersed in such a way as to make this a very satisfying experience i can highly recommend this french film with subtitles for its humanity that is quite evident from beginning to end in addition the sound track of cars racing down the road give ones sound system a vigorous workout,POSITIVE,Comedy

4394,9.0,6 February 2017,"November 2, 2011 (France)",reviewi sat to write a review for this film as an acknowledgement of the debt i incurred while watching this masterpiece the plot revolve around a rich quadriplegic phillipefrancois cluzetand his temporary caregiver drissomar syand the misdemeanors and infractions of the latter while performing his duties assigned and the very sophisticated yet intangibly compassionate understanding of these actions of the earlierphillipethe temperament exhibited by him phillipe against all the brusque cocky yet humorous attitudes of his caregiverdrisswith his withdrawn elegance are perhaps the driving force and the most rare facet of this film turning this in my opinion into a timeless work of artthe central theme is almost intangible abstract yet of the most emotive genre which will engulf you despite not knowing whats exactly the dimension of this film causing so there are moments so intense and so impassioned though of course not obvious that will make you feel indebted to this film with their subtle portrayal in a manner which cannot always necessarily be perceived by the senses otherwise it will take time for you to understand the parallel facets that follow every measure being pursued by the actors the background music is almost heavenly took me somewhere so unknown simply put you will perhaps never meet another one of this kind in future in case of me at least that have not happened yet,POSITIVE,Comedy

4396,1.0,3 October 2013,"November 2, 2011 (France)",i loved this movie it had absolutely all the elements of a great film the acting was amazing and the cinematography was fabulous it had many messages all done in a really nice subtle way the music was perfect too i really loved that last shot of driss looking back in the window that shot with his facial expression said it all and will stick in my mind the only thing that bothered me was the ending writing about what happened to them i thought it broke the mood some and it would have been better left unsaid but then i remembered that this was based on a true story so that makes it more justified omar sy is loaded with talent i will check out his other movies,POSITIVE,Comedy

4402,9.0,14 November 2012,"November 2, 2011 (France)",the film does not tell anything new but the refreshing feel that it gives you after watching is something you will cherish forever the credit basically goes to the acting by the lead cast the storyline is pretty simple oh and the music is the backbone in this film it is one of those few films which manipulate your feelings extensively with the help of sounds the story of a quadriplegic man helped by another man for day to day work and living the beautiful moments of life is sure to impress you pros the thought that fascinated me most was the demand of philippe from people not to be sympathetic to him that is so true and original people met with accident want a normal life again and do not want sympathies which eventually look like forced upon omar sy as driss has definitely stolen the show the main story revolves around what the two do all day but it also gives fair judgment to the personal life of driss he has been shown as a realistic character that is kind hearted but on the other side is not able to live properly with his family the film its characters its locations music cinematography and almost everything else is soothing message we all need equal treatment verdict most recommended,POSITIVE,Comedy
4403,9.0,19 June 2015,"November 2, 2011 (France)",intouchables is a film that has the rare quality of telling a story about a situation that is sad and putting a uplighting spin on it philippe francois cluzet is a rich quadriplegic looking for a caregiver he hires driss omar sy a young man from a background that most people in phillipes circle wouldnt trust phillipe is looking for someone who wont pity him and what he gets is a person who gives phillipe a perspective that makes the both of them grow to become better people the film is funny sad and above all else extremely well made the story which is superbly written flies by the cinematography and the editing contribute to the films smooth style and with the soundtrack not to forget youre in for a good time it can cross languages and cultures and can still be viewed as a gem of a movie,POSITIVE,Comedy

4405,1.0,11 October 2012,"November 2, 2011 (France)",i saw that this movie had made it on the top list rather quickly so i had to go see it from the opening scene the movie kept you engaged with its memorable characters which provide great chemistry with each other makes you wonder if a price can be put on your health and freedom i had to ask myself if i would trade places with philippe with all his status and material riches but to be totally dependent on a caretaker for the most basic of daily tasks the driss character was a total contrast and provided what philippe could not provide on his own not just from a physical viewpoint when i went to see this it was only playing in one theater in the chicagoland area a shame that a quality films doesnt get the distribution while the mass marketed produced junk that hollywood churns out pushes out rich films like this one hopefully it will be released in dvd soon,POSITIVE,Comedy

4407,8.0,14 March 2017,"November 2, 2011 (France)",i wanted to like this film before watching it is that a bad thing i read the basic story line and believed the movie would deliver an experience worth its time i only knew omar sy driss from director jean pierre juneauts micmacs where his knack was a proliferation of clichés that trailed off topic but ended in that contagious smile and accompanying laugh not much to work with not so here from the opening scene we know the unconventional inertia of driss as childlike stating the elephant in the room and his street smarts but without francois cluzets portrayal of phillipe the paraplegic we would have an immature caretaker with a drooling invalid with no heart or purpose we couldnt be laughing at our own self imposed limitations yes without phillipe being rich beyond belief wed have no action much like the brilliant the diving bell and the butterfly this story takes us away from our spoiled selves not just cinematically but spiritually here it is filled with its own hollywood clichés of dance scene car chase and feel goodness but that doesnt distract from the plot as much as it could have in a ssell out studio requirement there is personal acceptance over stereotypical forced growth experiences and makes for a good film,POSITIVE,Comedy
4408,1.0,25 March 2015,"November 2, 2011 (France)",rating the intouchables is a sweet french comedy drama all about a disabled man and his carer it is a tale of not only happiness but life affirming thoughts and actions and one film you mustnt miss it is sweet and very emotional but can then change into a kind of vicious emotion attacking your very emotion but by the end you come out thinking nice thoughts and you really do feel something for all involved now it isnt that this is something completely new a revolutionary new thought process in film we have seen films like this before the thing is that this movie is hilarious as well as interesting and all together it just breathes brilliance and fun the funniest character has to be drissbrilliantly played by omar sy who is not only hilariously funny also holds a deep side which can really draw you into him in general the movie is all round acted well not only omar sy puts in a good performance francois cluzet is great as the disabled character phillipe and members such as anne le ny and audrey fleurot add to the beautiful portrayals i think as i said before you can really connect with the people in this and they feel like real peopleit is to be fair based on a true story but they really feel similar even if stinking rich some of them the direction is beautifully done by olivier nakache and eric toledano who both seem to skilfully deal with the matter and make it feel so normal and also of course humorous along with the direction the cinematography is done well too and the shots used are not only perfect but add to the atmosphere the scenes are trying to get across the true gem of this movie and the true heart and soul is the script written by the two directors nakache and toledano seem to bring in a lovely thought process and make this a movie containing loud laughs and then down to maybe even near tears the script is the best thing about this and i felt that more nominations could have been given to it for that maybe even international awards that werent just for foreign film all that saying it can be said this has been done before now i explained what i thought but some may feel this is too similar to the kind of feel sorry for them story this really does have another point is the partly cringe thing that is a white millionaire and his poor black carer it just feels too much like oh hey lets make it like the poor guy can change and so can the rich guy and lets make them different races it kind of annoyed me and although it works well in the end it could have just been anyone and still been interesting this movie really does represent french cinema at its best and i dare say it makes you want to see more with its quick wit and well time and length minutes this is really a movie i couldnt recommend more to those who feel maybe they need to see film that really talks about true life this is one and although most of us will not experience anything in this you still feel like your in the characters skins anyway overall i felt it was brilliant just gloriously wonderful not perfect by a little way but still a movie all should see,POSITIVE,Comedy

4425,9.0,26 December 2013,"November 2, 2011 (France)",this movie was the best i have seen in it was so good because it was real versus fake within the field of psychiatry the act of giving medications to a seriously mentally ill individual there is usually little room for psychotic behaviour symptoms for example in the film the caregiver takes a certain number of risks that to me borders on psychotic behavior namely driving down highways at high speed zigzagging in and out of cars at high speed experimenting on his patient and stealing all of these symptoms could also be experienced as criminal through the lens of a police officer but this movie was more then its details it was a movie about a connection pure and simple these two grown men connected with each other one way or another it was real bond that they formed and this bond was unconditional no matter what the other one would do it would be forgiven the filmmaker could bring to the screen a feeling that is deep and pure that is what makes his film so special,POSITIVE,Comedy

4432,8.0,5 October 2014,"November 2, 2011 (France)",what i will write is not a review of the film but rather my feelings about it i think that a critics judgment although in most cases accurate is often clouded by ego and limited appreciation towards the human side of the movie and more towards the aesthetic value of it and the notions of motion picture art and science so what if its a modern version of driving miss daisy thats not the point of the movie when one lets go of all these distractions and the film works its magic the human feeling it exerts on the viewer is incredible also i didnt get the nonsense about the racial stereotypes in their shallow selves the critics especially the american ones paid too much attention to these alleged signals of race stereotypes i for one didnt think once about it and i was shocked to read that the movie contained racial stereotypes i like to read reviews after watching a movie to avoid being influenced furthermore the instances where the film tackles cultural differences not the plot of the movie albeit unfortunately are not necessarily stereotypes but a reality for many people of different cultures and ethnicity even in america as much as american critics hate to admit it so therefore if you havent seen this movie yet let go and immerse yourself in a touching and very human experience and dont be prejudiced about it and you will agree that this is a case where critics get it spectacularly wrong,POSITIVE,Comedy

4458,1.0,31 March 2020,"November 2, 2011 (France)",throughout the movie there is no grand theme of life and death and no final cry for help from a dying man just one theme that is respect too many people in this world are hurting others with their selfrighteous good will their sympathy and compassion seemingly is a good will but actually become a harm in the world there are many people that may have physical defects strange ideas and so on but in any case everyone is a free human being with an independent personality ordinary treatment and accepting different should be the best relationship between people,NEGATIVE,Comedy
4459,1.0,17 November 2019,"November 2, 2011 (France)",this movie shows life of two peoples of different backgrounds and how sens of humor helps to change your opinion about person that made not the best first impresion on you,POSITIVE,Comedy
4460,1.0,26 September 2015,"November 2, 2011 (France)",so i will go with the flow of the others and say that this is really a wonderful and touching movie i guess it just adds to it that it is based on the true story however i will not agree that this is the best french movie as it is certainly not le fabuleux destin damelie poulain is the top french movie for me i think that the movie has to thank its high score to the brilliant and utterly convincing acting of omar his acting and presence really are believable and you feel connection to him and to the millionaire through him of course the story itself has the universal appeal of compassion understanding struggle and faith i liked the part that touches on art euros for a painting with a red dot on canvas and berlin gallery new artist painting clever yes this is a clever movie no wonder it gets high scores although it is set in paris somehow i think it would have been better if there were more scenes with the city itself nine from me,POSITIVE,Comedy
4461,1.0,27 July 2023,"November 2, 2011 (France)",ive known of this movie for a long time but never got around to watching it the story didnt appeal to me as i am not a fan of dramas and even though i am francophone i rarely watch movies that are not in english but after watching a few scenes on youtube i decided to give it a shot and i was blown away the story itself is nothing special on paper rich white man meets poor black man poor black man helps rich white man and they become friends despite their differences what makes this movie special is three factors acting chemistry and subtlety acting is selfexplanatory both omar sy and françois cluzet are fantastic in their respective roles omar sy especially just radiates off the screen and delivers a fantastic performance he is kind but not a pushover he is strong and will use force but only up to a certain degree he has flaws but he is extremely likeable as for françois cluzet he doesnt make the mistake of falling into the trap of being either too angry too reclusive or trying to lay in on to gather pity this is also true of their chemistry on screen you truly believe these two men are becoming close friends and that relationship grows before our very eyes this movie wouldnt work without that chemistry and its what drives the plot forward if you just read this screenplay it wouldnt really be as effective the casting is on point and omar and françois are fantastic together subtlety is a big strength of this movie never does it try to make you feel bad for philippe or driss we are shown their pain philippe of losing his wife and losing his ability to move and driss of being an immigrant in a foreign land with a large family and a strained relationship with his adoptive mother the relationship between philippe and driss also grows slowly theres not one single moment where everything changes the love these two men have for each other feels earned and driss eventual move out is not a big blowup its just a small human moment where circumstances change the score is not overused the direction is not heavy handed and it helps the movies message feel more realistic the movie is clearly better if you understand french but i think even with subtitles its worth a watch,POSITIVE,Comedy
4462,1.0,28 April 2017,"November 2, 2011 (France)",this is one of my favorite movies and by far the best european film i have seen and i have seen a lot of movies i am very doubtful towards comedies and they fail times out of ten if you want to see a touching movie with a great moral perspective this is your movie i really love the challenging topic and the versatile humor in this film i have to be honest i did not know anything about this movie and the cast before i watched it the actors really nailed their performances i always refuse to give a because who am i to say that some movie is perfect this is suitable to everyone and i always recommend this movie to all regardless viewers age or preferences,POSITIVE,Comedy
4463,1.0,12 March 2014,"November 2, 2011 (France)",if mainstream cinema leaves you soulless see this film if you have a modicum of intelligence see this film if you like great acting and directing see this film if you like great writing and editing see this film if you have an interest in a comic situations see this film if you are a sad person see this film ultimately its a fairly predictable film but the familiar beats and tropes do little to detract from the omar sy and françois cluzets outstanding performances nor the movies large heart its a crowd pleaser very funny at times and a rousing testament to the transformative power a single friendship my only real quibble with the intouchables is that the prologue scene at the end of the film showing the two real people upon whom the film is based has a funny way of stealing some of the affection i felt for the honest depictions of the fictional characters,POSITIVE,Comedy
4464,1.0,19 April 2020,"November 2, 2011 (France)",this is one of the best french movies i have watched so lit was simply perfect and drawn from a real life story it restored my faith in humanity,POSITIVE,Comedy

4466,1.0,5 June 2020,"November 2, 2011 (France)",after watching the movie i often wonder if too much socalled education has brought us a lot of restraints these concepts from various classes levels resumes and environments are cagedlike reeds with others the mud of thinking dancing with the fragrance of selfconfidence and freedom we can only overcome our environment on our own there is no socalled pros and cons,NEGATIVE,Comedy
4467,1.0,25 July 2017,"November 2, 2011 (France)",the ability of this movie to be simple is impressive the comic vein also used is a factor that deserves to be highlighted at no time does the film want to move us shake us and move us dramatic situations alone fill the film with scenes that contain a sharper emotional appeal and even being a comedy we never forget that behind every characters laughter there is always an unhealed wound,POSITIVE,Comedy
4468,8.0,9 February 2020,"November 2, 2011 (France)",every time someone ask what to watch on netflix this is the first movie i recommend its funny and touching the actors are very good they honor the real story,POSITIVE,Comedy
4469,1.0,4 August 2019,"November 2, 2011 (France)",this movie is a modern day phenemenon spawning multiple remakes in a very short amount of time just last year the upside hit theaters it is interesting because i dont really think this film is anything super special its competent and enjoyable but nothing that truly impresses the two lead characters of the film played by françois cluzet and omar sy have a interesting chemistry between them and it is well acted but the film suffers from having a mega rich person as the lead character there are tons of people who have terribly crippling physical ailments that are also poor that dont have the resources to have anything in the world they wish that would be much more interesting stories the only poverty and struggling we see through the film is sys character but it is grossly underused instead having him live the high life for the majority of the film the film also tends to shy away from the hard hitting depression that afflicts physically disabled people even looking at the real life person the film was based off of would show that he attempted suicide by wrapping and oxygen tube around his neck i feel like it is important to illustrate these emotions and feelings more effectively in films like these despite all this there are some really funny moments and a real genuine charm from the leads to be found sy has a better performance than anyome else in the film but i would say all parties do a good job the dancing scene later on in the film is incredibly endearing and the soundtrack of the film is a blast,POSITIVE,Comedy
4470,8.0,19 January 2022,"November 2, 2011 (France)",i watched the film one plus one many times and still when i accidentally get on it i still stop how is it possible to make a film on such a sad subject with so much humor for me this is almost a masterpiece the film is also based on real events and this is always at least catchy film genre drama comedy what is the movie about a wealthy aristocrat named philippe francois cluzet is confined to a wheelchair after an accident it is difficult for him to find a person whom he would like to see next to him but nevertheless such a person was found it turned out to be a young man a black driss omar sy although he was not going to work much nevertheless they agree on mutually beneficial terms to try to pass the time together despite the fact that phillip is paralyzed driss manages to bring a breath of fresh air into his life with a dose of adventure and humor an excellent film about the struggle for life the actors are just amazing i always enjoy watching this movie if you havent watched it yet i highly recommend it it will not leave anyone indifferent more films like this pass the time with this movie as well,POSITIVE,Comedy
4471,9.0,19 January 2022,"November 2, 2011 (France)",the strongest movie of all i have seen and the point is that the authors of the film managed to make a wonderful and kind movie about the friendship of two men friendship which took place due to the fact that one had no benefit and the second nurse looking after him due to the fact that he was not able to move and ensure herself and here one of them accidentally falls on the interview and the second as an experiment or due to interest hires to see how it will be and what will come of it and it comes out quite a serious and friendly attitude between different estates and various cultures which can be combined not only by a disease but also the desire for life freedom and love the most important thing is that the film is raised on real events of course it is changed and the characters are reworked but the fact remains a fact well that the director managed to make an interesting movie actors play good and strong roles and scenarios to saturate the film by humor and human feelings,POSITIVE,Comedy
4472,9.0,18 April 2020,"November 2, 2011 (France)",this film tells the audience that when the audience is restricted by the body and cannot control the body it becomes a prisoner for the audience the audience can still keep a clear head and have a flashing mind,POSITIVE,Comedy

4474,9.0,12 March 2024,"November 2, 2011 (France)",a very multifaceted film and at the same time it shows how two different people can become close to each other despite their different statuses in life in addition the film shows us how the lives of the main characters can change into one one of the main characters is too correct in life the second is a completely opposite personality also negligence in work led to the fact that the main character realized that there was no pity for him thereby he realized that this brought him back a little to normal life in conclusion i want to say that the acting was at the highest level i would have watched a continuation of this story and its a pity that grimas and odysseus were not back in,POSITIVE,Comedy
4475,1.0,18 April 2021,"November 2, 2011 (France)",i cant say enough good things about this film was flicking through netflix this afternoon and found this gem wonderful movie for a sunday afternoon or any day of the week i recently watched omar sy in lupin and he was fantastic in that but this he is sublime so charming and funny and the actor who plays his quadraplegic boss is also excellent i loved it all of it every single actor involved massive kudos,POSITIVE,Comedy
4476,1.0,18 November 2017,"November 2, 2011 (France)",the intouchables is a french movie that includes both comedy and drama i cant describe it in words so i highly recommend you to watch this work of art which shows us that there are still people with a wonderful soul nowadays the plot is inspired by a real story francois cluzet plays the role of philippe a rich man who paralyzed after an accident philippe hires a young african man named driss played by omar sy who only wanted a signature not a job so he can receive his unemployment benefit philippe offered to the young man a period to gain experience helping him after that driss can decide if he wanted to stay with philippe or not ill let you discover what decision driss took but i can say that their lives have changed completely the movie directed by oliver nakache and eric toledano has an impressive soundtrack made by ludovico einaudi which fits perfectly with the action and the scenes to be honest i didnt expect to like it but now i think its the kind of movie that goes right to your soul full of humanity and emotion i enjoyed every minute of this even if the real story isnt the happiest i was also impressed by the friendship between two people from different worlds countries who have totally different behavior it is like an antidote against sadness and negative feelings of our lives i found on the internetimdb that of the profits from the movie were donated to an association which creates living spaces for disabled people this left me speechless in the end i want to mention that the most important thing is to enjoy your life and to be happy for all the little things its all that matters thank you,POSITIVE,Comedy

4479,1.0,20 November 2013,"November 2, 2011 (France)",its been a while since i have had such a good laugh quickly followed by tears when watching a film the last one was probably the intouchables however i found to be a much more emotionally evocative and explored difficult topics ie racism socioeconomic strata gangs disability sex parenting loyalty and acceptance with eloquence not to mention the soundtrack which was diverse including both classicalpiano solos and r b but exceptional omar sy a little known actor showed impressive acting talent on par with francois cluzet the two had wonderful on screen chemistry any lesser performance of drisser could have easily made him a hateful character somehow despite the harsh things driss says and his seemingly unempathetic actions brazenly making his way into the interview and demanding a signature refusing to compromise for his gracious employer or any of his coworkers aggressively pursuing magalie making almost offensive passes pouring hot water over over fascinated to see that philippe cannot feel it always acting like the tough guy and refusing to show any kindness or weakness his carelessness almost causing serious harm to philippe a few times omar sy manages to make driss quite the opposite of course we soon learn that despite the act he tries to put on he has a very kind heart this is exemplified in so many indescribable gestures allowances and gestures throughout the latter part of the film my favorite being the final scene of course where he has set up a date for philippe to meet eleanor philippe and eleonore had been carrying on with an epistolary relationship for over six months but philippe had to that point been understandably too afraid of rejection to reveal his true physical state and situation the other more minor characters are almost all played wonderfully as well yvonne the awkward coworker magalie philippes secretary and drisss love interest drisss motheraunt and his other family members even philippes brother and the caretaker who replaces driss the impressive thing is that this film manages to not only be funny but witty and there is a significant difference references to popular culture art music and current events obama hitler bieber michelangelo the turtle goya dali opera mozart schubert earth wind fire etc are welcomed and educated usually given in the context of witty banter the cinematography especially on the weekend paragliding adventure and the closing scene by the cabourg seaside is extraordinary the use of angles and mise en scene is great throughout even in the opening scene of the car chase in the maserati in the end the title really says it all it should really be named the untouchables as intouchable is french for untouchable this is a story about disability racism and all those other difficultto discuss topics but on a deeper level it is about friendship love and loyalty throughout most of the film nobody understands why philippe has hired such an unqualified individual seeing driss as a true outsider the two of them however in their own way dont give a damn about what anyone else thinks through their friendship they teach each other things learning and enriching each others lives bringing out the best in each other like any great friendship they have many inside things nobody else would really understand illustrated in numerous favorite scenes like the erogenous zones of the ear drisss comments regarding the audacity of the opera drisss initial lack of appreciation for art but then creating a masterpiece of sorts nice knowing you philippe giving driss a difficult time during their flight where can you find a tetraplegic where you left him the endearing way in which driss dances to earth wind fire and encourages other guests to do the same turning philippes usually sad affair of a birthday party into a fun one etc etc etc in this way their unlikely friendship is untouchable individually of course they are also separately untouchable driss with his blunt hardened approach to life and others and philippe quite literally being a quadriplegic notably in regards to his birthday party he mentions how everyone acts like they care but the sincerity is questionable for these reasons sadly most of society treats them as untouchable individuals of a lower class that this film is based on a true story makes it that much more extraordinary i realize some of the facts were misrepresented but that is why it is based on and not a true biography i intend to locate a copy of philippe pozzo di borgos a second wind andor abdel sellous driss you changed my life when i can for me the idea that this film was predictable means nothing the art of great cinema is taking a story predictable or not and illustrating it in such a way that viewers fall in love with the characters and walk away feeling differently than when they began inspired to think differently act differently the intouchables did this without a doubt,POSITIVE,Comedy
4480,1.0,25 November 2017,"November 2, 2011 (France)",i saw this movie many times on imdb but somehow i didnt want to watch it one day my colleague from work made me a list of movies that i should watch in a lifetime i was tired of all the new superheros movies and i wanted some good movies this was the first one from the list and it made me realize how many wonderful stories are out there that we need to see the movie is amazing,POSITIVE,Comedy
4481,1.0,15 January 2014,"November 2, 2011 (France)",at first i thought that this movie is just another regular drama movie boy was i wrong the movie is about a quadriplegic that looks for a personal assistant which will take care of him feed him bathe him and everything else thats needed after an assistant audition he chooses a rather foolish man to care for him after a while the main message of the movie kicks in and shows us what does true friendship mean and what is really the stuff that we should give our attention to in our lives if you love a pleasant positive lively movie that really carries a nice message with itself then this movie is what youre looking for,POSITIVE,Comedy
4482,1.0,28 August 2016,"November 2, 2011 (France)",the start of it lord almighty its like it ties you to the main characters without actually explaining them to you i first saw this movie just last night and i had to ask myself maybe it was so good because of the two glasses of wine that i just had but no liquor can do what this movie did to summarize imagine sitting on a bench in a park and watching as two people grow to be friends nothing is forced onto them nothing is disrupting them and sure they have their differences even coming from two separate worlds entirely but you have the chance to watch what true friendship is based upon without even realizing this is a movie its like sneaking in a theater and watching a ballet dancer exercising with no public i say that i hate this movie for what it made me feel at first it was happiness even melancholy seeing the characters growing to like each other but then it was jealousy because something like this doesnt happen too often superbe,POSITIVE,Comedy
4483,1.0,13 October 2016,"November 2, 2011 (France)",one of the best movies i have ever seen it balances perfectly between comedy and drama and despite the tough subject it manages to make the whole story optimistic the performances from the two main actors are brillianttheir expressions alone are priceless music is ideal and enriches many scenes of the movie the jokes are to the point and hilarious and thats what makes this film stand out from others with similar drama subjects the fact that it is inspired by a true story makes it even better as you appreciate the directors point of view you can cry you can laugh you can reflect on your life you can stay speechlessyou just have to watch this,POSITIVE,Comedy

4485,1.0,19 January 2022,"November 2, 2011 (France)",the old saying goes the best stories are the stories written by life itself the directing duo of olivier nakasha and eric toledano managed to correctly tell a tragicomedy based on the real story of a poor young arab from the french ghetto and a paralyzed businessman whom fate linked with an unexpected friendship despite the fact that in reality they are not connected by anything be it social status or views on understanding life the charming tragicomedy the untouchables first of all has a heart and a mind completely free from cliches about showing compassion to the disabled and other incapacitated people the film correctly allows them in the person of philip to feel like almost fullfledged people like everyone else conveying all this in a humorous form often bordering on disarming frankness and this happens on the screen thanks primarily to the fascinating atmosphere created by the excellent duet of omar saya who seems to have a fresh joke in his pocket and francois cluzet who masterfully makes this film a success only through facial expressions and voice in addition the film also touches in passing on other topics that still raise many questions in french society whether it is unemployment among emigrants or child crime in between which having the opportunity to also criticize contemporary art which in of its cases borders on a simple childish daub but being highly appreciated by critics is given out as something brilliant having finally created a lifeaffirming witty funny and charming explosion of a mixture of drama and comedy in the most effective proportions untouchables has become almost an ideal film for any audience and certainly one of the best french films of,POSITIVE,Comedy
4486,8.0,16 July 2021,"November 2, 2011 (France)",like critics love to say a tour de force huge performances and a film that does everything right comedy drama life wow,POSITIVE,Comedy
4487,1.0,25 July 2016,"November 2, 2011 (France)",this is an amazing movie i think the most important thing to impress viewers in this movie is the sound this is french movie so the situation is paris and of course people speak french most japanese including me are not familiar with french so french characters speak in this movie is a part of the elements which impress us strong it sounds like music and it tells us something which we can understand just because of we dont know french in addition actors facial expression is also remarkable thing for me there are some scenes which have no dialog only back music in those scene characters facial expression tells us a lot of things and i think the music in this movie is wonderful the beautiful music makes us think about many things in each situation sound elements tells us its story so quietly but strongly,POSITIVE,Comedy

4493,8.0,2 September 2016,"November 2, 2011 (France)",at the advice of a friend and with a boring sounding plotline i was delightfully surprised from start to finish i never would have thought at film about a quadriplegic man forming a friendship with an unusual caretaker of sorts would remind me of the beauty of foreign cinema it is nuanced witty unpredictable and true artisticcreative expression it is also quite humorous adding lightness and hope to the situation at hand what the characters seem to lack in terms of life circumstances is certainly made up for and carefully shown in a new and inspiring light it left me thinking about how different we all are on the inside and within relative contexts absolutely a gem of a film one of the best ive ever seen,POSITIVE,Comedy
4494,8.0,8 November 2016,"November 2, 2011 (France)",i havent ever seen the movie so naive and real like this nothing is fake in this movie and this makes it different from others i think its the best comedy ever and i think even from imdb is underrated for this movie the fact that the movie was based on true story and real people made it great the actors and all cast crew worked very well even brilliant so i can watch this movie again and again this is one of most unique beautiful and honest friendship ever committed to film oscarworthy movie and its the most disappointment of the year that movie didnt get it i think hollywood should learn how to make movies like that,POSITIVE,Comedy

4528,9.0,19 January 2022,"November 2, 2011 (France)",the film has not yet had time to die off at the global box office and the americans are already preparing their remake because having been released in only eleven countries the picture of olivier nakash and eric toledano has already collected million no one can say exactly what exactly served as the box office success of an ordinary european film which is far from such an americanized concept as a blockbuster nevertheless this dark horse of the box office deserves at least respect because it is very difficult even for hollywood majors to raise such money around the world without attracting stars of the first magnitude and the lack of a powerful advertising campaign works in the genre of dramatic comedy showing the story of friendship of people from different social strata in short a paralyzed french businessman francois cluzet by chance he offers a job as a nurse to an inveterate parasite and just a former prisoner omar si in order to diversify his life a little and at the same time pull a morally degraded person out of the social pit all this is great of course and sometimes even instructive but for some reason the authors have not been able to move away from those boring stereotypes that steadily pass from year to year from the very beginning the creators draw a racial line between the main characters so that the viewer god forbid does not feel excessive originality for example a rich gentleman is necessarily a whitefaced gentleman and a careless boor is of course a black man and such cliches are accompanied throughout the film giving exactly the same informative characteristic that hollywood screenwriters gave twenty years ago when they tried to convey the entire culture of russia according to several outdated criteria starting with nesting dolls and felt boots and ending with drunken bears playing on the balalaika olivier nakash and eric toledano took too onion material well in the sense that the story itself about a paralyzed person is able to evoke emotions even in the most unflappable moviegoer so the creators simply had no right to look for slack in the viewer instead of proving the autonomy of their story the directors decided to play on the audiences feelings by assuming the functions of the main conductors then including touching music in the relevant episodes then overly dramatizing once again hinting to us what kind of complex material they selected for the film adaptation there have already been a lot of similar films so its hard to answer what makes stand out from the others because by and large we were shown another tearful film where the creators tried to put increased pressure on the audience forcing them to perceive events with their hearts and not with a clear coldblooded mind intouchables is an overcooked french dish the recipe of which is not innovative the picture is not so bad as to smash it to smithereens but it is not so good as to give it carte blanche in the form of leading positions in all kinds of audience ratings out of,POSITIVE,Comedy

4530,9.0,28 October 2014,"November 2, 2011 (France)",this film caught my eye for a couple of reasons first of all the exceptional viewer ratings and then because of the actors involved francois cluzet and audrey fleurot bitlyitymg too bad hers is such a secondary role but watching the film what was an unexpected surprise was the outstanding performance of omar sy he just absolutely steals the movie its one of the best performances and films youll see anytime this year any year it was no fluke it became the second highest grossing box office french film of all time and sy receiving the césar award for best actor for his role there are many reasons why we all enjoy watching movies but as most have shown by their high praise of this film you need go no further than these minutes,POSITIVE,Comedy

4579,1.0,2 November 2022,"November 2, 2011 (France)",untouchable intouchables i was very pleasantly surprised by how much i enjoyed this film i tend to steer clear of films with illnesses disabilities and so on because of their usually sad undertones and often overtones but this biopic story was a pure delight about a fantastic bond between a wealthy paraplegic classical music enthusiast and a random man from the street that he employed to take care of him although there have been remakes of it including the american the upside starring brian cranston i have been repeatedly told to watch this original french version it also featured on two of the top film lists that i refer to im glad i did actually watch the original because it seemed to have a charm about it that i felt would be lost if it was based in another country certain elements and quirks that could only be found in france the paraplegic philippe was like a parisian dustin hoffman and was equally as capable of delivering a warm and charismatic yet humorous performance that was engaging and i found relatable too his isolation and social anxieties were familiar to me and i felt for him in that respect more than any pity i might have had for his other medical situation because they didnt labour that point which was refreshing the carer character of driss was brilliantly inappropriate i loved the fact that philippe gave him a chance because he wanted someone genuine to look after him and thats what he got the friendship that blossomed between them was great fun to watch and driss way of dealing with things was brilliantly real he also delivered some cracking laugh out loud moments i actually think though that the majority of the humour was what i could expect from a day to day conversation with my friends and family so i wouldnt call it a comedy as such it certainly didnt seem to be played for laughs at every opportunity but delivered a script that was full of the humour of every day moments instead it bears a definite similarity to the scent of a woman in which chris odonnell goes to work for a blind al pacino and learns about himself as much as the care of a sightless man and that was a good film but i think that untouchable will stick with me a lot longer i also felt that the soundtrack of this film was not only appropriate but also beautiful it fit perfectly with the different men in the lead roles and really helped to show their differences and show the environments that they found themselves in i can see why it was remade in america india and argentina because id want to tell the story again too and i might be tempted to watch the u s version purely for comparison but i think those that have said to watch this one and with subtitles not dubbed would be right in their adamance that this was the best one,POSITIVE,Comedy

4581,9.0,19 January 2022,"November 2, 2011 (France)",the most powerful movie of the beginning of this year or the end of the last is not the point and the bottom line is that the authors of the film managed to make a wonderful and kind movie about the friendship of two men a friendship that came about because one of them had no allowance and the second nurse had to look after him because he was unable to move and provide for himself and then one of them accidentally gets into an interview and the second as an experiment or out of interest hires him to see how it will be and what will come of it and it turns out quite a serious and friendly relationship between different classes and different cultures which can be united not only by an illness but also by the desire for life freedom and love,POSITIVE,Comedy

4608,8.0,18 August 2018,"November 2, 2011 (France)",the intouchables story could be familiar to anybody even to those who havent seen a lot of movies almost every phase and every point in this movie is so conventional and unoriginal however this movie is very remarkable thats because it surpasses all the feelgood movies of its kind needless to mention the highclass direction from olivier nakache and eric toledano that made this movie exceptional thanks to this superb direction the intouchables delivers broad laughs and tugs at the heartstrings without delving too deep or present anything new sometimes the movie becomes so hilarious and other times you couldnt help shedding some tears often of joy the best thing about this movie that it kept its lighter tone throughout its runtime the tonal shift when the movie moves from its second to its third act wasnt smooth though that being said you will never find any movie of this kind that has half its magical moments the friendship between philippe and driss is simply unparalleled thats of course due to the insanely magnetic chemistry between omar sy and françois cluzet i bet you can find such chemistry in any other movie of the same kind the soundtrack is perfectly utilized to match the movies bright tone and the cinematography is beautiful but what i think made the movie looks spectacular is its fancy production design the third act is definitely a bit rushed but i feel like the ending more than makes up for it this ending could be the sweetest and most charming ending ever you couldnt decide if you should cry or laugh but dont worry because you would do both,POSITIVE,Comedy

4613,8.0,3 March 2013,"November 2, 2011 (France)",i dont know about you but a nearly hour french film about a former thief and a quadriplegic doesnt seem like it would be that funny surprisingly it is omar sy and francois cluzet have fantastic chemistry and make a great duo that you actually care about the soundtrack is solid with danceable tunes from earth wind and fire one of driss favorite bands as well as classical music from bach and mozart philippes preference if you prefer character driven pictures over special effects extravaganzas youll want to check out the intouchables cinemajudgementday review was of or roughly an if i could out of here,POSITIVE,Comedy
4614,1.0,3 December 2023,"November 2, 2011 (France)",normally i am not the person to be impressed by overly sugary saccharine or light films i think they can be corny formulaic and trite affairs which is probably why i felt pleasantly surprised when i viewed the intouchables there should be no qualms that this films intention is first and foremost to make its audience laugh the script is impeccably witty and very funny aided by marvellous performances by omar sy and francois cluzet sy and cluzet are a remarkable pairing for they enjoy an unabashedly enjoyable sometimes even riotously funny dynamic with each other this is also to teh screenplays credit philippe is written as a character stripped of almost all pleasures in his life which lends well for him to adopt a reckless attitude or at least one reckless by french aristocratic standards towards life he is hence a perfect match for the often crude and profane driss he is paralysed waist down so he doesnt care if driss talks to him at the opera or insults or embarrasses his family members this lends itself to wonderfully hilarious situations in the film always maintaining a taut pace and making thetwo hour duration an easy engrossing and engaging watch but i doubt the film would score so highly if it were merely an overt comedy indeed what makes the intouchables a great rather than a good film is its emotionally resonance driss and philippe come from entirely disparate walks of life and the director does not shy away from portraying both the decrepit dirty blocks of ugly public housing and the lush refined surroundings of philippes home like what good friends do driss and philippe helps each other with achieving self fulfilment and it is interesting that this help rendered to each other originates not only from their common humanity but also from their different backgrounds philippe helps driss in discovering his talent for abstract art and even manages to help him sell his painting through his own wealthy connections of course meanwhile philippe not only lacks the bravery and initiative to pursue elenor but also has trouble with his daughter driss with his more direct and tougher personality helps with encouraging philippe to be more direct both in disciplining his daughter and with chasing elenor of course part of the films appeal is that it balances drama and comedy deftly the film never feels overly saccharine or overly sentimental instead it offers a measured blend of both this is what makes the intouchables a sublimely uplifting yet hilarious watch,POSITIVE,Comedy

4695,4.66,25 December 2014,"November 2, 2011 (France)",this french farce was given an unfortunate title but that seem to me to be the only thing wrong with this entertaining wellacted farce of an energetic character who happens to be black positively affecting the life of a handicapped white man who happens to be sickeningly wealthy its a terrible mistake to look at this picture as an unfortunate stereotype of racial relations as some professional critics have done i wonder what would be said if the black character was cast as arabic which was the actual situation on which the story is based and wouldnt it be peculiar to see an arab participating in some of the antics that mr sy the wonderful actor from senegal performs his performance is outstanding and one of the best comedic performances of the year there is talk of remaking this in english please dont do that,POSITIVE,Comedy

4700,4.66,13 October 2012,"November 2, 2011 (France)",while not receiving as much praise as i had hoped a quick coup doeil of critiques concede its appeal despite a few exceptions who shall heretofore be referred to as les détesteurs haters id like to thank les détesteurs for validating the purpose of this site high concept doesnt automatically mean this movie sucks it just seems that way because weve been served dreck so we think looking to europe particularly france led by les détesteurs and expecting to be served high art will replace those iq points lost by domestic offerings the real snobs are the ones who scoff at france revealing her quotidian side you know the masses that in actuality pay to see the high concept dreck that we serve them now is that juste is that american it was an englishman that coined the phrase imitation is the sincerest form of flattery we were not ashamed to flatter him or his country by imitating appropriating their language i suggest we allow ourselves to be flattered at their appropriation of our culture refusing would only further confirm their suspicions of how uptight we are beginning with the r rating the story concerns a stereotypical white guy uptight hyperrich insufferable man of privilege who happens to be a paraplegic françois cluzet as is normal in such a circumstance he requires constant care the movie begins with him interviewing prospects note to les détesteurs hes does not attend a slave auction among the candidates is a stereotypical black guy tall muscular bald lives in the projects in trouble with the law ill at ease with the finer things in life omar sy détesteurs did you notice that hes really black like direct from africa black your castings way off if you cant suss out the story from here you probably havent seen trading places driving miss daisy hours etc those were all good entertaining movies based on the same cliché the critics log line would be black man helps white man become better person however i would bet that you wont be able to predict everything it is indeed a french movie so some ambiguity is required for those with psychic cinematic gifts who do guess everything so what predictability is not a bad thing being predictably bad is a bad thing the movies mentioned in the previous paragraph were all both predictable and enjoyable instead of calling omar sys character an uncle tom ensuring a google legacy forever linking him with that slur wouldnt it be great if instead this film launched him as an international superstar its certainly time for a new face especially a nonwhite nonanglo one while i think jean dujardin will have a successful international career i dont think jamel debouzze or gad elmelah two established comedic stars in france trying to cross over have the same comic talent or charisma and his english is better before i rest my case let me remind you of the most recent francophone superstar jean claude van damme finally i would like to explain the cryptic title françois cluzot has been a critically acclaimed actor for many years and hopefully is recognizable to french movie fans omar sy became famous in france on sketch comedy tv shows like his compatriot firsteverfrench best actor oscar winner jean dujardin but the real star of this movie is us the us the united states not our biracial kumbaya movies not our appropriated high concepts and clichés the elements that bonds these two men is music a specific genre of music born in america from an american group that epitomizes that genre like no other and eradicates any overtones of racism the recent tragic deaths of two of discos greatest artists donna summer and robin gibb retrained my perspective anyone who was lucky enough to be alive when disco dominated everything also remembers the death knells that chimed deafeningly as it was killing itself through overexposure for a brief time admitting you liked it was an invitation for ridicule now let me ask have you ever let alone recently been to a wedding a bar mitzvah a club where anyone requested quarterflash the alan parsons project or the little river band it was they who vanquished disco as we all know disco didnt die its call to dance has always been an affirmation of life so for a lifeaffirming feel good movie its only right to credit disco as the true star,POSITIVE,Comedy
4701,4.66,10 February 2015,"November 2, 2011 (France)",this is funny and touching about a rich disabled man in his château and his rowdy new caretaker from the projects but where wed expect pity and selfpity we get one man hanging out with another teasing like he would any friend sharing a spliff the real compassion of friendship as antidote instead of treating an incapacity nurturing a capacity not just dutifully picking up and massaging a broken body that cant be made whole again but doing these for a mind that can the film is rife with pairs of dual opposites rich and poor cultured and not genuine and not mind and body etiquette and humor duty and bond thinking and doing simple stacking opposites so that the modern mind stuck behind a facade of disappointing conventions from how to treat a patient to courting love will be freed by messy spontaneous action it recasts zorba where the overthinking intellectual learns a deeper wisdom from his employees unfettered love for life no less wistful in the end about redemption than a lachrymose oscar film on the subject neat as inspirational films go whole but this is deeper about a response to suffering and view that looks past it rather than just shedding beautiful tears before a deadend wall i always welcome the former and hows this for a french postcolonial view the white and black french in stereotyped symbiosis of mutual dependence the first as a gentle intellect perched ontop of a dessicated body surrounded with artifice and etiquette that fail to sooth the latter injecting him with goofy new vigor for life but of course to be stuck behind this intellectual cynicism that sees master and servant to dismiss the film on grounds such as these would be only more of that ailing western mind in desperate need to be invigorated with a film just like this,POSITIVE,Comedy

4703,4.66,25 December 2022,"November 2, 2011 (France)",the titular characters are what make the movie the visible chemistry of their friendship despite their sociocultural and intellectual differences is simply lovely the légérété with which the film progresses is so quintessential french furthermore the multiple thoughtful messages of this movietolerance towards the incapacitated not trying to be reduced to a social background are also notable as they are laudable i just think its marvelous that we live in a time where we can provide extensively to people with serious disabilities humanity still is befallen with imperfections but its trying the recurring piano theme is beautiful especially its use at the end is striking all in all this is another testimony of french cinemas timeless place in the world,POSITIVE,Comedy
4704,4.66,14 March 2014,"November 2, 2011 (France)",this film tells the story of a rich paraplegic man in paris who gives a chance to a man who was just released from prison intouchables is a really touching and inspirational story i really like the fact that both philippe and driss are so wildly different from each other but yet they can complement each other and make each other grow philippe is cultured but reserved while driss is playful and hedonistic i like the scenes where philippe is selling the painting by driss the scene in the opera and the final scene they complement each other so well and they both treasure each others friendship its a beautiful tale of mutual inspiration i love it,POSITIVE,Comedy
4705,4.66,19 January 2022,"November 2, 2011 (France)",is a movie that i watched at a very young age and then it seemed to me that this was just a film about friendship but recently reviewing this picture i noticed how simple things can make us happy we often monitor our problems without paying attention to others the film shows us as if from the outside what difficulties there are in life and that you always need to have a reliable friend behind you the film is very fascinating there are a lot of funny moments i would call this film a family one since it is very kind and carries a moral i rated the film out of after watching you start to think about what is really important in life,POSITIVE,Comedy

4708,4.66,14 August 2013,"November 2, 2011 (France)",pragmatic is the way griss an exconvict from parisian projects hired by super rich paraplegic phillipe as a caregiver describes himself and for me that one word captures the essence of the whole movie trough his eyes we see our world in a new and fresh way which is actually a simple pragmatic tell it how it is narrative the movie is a delightful version of the old fable about the stranger who comes to a new place and shows everyone how things really are not the way people are told them to be sort of polyanna story but here it is not a girl feeding you saccharine but street smart immigrant from senegal who tells us some unpleasant truths and delivers them as super funny commentaries on some of follies of modern western society what are those discoveries that griss helps us to see perhaps being a disabled person is hard but certainly it is better to be a rich disabled person than a poor one maybe the best way to act towards socially superior is to behave as there are no differences at all instead of our usual docility which only gives more power to already powerful and perhaps some modern art is really nothing more than overpriced crap where experts have integrity of used car salesmen who cheat confused public and be honest deep down we prefer pop to classical music but would not admit it because we dont want to be perceived as uncouth and look closely when movie pokes fun at the way we are taught to apply for a job according to scripted nailed into our heads set of questions and prepared answers griss with his honest chutzpah makes all other identical applicants look like a bunch of robots and phonies although telling truth all the time could be problematic but telling politically correct lies all the time so we all feel nice and comfy can leave western people not well prepared for setbacks phillipe knows that very well when he hires griss though money can buy the whole crew of helpers he needs something more than advanced but somewhat mechanical care to live a full life he needs somebody to treat him honestly pragmatically,POSITIVE,Comedy
