9.0,3 December 2022,"I have loved Tulsa King so far. I actually love everything Taylor Sheridan does so I knew this would be no different. This is fun crime show that knows exactly what it wants to be and you can tell the cast, led by Sylvester Stallone, are all having a blast making this. It's about a New York mafia boss named Dwight ""The General"" Manfredi (Stallone) who is released from prison after 25 years. He thinks he coming out to a hero's welcome but gets sent to Tulsa to run things instead. After not feeling the love from his gang like he feels he should he starts to build his own in Tulsa. Some of it may come off as a little silly but overall it's a really good show that's definitely worth watching. It's obviously doing well because it's already been renewed for a second season which is great news!"
9.0,28 November 2022,"I figured this would be an entertaining show. We've grown accustomed to think that anything with Stallone in it nowadays would be a comedy, and Tulsa King does feature good amount of humor. But Taylor Sheridan isn't going to create a simple parody of a mob story and using Stallone as a joke and punchline.

The show has promising depth, despite the light-hearted premise of a former big shot mobster forced to make a new start in a new city after a long prison sentence. Some comedy ensues as a New York mobster finds his way around Tulsa to establish his turf using his ""old world"" ways.

Characters are genuinely likable across the board. While it's not unusual to root for a ""bad"" guy as the protagonist, his directness and old world commonsense values appeal to those of us looking for something refreshing amidst today's social nonsense. Irony in the message is that it takes a thug who bows down to no one to smash through and expose the shallow social hypocrisy. This is the same formula that made Yellowstone such a success, and Sheridan knows this is what so many of us want.

Stallone gives an excellent performance. Before he became a caricature from his later roles that drove Rocky and Rambo franchises into the ground, his acting and screen presence created those iconic roles. It's good to see him back on screen in a role that seems perfect for him, and leverage some of that cheeky persona to add depth to his character and the show, rather than undermine it.

Overall, highly entertaining show that I look forward to, and an excellent addition to Paramount+ portfolio."
9.0,21 November 2022,"Sylvester Stallone absolutely kills it in Tulsa King! For Stallone to do a tv show you knew it had to be a good script and of course it would be with Taylor Sheridan as the created. Sheridan continues to hit home run after home run. He is the best thing going on tv right now with incredible shows like Yellowstone, 1883, Mayor of Kingstown, etc. And movies like Sicario, Hell or High Water and Wind River. Everything he touches turns to gold. Also, one of the other writers is Terence Winter who wrote shows like The Sopranos & Boardwalk Empire. I mean come on? There was no way this show was going to be bad with those two at the helm. It has everything you want in a good show...drama, violence, comedy, etc. Stallone plays a very likable tough guy to perfection."
9.0,14 November 2022,"I watched this out of curiosity, no high expectations, I was just surprised to see Stallone in a tv series. You feel the tension in the scenes, it also feels fairly realistic as far as the plot would demand it. Wouldn't say it's humorous but a couple funny scenes as a result of Dwight (Stallone) coming out of 25yr prison sentence and not fully integrated into the way the world works now; so I'm assuming the abrupt transition will offer some interesting hiccups for him down the line for us. I'm glad someone told him how to use an Uber, it was funny while it lasted.

It's a pretty smart script but not in a forcefully witty way which bodes well. Of course Stallone is a huge presence but the rest of the cast seem pretty good.

The show literally feels like you took gangsters written for a movie from the early 90's and just threw them into 2022, makes for a good blend of humor and violence.

I thought it was just going to be a throwaway show as some of stallion's recent movies are; mostly just leaning on his name and performances but Taylor Sheridan does a good job here with writing worthy of Stallone's performances. I think it's gonna be fun to watch macho Stallone building a criminal empire from scratch, middle of nowhere Tulsa. I love how it has this western oater feel to it at times while still being mafia. I think the show could end up going under the radar, then get buzz later on with people asking how they never caught on to it earlier, because I haven't seen that much advertisement from Paramount.

I went in with no high expectations, but if the premier episode is anything to go by this could be a really fun watch. If it keeps on like this, great, if it gets better that'll be fantastic. I'll add a rating after more episodes release and update if anything changes drastically about the show."
8.0,28 December 2022,"I've always liked Stallone, over the years, yes he's sequel addicted but has made some really enjoyable films scattering a few classics along the way. In Tulsa King could very well be his best work just from a acting perspective, he's just stone cold nailing the role of a mafia capo. The series itself has a interesting story, it's well written taking full advantage of the humor of a New York mobster in Tulsa Oklahoma without becoming silly at all, throw in a healthy dose of violence, good writing and dialogue, and a great cast of supporting actors and characters and they have a winner. Fun to watch, well worth a look."
9.0,20 November 2022,"Sylvester Stallone 's Rocky, old school, hard a$$ acting style fits this show perfectly. From narrating to cruising through Tulsa it just shows that this role is perfect for him. Also acting as a guy his age and style definitely helps to blend in perfectly. As for the show, the buil up in first two episode was great and moving pretty quickly. It will be interesting with coming towards the end of the season how good and how big twist they have prepared. In the meantime if you are Sly's fan you definitely have to give this show a chance, even if you're not, I would still recommend it for the sake of gangster shows."
9.0,26 November 2022,"I don't think any other actor could have played this role. Sly is bigger than the small screen and he's given the best lines in this show. I only saw the 1st ep on YT, I don't have Paramount, but if there's more being released on YT I would definitely see it.

His supporting cast is no-name, I didn't recognize any other actors. And filming in Tulsa gives the show ""flavor"" vs filming on a backlot in Hollywood. I think Stallone has reached his peak with the Creed movies and this TV show. Age does him well. Glad he's away from those action movies, which I think he outgrew. This is the fit for him."
6.0,13 November 2022,"Exactly what you're looking. Tulsa King delivers. Stallone hits the mark with a brooding no nonsense performance that blends humor and violence to near perfection.

The classic fish out of water scenario is well played. And the first episode does a great job at setting up what looks like a stellar cast. Right from the start the plot begins to weave together. Frankly I was pleasantly surprised.

We'll see how the season unfolds but so far it's a great change of pace from some other series debuts lately. There's no cgi to be sure. Just great characters, authentic dialogue, a smart story, and a first class cast."
8.0,23 November 2022,"The writing is good - Stallone's narration is well written. He's also good in this role. The show moves along and is entertaining. Problem is you have to believe that in today's world, someone would just show up to a town like Tulsa, start knocking people around and making demands and people would just fall in line and not call the police.

In reality, every incident in this show where he knocks someone around and gets what he wants wouldn't happen. Ever. The person would simply call the police, they'd come, see that he did in fact commit an assault, that's he's an ex con recently released from prison and he'd be in jail waiting a new trial.

But in this fantasy world from 1960 (that takes place today) he just makes demands and people does what he wants.

If you can accept that, you can enjoy the show."
6.0,4 December 2022,"Likeable and relatively deep characters, plausible plot, tolerable pacing are the driving forces behind this show. Stallone is good being the main protagonist, but I like Andrea Savage and her character a lot, very nice performance. I respected a lot that Stallone is not trying to look younger when his character Dwight honestly mentions his age and how it could affect his relationships with younger woman.

Cinematography and music are nothing to write home about, both are good enough to help keep the show entertaining, but not really adding value and not standing out. My review make the show look pretty average, yet I'm rating it at 8/10 because it is a solid entertainer, not a TV/ Cinema masterpiece or tour de force."
8.0,29 September 2024,"The first season was great, entertaining, fresh. Sure, some things were far-fetched, but okay I'll play ball - Sly cracks a joke here there, so all forgiven and forgotten.

The second season is hard to believe (even more so), full of family/girlfriend drama, and I just cannot help it bt laugh at their supposed toughness. I guess Sheridan was busy with other projects, lol.

Also, what is wrong with the wardrobe? They wear ridiculously silly suits and yet carry themselves like kings. Please, someone from Tulsa tell me this isn't how you dress over there:)

Don't get me wrong. This isn't your Netflix BS, it is entertaining. But it has flaws."
7.0,14 November 2022,"I really like this show . It's a bit unbelievable but mostly entertaining . The humour Stallone brings to the character ( of the writers ) evens out the bits that are absurd.

Stallone brings a nuanced performance of a recently released from prison monster. Who is given the opportunity to move to a south western state and earn for the bosses back home .

He makes the best of a situation he rather not be in .

A fish out of water no . A shark in a different ocean maybe more like it .

This looks like it's going to be a fantastic addition to a historical and legendary career of one of hollywoods greatest box office draws of all time .

Stallone is in his element and he delivers the goods ."
1.0,23 May 2023,"The series is off to a great start! At least I had to grin a lot during the first episode, because I found the realization good. Sylvester Stallone as Kapo is excellent, the role fits him perfectly. You can say that the series is not the reinvention of the wheel, but you have from episode to episode desire to look further. Not many series manage to do that in this day and age. Apart from Stallone, the other actors are also well cast. The acting level varies a lot, but that's not too bad. It is not a documentary 😉. Only the end of the season was a bit disappointing for me, I expected a bigger bang. Nevertheless, I look forward to the future seasons 🤗. I can recommend the series with a clear conscience, even if it gets ""only"" 7/10⭐ from me.

Overview of the individual episode rating: Episode 1 = 9/10⭐ Episode 2 = 7/10⭐ Episode 3 = 7/10⭐ Episode 4 = 7/10⭐ Episode 5 = 7/10⭐ Episode 6 = 7/10⭐ Episode 7 = 6/10⭐ Episode 8 = 7/10⭐ Episode 9 = 7/10⭐"
9.0,4 May 2024,"I'm a big fan of mafia shows/movies and after watching Sopranos for the third or fourth time, I looked for something somewhat similar and was suggested Tulsa King by Google and many positive reviews.

Stallone is not believable as a mob boss and the general vibe of the show feels cheesy. The first episode also makes it clear that being ""inclusive"" was one of their main concerns when making the show, rather than being realistic. I found this to be a huge turn-off and after things got even more unrealistic in the second episode, I turned it off.

If you like mafia shows and movies that have a realistic feel to them, this show isn't for you."
9.0,13 November 2022,"I didn't know anything about this. I found out by accident. Look, I am a Stallone fan. Have been since Rocky, Rambo, Cobra. Even M. A. S. H. (1970...yeah I'm dated now). Stallone, in my eyes, deserves the upmost respect for his craft. When I was a kid he was a talking point for humor from my peers. Fast forward to today, this man has weathered the hollywierd storm. He has outlasted his peers and become something so much more. Ahnold? Willis? This man is a gem. Imagine, 75 and going strong. Great actor, good eye for a dying business and very, very good start to his first adventure into streaming tv. I take me hat off for you sir."
9.0,26 January 2023,"Slyvester Stallone is a legend!

10 episodes where a mafia capo is exiled from his family after 25 years in prison and you will empathize every minute of it.

I liked the show, but maybe it's because I'm a big fan of Sly. It is possible to come across cliches from time to time, as if the story was formed when many movies and TV series came together.

However, it easily adapts the audience to the story with its fast pace, simple script and pretty good acting. While watching you will not see any nonsense that you would think ""what is this?"" Everything works in harmony with real life. Keep punching, Sly! God bless you."
9.0,26 November 2022,"So I have always been a fan of Sylvester. Yes, he has gotten older (as we all do) but we MUST stop comparing his Rocky and Rambo movies to his latest works. I will admit, I was guilty of this and as a result, I ended up thinking that his latest movie (the Samaritan) was not up to snuff and truly, the movie was probably a B at best. I am not sure that was entirely because of Stallone though. In any case, THIS new series (Tulsa King) is ABSOLUTELY, WITHOUT A DOUBT, worth the subscription price you may or may not have to pay. The part of Dwight ""The General"" Manfredi was 100% made for nobody but Stallone. He plays the part so smoothly and you actually believe that he really is part of the mafia....and with such humor that I find myself laughing many times throughout each episode. I actually have an alarm set on my phone to remind me that a new episode is about to drop (on Sundays) and I get excited (as I do with Yellowstone). I truly hope people will give this a chance and let this series be the series that Stallone can come back with and allow him to ride off into the sunset (hopefully years from now :) :)

My only beef is the fact that only one episode is released each week (yes.... I know that this is how series are...but still I find myself feening for more). LOL)"
7.0,30 November 2022,"I've watched the first three episodes and frankly after the first one I was hooked. This is interesting. I want to see what happens next. I see a man who was knocked down, picking himself back up. And although there is adversity along the way he seems to be making progress.

I like this show what can I tell you.

10.0,20 November 2022,"I didn't expect to like this when I watched the first episode last week because I'm not really a Stallone fan. Let's face it, his fame is from playing dumb angry guys and it's a different world we live in these days.

But I've been pleasantly surprised here. I've watched the first two episodes now and they're well thought out and well carried out.

I like the modern angles that they've thrown in, like the weed farm. And I also like that they didn't make Stallone's character woke which seems to be the trend in television these days.

I'm eagerly looking forward to seeing how the season plays out!

EDIT: I just finished watching Episode 6. They're convoluting the story with too much family drama. Sometimes less is more and we don't need the plot going in a dozen different directions. I'm removing a star from my original rating because it's making the episodes slightly less enjoyable. If I wanted family drama, I'd watch a sitcom."
7.0,11 January 2023,"Tulsa King is currently being shown on TV here in the UK (Jan 2023) and I randomly came across it last night as I was flipping around channels, seeing what was worth watching. I was surprised to see a Sly Stallone TV series and didn't think he'd been in one before. I have to admit, I think Rocky is the only Stallone movie I can remember ever seeing, so it's not like I'm a massive fan but I do like his acting. I had a hunch this would be a good show and it is! I got engrossed in it straightaway. It's quite punchy, witty and Sly is very watchable and sharp. His character, coming from the big city, has a culture shock, having to settle in an out of the way, dusty, Bible Belt small town that's totally alien to him but he finds his footing straightaway and (unbelievably, of course) finds a business to get involved in, and a driver too, even before he finds a hotel / motel to stay in. Kind of silly, of course, but very entertaining and I like Sly's oomph even at his advanced age. Just goes to show, age is all in the mind (well, in theory anyway!)."
9.0,11 December 2022,"Can't say I've had many disappointments with sly throughout the years.. so I came into watching this very optimistic. After. First episode I knw this show Had potential. Good story line, and doesn't seem to be dragged out or to exaggerated. Already interested in a second season and how they would approach it.. I was looking for a lil more action but it still keeps your interest without a lot of it.. I dnt think any other actor would've drawn me into this but either way good plot.

5 episodes in and let's keep up the momentum.. I would like to see how this develops in the nxt few episodes...💪🏽💯💯💯"
7.0,13 February 2023,"The first episode has some cliche tropes and cringy lines. Stallone's character just stopping in at the first weed shop he passes and strong arming them out of 20% was almost too much. It gets back to reality and develops the characters and story before taking off to extreme fiction again. It's entertaining and I'm looking forward to season 2. I don't recall any nudity and there's no sex scenes, and that's not a bad thing. It seems pretty mild for a few episodes and then the violence ramps up to what you would expect from a mafia action movie. I'm still wondering how he booked the penthouse suite without a credit card."
5.0,12 December 2022,"Seen the 5 first episodes, and great story so far.

But the plot: ex, Italian gangster, out of prison, and moves to another ""country"" , and in his own, old way, makes a business as ....a gangster.

Impressing, how fast you can get a gangster business running, and even more, how fast he learns how to operate a smartphone and a PC, after spending 25 years in prison 😉

Stallone does a great figure, and the acting is so far on track.

Write-off, from the great serie on Netflix, Lilyhammer. Just without the snow

Looooved that, but the humour runs also in Tulsa King, so I will keep watching. Give them Hell, Sly."
9.0,25 November 2022,"I live in Tulsa. While Stallone's character is entertaining, as is most of the cast, the writing is more out of touch with reality than Stallone's character is. You can't just walk into a dispensary and say ""It's okay - I'm just looking around"" when they ask for your MM I. D. card. You wouldn't have to supply the dispensary with a security camera - they already have lots of them. A loaded Lincoln Navigator costs more than 50k. In almost every situation he's in, the police would have been called within seconds. I've only seen the first episode, but the ""wrongness"" of this show just goes on and on. But it's moderately entertaining."
9.0,28 November 2022,
10.0,21 October 2023,"This series is a beautiful blend of tough, funny, sweet, sad and every other kind of emotion out there. Didn't really think it was possible but it does have it all and oh, how nicely is delivered. Amazing work on getting a such on point cast, having the right music for the right time, fabulous camera work, great script with the right amount of funny and sass.

For some reason I have never been a fan of Sylvester Stallone and have seen minimal films staring him but I get it now. He's got charm, he's got charisma, he's got talent and most of all, years of experience. There much to admire.

I enjoyed every minute of it and eager for more."
9.0,11 January 2023,
7.0,13 November 2022,"The series is promising if you know what are you going to find from an actor like Stallone. The script is Ok, settings are great including real Tulsa locations and cast is acceptable.

The series starts great because Stallone fits on the character perfectly even he is actually 76 years old. Still credible and some scenes made me think to Clint Eastwood in Grand Torino. I'm not going to spoil anything saying both are great actors in his most repeated and common roles. The series starts strong. Sly interpretation is great and it can become better. So, overall, the series has potential, so let's give it a try. Why not?"
10.0,30 January 2023,"Finally, Sylvester Stallone is in the right place, and more importantly, in the series. He as a persona, very suitable for such a series and a character in the series. But it's not all that smooth.

The series, which is its main very good plus, is light. Though it has some good action going on in places, it is easy to watch. The main characters are well delineated and visually memorable (but not the names). A topical and modern comedy that can't be called very funny, but makes you chuckle.

At times there is strange acting and incomprehensible character motivation, especially one of the characters. The plot is uncomplicated and quite ordinary with its variations, which does not make it stand out among other similar shows besides Stallone.

Although the series on season 1 and has no particular flaws, but I personally have a feeling that the series will roll because of the lack of ideas and poor further implementation, but I hope I'll be wrong. After watching season 1, I can say that it's a good, light, dramatic crime to watch."
6.0,6 December 2022,"EDIT: For those rating this by comparing it to The Sopranos's, Tulsa King is not that. It's an off beat comic-drama in the Lillyhammer style. Take it as such and you'll enjoy the ride...now back to my review..

What a pleasant surprise. Can't believe I'm liking a Stallone project this much. Just binged the first four episodes and found myself loving his character and the storyline. Nice ensemble cast that develops through the initial episodes. Perfect blend of a quasi-serious subject matter with comedic interludes wrap the storyline up nicely. Not surprised this series was immediately renewed as its got some interesting quirks, offbeat scenes an7d solid writing. Great setting out in the ""middle of nowhere"", Tulsa! Who would of thought Stallone would bring Hollywood to Oklahoma? Now I find myself counting the days until the next episode! Way to go Rambo!"
9.0,18 December 2022,
7.0,3 December 2022,"I had my doubts, however, exceeded my expectations. All the likable qualities of Stallone are wrapped tightly within his best character since Rocky and that other forgettable movie where he played a disabled, local police officer.

Dwight is a touch of ""Balboa"" and a Sapronoes player.

Similar to Ozark, Dwight relocates via the mob to Tulsa, Oklahoma. Of course, Dwight, named after Dwight D. Eisenhower, begins building his empire with mob business savvy. A true antihero, Dwight works to make his friends money.

Don't see much ""Yellowstone"" influence - except for the likable characters and integrated, story lines.

Good for Stallone for taking a chance."
2.0,8 January 2023,"""Tulsa King"" has an old, tired premise, with many contrived moments so you have to suspend disbelief. This is another installment from Taylor Sheridan showcasing rural America and sweeping horse ranches. This time, though, it is more of a comedy, thanks to Sylvester Stallone's endearing mix of self-deprecation and smugness. Although the large cast of characters is mostly likable, it is Stallone's ""it factor"" that evidently carries the show. Without him, this would just be comprised of a string of unfunny skits. I stay on week after week mostly looking forward to all of the Stallone scenes with his sidekicks, especially Martin Starr as Bodhi, Max Casella as Armand, and Jay Will as Tyson. ""Tulsa King"" is a fun, relaxing watch if you don't nitpick the logistics too much."
9.0,16 April 2024,"You know the stereotypical Nic Cage movie with the cheesy writing, horrible lines, and even better delivery? That's Tulsa king.

The story advances as if it were simply just ticking boxes on a to do list. You don't feel anything for a single character and there's very little tension. Things just always work out the first time.

The best way I can describe Tulsa king is like this: you know when you watch a movie after smoking a joint and it's hard to take anything seriously because you're hyper aware of the fact that it's simply people saying lines and they aren't really their characters? That's Tulsa king."
10.0,22 December 2022,"Well, the Hypercritics and Overanalysts have spoken. I choose not to be one of them.

I will acknowledge (and not disagree with) some of their points. I don't know if the show is a comedy with serious segments or a drama with comedic segments. Much of the story is unrealistic and I get the criticism some of the writing seems formulaic.

I don't care.

Fact is, from what I've watched so far, I'm entertained. I can find the meaning of life from sources other than Hollywood, though I take an occasional lesson from one show or movie. Those of us that work day-to-day experience enough of what matters to know what matters. It doesn't take some heavy opus to show me the way.

At least they made Stallone what he is--70 something as opposed to 40 something, and he's acting in his zone--not overly deep.

If you expect ""The Godfather"" (and I love it, BTW) with every mob movie/series, move on. If you just want to enjoy something for an hour away from the rest of the world, tune in (at least so far.)"
10.0,24 November 2022,"This is a really great show. It has the potential to be the next Sopranos or Breaking Bad. Hope they are not messing it up. Great build up in the first two episodes and a lot of comedic elements which work great. Exactly the show I was waiting for featuring Sly. Schwarzenegger should take a close look on how this kind of ""old man"" show can work and be so good. I waited years for King Conan to happen... and know it will never BUT Arnold, please!!! Bitte mach eine Serie, wie Sly! Eine Serie, wo Du den Bösen spielst und anderen eins aufs Dach gibst! Please Arnold make a series like Sly! It is never to late... and Silvester Stallone is showing it!"
8.0,21 November 2022,"Sylvester Stallone is a true icon. Wonderfully written with a mix of drama and comedy. Sly is right on point with his character, and his costars are really good too. Great storyline as well. Only have seen to 2 episodes, and I want more! Makes me proud to be Italian lol. If you thought Sly was great in movies, you are in for a treat, because he is even better in this television show! And he's 75? You wouldn't know it. If you are a Sylvester Stallone or mob movie fan, give this show a shot. I promise you that you will enjoy every minute of it, and like me be on the edge of your seat waiting for next week!"
7.0,23 September 2024,
9.0,20 July 2024,"Greetings from the other side. Tulsa King has some issues with its writing, but I still found the show enjoyable.

Many of the scenes are very hard to believe, but if you just go with it, Stallone is very entertaining. Yes, he is older now but still looks tough, and he's the type of bad guy you cheer for.

The few bad things that he does initially, he ends up taking care of them later. It's like they become his family, and he does whatever it takes to look after them.

He does end up causing trouble for his friends, but that's because he ends up bumping heads with other criminals.

It's a good collection of characters in the show, and I did enjoy watching it. I hope there is a season two. I recommend giving the show a watch, especially if you are a Sly fan."
7.0,14 November 2022,"Sylvester Stallone is officially back with a non pc action/comedy, he actually has great comic acting and Timing! This is for your old school action /comedy fan's. There won't be a massive intellectual storyline but as long as we get to see Stallone beat up some people I'm happy. Martin starr is also very good as the wimpy dispensary store owner, He's a very good actor and is underrated in the roles he takes on. I love watching the action stars of the 70/80/90s. It's great too see them keeping this genre alive with old school action and humour. You don't need them to dress up in skin tight uniforms and have magical powers to have a solid action movie/ tv show. This is a breath of fresh air and I hope they keep making programs like this and keep away from superhero stuff."
9.0,20 November 2022,"Don't get me wrong, I really like this series and I've always loved Stallone. That being said, I also believe ""old dude"" Stallone is much more interesting than ""younger, hot"" Stallone. The only thing I don't like about Tulsa King is that it reminds me so much of Lilyhammer, I think Steve Van Zandt should be mentioned in the credits. Lilyhammer is on my list of all-time favorite shows. I love everything about it and I've watched it several times. So many, in fact, that it seems like I've already watched Tulsa King, as well. So far (2 eps in) it's like a scene by scene recreation. Good thing I needed a new series to obsess over, the bad thing is, I've already seen it. Hopefully, future episodes will be a little more original."
7.0,26 December 2022,"Okay, so I started watching this while isolating due to covid - going into the show with zero expectations. I really enjoyed it and am now watching it a second time having talked my husband into watching. We are really enjoying it. And I gotta say, whoever wrote that FaceTime scene with Joey - you got me twice! I was just in tears. The writing is good - gets the story told but in an emotional and efficient way. I've liked a lot of Stallone's past works - but for some reason I wasn't expecting a lot from this show. But here I sit at 6 am watching for the second time. I may have to check out Yellowstone now.

I'd give Tulsa King a 10, but we haven't made it to the end yet have we? I'm expecting to love it, though."
3.0,12 January 2023,"Mafia soldier, out after 25 years in the big house, is banished to the hinterland (Tulsa, OK) to set up shop for the Family. He puts together an unlikely crew, mixes it up with the local hoods, evades the Feds, all the things you'd expect.

Stallone will never be mistaken for a good actor but he has a certain charm that makes it easy to forget. The story and characters are mostly unbelievable and not terribly imaginative. There are no surprises, nothing you haven't seen a hundred times before. Don't expect realistic depictions of crime, criminals, or law enforcement. Less gritty, more feel good and quirky.

Still, I keep watching. If you don't take it too seriously, it's an entertaining ride."
10.0,25 November 2022,"I was really looking forward to Tulsa King - but it gets SO many things wrong, it's just not watchable. Whoever wrote the script has no idea what happens in Tulsa, or how pot farms work, or how pot stores work, or how the banks and federal government are involved. Whoever wrote the script has no idea who Oklahoma people are, or how we behave, or what we do.

On the flip side, a lone gangster from New York wouldn't last very long in Oklahoma. While most Oklahomans are welcoming and friendly, there is a ""militia"" element that would ""disappear"" (or ""redneck justice"") a lone New York gangster very quickly and efficiently - which would make a much better story than what was written for Tulsa King.

In summary, if you like Tulsa King, you have absolutely no idea what really goes on in Oklahoma!"
9.0,9 October 2024,
10.0,14 October 2024,"Taylor Sheridan has done it again. The whole cast, especially Sylvester Stallone nailed their roles. Each character is unique with their own interesting backstories, making it feel like you're watching a modern western series.

The storytelling is top-notch, blending intense action with heartfelt moments. The cinematography captures the rugged landscapes perfectly, adding to the authentic western vibe. The dialogues are sharp, keeping you engaged throughout. It's clear that a lot of thought went into developing each plotline, ensuring that every episode is compelling. If you're a fan of westerns or just great storytelling in general, this series is definitely worth checking out."
10.0,26 November 2022,"I'm so excited for this series. I feel like the writing is superb, and Stallone was made for this role. He knocks it out of the park, I am a fan. This is very comical and it's awesome to see comedy in these types of shows. I laughed a ton.

Tulsa king hits on every point. I've always been a fan of the rocky movies and I still watch them to this day to find inspiration, so far I feel motivated after watching the first episode. It's very impressive how he gets on his feet after being in prison for so long. He has class and style, and let's nothing get in his way. All in all I highly recommend the Tulsa king for anyone looking for a great evening."
7.0,2 December 2022,"I really wasn't sure what to expect when I began the first episode but it became clear by the end I was going to be thoroughly intrigued to find out and haven't been disappointed! With some classic mob story line, brilliantly placed humor and building suspense now three episodes in i'm completely hooked to see where this ride takes me. Stallone uses his now well honed talents to bring an aging removed gangster persona to life in a way I didn't expect. The supporting cast adds flavor in so many different ways with a vast sea of storylines that add to overall plot of the show. I hope writers don't lose sight of the masterpiece they are unfolding here because for the first time in a long long time, Tulsa King shows promise of being absolutely epic on many many levels."
10.0,23 September 2024,"I was an IMDB user before FB even existed / and I have never ever in my life left a review, but the Italian Stallion deserves one. This show is a mix of Ray Donovan - with a pinch of Breaking Bad, and a sniff of the sopranos. Stallone is in the fall of his career, but his acting is his prime. The cast is so well done, the majority start as chickens - but they slowly turn into eagles when they realise the opportunity given by them in their somewhat mediocre life in Tulsa. The cast is so strong, especially all new characters joining along the season. So many character actors (for those of you that don't know - the types of characters whose name you don't know but you know their face) - Domenick Lombardozzi (ray Donovan series) - Ritchie Coster - Neal McDonough (suits and ray donovan) - Frank Grillo (always underrated imho) - Barry Corbin - Alan Peterson - Max Casella - and many more. Season 1 was kinda 'get into it' - season 2 started so strong - love it, and Stallone is really a gem of an actor in the autumn/winter of his career."
7.0,15 November 2022,"This reviewer is indeed a Stallone fan, in spite of the fact that not one of his films made my IMDb list of the best films of all time (more below). Possibly that is because, with Sly, you do not expect perfection, merely a good time. With this ""vanity"" series, a good time can indeed be had, but not everyone is going to be pleased. On paper the Stallone/Sheridan combo is the odds-on favorite for an early knockout. In reality however the false bravado of the writing strikes a off note, as this oddball character lacks the sincerity of the Rocky/Creed films, and even lacks the chewy moral center of his most recent hit, Samaritan. (An under-rated film, BTW). So, bottom line, not for everyone. ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer."" Please check out my list ""167+ Nearly-Perfect Movies (with the occasional Anime or TV miniseries) you can/should see again and again (1932 to the present))"
10.0,13 November 2022,"I was pleasantly surprised. Main character is like a ripple in a water that was too calm for too long. At 76 it is pretty impressive he can still land a role like this. It is also very inspiring. Perhaps this story will remind everyone it is never too late to start all over, if you have what it takes. Everything else, like new tech, are just details. Main rules never change. It's all about hustling. Kinda like undercover billionaire reality show, but on the other side of the law. They should have a shark tank for business ideas for criminals. That would be a hit reality show :D. I can't wait to see how this story develops. I will definitely continue to watch."
7.0,12 January 2023,
5.0,12 December 2022,"The show is just getting heated up by the fifth episode and shows a great deal of potential for becoming an even better production as the cast further grows into their roles. The role fits Stallone like a glove. Stallone's character at this point in the season has formidable enemies. Elements in his Mafia family have sought to undermine and destroy him since he has been in prison. A vicious biker gang opposes his activities. And the local Sheriff's Department is on the payroll of the outlaw MC. It will be interesting to see how Dwight ""The General"" Manfredi deals with the odds being stacked against him as he forms a crew and rakes in the cash. The show so far is well-written and well-acted. Let's hope they stay on course and don't run off the rails with unrealistic story lines. The ""Sopranos"" prequel did just that and was universally panned. The writers of the prequel destroyed any opportunity of the movie sponsoring a new series."
10.0,9 January 2023,"I am sure you read the premise in other reviews and no spoilers here. It is generally a good show and for me personally what made me give this a 7 was mostly the writing and the finally was a bit of a let down. No real surprises and I think 9 episodes wasn't enough so it just seemed like they tried to cram too much into the last episode of the season.

The season has quick emotional swings in a number of Dwight's relationships that were all predictable and often rushed. The emotional development on a number of characters was too quick and dramatic as well. This goes both ways in either their loss of inner strength or going from someone that will faint from a sneeze to a stone cold killer. The changes are almost instant and would have been better if it was done over time versus rushed.

Overall, if you like Stallone you will enjoy the show."
10.0,16 November 2022,"I was looking forward to the pilot of Tusla King because of the writers and directors involved. I know it's early days, but you would expect the first episode to grab your attention. The only thing that surprised me was how much of a non-event it was.

Stallone's acting is wooden and he maintains the same expression through every scene, though that could be he literally can't move his face at this point. He also delivers his lines almost mumbling. It seems a very strange choice of lead to cast for this.

As for all the early 10 star reviews...I'm going to guess that's industry intervention or there were a lot of people high on meth while watching it.

Here's hoping it gets better."
10.0,26 January 2023,"This series is so well written and directed, I don't know why more people aren't recommending it. It's funny heart warming and addictive. I was hoping for something good and Mr Stallone didn't let me down. My only concern is that I don't know if there's another series after this one . This series is so well written that it can go anywhere. I don't want to spoil the story but I'm sure you know that Sylvester Stallone plays Dwight Manfredi a New York Mafia capo, and he's been in prison for some years, now he wants his payback. Without wishing to be horrible, Stallone's language and speech has no connection to his previous roles so please give the programme a view, you won't regret it. Thank you Mr Stallone, it's very very entertaining."
10.0,25 December 2022,"Glad to see Sly, in entire episodes, and not just advertised as a main character, and just be in the film a couple of minutes (Don't know why he does movies like that), any way great acting ""Gangster hard"" great cast and the story is going somewhere!!!

It is rare to see an actor's entire potencial and Sly is knocking out of the park, kicking ass, awesome acting and great story, might be a bit premature but I like where this is going, good Tv Show I've seen in a while, Sly never dissapoints, I,ve been a fan since the 80's, watched every movie hes made, I like his style mixing old with the new. A New Gangster series is always welcome."
7.0,22 February 2024,"His appearance and voice give off strong Italian gangster vibes. However, I'm not a fan of the cast this season. Sylvester Stallone delivered an exceptional performance, carrying the entire cast on his shoulders. While the storyline wasn't exceptional, it was still enjoyable to watch. Overall, it's worth watching, especially for Stallone's outstanding performance. If they're planning for a second season, they should focus on casting that complements Sylvester and unlocks more of his potential. I also missed the intense action scenes with guns, blood, and messy fights. Best of luck for the next season i hope it will come out soon."
8.0,12 January 2023,"I've always liked Sylvester Stallone. He's funny, can pull off tense drama with ease and has always been easy on the eyes. But the performance in this series is amazing. He is mesmerizing in this role! But he couldn't carry the show for long in his own. Fortunately he doesn't have to.

The supporting cast are engaging and well developed. The relationships between them and with Stallone's character give the show an overall feel that is reminiscent of SoA or the Sopranos. You find yourself rooting for him and his crew, even though they aren't good guys.

In summary, the concept of dropping a Mafia capo in Tulsa Oklahoma provides lots of opportunity for humor. Meanwhile, the drama that spins out in the lives of all involved keeps you wanting more. Kudos Mr Stallone. I'm hooked."
9.0,12 December 2022,"This is a great series with heavy drama and moments of real-life comedy mixed together. One of Stallone's best roles ever (this character will more than likely become iconic, like Rocky and Rambo). The writing, the direction, the acting -- every element comes together perfectly, and ends each episode with a strong cliffhanger to make you want to come back the following week to see more.

At a time in life when most people are winding down their careers to take it easy, Stallone defies tradition and pushes forward with what I expect will be an awards contender come awards season!

Taylor Sheridan and the production team hit another home run with this one. Highly recommended!"
7.0,18 January 2023,"Mr. Manfredi is one of Stallones best roles in years. He is funny, witty, and compelling as the aging but physically daunting mafioso. It was about time he stopped making action movies and did some great drama. Tulsa King has a perfect blend of comedy and drama to keep the viewer attentive.

Except for Stallone, there are not many actors with huge names which is nice. And choosing to shoot the show in Tulsa was a great choice. It makes the show more genuine and unique compared to other shows shot in the backyard of Hollywood.

All in all, it's an entertaining show with a compelling and sympathetic lead. If you are a fan of either Stallone or other crime shows, you will enjoy Tulsa King. It's not too long and though to get through."
1.0,28 December 2022,"Tulsa King is exactly what viewers want. Sylvester Stallone meets Daniel Craig's dressing sense in a tightly paced mob drama. The elements of loyalty and family, which audiences have loved for decades in the Godfather, Goodfellas, and the Sopranos, are abundant in this series thanks to Taylor Sheridan. The story of the show kicks off in a timely manner and there are absolutely no scenes or episodes that feel longer than necessary. Producers and show-makers can learn a thing or two from Tulsa King as it's a masterclass on the fruitful mixture of nostalgia with new-er themes. Tulsa King is a great show and is worth binging."
8.0,19 January 2023,"Sylvester Stallone went beyond his acting abilities and did something fantastic in my view for this one. The writing and direction of the series is praiseworthy and the humor with action packed episodes are capable of keeping you on seat for the whole time.

It was really well written how a person being 25 years in prison would see the world when he comes out suddenly. The world has changed a lot in this last 25 years in terms of technological advancement and Mr Manfredi (Stallone)'s expression towards those changes were so real. Besides, this series will be considered as one of a kind with great dialouges. Seemed like the series and Stallone was made for each other.

On the other hand, the other casts were so good in their characters that in a whole it became a masterpiece to me and so much enjoyable the whole time! Hoping for a season 2!"
10.0,9 December 2022,"This show is quite entertaining but it's definitely not because of any sort of realistic portrayal of mobster life. Everything is simplified and plays out according to stereotypes. The setting with Stallone being in the mafia plays to just about every stereotype of how the mafia gets portrayed in popular culture. The mafia stuff is a little bit like how it's shown in The Sopranos but it's even more reduced to basic stereotypes. And this show is all about glorification of violence. In real life, the behavior and way Stallone conducts himself would quickly lead to his arrest on a multitude of assault charges. But in this show, he's able to simply get through life and find success by throwing a few punches and enacting violence on those who oppose him. So if you view the show like a sort of comic book/superhero affair and put aside any expectations of reality, it can be quite entertaining. I would also say that although Stallone tries to weave in other philosophies such as 'The Art of War', he's basically just going to clobber his way through everything like the Incredible Hulk."
10.0,24 November 2022,"Pure cheese. Generic one liners, terrible acting, cringy scenes and and overall cheap feel to it. This is a show for simpletons that are easily amused. Couldn't even finish the first episode. It's so bad, it boggles my mind that something this poorly written and executed could receive a score as high as it currently has. I'm losing my faith in humanity. I feel sorry for Stallone, I get that he's in his twilight years and still wants to be the ""tough guy"" but it's just not believable anymore. He doesn't need to hang it up yet but somebody needs to tell him it's time to try something else. This show is just downright awful."
9.0,25 September 2024,
7.0,13 December 2022,"I can't tell you enough, how long I've waiting for Sylvester Stallone to have his own show. It's the only direction to go when you've been such a hit in movies for so many years.

The show has the feel of Breaking Bad, Sons of Anarchy and 6 Feet Under all rolled into one. I was worried that it would be more of the same but maybe because the star of the show is so big and so beloved, it just all feels fresh to me.

When I say it has the feel of those three other shows, please don't take that to mean it is just like it. It's just a feeling you get when you watch it. Especially after opening credits play this tune that is right out of the Good, the Bad and the Ugly.

Well done show and I hope it lasts for a few more years. Would love to see what Stallone does with this series."
9.0,28 November 2022,"Sylvester Stallone is a phenomenal actor in this series!! He's a natural! The series is so believable!!! I'm always in anticipation of the next episode! I hope the series continues!! The entire cast is fantastic! Love! I've always been a Sylvester Stallone fan since the very first movie, Rocky was released! And ALL the Rocky movies and Creed movies are classics! Jay Will is phenomenal as well! I'm curious to see how he will mold into this crazy, fascinating and dangerous world of the Tulsa King! The title is so fitting! I can just envision how Sylvester Stallone , Dwight Manfredi, is going to take over Tulsa, Oklahoma. Glued to my tv!!!"
6.0,27 September 2024,"Good to see Stallone back. I didn't know what to think at first. It seemed pretty gritty, but as you move along, you realize it's not meant to be a real depiction of anything. It is just entertainment. And that is great. People complaining about the role, Stallone plays, romanticizing, bad people, etc. This is television. This is acting. Just enjoy the ride. It is not as dark as some of the other stuff out there that are gangster related. It is not really based in reality. It is simply entertainment. I would say the same for Taylor, Sheridan's other show, Mayor of Kingstown, same thought process here. And it's over the top in so many ways. It was never meant to be comparable to the mayor of your town. It's simply entertainment. And obviously entertainment that people love because Sheridan is everywhere right now. Enjoy the ride."
10.0,21 February 2023,"Tulsa King, the 2022 crime drama, is a decent show that entertains viewers with its well-executed crime drama elements. However, while it delivers a solid entertainment experience, it falls short of delivering anything particularly interesting or groundbreaking.

One of the show's strengths lies in its ability to weave an intricate and compelling storyline, keeping the viewers engaged throughout. The cast is also strong, with each actor bringing their A-game and adding depth to their respective characters.

However, the show suffers from a lack of direction in some of its scenes, which can feel unnecessarily prolonged and often pointless. This results in some episodes feeling like filler content, adding little to the overarching plot.

The show's best episode, ""Token Joe,"" is only an alright 8/10, highlighting the lack of extreme highs throughout the season. While the episode is entertaining, it fails to stand out from the rest of the season, which is a shame.

Overall, Tulsa King is a decent crime drama that provides an entertaining watch. While it may not be groundbreaking or particularly memorable, it still has enough going for it to keep viewers engaged. If you're a fan of the genre, Tulsa King is worth a watch."
7.0,14 November 2022,Sylvester Stallone delivers!!! This was good from beginning to end. Wish they had put all the episodes up at one time. I really wasn't ready for it to be over!! Fast pace good story. Can't wait to see the next episode. I like that Andrea Savage is it too. She is always great. Soon as it was over I restarted it again. It was to good not to watch at least one more time. This will definitely be a long running series I just hope they don't take to long with the next season. This season will surely be over to quickly. Looking forward to seeing where this story goes. Will Sly be Tulsa King forever or will he go home. Can't wait to see.
3.0,13 November 2022,
10.0,25 September 2023,"The storyline is so good the acting is 10/10 and it's so nice how he has his actual daughter in the series and she actually does so well with acting. Definitely recommend watching this pure entertainment, I literally watched the whole series in a day so i do think it could do with more episodes in the series but it still came together really well. I can't wait to see what's going to happen in season 2!! Was an unexpected ending but that means season 2 is going to be even better! If your sly fans you are definitely going to enjoy watching this and wishing there was more once the series finishes."
10.0,9 September 2024,"I for one thru the years have been a fan and watcher of movies and series of the mafia, and anything with Sly Stallone had me in as here in his first major television role which was created by Taylor Sheridan(""Yellowstone"") and written by Terrence Winter(""The Sopranos""). The story is compelling with twist and turns as Sly is Dwight Manfredi a New York City bred Mafia cap who took a fall and spent 25 years in prison. Now after his release a new start and a new life guess what in all places Tulsa, Oklahoma. This series is typical mob dialogue with profane talk and threats, all while the key character Dwight is trying to find himself and be a liked guy, it's like he's such a loveable anti- hero. Flashbacks and memories from ""The Big Apple"" haunt Dwight like his strained relationship with his grown daughter, still building a new empire and new extended family await in the Sooner state. The series is back and fourth with connections, with themes that involve trust, loyalty, and honesty. This series may not be ""The Sopranos"" still Stallone's work is that of gold."
10.0,22 November 2022,"There was one line of dialogue where I thought the show would have something to say, ""Was it worth losing 25 years of my life for this job? No."" Thinking that maybe in that tough exterior there was a gentle soul coming out of prison to make wrongs righted, and after seeing 1 1/2 episodes, is it worth wasting 10 episodes watching this show? No.

Yet another show written by Taylor Sheridan for man-babies who need a power complex. Except he tries his hand at comedy, and it's almost as bad as Domenick Lombardozzi's wig. A man almost 80 sleeping with a woman half his age, pushing people around, punching people, getting everything he wants immediately after leaving prison. I.e. Boring. I can't complain about Rey from Star Wars knowing everything and doing everything perfectly and not do the same for this. He also gets a plucky black sidekick which made me wonder if Sheridan had ever met one before and a very bored looking Martin Starr is in it too. Wow, wacky weed humor, wake me up when Sheridan realizes what decade he's in.

If you want to see Sly in a comedy/fish out of water story, see Demolition Man... I beg you."
10.0,8 January 2023,"I love this, Sylvester Stallone is a great actor and this series shows that in all its light. Bringing the old school gangsters to the modern world. I didn't think it was going to be this good, I'm up to episode 8 and I'm itching to see the next episodes already. If you love your gangster movies or just love movies with a great storyline get this watched. Manfredi done 25 years in the slammer for things he done with his role in the New York Mafia. He then gets out and sees the family (mafia) things have changed and he must go elsewhere to create his own mafia. It's truly a great watch. Getting ready to watch the next episode tonight :)"
6.0,13 November 2022,"Not too many new shows are this well written. Taylor Sheridan knocks it out of the park. First episode in and it's already one of the best series. Stallone is better than ever and he was made for this role. His acting is dead on he never misses. Always been a fan since Rocky and Rambo and a few others. Creed 2 showed he's a Hollywood contender but some of his recent movies have been really bad especially Samaritan. Acting was horrible and the movie was just a dumpster fire. He totally redeems himself here with one episode of Tulsa King. It's gritty, funny, and the mix of light action and drama is perfect. Don't miss it."
10.0,1 January 2023,"Anything that Sheridan touches turns to gold Have to credit the idea of this TV show I don't know how they did it but getting Silvester Stallone for the lead role is brilliant I love how he creates this person who is not only muscles But also is smart knows how to turn businesses to big profit maker. He's a family man too can't forget Royal There's a lot to the character you can't help but get drawn to see what the next episode got.

Funny how I was in for only one episode now I'm a fan.

Like how characters characters have their own story,demons they are fighting.

One of the best crime drama series I have watched."
6.0,6 December 2022,"I saw few comments saying it is very predictable. I would say; Well, topic is same as other Mafia movies, just enjoy it once. The gangs have of course predictable lives, they are ending up got shot or live in the jail for the rest of their lives. I know many of you watch cult movies like godfather, goodfellas, casino blah blah, but don't expect same creativity as these movies have because if you are the one who watched all the Mafia movies you would probably get bored when you find some other show with similar topic too. So watch it or look around for some other unpredictable garbage like Parasite who received several Oscars without a reason."
8.0,23 November 2022,"In my opinion Imdb should add comedy to the genre entries of Tulsa King - yes, the basis is a crime show, and yes, there is some personal drama, but there is a good and potent shot of comedy in this show too. Therefore all those complains about cliches, unbelievable characters or plot moves are wasted - this is not a show that tries to be a realistic crime show, this is simply pure entertainment. Mr. Stallone is great fun to watch in his role as Dwight Manfredi, the rest of the cast is solid, the production pro, some subplots are introduced, enough stuff to keep up my interest in the story of cinque stelle."
6.0,8 January 2023,"Want to begin with a disclaimer: I'm not a writer and English is my second language, therefore you've been warned. Also, I don't leave reviews because too many characters to type nowadays on IMBD, however just watched the last episode, oh man that was good, I say more; I loved this show, therefore here it is. If you love Yellowstone, SOA, Justified, you would love that one too. Stallone is mature, classy and funny - one of his best roles. I truly believe I will remember him as the ""General"" after this show.

This show does not have a lot of cursing like Sopranos, it is not about mob life style it more about life in general and meaning of it, it about values, family and organized crime. Dwight is very respectful to all women, men, races and takes care of his own (even in the end).

The music in the end of the last episode is perfect, got the same feeling as in SOA with how well the music was chosen.

Great job!"
2.0,16 December 2022,"It is worth watching, maybe. But not a show that will be remembered. The only thing special here is Sly is doing TV. Other than that, it's just another show that will not be around long. Comparing to the Godfather of Harlem - not even close. This is another example of using an established name to generate viewership but not really investing in the supporting cast to really develop the plot. None of the supporting cast is a known name. The plot is weak and simply skims the surface. We are into episode 4 and the deeper lot isn't developed yet. I am actually not excited to continue this show unless they put in more effort."
9.0,13 November 2022,"I feel like the pilot episode is hitting all the right beats you would expect from Taylor Sheridan. There's the ol' timer, recognizable face, stoic most times, charismatic when needed. They establish the premise of the show from the get go, even starting with some obvious tension. And then, thrust the audience straight into Tulsa, just like Dwight (Stallone). He definitely hits the ground running. He starts recruiting his band of quirky misfits and sets agency in the new environment. And the episode ends with an interesting twist to the call to adventure. *chef's kiss*

Not all of it is positive feedback. I understand we're establishing a fish-out-of-water ex-convict trope, but it's a weird disconnect from time for our anti-hero--like it mentally froze for him. From the way he's being portrayed, I would imagine, he was in the hole for all 25 years. Not knowing anything like Google, iPhone or Uber apps, is very unusual for a society with so much information access.

No knowledge of the current criminal climate coming out of prison is also pretty hard to swallow. New inmates rotate in and out and they have all the time in the world to discuss criminality. That's why they refer to the whole judicial system as the University for Hard Knocks. Not to mention, I have friends in High Level Max's that have Instagram and Facebook accounts, with profile photos from their cell (both meanings).

Just nitpicking the lure but still looking forward to the next episode. Definitely a good start."
10.0,14 March 2023,"It's not that it doesn't have its moments, or that it's no fun watching Sly in a tailor-made setting, it's that everything about it feels so so passé.

The sensibilities, the setup, the humor, the standards of plausibility, the signifiers of manliness. It all feels stuck at Tango & Cash or Daylight.

The series does have its moments and some of the humor does land. But how people react to Dwight's anachronisms feels like sad pandering to folks who wish the good ol days hadn't evolved. Are people really that easily intimidated? That and there's not a single tired trope left unused. With a little less kowtowing to the star, it could have been terrific."
10.0,21 November 2022,"As a fan of Sylvester Stallone I had to watch and now I feel sorry for him. It's as if he's having to to this because he can't get anything else. I just don't see Sly as a believable wiseguy.

His acting well, it looks as if he took acting lessons from Steven Seagal or Chuck Norris. He's surrounded by unappealing characters and I'm sure the people of Tulsa are going to appreciate looking like ignorant weaklings getting bullied by a 75 year old thug.

Don't get me started on the political correct crap and the cliched writing. Because of my fondness for Stallone I will watch another episode or two on the sheer hope that it will get better; but for that to happen the writers better give Sly's character more depth and a more interesting supporting cast."
10.0,11 December 2022,"Never thought I'd give a Stallone TV series 9 stars, but this show is really, really great.

Great directing, great acting, great script, great dialog, great casting, great scenery (who knew Tulsa was so bleak?).

A well-done show with genuine heart and humor is rare, but to see it in a crime show? This show pulls it off exceptionally well. A crime show with heart and humor...what's not to love?

IMO this is Stallone's best acting since Rocky. He completely possesses his character and completely fills the screen. He's riveting; I can't keep my eyes off him. He plays sweet, he plays kind, he plays generous. And he also plays tough and cold and ruthless. But I had no problem reconciling these contradictions because his character is so well-developed and believable. I had no idea Sly had this kind of acting range. Emmy-worthy, for sure.

Would be a perfect 10 stars except for the Dana Delany casting. She's just not believable in the role. Or maybe it's her dialog. Is she really this steely? Here's hoping she doesn't remain so one-dimensional and cliched."
7.0,5 January 2023,
9.0,8 December 2022,"I say this because of the lead role played by Stallone. His tough guy character is believable. Even though there is violence in the series, the writers also make room for warmth and romance. What more could a tough guy ask for. He gives hope to the other characters around him. I wish Tulsa would come on more than one time a week. Thank God for Paramount!! I do not know what note the series will end on, but I can tell you that I can't wait for the next episode. The chemistry of the other actors is a perfect match. I haven't been this interested in watching a series for quite sometime. Keep up the great writing. Tulsa for me has been a long time coming. Great stuff!!!"
6.0,1 January 2023,"Wow, this show got me hooked from the first episode, this is by far the most entertaining show on tv right now, every Sunday I can't wait to watch it, Stallone is at his best portrayal of main character, writing is superb, characters are amazing its a perfect 10! I don't usually write reviews but this is just an amazing show. Sly has been at top of the game for the past 40 years and he always brings 100 percent in everything he does, every minute of this show is so enjoyable I can't miss a second of it, this is a true gangster show, better than both Ozark and Breaking bad is you ask my opinion!"
10.0,1 January 2023,"Without a doubt, the living legend Sylvester Stallone is the drawcard.

It's an interesting series, strong opening episode, then not quite as strong in the other episodes, but holds attention enough for you to watch.

Obviously one can't compare it to his great iconic movies, but it's a better than average series, and Taylor Sheridan knows how to write for tv, whether you're a fan of Yellowstone or no, and I'm not really a big fan of it.

This series about Dwight, a guy who served many years in prison, took the fall for others so to speak, because he didn't want to 'rat' on the others in the gang/ mafioso.

He comes out of jail, and after meeting up with those from the said mafia, he is set up in Tulsa, and sets up his new empire, and knocks heads with the other criminal element, so to speak.

Nice to see Andrea Savage, whom I remember from an episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm.

I'd recommend it to watch. If you're not into this kind of show, but are a fan of Sly's, give it a watch."
6.0,5 January 2023,"Well, who would have thought that Stallone could deliver such great and captivating acting.

Don't get me wrong, I love the man and his movie, it's just such an icon in the movie industry. But the films he usually plays in are mostly films with not too heavy fare, if you know what I mean.

So this series surprised me right from the first episode. The script is good, the storyline is correct, the cast is good and refreshing, the dialogues and scenes are well put together and you are curious about what is to come from the start!

Good job!

Or how Stallone would put it.... 'Yo Adrian, we did it!'"
3.0,20 February 2023,"Not taking itself too seriously, this series is good fun. Suspend belief and imagine that some gangsters are actually good guys and you may enjoy it as I did. Sure it is fairly two dimensional and predictable but it made me laugh and kept me engaged. The bad guys are all bad the good guys are are a mix but lack the malice of their opponents. Stallone is no better at talking than he ever was but his lines are nicely written and intelligent enough. His character gets into some scrapes but the ways he approaches them are inventive and entertaining. Shakespeare it isn't but there is enough depth and character development to sustain and it might be the best thing Stallone has ever done."
9.0,15 December 2022,"I mean, I never expected to fall in love with such a natural flowing gangster character that Sylvester Stallone is playing in this show. He's so entertaining natural, and just purely entertaining.

I love how it starts and how the events unfold in a simple yet effective manner, the cost of the show I think is perfectly aligned with the whole vibe, and the fact that the mafia went to the middle of nowhere is exciting.

I am confident in already asking for season two and I hope the story evolves even more and just an advice for the producers to please don't make unnecessary seasons. If you have to close it then let's close it in a good way where the brand resides in peoples minds and hearts as one of the best shows of 2022."
9.0,22 February 2023,"Packed to the gills with every kind of cliche you can think of and a few more more besides, Stallone's 'Tulsa King' is a nonsensical but likeable mess from start to finish.

Martin Starr as Bodhi is the standout performer, milking his Silicon Valley Gilfoyle character and transposing him to Oklahoman weed store owner. But Jay Will's cliche lathered performance as Taxi driver, Tyson also deserves a mention, as it rises well above the haphazard writing and often bizarre story arcs.

Some of the comedic moments raise a chuckle and the snappiness of the supporting cast and the sheer 'who cares if it makes sense' attitude of the writers almost works as a parody of late 80's action films and 'straight to DVD' Mafia b-movies. But I'm not sure that's really it's aim (or maybe it is).

Stallone is pretty wooden most of the time, but the old twinkle in his eye comes out every now and again. And Ritchie Coster hams it up admirably as the mad Irish biker gang leader, Caolan Waltrip.

It's dumb, turn off your brain fun."
9.0,26 June 2024,"I love Stallone. I love organized crime flicks. Tulsa King started out great, but lost its drive pretty quick. The characters are not believable and the story simply does not captivate at all. And of course he has a young and good looking cop lady who falls for him. Nah, I don't think so.

The whole thing feels like they're trying too hard to make it seem like it is something it actually isn't. Towards the end of season one I kinda lost interest in every single character and just wanted to get it over with. Kinda makes you question why you started to watch the show in the first place.

This could've been great. It's not even mediocre. Too bad."
9.0,26 January 2023,"As the title of my review suggests, Stallone isn't my favorite actor by a long way. However, King of Tulsa has brought out the best in him and he totally carries the show, he actually does have Star Power!

A great show, well written, well cast and enough dark comedy and action parts to keep it bubbling along. Stallone is perfectly cast as the 25+ year ex-convict released from prison and then banished to Tulsa by his underworld boss in New York. Season one has set the pace and I'm really looking forward to seeing the story arc over the next season or two. Let's just hope that it doesn't get cancelled as seems the norm for great shows these days."
6.0,25 September 2024,"Of all the men that have played gangsters in the last 40 years Sylvester Stallone actually pulls this off with perfection... I have a new favourite. Great cast.. Martin Starr really has a great screen presence as well... like the Weed Store owner with some tricks up his sleeve... Honestly ... Tyler Sheridan really knocked this one out of the park.. Sopranos on Dusty Roads and Cattle.. who would have seen this coming.. But it's great, hope it lasts for 10 seasons..

Watch it.. you'll like it. Stallone you make a better tough guy than that mouthy liberal idiot Bobby D all day long..

""Take the Reins"" ... literally."
9.0,21 October 2023,"Stallone's performance in this TV series is nothing short of unbelievable. His acting prowess shines through, and the supporting cast stands as a strong pillar, delivering their roles with finesse. The chemistry among the actors elevates the viewing experience.

Certain scenes in the series have a remarkable ability to tug at your heartstrings, especially for those who are fathers themselves. It's in these moments that Stallone's character reveals his vulnerabilities, and it resonates deeply.

While the action sequences may not reach the heights of big-budget Hollywood blockbusters, they still manage to entertain. The camera angles and fighting choreography might seem somewhat amateur, but it didn't bother me much, given the compelling storytelling and character development.

One character that particularly stood out to me was Mitch, the bartender. There was something about him that I found inexplicably endearing. Perhaps it's his laid-back yet quietly charismatic demeanor, or maybe it's the familiarity he exudes, reminding me of a friend. But the real surprise was discovering that he's played by Garret Hedlund, known for his role in 'Tron: Legacy' as Sam Flynn. This added a layer of connection and intrigue to his character.

If you're in search of a well-rounded series with a great ensemble cast that truly delivers on their roles, I wholeheartedly recommend giving it a watch. As I write this review, I can't help but anticipate season 2 with excitement, especially after learning that Sylvester Stallone has agreed to return to the series, which is fantastic news for fans like me."
6.0,13 January 2023,
10.0,11 January 2023,"To start with the best, Stallone is absolutely amazing in this role - a mountain of a man who feels his age but is still worth ten others. Very dignified yet ironic and playful. He's almost the one single thing that makes these series worth watching.

Almost, but not quite - because his henchmen are also a vivid bunch - all of them are well played and everyone is peculiar and unique. Some have larger backstory, some almost none, but it feels like we get it where it's needed. And their interactions with Dwight are also well written and played - so at least some parts of the watching experience are delightful.

Some, but by far not all. Most annoying thing were villains - if New York mobsters were at least a little frightening in their quiet cruelness, the local motorcycle gang is a farce in everything: from the massively overplayed leader who looks and acts like a caricature with a violent tantrums the level of a spoiled child, to the rest of them performing at the level of wooden dolls.

Most, but not the only one - the plot itself - it starts OK but then just gets cornier and cornier, with ""family"" being an answer to all problems and healer to all wounds, and the variety of protagonist problems boiled down to ""feds, motorcycle gang, past crimes and angry daughter"" is, well, not original.

Stallone still saves it all though, so I'm planning watch season 2 when it arrives, no matter the plot."
7.0,2 February 2023,"What can you say about Sly? He's done it again. He's been entertaining us for decades and now he's back with an excellent character.

Stallone dominates the screen by portraying a New York mobster sent to Tulsa, to build his own crew there. Tulsa King is beautifully written, beautifully directed by the great Taylor Sheridan, has a very good cast, and it feels balanced between action and drama without leaving out the right amount of comedy - enough to not stop taking him seriously.

It's the kind of entertainment we need, and Stallone's star shines once again. Let's just hope it will run for more seasons."
1.0,29 November 2022,"I really REALLY hope Taylor Sheridan isn't writing this because holy hell some of the characters are just so badly written. It's just stereotypes and ""lol young people"". Love all of his other shows since they are actually well-written so this is kind of a shock to see. The ""potheads"" and the ""driver"" are just the worst characters of actual people. Sly Stallone is great in it, and the gangster/mafia stuff is pretty good but literally, everything else seems to be ""lets google it and the first thing that pops up is what we will use to write these other characters"" I really hope these next few episodes turn the page and present a show that's ""real"" not just stereotypes."
9.0,24 January 2023,"Other reviewers have decried (albeit, legitimately) the premise as preposterous. Fair enough; but who cares?! The acting is so uniformly superb, the writing so smart and adult, and the satire so sharp, it's a fool's errand to not willingly suspend one's disbelief and just enjoy this series on its own terms. Mr. Stallone has never been better as a world-weary, rough around the edges individual with a mind and wit both wise and incisive. The supporting players have been cast with extraordinary skill (kudos to the casting director) -- each and every one absolutely nails the exceptionally well-written dialogue they've been given. This is a frequently violent series that respects the conventions of the gangster genre, but at the same time, satirizes same with a contemporary sensibility that is very funny and quite original. So engrossing and enjoyable that newcomers may find it hard not to binge. :-)"
9.0,22 May 2024,"After 25 years in prison, New York Mafia capo Dwight Manfredi has been released. He is expecting a reward from his bosses for not rolling over on them but instead finds that time didn't stand still while he was inside. His boss and friend, the man who he can rely on to look after him, is now only nominally in power. His son makes all the decisions and doesn't view Dwight as favourably as his father. He sends Dwight to Tulsa, Oklahoma, as he views it as an untapped market. Dwight has nothing: he is going to have to build a crew and the Mafia's presence in Tulsa from the ground up.

I initially wasn't interested in this series but once I noticed the writers behind it, many of whom were involved with The Sopranos and Boardwalk Empire, I gave it a go. Turns out it's not bad though is a bit disappointing in some respects considering the writers involved.

It started intriguingly enough. Dwight's backstory was engaging and the whole fish-out-of-water building-an-enterprise-from-scratch scenario was interesting. His initial steps into setting up a Tulsa operation are quite entertaining (though not entirely plausible).

Here lay the first problem: the plot is a bit thin, covered up with large degrees of style and swagger. This turns out to be a weakness throughout the series.

Allied to this style-over-substance method, we have Sylvester Stallone as Dwight. I was sceptical about his casting from the start: I know he's there for his star status but I kept thinking he's way too old for this. Turns out that's the look the producers are going for: he's literally playing his age! More tellingly, he seems like a cartoon gangster, far more flashy than credible.

This all said, it is reasonably entertaining. There's some good action scenes and the series moves along at a decent pace. Not a must-watch but not a waste of time either."
9.0,21 November 2022,
10.0,30 January 2023,"Pretty good writing, great characters, wonderful banter. This isn't the normal Stallone flick you've seen in the past decade, this is very entertaining. I was very apprehensive about watching this, but mom talked me into it. I'm very glad she did. You still see some classic Stallone tropes, but nothing that takes you out of the show.

If you like rag tag teams with heart and banter, give this a shot.my only complaint is that the show isn't long enough. I'd love more episodes in the season. Tulsa kimg has the legs to go for multiple seasons. The characters back story is pretty open ended, so there's many directions you could take this show."
6.0,25 January 2023,"This is by far the best performance by my man Sly, that I've ever seen. He has me cheering him on every episode, just like he did in the original Rocky. The directors and writers have given him the perfect material. It totally brings out so many sides to Dwight, and Stallone has his co-stars and his audience eating out of the palm of his hand.

I feel totally invested in his character, and was completely blown away at how he was able to show Dwight's softer side. Who thought they would ever see Sylvester Stallone moved to tears onscreen, in a scene that had me choking up? Kudos to the entire production!

Now I have to get back to watching the last two episodes of season one, and already can't wait for season two."
9.0,22 February 2023,"This is the best I've enjoyed for a while. And it doesn't require the usual slow character building 3 or 4 episodes before it gets going. It gets going from the off. No time to be bored.

Stallone is excellent. I thought this show was made for him. His tough guy no nonsense dead pan demeanour is hilarious in parts. Laugh out loud stuff which is rare for me. Love the character. Script is good. Other characters are interesting too but for me it's all about Sly.

I watched the whole series in two nights and will be jumping on the second series at the earliest possible opportunity. I wish there was more TV as easy to watch as this."
6.0,21 March 2023,The Stallone that is best! This Series has everything you're looking for Style character Adventure love romance Etc! It tells a story of trust and family but Stallone was betrayed. When I say this movie has it all it has it all. It has your rooting for Stallone all the way even though he may be a mobster But he has the biggest heart one can see. It shows you that even though he may be considered a bad guy he very very much has character and loyalty. This series gives you a set of ideals that one should live up to. I admire the series for the set of ideal it should instill in all people. Hope to see another season of this and to keep the intensity up not down.
8.0,11 December 2022,"Have been a Sylvester Stallone fan since Rocky , through all of them and Rambo as well , but haven't watched his recent work which were understandably necessary money makers for him . But Tulsa King very , very good , he is excellent in it . Watched all episodes twice , once with subtitles not to miss anything . Episode 5 very strong /Tony Soprano territory/ the Father dynamic is very well done . I think a great watch , good supporting characters as well . The Tulsa location angle is unique.

That is all I have to say , but need more characters to have it submitted - Bottomline have enjoyed this thoughtful series very much ."
6.0,15 December 2022,"Her I am, five episodes into the most preposterous suspension of believe wise, ridiculous, silly, plotline in probably the entire history-in of all of the above-series.

It required me to go along with the premise that there was no criminal element In Tulsa that couldn't be defeated by a motley bunch armed with baseball bats.

East coast bigotry squared about fly over country.

It must be that the lead, Sylvester Stallone, is still one of the most watchable actors ever.

In my shame I'm awaiting every new chapter, suspending belief, rooting for a career criminal and hoping this obsession is not another sign of dementia."
5.0,10 January 2023,"I really love this show. All the characters are very interesting & so lovable. Sylvester Stallone is amazing & of course plays his character so very well. All the actors do an amazing job & I've looked them all up wondering why I haven't seen some of them in anything else because they're all so amazing by really bringing each character to life & blending the story together. Ive become obsessed with this show. I love the development of each character & their relationships to each other. I found myself yelling ""YES"" at the tv while watching it several times. I can't wait to watch the last episode of season 1 & I'm so excited for season 2!"
10.0,26 December 2022,"So many of my favorite shows are not airing new episodes until Jan. & I wanted to watch something I had not seen before. Decided to check this show out, but admittedly, was not expecting much. After watching the 1st ep. I was impressed. After watching the 2nd, I was hooked. Can't wait for the next one (I have seen 7, so far). My only disappointment is that this series, like so many other great ones, was only given 11 episodes for season 1. This sucks big-time! I miss 22-24 ep. Series something fierce. I can understand waiting a little while to see if a new series catches on w/viewers, given the high cost of production. But when it does catch on, as this one has (w/both critics AND viewers), why not add more episodes to the season instead of making a rapt audience wait an entire year for more?"
8.0,4 December 2022,"I'll admit, when I first heard about the Tulsa King my immediate thought was that it would be a weak cousin of the Sopranos, or some woke take on the world of the mafia.

But was I wrong. This show slowly but gradually grows on you right from the first episode, and as it continues it only gets better.

This role fits Sylvester Stallone like a glove, and Sly is really showing that he should've been doing TV series earlier in his career, because he for sure is carrying this show all by himself. There are other characters for sure that also interesting, but none carries himself like Stallone does. And Stallone is bringing his A+ game on every episode, even going to the point of proving he can be very emotional and believable while doing it.

The shows knows when to be serious, funny, dark, and hopeful. Even when Sly addresses the current problem of wokeness, he does so logically explaining exactly how the current Gen Z has no idea what the previous generations had to go through. His character doesn't insult in any way those that are woke, he just asks the very reasonable question of when will enough be enough.

I for one am loving Tulsa King, and I strongly recommend it to anyone that just wants to watch a great show, without any politics, wokeness, allowing the viewer to just relax and have a good time."
10.0,16 July 2023,"The music, the opening sequence, production, and all the actors in the show are all first class. But that's about it.

The comedy in the first 2 show was great and I was hoping for more. But then it disappeared and turn all serious. There is obviously a lot of setup for season 2. For example, the large amount of characters involved, NYC, love interests, the bar, the business and how season 1 ended.

Of course Stallone holds everything together. The writing is just above average although some cliche here and there. The group speech at the bar is just a bit too average. Can use more smart comedy, but then comedy is hard to do."
9.0,4 January 2023,"Nonsense on steroids. Do the writers even read their own scripts or know their own characters? Have they ever even been around a real soldier much less an assassin?! For lack of time and interest I'll just showcase two inanities. One being, sheesh, the fat dummy biker shooting holes in the bar expected what to happen, lol. Did he expect the mafia dude to come out waving a white flag or did he expect to have holes shot through him while standing there in the open looking like the broad side of a barn. And his girlfriend the 'explosives expert' who did not one, not two, but three tours in Afghanistan where there really was a whole lotta Bada Bing, Bada BANG, Bada BOOM going on and dead people everywhere goes all to pieces when fat boy doesn't come home from his tour of duty doing target practice. She goes all to pieces as if it's the first time she'd ever been acquainted with matters of life and death. KA-BOOM! Do we hear four tours! C'mon man!"
7.0,30 November 2022,"I found Stallone to be better in this series than any of the Rocky movies and his driver is hilarious. Having grown up in Tulsa all my life, and then serving in the FBI until my retirement, I laughed all the way through it. I loved all the little quips that I'm sure a lot of people missed, such as Jimmy, the Creek the White Dwight and others. The theme of a ""gangster"" with integrity who kept his mouth shut for 25 years before being released into this changed world is really humorous. I really enjoyed his take on going to college which is so true. I laugh every time I think the series and cannot wait for another session."
10.0,26 January 2023,"Absolutely wonderful series. It makes you pity the fact Stallone hasn't made more of these type of series - or maffia films, for that matter.

The storyline is great, the supporting cast is fantastic -Domenick Lombardozzi (!) and it seems to me that season one is just an appetizer for a even better season to come. The cliff hanger in de last episode definitely makes you want for more.

One point of criticism could be the age gap between Stallone and his romantic counterpart (Andrea Savage). In real life she's 49 yo and Stallone is 76 yo. But hey, she quite a sight for sore eyes, so I am not complaining."
7.0,14 January 2023,
10.0,24 February 2024,"It's a great pleasure to watch the ""Tulsa King"" take advantage of every opportunity to build and expand business opportunities with a twinkle in his eye and a macho grandeur, recruiting a bunch of quirky birds without getting flustered. Even if the story isn't the greatest reinvention, it is told with so much subtle humor, sensitivity, great acting and excellent dialogue.

Stallone hits the mark with a brooding, straightforward performance that combines humor and violence almost perfectly.

All the actors do a very good job, with Domenick Lombardozzi, who is also good for surprises, deserving special mention. But Dwight's new companions also know how to inspire. To list them all would go beyond the scope of this film, because they are all excellent in their roles, each in their own way. Even the smallest supporting roles are perfectly chosen.

The characters continue to develop over the course of the episodes. It's a joy to watch them.

The great actors, including their always to the point dialogues, as well as the humor that always makes you laugh or smile in so many situations, make the time fly by. You are carried along on a cloud that provides excellent entertainment. The emotional moments are not neglected. A father who doesn't agree with his son's choice, a father who would love to turn back time to spend it with his daughter, or the softer side behind a hard core. There are so many moments where the vulnerable side is also shown. This mixture is spiced up with a touch of tough macho gangster style and makes for excellent entertainment. The whole thing is then complemented by appropriate camera work and great sound.

The show has promising depth, despite the light-hearted premise of a former big-time gangster who is forced to make a fresh start in a new city after serving a long prison sentence. He has class and style, and nothing is allowed to get in his way.

------------- Conclusion:

Excellent - This is a very entertaining series that knows exactly what it wants to be, and you can tell that the cast, led by Sylvester Stallone, are all having a lot of fun doing it. All in all, I can recommend the Tulsa King to anyone looking for a great night out. We hope for a sequel."
7.0,30 September 2024,"Me who has seen GOMORRA series, even four years ago, enduring this series is too much unbearable. This is such a disgrace to be submitted to such a torture. This is lousy, stupid, for such a plot, such a mafia series. This is made to please to anyone, even to the family grand ma. It should be brutal, gritty, poignant and thrilling in the same time. I agree to other reviewers who say that Sly should have played a mob kingpin far earlier in his career. And not in a comedy, but a real gangster or for a character like the one he had in F. I. S. T. That was a great role for hm. He should retire now."
1.0,5 September 2023,"I started off thoroughly enjoying this series - the dialogue and repartee was excellent and amusing. Dwight's fish-out-of-water bumbling as he is released from prison into a modern new world had some very comical moments.

However, as he reverts to type and his gangster side starts coming to the fore I started to find him less likable even though you still root for him.

I can't put my finger on it but there's something off about his eyes. Is he wearing contacts? At times they were just downright creepy. Perhaps it's just me.

Big ups for having age appropriate love interests, although one of them is still about 25 years younger."
9.0,29 September 2024,"I love this show. The key to a good one is that my entire family loves it, from 70 years old down to 20. Sylvester Stallone is still as charming as he always was, and this role could not be more perfect for him. The additional cast members were so well chosen, you can identify with each and every one of them. The music is great, the humor makes you smile, the sets are believable, and this season is ramping up to be pretty exciting! Stallone was way too nice in the last season, now we are going to see him in action! Thanks for giving us Sopranos fans something to look forward to on Sunday nights again."
10.0,16 October 2024,"I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the first season of Tulsa King. Sylvester Stallone finds the perfect balance of charm and brute force as a Mafia ex-con exiled from New York to Oklahoma. To his own surprise, he embraces the change of scenery and slowly builds his own ""family."" He also romances two women, forges a relationship with his estranged daughter, makes some shrewd investments, and fights a motorcycle gang leader. Season 2, however, falls flat from the first episode and hasn't recovered yet (I'm halfway through it). There are too many ""cute"" scenes, such as Sly's tough guy clashing with the head of a homeowners association or visiting a politically-correct private school with his grandkids. These scenes just feel like filler material. I also miss one of my favorite characters from the first season (who may have been written out of the series...hope I'm wrong). Finally, Dana Delaney and Neal McDonough are wasted in underwritten roles. She is too good an actress just to stand there and smile, basking in the charm of Sly's gangster. So, first season is an 8 and the second a 6...hence,my rating of 7."
10.0,20 April 2024,"Has anyone seen a realistic one? I mean most movies we watch are unrealistic. People use bodies as shields against bullets. How realistic is that? We literally have women who are the same strength as men. How realistic is that? Look at what happens when the top champion women soccer players try to play a team of 16 year old boys. But in movies we almost expect it. We have 17th century England with asian and black people in it. No one worries about realistic. But a guy who is too confident is a hurdle you cnat cross because of realism? Have a deep introspective look.

The movie is very enjoyable, all the characters are likable, the storyline is upbeat, and while it's not realistic, it's not meant to be. It's easily as realistic as any show made.

Great pacing, great dialogue, and Stallone is riveting on screen!"
9.0,20 February 2023,"Let's not pretend this is a smart and clever show, because it's really not. Let's also not pretend that Stallone can act convincingly, because he really can't.

But was he likeable as cartoon gangster Manfredi? Totally.

Suspend you disbelief because the silliness is dialed to eleven pretty quickly and this gets progressively worse (or better, depending on your taste).

The show doesn't seem to take itself too serious however, so paired with the rather short runtime of each episode, it's pretty easy to stomach and get entertained if you accept everything for what it is.

It's shallow, it's cliché. It's not even good. But it's entertaining.

This felt like a ""thank you, Sly"" send-off more than anything else. Well deserved, I reckon.

7/10."
6.0,13 April 2023,"I can't say that I recommend this show, at all. Taylor Sheridan the creator is--in case you haven't already noticed--a plagiarist. Sheridan's 1883 is a pathetic ripoff of ""Lonesome Dove."" And with Tulsa King, Sheridan plagiarized crime author Jack Bristow's ""Hard Time"" novel. The similarities between Bristows' novel and Tulsa King are striking.

""Tulsa King"" is the product of a writer who has never once had an original thought. I like Stallone, but in this show, the character Stallone plays isn't even remotely likeable. Additionally, this show borrows a bit from Steven Van Zandt's ""Lilyhammer."" But Sherdian doesn't understand what Bristow and Van Zandt and the writers of ""Lilyhammer"" understood: Make your character likeable. Van Zandt's Frankie the Fixer in Lilyhammer only bullied the bullies. Ditto Bristow's Tommy Roma in Lilyhammer.

In ""Tulsa King"" Stallone plays a thug we want to see arrested again, who bullies and extorts owners of a legal marijuana dispensary just because Sheridan wants to show what a bada*ss Stallone's character is.

Such juvenile storytelling doesn't belong on television.

But what do you expect from a plagiarist?"
10.0,22 January 2023,"Without spoilers:

I finished the season before commenting. Yes I am comparing it to the Sopranos, because that's the genre it has to compare to.

I would say factoring in it's 2022/3 and the garbage that is coming out of Hollywood these day this would rate a 10/10!

But with all seriousness I really liked this series! Its an island amongst the ocean garbage heap of ideological trash of today.

It's not perfect but its a simple story, its Rocky meets the Mob! Its escapism at its finest for 2022/3.

I feel nowadays I have low expectations of Hollywood and that anything remotely good that falls short of yesteryear is great. So comparing this to Sopranos its a 9/10."
6.0,29 September 2024,"Everything I said in the title is really what it is! Haven't watched a series like this in many many years!

Honestly it's making me want to move to Tulsa Oklahoma! I know it might not seem like the glamorous lifestyle like Hollywood California but that's not what I'm looking for. My number one issue is it has to be a red state not dealing with all the garbage coming from the blue states first and foremost!

I just want to make a honest living raise my kids and grandkids in a decent town that has values want to be left alone enjoy the fresh clean air good music good food and good people to be around what can anyone else want Sylvester's Stallone Really brought out this city in a big way Watching this series with a few glasses of red wine really makes me melancholy for that kind of living especially nowadays where everything is so disgustingly blue! I live in Rhode islandand I'm pretty tired of politics out here after 17 years I've had enough looking to move out Of this state an honestly After watching this series I'm really doing research on Tulsa Oklahoma of course before making the big head first dive to that state.

I will keep you posted to what I decided to do!😁💖"
10.0,25 February 2023,"If you weren't a Sly fan, you will be now. Like a fine wine Stallone gets better with age. The show is delivered with an essence of Sopranos, only if Junior forgot his whereabouts in Jersey and ended up on route 44 - hence a touch of Sons of Anarchy. A strange contrast at times, although production some how pull it off, and leave you wanting more. The combination of bikies, feds, and mafia refreshing due to solid performances by all the main characters. This show is different, but in a good way. An appropriate number of characters are involved in different aspects of the general story line keeping things interesting.

Highly recommend. Looking forward to season 2 and the adventures of Dwight."
7.0,22 September 2024,"I gave the first season the rating of 9/10. It was funny, rugged with good dialogues, with the exception of the finale which was a serious downer. Despite of that I had had high hopes for season 2. After having watched two episodes of the second season I must say I'm pretty disappointed. The dialogues are disjointed and mostly cliched. The plot is being dragged into several directions at the same time which makes the movie lose its cohesion. The introduction of the fat singer at the end of ep. 2 is just one example of that: I have no idea what purpose it served. There are a few developments that might still save the movie though I seriously doubt it.

My new rating for season two is 4/10, that's the best I can offer here. A real shame!"
1.0,16 January 2023,"There is absolutely nothing complicated about Tulsa King. You get what you paid for. Acting is decent, don't over-analyze it and especially, don't over analyse the plot. Everything is happening in an ""advanced"" time frame, as in, what may have taken 3-4 episodes to explain on another show, will only take 5 minutes in this one. And that's absolutely okay! It's a show that's unpretentious. It knows its role, sometimes it tries too hard (cheesy Stallone speeches), but then it comes back.

It's worth watching. The dynamic between Stallone and his new crew is amazing. It's something of a mafia/drama/comedy. Just to think that Stallone is 77 and he's acting like this, it's absolutely brilliant. He does not get enough credit for this. Put it on, relax, enjoy it for what it is and don't over think it."
8.0,21 November 2022,"If ever there was a part for Mr. Stallone then this is it.

After playing a hero, protagonist and man of adventure it is refreshing to see him on the other side of the law.

The location is interesting as Tulsa is about as far from New York City culturally as one can get. The humor is implicit similar to That in Young Sheldon, based on truths. A man who has been removed from society for 25 years comes to grips with modern society. Very much like Green Acres and the Beverly Hillbillies with a malevolent yet humorous twist. Stallone imparts a great feel to his man all alone. He has many associates however, he stands alone."
10.0,2 December 2022,"It's not Taylor Sheridan or not even up to par with his writing/production/acting.

One-dimensional and just plain stupid.

Hopefully Mr Sheridan doesn't over-work himself and develop 'Elon Musk Syndrome.'

It's just boring (And I'm a really good-looking 51 year-old male who never married nor was stupid enough to raise kids in the United States.)

Anyway I'm glad I bought Disney 20 years ago @ $11 a share but I should tell me people to sell it.

I like to drink Kettle One, Markers Mark46, Patron Sliver and hopefully I'll be at the character limit soon.

Anyway the world has dumbed so down.

And what I always say is that if you make a million a year but spend a million-five; you're not rich."
10.0,17 January 2023,"Who would of thought it.. Stallone doing a tv series?! But he totally and utterly nails it, this is one of his best roles since noticeable big roles in the years gone by.

The important thing to mention, this isn't just a a Stallone series, it's the supporting cast that adds all the depth and drama to the series that lends itself to all the great drama splashed with lots of action and great humour.

Plot is really good with a great back story that becomes clearer as the series progresses, no spoilers!

Even if your not a big Stallone fan, well worth a watch if you want an engaging series to watch, enjoy!"
10.0,8 January 2023,"I truly believe Taylor Sheridan is the best series creator to come along in decades. His series have a way of grabbing you by the heart and not letting go. A master storyteller A master of suspense. All of his projects have demanded acting on a level you rarely see. No boring episodes. No boring moments in his series or films. Rarely do I find any characters annoying.

This is all why I've been so disappointed in Tulsa King. The series falls way short of the Quality I/we've come to expect from Sheridan. Honestly, it just feels like a cash-grab. Maybe he's just got too much on his plate right now to maintain the level of quality he's shown us. I don't know what happened with this but as a Sheridan super fan, I really hope his success doesn't prevent him from creating series and films that, in my opinion, are masterpieces."
7.0,6 January 2023,
10.0,30 December 2022,"Most of the low ratings result from people thinking that this is a mob documentary or a serious look about how crime works in New York or Tulsa. It's not.

It is an over the top comedy with Stallone playing the lovable tough guy, much like Rocky. As many have mentioned, it is unrealistic as Stallone would have been arrested about 12 times on his first day in town. Other things are implausible. For example, what nice hotel would rent to an out of towner with no ID and paying with a wad of cash?

It gets 8/10 because some of the NY scenes give the impression that justifies some of the reviewers' beliefs that it is a serious drama. As long as you just accept the over the top 80's slapstick violence, and just roll with the premise, then you will very much enjoy this series."
7.0,28 September 2024,"""Tulsa King"" is an outstanding series that highlights Sylvester Stallone in a role that feels like a perfect fit for him. The show follows Dwight ""The General"" Manfredi, a New York mobster who, after getting out of prison, tries to establish himself in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The mix of drama and humor keeps things engaging, making it both entertaining and thought-provoking.

Stallone shines in this role, bringing a depth and charisma that draws you in. The supporting cast is strong as well, each character adding richness to the story. Set against the backdrop of Tulsa, the show offers a fresh take on the mob genre. With its compelling plot and well-developed characters, ""Tulsa King"" is a must-watch. It captures the complexities of loyalty, family, and starting over, making it an unforgettable viewing experience."
9.0,5 March 2023,"Not a lot of dry moments waiting for an exiting part to come up. More entertaining than I thought it was going to be and left me saddened when it was over after binge watching it. Didn't feel like an agenda was being shoved down my throat which was a fresh breath of air in today's media.

I thought they cast the characters very well and seemed to work well together. Definitely made me like and dislike some characters as the show progressed at a very reasonable pace. Overall it was tasteful on how they led the protagonist to interact with the the law enforcement love interest. Would highly recommend and hope a season two happens."
7.0,16 March 2023,"Usually we get a rough diamond that needs shaping and polishing. In this case Tulsa King didn't need any of that. This is a gem of a show that captivates from episode one. Sylvester Stallone brought his A-Game for this series, highlighting the fact that he still an A-Lister... Can't wait for season two... These are the type of series and shows we need to keep our interest perky. In this series, we see the humor, old school gangster mentality and realities we don't think happen in small towns. The interaction of talent in this show, highlights its quality. Every actor is on point giving us a show that will be missed and remembered when it concludes; hopefully, not for another four seasons or more..."
2.0,24 January 2023,"With Terrence Winter and Taylor Sheridan, I expected more of a western-themed Sopranos. The show is a mixed bag of mafia scuffles, family drama, capitalizing on the local 420 market while rumbling with the SOA wannabees. The fish-out-of-water (25 years in the can) adds a humor element which helps remind to not take it seriously. Despite the writing power of the creators, this is not a high caliber series {like SOA, B-Empire, Sopranos}. The conflicts resolve withing a few episodes and so far there doesn't seem to be any long term story arcs besides the attention of the Feds. Even the NY Mafia problem was fixed in half an episode - just sent them packing back on the plane. Overall an enjoyable watch, just don't expect a deep crime family drama."
10.0,23 January 2023,"The general concept of the show is the somewhat well-worn ""fish out of water"" trope - a Mafia capo is exiled to Tulsa after he's released from prison, haing served a lengthy sentence rather than ratting out his partners in crime. Despite this trope (and a number of others - e.g. The ""good"" mafia guys (like the protaganist Dwight Manfredi) vs the ""bad"" criminals (mafia and otherwise), it works out surprisingly well. Some very clever (and often humourous) dialogue and solid acting all around, plus well-choreographed action sequences and an interesting plot. It does touch upon some serious topics, but contrary to what seems to be a prevailing trend, doesn't try to plumb the depths of human darkness. The first season flew by. Very entertaining and worth a watch."
10.0,20 December 2022,"Didn't know much going in, just Stallone and Italian mafia is enough for me to check it out.

You just sort of follow Dwight around as he does regular, mundane things and slowly get to know him and his team. There are very little mafia-ing going on. Feels like watching a PG13 version of Scarface. On the Godfather scale of 1-10 this would be a 2-3. Some things are done with zero legal consequences and events just magically resolve in his favor. So far the body count has been depressingly low, and the violence has been very mild, as this show goes out of its way to not become a serious crime drama.

If you are a Stallone fan and just want to kick it with him as if watching a talk show, then this is pretty good. It's moderately entertaining and well made."
9.0,30 March 2023,"I tried this just out of curiosity after watching all Picard episodes released so far and boy was I impressed. This show really gives credit to Stallone's range as an actor and in my opinion, his best work since the days of Cliffhanger, Demolition Man, Daylight, and Assassins. Him playing the mob boss getting his patience tested every second in Oscar may be my favorite movie of his just because at the time it came out, I wasn't aware yet of his comedic range and talent outside of the action packed genre I'd only seen him in prior. It seems that if you give this man a well written story along with a great supporting cast, you don't have to worry about him carrying it the rest of the way and making it an enjoyable experience. I was also a big fan of Doogie Howser when I was much younger along with Freaks and Geeks later, so it's great whenever I get to see certain actors I've admired thru their careers take on rolls in something enjoyable like this."
8.0,23 August 2023,I clicked n the most recent reviews and read a couple and go from there... But the first 6 are ridiculous! I was never going to even entertain this ( because beyond Rocky I didn't know what to expect)?!? I'm not a big fan of stalone but I've watched 4 episodes so far and I stay up until about 4-5am and I wanted to continue! Since I've run out I'm watching shows I never usually would but so far this is decent! And the Sopranos couldn't get though 1 episode over the years but apparently i find this amusing because if I didn't I wouldn't be able to get thru 10 min. Oh and i did almost turn it off but it was like 2am so I kept going. I'll update my review if necessary when I watch more....
7.0,14 November 2022,"Stallone wants to make money with every chance he geta and this is just another opportunity for him. He doesn't really care about quality.

I wanted to like this, but it's just so bad. The name of the show should be ""Politically Correct Gangster"". Some scenes from the first episode were so stupid and I stopped watching at the minute 33 so who knows what else they used there.

It's not just the cliches, it's the modern lazy writing, the check boxes, the racial and feminism narrative... People are tired of that... Hopefully the new season of Yellowstone is not as boring as this show, otherwise I'm going to give up watching that as well.

Anyway, if you want to watch real gangster shows, watch Sopranos, The Wire, Boardwalk Empire. Even Ray Donovan is a better choice than this."
9.0,16 March 2023,"The only thing I didn't like about it is how they made the ATF agent seem as if her wrongdoings were simply because of emotional reasons.

But it shows us how, in the real world, all these 3 letter word US agencies create, fund, arm, and/or work with ""the bad guys"". From drug kingpins in Latin America, to terrorist organizations in the M. E., until the ""bad guys"" are no longer useful to them and then these agencies betray them, never being held responsible for their own crimes. 99.9% of the time it's not ""feelings"", it's strategy, it's them who are the biggest bad guys, but they get away with it."
7.0,18 September 2024,"Tulsa King is a captivating series that blends crime drama and dark humor, buoyed by a charismatic performance from Sylvester Stallone.

Secondary characters provide depth and dynamic interactions, while the plot offers a good balance between action, character development and lighter moments. The series stands out for its well-controlled pace and unique tone, combining crime, humor and introspection on the lives of aging gangsters.

Tulsa King's soundtrack really adds to the series' atmosphere, mixing contemporary and classical pieces that reinforce the contrasting mood between Dwight's mobster past and his new environment in Tulsa. The music plays an important role in accentuating the dark humor and tension in key scenes, making the experience even more immersive.

If you like crime dramas with an endearing anti-hero, Tulsa King is a series not to be missed."
9.0,7 March 2023,"The pacing worked really well for me, the story is good, I liked occasional humor, but what I liked the most are the characters - here, each character is thinking with their own head and looking out for themselves.

There's really no ""filler"" characters that behave exactly as you'd expect them in a generic series about gangsters, but instead have their own little worlds that we viewers get a glimpse into. It's amazing how you can flesh out the character through a couple of dialogs and explain their motivations that aren't just driven by ""because the plot needs it"".

I also appreciated how they wrapped S1 but still opened up an opportunity for the story to continue. Strongly looking forward to the future episodes. Well done!"
7.0,20 May 2023,"Sylvester Stallone's career has always relied on his instinct for great scripts. That hasn't changed.

This series follows an aged New York mobster, recently released from prison, who discovers that the world has moved on and both his biological and criminal families have abandoned him. He is sent to Tulsa with the guise of establishing a new syndicate, but in reality, it's a place of exile where he is expected to quietly meet his end.

However, the old man refuses to let life slip away, finding ways to apply his criminal skills in a new city and era.

The script aims to capture the essence of Elmore Leonard's style, but falls short in some respects. It forges its own path, offering comedic relief that doesn't quite match Leonard's average humor. Nevertheless, this script invests more in its characters than Leonard typically does. The backdrop is well-crafted, and the major players are sufficiently developed to spark interest in their future journeys. Stallone's performance is exceptional, a blend of John Rambo and Vito Corleone, and the supporting cast is equally impressive."
1.0,13 January 2023,"They blew all the budget on the star, forgetting to buy a script and reasonable acting skills for other members of the team. Over all, it's boring, empty and predictable, enough to be painful. Limited acting abilities of the lead man are also felt sometimes, but he mostly doing his job. Call Baldwin, shoot the writers, by pure accident, of course, and the show can be saved. Gave it a 7 star rating out of respect for the old man, jumping into new media. Would not watch it again, and can't recommend it to others.

Shows with less of a star in the lead can surprise for the better, this show had nowhere to go but down, and down it went. Cardboard cutouts could do the work of all the people around the lead, as empty and undeveloped they are. People get shot, and I wonder why should we care, people get added and I wonder why add them at all."
8.0,28 September 2024,"This is great series, offering almost everything we love to watch. Season 2 just released and i am happy to say that this season seems more entertaining and energetic than the 1st season, especially the way thay have added a little touch of comedy in this series, its making this show much interesting. If we talk about the actors, almost every one is doing an excellent job. Cinematography, musical effects work is done perfectly. I am really impressed with the music director of this series, songs and music selection is outstanding. Jelly roll part was amazing and his song ""i am not okay"" was a treat of ears to listen loved it."
10.0,13 May 2023,
9.0,13 January 2023,"Hopefully, they don't ruin it as the show progresses. But as things stand today - it's an incredible piece of crime-and-drama pact series. And most would disagree but with a tremendous potential to be a tough-one-to-beat series since Breaking Bad. That's right. Obviously, not in terms of its originality or character development. But with everything else. Certain plots were unnecessarily interjected for reasons I can't conclude. But no show is entirely fulfilling if your standards are unrealistic.

I should also note that you won't be as interested in the beginning as you would in the latter.

Lastly, Sylvester Stallone, aka Rocky, plays a convincing and naturally-fitting role. The man is born to play a role of an ambitious leader. In this case, a feared mob leader from Tusa, Oklahoma."
8.0,24 April 2023,"This show is actually pretty good.

I was a big fan of Sylvester Stallone as a kid with the Rocky and Rambo movies (I have an older brother). I haven't seen much of his work until the Creed movies where we saw his legit acting chops that earned him an Oscar nomination for the first installment of the series.

For Tulsa King, Sylvester Stallone plays a Mafia member recently released from prison and adjusting to his new life in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Trying to not be an ageist but at his ripe age of 76, he is kinda of sexy in this role. I wonder if there will be a season 2 because you never know these days."
7.0,18 January 2023,"This Sheridan guy has many shows out now and they all suck. Perhaps he should focus on one & then maybe one would be watchable, I tried Mayor of Kingstown, was garbage, this is garbage , none of his shows have any likeable characters, or real plot, so what is the point. ( to spread political correctness maybe) Entertainment is supposed to make us feel something, sad, happy, scared, anything to escape from reality, well, I feel nothing but more bored half way thru both of his series and I'm now pretty sure Sicario is the only thing that I've liked from Sheridan. Just garbage. How these shows get 2nd seasons is beyond me."
9.0,20 January 2023,"I honestly don't understand all the bad reviews, it seem like people we're looking for a Deep story Mob show like Sopranos or Boardwalk Empire.. But the trailer gave nothing that would even point in the direction, You get exactly what they show you, pretty decent acting , action , and storytelling. Plus the dialogue was pretty hilarious, and I was Definitely impressed with Stallone change of tone for this character. Tulsa King is its own show, with a few HBO heavyweights in it as well

Overall I give it a Solid 7/10, Prime really stepped their game up with this show , and i never leave reviews."
7.0,18 September 2024,"Wow, love, love, love this series. Sylvester Stallone is amazing, His acting is by far the best since his Rocky days. He doesn't usually take the main character in most his movies which I don't understand why. This series is both funny and action. All the actors are great but can't beat Stallone. He is still such an amazing actor and he is HOT. Do not hesitate watching this series. I can watch it over and over. Great job, Stallone. I have been a fan since I was a kid. Keep taking those main character roles and keep making more Tulsa series. When it run outs start another series. He is to talented to stop."
10.0,6 February 2023,"You don't have to be a Stallone fan to like the lead character but it helps. The plot is very much the same as Lilyhammer (which is also a 9 even if it starts slow)... but this one is set in the USA not Norway and US version much less comedic! (So far... I've only watched 1 season)! Would be great to have Van Zandt make cameo and it's nice to see some favorite old actors make cameo appearances (see if you can find them)... Stallone is aging and voice is rough but it fits the character! Overall very good acting and storytelling! Way too many commercials so advise streaming without them. Very little ""woke"" in my view! I'd give it a10 except it's a bit predictable and costars could use a bit more background and depth! Overall it's one of the best on TV... (I know, these days that is not necessary complementary)"
3.0,21 January 2023,
8.0,27 March 2023,"Stallone makes his debut on television with this off-beat series about a mobster realizing his mortality. The first 5 episodes are fantastic as it builds the world around Stallone's character, but the last 4 episodes start to peter out into just typical gunfights and fistfights.

Stallone plays Dwight Manfredi, a mobster who did 25 years for murder. Once he is released, his former mob family wants nothing to do with him, so the new boss, Chickie (Domenick Lombardozzi) banishes him to Tulsa where no mob family has a controlling interest. Once there, Dwight meets Tyson (Jay Will), an Uber driver who he hires to be his personal driver. He then muscles in on a medical marijuana dispensary run by Bodhi (Martin Starr) and forces him to take him on as a partner to launder money. Dwight also runs into a former mob informant, Armand (Max Casella) who thinks Dwight is there to kill him. Adding to his new ""family"", he befriends local bar owner Mitch (Garrett Hedlund), also an ex-con. Stallone's own daughter, Scarlett, appears as a barista and later horse trainer named Spencer.

The first 5 episodes are superb. We learn a lot about Dwight's past: his wife divorced him while he was in prison and he has not spoken to his daughter, Tina (Tatiana Zappardino) since going to prison. He gets romantically involved with Stacy (Andrea Savage) an ATF agent and Margaret (Dana Delaney) who owns a local horse farm. He also locks horns with a local bike gang led by Waltrip (a menacing Ritchie Coster), whose turf Dwight has invaded. There is also a local Native reservation on which Mitch's bar resides and whose inhabitant, Jimmy (Glen Gould) provides Bodhi's product. Jimmy has a sidekick named Bad Face (Jonathan Joss) who is a towering, scary Native. He doesn't speak much but is an impressive screen presence and actually has a cool sense of humor. He is used very little and disappears after like episode 6. That was a very curious decision by the creators.

The beauty of the first five episodes is how Dwight adjusts to not only freedom, but Tulsa. There are jokes about his age (Stallone is 75!!), his lack of awareness of new technology (he doesn't know what Uber or phone apps are) and his learning about life in the Southwest (a strange white horse trots around downtown and no one seems to mind). He's got tensions on all sides as his former mob family wants him disposed of (the older retired Don won't allow it), the bike gang wants him dead, and his daughter won't speak to him. Not to mention he is on the radar of the FBI and ATF.

All of this should have made for a modern day Sopranos. Instead, the last 4-5 episodes just become a series of fist fights and shootouts. The writing becomes weaker for the latter episode and the plot gets looser instead of tauter. While this is a fun, exciting series, I don't see it lasting very long because it doesn't appear to be interested in taking its time with the characters. For instance, his relationship with his daughter get resolved in like 2 episodes. They have not seen each other in 25 years, but it all gets glossed over. This should have been a 2-3 season arc for these two alone. There is not a lot of machinations or ""court intrigue"" for a movie with ""King"" in the title like in a classic Godfather or Sopranos world.

This show has much more in common with the Cinemax series, Banshee, than with the Sopranos. Every episode is a gun or fist fight and despite it supposedly being a small town, there is a lot of crime which no one seems to notice. While Banshee also included a ton of sex and nudity (Ivana Milicevic is a goddess), Tulsa King has a limited use of profanity for a show about mobsters and only one sex scene, with no nudity. Otherwise, they both start out really well creating the characters and then just have them either fighting or shooting each other. The final showdown is about as bland and unoriginal as you can get and has been done much better in just about every 90 minute movie on Netflix. I was really disappointed by the last two episodes.

The first 5 episodes deserve a 9 while the last 4 episodes are a 5. I gave this a 7 overall. Hopefully, season 2 gets better."
10.0,19 October 2023,"Sly man.... he's old, i feel like he is going away, this thing is a gem, really a privilege to see him on screen in such a good form .

This man impacted so many generations of people and inspired us to become better .

Now, the film i high level stuff, usually tv shows tend to be a stretch and use filler scenes to drag it out or have it make sense.

But this thing is like an ongoing movie , i didn't even realise i was already halfway through .

There was probably a big budged for it, but the writing is also top notch, i just enjoyed it a lot and forgot i was there , that happens when real cinema is done right .

We need more ."

10.0,18 September 2024,"High expectations and it's worth it., Stallone gives an excellent performance. The show has promising depth characters are genuinely likable across the board. While it's not unusual to root for a ""bad"" guy as the protagonist, his directness and old world commonsense values appeal to those of us looking for something refreshing amidst today's social nonsense. Irony in the message is that it takes a thug who bows down to no one to smash through and expose the shallow social hypocrisy. This is the same formula that made Yellowstone such a success, and Sheridan knows this is what so many of us want..!? Greatings for the series!"
10.0,1 January 2023,"Tge writing is barely C+ , storyline is predictable and SO SLOW! When something does happen it is just the typical ""Sopranos/ Sons of Anarchy"" violent, already been done, predictable writing. Does not suck you in even though it desperately tries over and over. This is background noise at best, very boring.

Just watch Sopranos or SOA, those are at least worthwhile. We wanted to give Sly a shot but we just could not continue watching it. Could care less about the characters and what happens. Once again everyone raves about something that is just all hype and no delivery, this is no where near as great as everyone claims it is."
9.0,13 November 2022,"Stallone is back, and at his best, This is Stallone going back to his younger days, with the exhibiting the kind of towering, megawatt, likeable and funny even when he's knocking someone out, and the charisma that we have forgotten how good Stallone can be at, but good to see he hasn't. The story is very much banished by his old crew after 25 years in prison, and sent to Tulsa, and belief he would probably go quietly, but Stallone has other ideas, and from the moment he hits his first shop, he looks to start his own business up, plenty to enjoy in this show, and I think Stallone has a hit on his hands."
3.0,14 July 2024,"Insanely Cool slow action thriller that will leave the audience wondering that why there aren't any other series like this one. This series is a 10/10 and deserves for appreciations. It was Super simple and Superb work, and ticks all the boxes that a series needs. Sylvester Stallone as we know is a master character and many might have been following the series because of him. I hope, season 2 will be a blast as well and we'll see more interesting drama in that. The way the director ended season 1 didn't seem like it was going to be so long, but with the popularity of 'Tulsa King' the creators are intentionally forced to come up with season 2, great work."
9.0,18 September 2024,"This is a great show! Sylvester Stallone should get an Emmy for this. He plays the role so perfectly--he embodies the character. Love the attitude & he is one Sharp Dressed Man! Love the shoes & ties especially. The writing is superb, and the story premise is great. Couple of scenes have been over the top, but again Sly plays every scene and line at the top of his game. His supporting ""crew"" are outstanding as well. Love his ""chauffer""--he is the perfect #1 to Sly--they have natural chemistry. Can't help but cheer for all of them every step of the way. Hope this stays on for quite a few years!!!"
10.0,28 August 2023,"I was a little skeptical of this at first; I mean, come on, Sly Stallone playing a gangster in Oklahoma? Just another fish out of water plotline, right? Little too cliche. Boy, was I wrong.

Tulsa King combines great writing, great actors, and great acting to produce an extremely entertaining series. Stallone is perfect as mobster Dwight Manfredi. His mannerisms are a little on the nose, but I found them to add to the fun of the character he plays. The supporting cast, including Andrea Savage, Max Casella, Martin Starr, and Jay Will, among others, are perfectly cast and play their roles to perfection.

I'm truly hoping for a season two!"
9.0,10 December 2022,"Please make more seasons!!! Stallone your character is funny and very realistic man. My pops and I started watching this and just wow what a performance so far. Keep grinding! Have been watching you since rocky balboa, rambo, all the movies man I can't wait to see what Tulsa King has to offer more down the road i am really looking forward to it. Dang i miss in the city too i was working around that area you was in the first episode. I was like no way Sylvester Stallone is here in the city filming right now! Hey god bless your soul, your still young keep on filming please this is the best thing that's happen. Thank you."
10.0,19 January 2023,"I really had no expectetions whan I started watching this, after the first couple of episodes the series become intense and interesting. I really liked the acting and authenticity of the mafia culture. The good amount of violence is very very well placed.

I definitely love mafia related shows, but this one I like A lot. People will say I am crazy, but I loved the script a lot more than the one of Soprano's.

In a nutshell, I highly recommend the people people that like such movies to give this one a chance, they will not be dissapointed.

I cannot wait for season 2 and I really hope Paramount will continue making the show."

9.0,8 April 2023,"Enthralling TV series that explores the story of an ex-godfather's return to the underworld after his release from prison. The show's standout feature is undoubtedly the brilliant portrayal of the lead character by Sylvester Stallone, who gives a captivating and powerful performance. The character's transformation throughout the series is a testament to Stallone's skill as an actor, and his chemistry with the rest of the cast is impeccable.

The series boasts an intriguing theme that keeps the viewers engaged throughout, and the musical score perfectly complements the scenes, adding to the overall ambiance. The series effectively portrays the underworld and the complex web of relationships that exist within it. It's a great showcase of the writer's talent for creating complex and engaging characters that keep the audience hooked.

While the series is a masterclass in storytelling, it does have one flaw that may leave some viewers disappointed: the ending. Without giving away any spoilers, the conclusion feels somewhat rushed and doesn't fully deliver on the promise of the earlier episodes.

Despite this, ""The Return of a King to the Underworld"" is still an outstanding series that will leave viewers wanting more. The performances, storyline, and direction are all superb, and it's definitely worth watching for anyone who loves a good crime drama. Overall, I would rate this series a 9 out of 10 for its excellent execution and entertainment value."
5.0,14 January 2023,"What an ABSOLUTE amazing Series. Taylor Sheridan has hit another one out of the ballpark. With Yellowstone, 1883, 1923 and now TULSA KING, his writing has got us all hooked.

With having Sylvester Stallone as the STAR, We already wanted to watch it.

Sly plays Dwight Manfredi, a former FAMILY member in the Mob who was just released from prison after 25 years.

The ""Family"" wants him out of New York and sends him to TULSA of all places!

(A little reminiscent of the Series ""Lilyhammer"" Steven Van Zandt is a Mobster who needs to get out of NYC, ends up in Norway. )

Dwight finds his new ""crew"" after a couple of episodes trying to fit into Tulsa. A funny Culture Shock to be sure - adding in the 25 years in Prison he has missed a lot.

Each Episode is just as great as the previous one. Stallone has some great one liners that only he can do. He's got such personality in this series.

The entire cast is a fun group of characters. I only wish the episodes were a little longer!

I am SO happy that there will be a Season 2.

Looking forward to it."
10.0,11 April 2023,I've never loved Sylvester Stallone more...and this is the show I didn't know was missing in my life! It's original and quirky and full of humor and action and yet is somehow relatable as well. I'm binging it right now - I'm on episode 4 - and I know I'll be sad after I get through the whole thing. It's SO entertaining and at the end of every episode I cannot wait to start the next one. It's completely and wonderfully addictive. Yeah it's violent and has some dark comedy moments so it's not kid-friendly...be aware of that. But the idea that a guy out of synch with the modern world as lived in Tulsa is maybe the funniest and best fish out of water story I've ever seen.
9.0,5 April 2023,"I was totally surprised at this show. Very well written with some very clever lines interjected. I went through the whole season in five days and hope there will be a follow up. Sylvester Stallone is perfect for this role and the introduction of the other main characters just enhances the whole production. Great writers and puts a human side to the main character that otherwise would be portrayed as just another tough guy. A very well done production and really hope there is a Season 2 and more for those of us who get tired of the doctor, lawyers, police, and reality shows that seem to be the only thing that the networks can conjure up. Thank you for providing an alternative."

10.0,19 September 2024,"While I love the widescreen cinemascope ratio of this show and wish more shows would follow this format, the actual story is painfully lightweight.

It's another glossy crime boss story set in an alternate universe where unlikely events happen every day and cardboard cutout characters pop up around ever corner.

It's entertaining, deserving a 5 or 6. It's great seeing Stallone do a series. But why do they aim for the lowest common denominator of viewer intellect? Everything is predictable and formula-driven.

The playbook is easy. Maybe that's why they do it. A template-driven production guaranteed to ""meet expectations"".

Many shows have come before this in the same low-complexity, surface-deep rendering. ""Power"" comes to mind - six seasons of ""gangsta fantasy"", super-unrealistic cheese without grit.

Stallone is surrounded by cliche narrative on repeat. He's enjoying himself, and this series is one of the better cheesy series, but I expected something a bit more... demanding of more braincells.

Where are the good writers? The characters with depth? The twists and turns that make you think? I long for more shows like True Detective, Narcos, Breaking Bad, Deadwood, even Dexter had more depth."
10.0,19 July 2023,"I always thought Stallone's roles undermined his intelligence. This role shows his intelligence and his emotional I. Q. It's one of his best recent roles. The script is well written. The characters are interesting. It's fast paced storyline is framed in a great sound track.

I hope we see more depth from Sly in the future. He's more than a thug with a gun in this series. My husband and I couldn't stop binge watching this series. We watch all 9 episodes in one sitting, We liked it that much.

The violence isn't so overdone, it's well paced with the story line. Series is well done. I recommend to watch it when you have time to binge watch it."
1.0,20 December 2022,"For reference, I did not like Godfather but I really like Casino and Goodfellas.

Based on my multiple attempts to get through the Godfather trilogy, I know enough of it to say that this is a modern version of that genre. Of course it's scaled down, but it's very ""today."" At the same time it feels grand and old school. Don't ask me how. It just does.

This series and Stallone are a perfect match. If I didn't already have a subscription to Paramount+, I'd definitely get it for this series without any hesitation.

Thankfully, it's not censored. In that spirit, at the end of each episode, I yell ""dammit!"" because it's over and I have to wait another week."

10.0,15 September 2023,"I rated this series a 9 simply because of the ending. It was such a disappointment to see how they ended this series and actually made me angry. Sometimes you just want a happy ending instead of one that's realistic! I enjoyed the interaction with family and Sylvester played an outstanding role in this series. It was a very realistic series with a bit of far fetched items that the so called bad guys got away with. Without those, however, the series would have been flat and ended before it even got started. Really liked how Sylvester took care of the Boss and his crew.....Epic!! Would really like to see more of this series and the ""traitor"" get hers!"
10.0,16 August 2024,"It is very good that a movie makes you feel good. This movie gives you the feeling of freedom and the pleasure of nature and the plains of Tulsa. I am grateful to the creators of this series and I hope the new season will arrive soon.

This series gives you vitality.

It can be said for sure that this series is the best performance of Sylvester Stallone.

In this series, all the environments are filmed, which gives you the feeling of being there.

In this series, each episode becomes more interesting than the previous episode. The story of this serial movie will make you feel happy. I hope the second season of this series will be made soon."
10.0,6 September 2023,"It is incredibly unbelievable at points but the entertainment factor is through the roof. The story keeps pushing forward at a fast pace but it has great dialogue, intriguing concept and great execution of it. If you suspend disbelief at points, it is incredibly satisfying.

The cinematography, atmosphere and directing is solid. Editing has some weak points.

I am a fan of mobster movies/shows but not the biggest fan. This plays on all the typical stereotypes of mobsters and cowboys in the South, biker gangs but the stereotypes and acting is believable. Don't watch for some kind of realistic mobster show."
10.0,8 January 2023,"Boring, predictable, corny are just a few words to describe this waste of time. I kept hoping it would get better, but it only got worse. I kept asking myself if this a parody or are they using corny predictable gangster cliche's as serious dialogue. The wardrobe is disastrously ridiculous. Stallone's coats and even his shirts have exaggerated shoulder padding that is so obvious, the effort to make him look burly actually makes him look puny. The storytelling is un-be- f-ING-lieveable. The dialogue is like fingernails-on-chalkboard cringe worthy. I must admit I only watched 5 full episodes. Halfway through the 6th I had to stop; otherwise I would have damaged my screen with a projectile; the condescending misogyny is repulsive . Spoiler alert does not apply to this time suck; spoiled before it was aired."
10.0,4 December 2022,"Very interesting, relatively low-key conversations that (I am sure) had to be modified by sly himself who is, also a great writer. Very Easy to follow. In the vein of the Sopranos or Goodfellas, The humor is carefully measured and quite believable. The action is also realistic. His character, Dwight, is bright and has had nothing to do for 25 years except study. His quotes are reasonable.

The show is adding characters at a reasonable pace and makes it easy to keep everyone straight.

The background of Tulsa gives a nice flavor.... and after 3 episodes I am totally hooked by Sylvester Stallone's first-ever TV show."
1.0,15 November 2022,"Waiting for a good show like this is breaking bad Sylvester Stallone definitely knocked it out of the park had me dying for more Not too many new shows are this well written. Taylor Sheridan knocks it out of the park. First episode in and it's already one of the best series. Stallone is better than ever and he was made for this role. His acting is dead on he never misses. Always been a fan since Rocky and Rambo and a few others. Creed 2 showed he's a Hollywood contender but some of his recent movies have been really bad especially Samaritan. Acting was horrible and the movie was just a dumpster fire. He totally redeems himself here with one episode of Tulsa King. It's gritty, funny, and the mix of light action and drama is perfect. Don't miss it."
8.0,12 April 2023,"I love this show! Granted, Sly Stallone isn't Al Pacino, but what he lacks in acting skills he makes up for with effort, style and heart, and there's no denying he has presence. I am so happy to see him in a series like this, he's tailor made for it! The characters are great, especially Bodhi! This show is far-fetched at times, but it's also well-written and brilliantly paced, drama that packs an emotional punch but there is also so much humour, not silly gags, but witty one-liners that are well timed. That's something really lacking in so many modern shows, which try so hard to be funny but fall short so often. If you liked Lilyhammer, you'll love this."
10.0,31 May 2023,
10.0,24 September 2023,"The only problem with this show is I found in season one.... So now I've gotta wait!!!!

I'll be honest, it took me awhile to get around to watch this, I regret waiting. The casting script acting the humour and tension - spot on.

There wasn't any poor episodes, each one was top-notch.

Whilst I've written that this was Stallone at his best, and he is clearly the headline act, the entire cast of brilliant.

Cannot wait for season two, there may be a delay given the writers and actors strike. Which is driving me crazy, especially as naturally the last episode ended on a reasonable cliffhanger..

Roll on season two."
8.0,5 January 2023,"I wasn't expecting much and the previews weren't interesting enough to me, but I've always loved Stallone. This delivers and then some! I binged the first 7 episodes in one night. The dark humor and various characters has me laughing and cringing in almost equal measure. Now I'm frustrated that I have to wait for the next episode. It's a different ""gangster story"" with grit and a little depth and some humor. I was nervous to see Stallone as the bad guy, but trust me, it's not what you expect. I do like Yellowstone and wasn't in the mood for anything too heavy. I'm actually glad it's considered ""R rated"" as the intention and atmosphere would be lost otherwise. Eagerly awaiting Sunday..."
8.0,21 November 2022,"The best I can say for Stallone is it's amazing he can deliver his lines with a straight face. To watch this series you'll have to be a master suspending disbelief and a Stallone worshipper.

I could write a long list pointing out holes in the plot, but the quality of this production is so bad it's not even worthy of nitpicking critiques. Everything that happens is so farfetched that it simply makes no sense. It's astonishing when you think about the fact that Stallone was originally a writer. The writing is bad. But what I noticed was that when it came to Stallone's lines the writing was noticeably worse, and not just a little, a LOT WORSE!! Which leads me to thinking this is a man who has completely lost touch with reality.

Feel free to give it a try if you're angry with your lot in life and have a double digit IQ, it's possible you may feel better watching Sly operate. Otherwise don't bother

What I."
8.0,27 December 2022,"Fun show with good actors.

The concept is interesting and fun, of course there are some flaws and unnecessary things, but not much. The plot focuses on Dwight Manfredi, a mob capo who, after being released from prison, tries to start a ""business"" in Tulsa.

The characters are fun and the casting is good. There is a lot of fun in the show, mixed with drama and some dark events. Old feuds come to the surface as we follow Dwight as he uncovers some things from his past.

Sylvester Stallone does a great job in this role, especially when we follow the clash of generations where we see some things being hilarious.

After a few episodes it became clear that this series could be a great combination of drama, laughs and some disturbing stuff. The quality of this show is certainly in its characters, which are well written and layered.

What is important is that the writers try to entertain the viewer without burdening him too much with irrelevant things. Nothing is perfect, and neither is this series, but it's good enough.

One of the rare series that is worth watching these days."
1.0,13 December 2022,"This show is just brilliant.

Is it crazy to think that Stallone has done his best work at the age of 75?

Well, you better believe it.

The humour in this show is incredibly funny, and Stallone delivers constant one-liners that will just crack you up. His demeanor and delivery is perfect.

But what also makes the show so watchable and addictive is that it is so much more than just comedy. There is suspense and a deep story to it.

The actors are all brilliant , which for me is essential in making a show worth the time.

The backstory is deep and emotional, and will hook you in.

It's hard to describe unless you watch it, but the whole formula of this show is magic and really makes this special."
8.0,4 December 2022,"Let's see!! It averages above brilliant for entertainment, story like believable check! Hollywood on a TV screen Check! Fun Level 9 or 10 check! Takes me away and leaves in a good mood after watching check! Weely release check!

All the above, or 75% of it will make TV enjoyable again. #letsmaketvgoodagain.

Before anyone goes for the jugular, was a just a bit of fun writing this, but very enjoyable watch. Stallone and cast carry off a good and all round performance that looks like it has many miles on the clock for a TV series. Doesn't taker itself too serious and is fun and has violence and Ganster at the right level. Long may it continue."
8.0,13 January 2024,"SEASON ONE: 8.0 In my inaugural dive into the 2022 first season of Tulsa King, Taylor Sheridan once again demonstrates his mastery in delivering gripping narratives. Sheridan has carved a niche for himself in the film and TV realm, and he undeniably excels in it.

Sylvester Stallone, whose recent roles have often felt like echoes of his past characters, receives a refreshing change under Sheridan's direction. The seasoned actor steps into the shoes of Manfredi, a character that not only leverages Stallone's comedic abilities but also offers him his first meaty original role in years. Manfredi is a concoction of humour and badassery, making him a standout addition to Stallone's repertoire.

Sheridan's penchant for crafting morally ambiguous characters shines through once again, as Manfredi becomes a figure we can't help but root for despite his flaws. It's this nuanced portrayal that adds depth to the storyline and elevates the character dynamics.

Beyond Stallone, the rest of the cast contributes significantly to the show's appeal. Sheridan's storytelling prowess brings forth likeable characters, each adding their unique flavour to the narrative. Andrea Savage is a particular standout.

Tulsa King proves to be a highly entertaining show, seamlessly blending humour, action, and character complexity. As the season concludes, the anticipation for a second season is palpable. It will undoubtedly be intriguing to see where Sheridan takes us next in this engrossing world he has crafted. With Sheridan at the helm and Stallone in a standout role, Tulsa King establishes itself as a must-watch in the TV landscape.

8.0,25 January 2023,Why hasn't he been a mobster yet? Because Hollywood can't ever see a good thing! Some of the best actors are finding their way to tv streaming because they ain't done and you can see perfect execution over and over. It's about time for Stallone to be in the mafia. Binged the whole season in one setting. I could not get my eyes off this show. Season 2 can't get here fast enough. I only hope this will fuel actors like him to hone in on streaming because this is perfect cord cutting reason to grab a subscription. At 76 Stallone made this look all to easy as if he'd been in the mafia the whole time.

4.0,22 December 2022,"You know I never knew that Stallone can actually ACT. All the movies I have seen in him have all been big macho blow-up everything moves with no real storey, plot or acting. This series has it all, drama, suspense and humour all excellently delivered by Stallone and the cast. For once a Stallone flick actually has a commendable story + plot. Seen 6 episodes so far and LUV it. It gets you hooked and I just can't stop watching, and eagerly await the next episode.

To the Producers - please continue and make more seasons of this. Stallone is just fantastic. Can't think on any other actor who could have played his character any better."
9.0,2 March 2023,"Ok so there's plot holes all over the place, the story doesn't stand up to the scrutiny of basic common knowledge of the law, the characters are one dimensional and stereotypical but I don't care, it's great entertainment. It's a pleasure to watch TV that isn't preaching to the viewer or interjecting some living embodiment of hashtags to tick some award show diversity box.

Stallone never stuck me as the sort who could carry off a mobster role but he performs admirably. He absolutely dominates the screen, the other characters are satellites caught in his gravitational pull.

The ""boss"" biker baddie is the weak point of the story, he's just not Machiavellian or well written enough to convey the necessary menace. Other strong characters seem to pop up and then just disappear with no real follow through eg badface, the stable owners ex husband, the Brooklyn mob boss but this is perhaps set-up for season 2.

A fine television show."
9.0,6 October 2024,"It's a good series... both similar to mafia and kind of funny... good actors... interesting scenario... every episode is better than the previous episode... fun and funny and sometimes violent... in general, it's one of the series It will be remembered for years.. I hope all the producers and actors are good and happy... The beauty of the work is that it always surprises the audience... and it should be noted that in most episodes of the series, apart from violence, relationships and human issues are also discussed, and it is strange that this series is also informative. It is also bad education :) But if you are over 20 years old, you can watch it with caution and learn a little moral lesson and laugh because of the violence :)"
8.0,14 November 2022,"Just with one episode, it made me watch it twice.

Sylvester really reaching violence and comedy to the perfection, I am really surprised to see him in Tv series but I hope it doesn't end soon (at least few seasons) for anyone who want to beg for the next episodes this is it just watch it and get satisfied with every episode.

The way he act in this show is showing how the world work and it is good to see a realistic show with best acting and high levels of entertaining.

Sylvester is acting like a real mafia king and it suits him very well , no doubts it will be best tv series for years and I will personally watch all of it many times."
8.0,21 May 2024,"I'm late to the party on this one. In honesty, it's not the kind of show I would normally dip my toes into. My mum has been singing it's praises for a while, and after watching both 'Arnold' and 'Sly' on Netflix the past weekend, I thought I'd finally give this show it's day in court.

I'm currently only two episodes in, but I must say, I'm already completely invested in this and really enjoying it. I find myself completely agreeing with the handful of other reviews I've read in here saying how perfect a role this is for Stallone. Thinking on it I'm actually quite taken aback that he's never played a Don or a Capo previously. Although I'd also say that is a blessing in disguise as 'elder statesman' Stallone is most definitely a better fit for this type of role than his younger self.

The cast and performances are great right across the board, although Dominik Lombardozi's wig is almost as distracting as Nic Cage's notoriously bad top-rug in Ghostrider.

There is, however, a disclaimer I'd like to add in regards to the amount of suspension of disbelief required here. I've never personally had an issue with this. I'm a fan of entertainment, and as long as a show hits that mark, then I can run with it. Whilst my all time favourite show is The Wire, I can also appreciate The Shield. If however you have trouble when a show ventures out of absolute realism, you may find yourself taken out of this show on occasion."
9.0,5 December 2022,"I wanted to like the show and thought Stallone did a good job with what he was given, but overall, the plot bends reality too far. The problem is that the writing makes no sense. There is just no way that Stallones character wouldn't be back in jail by the end of the first episode in any even remotely realistic scenario.

An old man assaulting multiple people would get reported to the cops with the result being a quick trip back to prison. I just can't believe that people would be too scared to report him or that they would just let his bad behavior go without consequence. The show would have been much better served by having Stallones character use charm and cunning to get what he wants instead of violence."
8.0,12 January 2023,"I've never been a great Stallone fan but this role is just perfect for him and this time in his life. I recommend this without reservation ! The very beginning felt a little implausible but it has become a delight. I doubt I'll ever get to Tulsa but if I do I already have an extensive list of places to visit. The family dynamics of the show (if you accept the original premise) stack up well and develop plausibly. ... and maybe getting rid of bodies is that easy 😂. The age difference with the love interest(s) also has a plausible realty to it - or maybe that's just my wishful thinking!

Just do it!!"

9.0,21 January 2023,"Sylvester Stallone finally got his role, in which he completely shone from the very first episode. I was a little hesitant to start watching the series, so I looked up a few reviews and a story about the series, I got hooked very quickly and watched the whole season in one sitting.a very charismatic and stylishly twisted story, in the course of which new characters appear, but it is unforgettable and the story is done with a very good style. I hope the series will be extended for at least a few seasons, because it doesn't last long, and you just want to watch and enjoy it. Sly feels great in the role and this is the case when the hero-anti-hero steps in and that's it, you can only feel sympathy for what he does and how he does it, and the seriousness and cruelty in the series really do not interfere, a good time is immediately guaranteed."
9.0,19 March 2023,"While the storyline is sometimes a little over-the-top, Stallone's character, as the aging mafioso ex-cappo who is forced to reorganize his life in Tulsa, is energetic, likeable and very watchable. The series plays like a very entertaining blend of dark comedy and drama.

The dark comedy revolves around the strange situations that arise constantly. The drama revolves around everything from Manfredi's estranged relationship to his daughter to the miscommunications that begin to occur between Stallone's character, named Dwight Manfredi, and his former mobster family back in New York.

If you're a fan of Crime Dramas, whether series or movies, about the Mafia or Sylvester Stallone, you'll want to watch this. It's a great series so far, all through the first season."
9.0,17 March 2023,"About 100 years ago the headline said ""Garbo speaks"" when the first film with Garbo's voice was on the screen. So it is with Sly. He's been putting out a lot of mediocre stuff in the past few years, but here he decided to go back to acting. And it works.

You have to remember, Sly did some wonderful acting in the first version of Rambo and of Rocky. Each time, he went on to get worse and worse with each successive version, until he became a stereotype unto himself. So we know he has the ability, but where did it go?

Wherever it went, it came back. He is accompanied by a good cast, great location shots, and a pretty good script."
9.0,14 November 2022,"Sylvester Stallone is pretty good in this. Like all mobster movies we're supposed to care for the main gangster because he beats up bad guys as much as he picks on the little guy. He's portrayed as some anti-hero who sticks up for people meanwhile engaging in all things thuggish. The writer Taylor Sheridan has lost it. He was too righteous and preachy before, now with this, and his jail show mayor of whatever, is more cowboy, macho, idiocy. People portrayed in gangster movies should not be celebrated/glamorized. They are bullies and such a story, i'm surprised to see exist still in this day and age. I'm sure this is some sort of commentary on how America was made; cowboys and gangsters. So cool. Not really. I'll pass."
10.0,22 January 2023,"Stallone has surprised me with a 'diffident' character that has intelligence, awareness and just that bit of caring that you don't see all the time but is below the surface and in his character's tolerance towards dimwits where disdain would rule in other characters of his ilk . Excellent accents all round, depth of character and such a connection between them all it does feel real. Very real. I tried to watch a recent western but in the first ep there was way too much violence and, although a friend said she can't watch this due to same, I guess I didn't notice it as being as brutal, and, tbh, the script had me so involved maybe I don't notice the negative stuff. But I personally don't see the violence in this as a big thing. Typical storyline but good slant to it, some predictability to it, but again, a few moves here and there that keep it interesting and as I said, the script, the acting, Stallone is really good in this as are all, and all in all I can't wait till season 2."
1.0,3 January 2024,"""Tulsa King"" is a crime drama TV series created by Taylor Sheridan. The show follows the story of Dwight ""The General"" Manfredi, a Mafia capo who is exiled to Tulsa, Oklahoma, after his release from prison. In Tulsa, he builds a new criminal empire with a group of unlikely characters. The show has promising depth, despite the light-hearted premise of a former big shot mobster forced to make a new start in a new city after a long prison sentence. Some comedy ensues as a New York mobster finds his way around Tulsa to establish his turf using his ""old world"" ways. Characters are genuinely likable across the board. Overall, ""Tulsa King"" is a fun and engaging watch that is definitely worth checking out."
10.0,22 November 2022,"This is the show we've been waiting for and the show we need.

I put it far above Yellowstone, which isn't saying much as it has become a slowly torturous trainwreck of it's former self.

This is one of Stallone's absolute best performances, and his first ever Television or Streaming series.

I can't remember the Italian Stallion ever playing a gangster either. And he looks fantastic.

If you enjoyed Goodfellas, Anayze This, or Breaking Bad , you will fall for this story.

It is cast perfectly, filmed on location in Tulsa, and has a perfect balance of dark comedy, editing, storytelling, and above all superb directing."
10.0,23 November 2022,"I got to tell you, I was hesitant to watch this and I did go into it with a lower then expected guard. This show has really spun me in a 180. Its great and I think its probably one of the best things I have seen Stallone do. I'm only 2 episodes in like most of you all but I am captivated and cant wait for more. I love that it gives that old mob feel with a new generational vibe as well. It also has some very funny parts to lighten up the mood which is also very good. I really hope they can turn this into something that will keep us all wanting more much like the sopranos and other series. Lets Go Sly! I am very happy for him!"

10.0,14 November 2022,"Tulsa King is what every organized crime or mafia movie and TV show fan needed after years of nothing quite able to grab your interest. It delivers with an aged but very capable Stallone, and who doesn't love Stallone right? Some parts give me Lillyhammer vibes, which is an underrated show, some Sopranos vibes, and adds some fresh new takes on OC where many don't see. Putting a high ranking NY mafia capo in a city such as Tulsa is great since nobody ever makes shows about a sleepy city like Tulsa, making it an exciting weekly view where you have no idea what will happen next and everyone is oblivious to gangs, organized crime, and the mafia, which gives Dwight plenty of room to gallop. Can't wait for every Sunday now, and to see how much of Tulsa Dwight can grab up before making some very newsworthy enemies. Awesome show, and love the cast so far."

8.0,22 November 2022,"Wow! This totally surprised me as I was expecting your typical mobster story. Yes, your usual fish out of the water part of the story isn't totally original. Yet, somehow Sylvester Stallone somehow manages to make it so. Love the humor infused throughout and the way the western scenes are interspersed here and there. The show is like a western-mob series - totally unique. And Stallone fits his role perfectly. Like he was made for this role.

I really loved the first episode (so much so I watched it twice). It started setting up the cast of characters quite nicely. The second episode continued the setup of further cast. I do like the actors they have selected as they seem to mesh well with Stallone himself.

Excited to see where this all leads."

That's my take on the set-up for ""Tulsa King"". And I don't know of anyone who could've pulled this off, other than Stallone. It starts off after he does his time (keeping his mouth shut) protecting his mafia family boss. And then he learns, after all he's been through for him, there's no payout, as was promised. Now he's estranged from his real family, trying to make a new empire in someplace he considers an insult. Hijinks ensue, of course...especially when he starts a new romance with (unbeknownst to him) a federal agent. New episodes every Sunday night on Paramount+...and it's worth the wait!"
9.0,9 May 2024,"This show, every single detail proves the other other detail. What a massive flow after breaking bad, better call soul This is like carry that legacy. Producers made this badass so why wont they grow this up until that level. Next season should definitely has some prison break scene. I feel it must be. I mean come on why not. Nothing to disappoint on this. This show must run for at least 5 seasons. All above master pieces that i mentioned did that amount of seasons. I only have a one worry and its not about the show its just why they waited this much longer to use the much old version of sylvester stallone ? Think about if he was at least his 60s. But hey, That's ok this is worth it any ways."

10.0,2 January 2023,"In Tulsa King, Sylvester Stallone as Dwight Manfredi shows us how to win friends and influence people. Of course it's for the purpose of building up his own little criminal empire in Tulsa, OK, but still it's entertaining to watch as it unfolds. The creator and writer of this series Taylor Sheridan has an increasingly impressive list of credits to his name.

After doing 25 in prison, his organization exiles him from NYC to go take advantage of this opportunity that awaits him in unfamiliar territory. No one else is operating there (no one from NYC that is) so he has the whole place to himself. Or that is what we are led to believe initially. Of course there are others, such as the biker gang the Black Macadams, and he just has to find them and take over their business.

He has a knack for finding the right people to join him. And maybe a bit of luck. For example, in the first episode the cab driver who gives him a ride from the airport, becomes his driver. Pretty quickly he is going around and meeting people. Stallone plays Manfredi as such a gentleman, and has such a commanding presence, that even when he meets someone you might think would become an adversary, he ultimately convinces the guy to join up. This has happened several times in the first few episodes I've watched, and it really elevates the production. This is easily one of the 5 or 6 best streaming TV series I've watched in the past year (2022)."

10.0,30 July 2023,"Okay, I admit. I always had a weak spot for Stallone. At 16, I boxed, stood up before dawn for a run and had raw eggs for breakfast. Nevermind, I lived in the sticks in Europe and not in Philly. I grew up in the eighties, I have a weak spot for 'straight to video' movies. But that was that was then. I have no need for 'The Expandables' and such nostalgia. A bad movie is a bad movie and there are enough good movies and series not to waste time on pulp. Bad movies will not turn back time and the past is not better, I was better in the past. Stallone must have realized the same thing. He decided to play the best role in his career. He proved all his criticasters wrong. He can act like the best of his generation. I carried a candle for him, but he didn't need it. And I'm grateful. The best is not necessarily behind me. Stallone proved it. Give this man a cigar!"
3.0,22 January 2023,"I've never been a Stallone fan. But he is excellent in this series. He stretches his acting abilities and while still a ""tough"" guy the writing shows a softer side of his abilities in a character type not usually portrayed by him.

Watching an out of the game mobster start over and find people outside of the ""family"" he cares about makes this series a must watch. I was hooked from the start and while it does have a measure of violence I was happy to see it was not so over the top as so many shows today are. When all the strife comes to a head you're just starting to believe Dwight is going to make it all work until betrayal rears it's head."
8.0,5 April 2023,"Tulsa King (2022)

Solid Entertainment

Episode 1: ""Go West, Old Man"" Episode 2: ""Center of the Universe"" Episode 3: ""Caprice""

A well-written series that plays skillfully on several registers, based on the charisma of Sly, pleasant characters to root for from leading roles to extras, and the refreshing charm of Tulsa, Oklahoma, which we are not used to seeing in cinema and on television.

Great Acting

Episode 4: ""Visitation Place"" Episode 5: ""Token Joe"" Episode 6: ""Stable""

Development keeps getting more and more interesting with a brilliant performance by Sylvester Stallone and other cast members.

The End of the Beginning

Episode 7: ""Warr Acres"" Episode 8: ""Adobe Walls"" Episode 9: ""Happy Trails""

Episodes 1, 2, and 3 introduced most of the characters and locations. Then, episodes 4, 5 and 6 developed their personalities and interactions, with all the brilliance of the performers who also excel in this conclusion to the first season in episodes 7, 8 and 9. A falling action that reveals some of the events of the past that led to the current situation, and which ends by promising an officially renewed second season just as exciting, if the episodes continue to be written and acted with such conviction. A brilliant group led by Sylvester Stallone and Taylor Sheridan, who achieve a teamwork deservedly rewarded by the nominations of Best Series and Best Actor at the Critics Choice Awards."
10.0,23 March 2023,"I must say this show blew my mind! Its all that mafia drama you've missed over the years with a TWIST! Best of all, amazing actor's and writing. I'm bummed there is only 9 episodes so far!!! I have now told everyone I know about this show and its crazy we didn't even know it existed till now! I couldn't stop once I started watching sooooo good!👊 I wasn't too sure starting in with episode 1 but then, man it was amazing! I miss the good ole movies like this, tjey don't make em like this anymore! Muah on this one. I really can't wait to see season 2! Sylvester still has it and he show's it off in this. He says don't count my ass out yet! I have friends who purchased paramount just for this show. It leaves you with enough to wonder, wtf then it also sums up the first season beautifully. I can't say enough good things about it. It has the mix of everything for everyone. If you've ever been to Tulsa you'd understand this, if you've ever been to New York or Chicago its right up there! Just watch and see it for yourself! I liked it so much I had to find a way to leave a review. I'm just getting started too!"
9.0,15 July 2023,"My husband started watching this on a flight and he came home and ordered the 1st season. Honestly, I have never really been a Stallone fan. Of course I have seen his movies but this show really shows his incredible talent. He fits his character like he was born for it. He is absolutely incredible, he just comes in and takes over. This role fits him to a tee. The whole cast & characters are great.

What a clever spin on a Mob show. Finally I am so glad to see a quality series. I don't know why they called this a comedy, it's far from that. There are funny moments by no means is this a comedy.

I am looking forward to the next season."
9.0,14 August 2023,"The Legend Is Back. Welcome back to Tulsa Mr. Rocky. Tulsa King is a must-watch series standout performance by ""TheGeneral"" Sylvester Stallone. The show is Entertaining and hilarious, It has the perfect blend of fun and serious moments. I wish that Stallone picks a different genre, he always chooses to be a mafia man, but I was surprised that he did it so well. I can see Rocky and Rambo but I was not bothered. The old, tough and grumpy mafia man but with a totally different flavor. I can't wait until season 2.. I can't wait until the second season. Keep it up old man! You deserve all the success."
9.0,14 November 2022,"Like everyone else, the star power of Stallone starring on the small screen made me check this series out, but after two episodes i'm out. It's a bust.

Upon heading to Tulsa at his mob bosses behest after 25 years in jail, the laughable premise of Sly spontaneously walking into a local *legalised* and crime free weed store offering 'protection' for a cut of the vast profits makes zero sense. And so it begins, and so it goes... Further to the ridiculous screenplay the main problem here is the show doesn't know if it's a comedy, a serious gangster story or a redemption piece but hey ho - Stallone is in practically every scene, being Stallone, so who cares, right.

You can pretty much guess where this is all heading as Sly parodies himself and the mob in pursuit of building an Okie empire with the ATF hot on his tail and the cheesy one liners comin' at you like an angry Al Capone armed with a baseball bat.

A few plus points are some decent cinematography, editing and casting but the weak storyline, cartoonish characters and cringey script make this Stallone retirement vehicle all rather... expendable. Ignore all the bogus glowing reviews (and markdowns) here from obvious plants because as De Niro et al would say - 'forget about it'. Back to the Rocky box set then while the many Stallone acolytes watch this dud in between re-viewings of Cobra and Over the Top."
10.0,28 January 2023,"""Tulsa King"" (S01, 9 eps, 35-42 min, Paramount+) is the latest gem from popular creator/writer Taylor Sheridan featuring Sylvester Stallone - in his FIRST tv show - as a fresh-from-prison gangster exiled to Tulsa. The show also features his real-life daughter, Scarlet, in a minor role, also her first tv appearance. The shortish nine episodes fly by pretty quickly as it's tough to try to watch this night to night, instead, you'll want to binge all at once. The pacing is good, the casting/acting/directing/writing and production values are all first class. Inside this first season his character, Dwight Manfredi, manages to get on the ""we must kill him"" sides of a rival crime gang in Tulsa and his former ""family"" in NYC. The season finale ends with a you-saw-it-coming betrayal which could return him to prison. A sophomore season has already been green-lit but will we have to wait a year or more to get another paltry 8+ eps?"

10.0,2 January 2023,"I have to admit, I thought another ""gangster"" movie would be just a waste of time, but Sylvester Stallone has made this a true hit series. The emotional range of not only the character, but the shows direction, draws the audience in like actually living in Tulsa and being a part of the situations. I don't want to include any spoilers here so you'll have to watch it to understand. What I can say is that the diversity of the various characters, the fact that this is set in the modern Midwest, and the storyline, will drag you in like no other. You'll start to feel the characters reactions because of the fine acting and the believable storyline!"
10.0,28 December 2022,Talk about a fish out of water story- it doesn't get any better than a hardened Mafia criminal landing in the middle of Oklahoma. Stallone absolutely knocks it out of the park as Dwight Manfredi and the supporting cast is equally incredible. Every episode weaves is full of twists and some unexpected turns A perfect mix of dark humor and drama makes this another hit from Taylor Sheridan. The writing is impeccable and the storylines just pull in. This has become my Sunday morning show to watch . You wont regret giving this one a try- and then you'll be hooked on it too. Wish there were more shows of this caliber on tv.
9.0,16 January 2023,"Once again Stallone delivers the goods in a fantastic tale of Newly released Mafia Gangster (don't call him that) Dwight ""The General"" Manfredi. He's ""gifted"" the City of Tulsa to build a new empire to carry out shady dealings for the Mob. This is where the crazy, unbelievably fun begins. He blasts into town and just takes whaqtever he feels like, enrolling a motley crew of characters unlikely associates as he meets them along the way. Leave your expectations at the door. Open the fun loving part of your brain and give this series a try. You won't regret it. A well deserved 9 from me. Loving every episode so far."
10.0,19 February 2023,"This show is fantastic!! I've always loved Sylvester Stallone and he's done it again!!! You know a show is REALLY good when they don't have to put nudity/sex scenes in it to keep certain viewers. We don't watch many series anymore because of the unnecessary sexual content and nudity in almost everything, so it was such a nice surprise and relief to be able to watch something and not have to grip the remote prepared to fast forward through a scene. Those scenes ruin shows anyway. This show has none of that and has a great story line and is just an overall great show! I can't wait for season 2!!"

I'm so glad you bring up how outrageous the world is now, & NONE of them get it.

Your wardrobe is just perfectly opposite..but, finding a western tailor?

Your storyline about the daughter is great! Maybe, a son you never knew about is trying to get a hold of you? But, NOT right away..just stick to what you're doing!!

Just wanted to put enough words so this might post.

We're the same age,so I've been in love with you too."
8.0,14 November 2022,"Ladies and gentlemen my guy Sylvester Stallone is currently 76 yrs young ! And has managed to give us a completely new character to fall in love with . This show is a throwback to the good old days when movies like goodfellas and Casino ruled our theaters . Sold writing great looking cinematography and old school kick but gangster vibes lol with a twist of modern life ! All I can say is. ""yes"" give me more episodes to devour ! I'll be looking forward to see where they take this ,hopefully they don't slack off on the writing and with success are able to pump up the budget which I'm sure would just add to the potential of this new jewel ."
9.0,15 November 2022,"A phenomenal TV series. Stallone embodies 80s gangster perfection. The filmography and story is great, the videography is picturesque and the cast is well thought of. Love the story line. Can't wait for the next episodes..

For his age, Stallone really knows how to capture audiences with his attitude, voice and personality. He is tough as nails and there should be more series like this, which displays what true reality is and what it takes to get places in life as a badass.

I don't condone being a gangster but certainly be assertive in life and set your standard high.

Looking forward to more episodes."
8.0,14 November 2022,"That was fantastic!!!!

The build up promised a cross between Sopranos and Yellowstone and I was nervous going in, having had big promises disappoint many times - but Sly looks to have found the perfect role and it feels as much a cross between Sopranos and Yellowstone as you could wish for.

Well done everyone involved, it's gritty and funny in all the right places, it's got the markings of a classic. Let's hope it continues to impress beyond episode 1 and before you know it we are watching season 5!

I think a rewatch of EP1 is on the cards as a I can't wait a whole week for another fix.

Top marks."
10.0,8 January 2023,"The show is awesome... but we get all the spoilers here in Norway, because the episodes show up 1-2 weeks later on SkyShowTime than the official airing.

I wish we could stop doing this.. the world is so up to date now, that no matter where you live, the plot will be spoiled for everyone who does not get the chance to see it at the same time as the US.

It makes me sad to know some services are still so slow to adapt to a global digital world. It is most likely one of the largest reasons some people choose to download from other sources. I won't do that.. but if I get the final spoiled online, I will most certainly loose all interest in the show."
10.0,21 December 2022,"I just dont understand the high ratings for this show!

It slow, boring, predicatble, cliched and above all else BORING!

The story is soooo dry and i have wtched this to help me fall asleep in the eveing, i guess this show does have a purpose then!

Why did Stallone star in this poorly written drama? It like something could potentially happen and then it doesnt. I am very disappointed with this drama and would advise you to maybe watch something like Home Alone, there is far more action in that than Tulsa King.

PLease Sly make something that is exciting and worth watching, i dont think you need to take on roes for the money...so get some quality work out there!"
10.0,15 November 2022,The show is abit far fetched but it gives it a certian charm an its fun to watch its not convuluded an dull like some shows like this could be in other words it's not trying to take itself to seriously an the first episode flew by because of that. Sometimes a show don't have to be really serious for it to be a good watch it has a sense of a dramedy about even an I'm looking forward to see the rest of the series to see where they go with it. It's not going to be the sopranos an that's fine but it's a tv show you can watch for 45 mintues every week an it won't feel like it's dragging or anything.
5.0,14 November 2022,"I've been following Stallone on IG for a long time and I've been seeing some pics and videos from this production. I really hoped it would be good, and after the first episode I'm all fired up!

I'm so happy we have a good old type of gangster show with some humor and class. Also it's good and about time we drop a bit of all this politically correct stuff. This is just straight forward. No need to complicate things. I am an old man and I'm tired of all the stupid CGI stuff that are made a thousand a dusin.

This is a fresh break from all the over the top action and (Yes, I know what I did there) it's easy pasted and fun. Thanks to the whole team behind this, for making something simple and fun, yet complicated in it's own way. I'm very excited for the rest of this season."
10.0,27 May 2023,"Sylvester Stallone brings us this crime drama with a somewhat slow narrative, but its plot is a fascinating story like The Godfather. The protagonist is a mobster trying to rebuild his empire in modern times. Sylvester does not lose the enthusiasm that characterizes him and even adds some of his humor to the character. Dwight Manfredi is a classic mobster movie character with grace and a deep story about how his years in prison affected his bond with his only remaining relative. Even the bond he establishes with a federal agent gives the story mobility. Tulsa King is a series that manages to adapt a classic mobster story well to the most current times and that makes it a good proposal. My final rating for this series is an 8/10."
10.0,4 April 2023,"Stallone is a rock star, movie star, mafia star, he is a legend. He played a great role. It suits him best being a mafia/gangster. Classy and powerful.

Sylvester Stallone is iconic, he is a true Hollywood legend whose talent and dedication leaves an indelible mark on the world of cinema.

This TV series is very entertaining and full of unexpected events, the overall performances of all actors are great.

I was also surprised to see Sylvester Stallone in a TV Series. I don't think any other actor could have played this role.

Shootout to Taylor Sheridan for this amazing work.

Looking forward to watch the second season."
9.0,15 September 2024,"I absolutely loved the first season!

It is a little bit like ""Lilyhammer"" which I also loved.

But this time a New York mobster does not end up in Norway but in Tulsa - which to to him is equally as strange.

There, in Tulsa, Stallone tries to build a new criminal empire with the local yokels - and it is absolutely hilarious!

The first season was full of quirky (but believable) characters, it was very funny but also had some thrilling and dark moments.

I've never been much of a fan of Stallone but in this case he absolutely nailed the role.

So much so that I think no other actor could have done it as good as he did.

I highly recommend this series and I am looking forward to watching the first episode of the second season today!"
9.0,5 January 2023,"I was skeptical that Stallone could carry a series by himself, but there's a great group of thespians alongside him that execute a well written story which is constantly evolving and piquing your senses. A very believable storyline that unfolds amidst a seemingly improbable setting (Tulsa) to yield a highly entertaining ride through a fusion of cow town/NY mob/biker cutthroats. A wonderful new Xmas classic!

I feel deprived that they made only 8 episodes (which I blew though over two evenings). The production is peppered with clever moments that endear the characters and create a bonding amongst them.

I probably extol too much, but after being disappointed recently with so many well-rated productions, it's so satisfying to get a program that truly delivers."
9.0,15 November 2022,"Not terrible but, not great either. Two problems with it. First, it seems like a direct rip off of Lilyhammer with Steve Van Zandt. Further, Van Zandt brought a lot more charisma and humor to the part. Second problem, do we really want to be cheering for a gangster setting up illegal activities? Is this really the hero for our times? Are we supposed to root for him extorting money from a pot shop? Perhaps the storyline will change or perhaps not. Personally, I'd rather watch the first Rambo movie again. I suppose the fans will decide for themselves if a lowlife is worth rooting for. I may try one more episode or not."
8.0,26 November 2022,"Love, love, love this show. Sylvester Stallone does an amazing job. Taylor Sheridan does it again. Great cast of characters and am so excited to see where this goes! Brody will be a fan favorite! Great writing and great delivery! Very easy to follow the storyline. Literally 10 minutes into the show you can tell everyone is settled into their characters. Love the mix of old school meets new world challenges.

There are so many ways this storyline could go, and I know it will be a fantastic ride as the season progresses. I would love to have a Taylor Sheridan channel with nothing but his content."
1.0,14 September 2024,"I honestly believe that this is like right up there with everything that he's done and it's probably on the top list of things I never get tired of watching. I'm of a younger generation but I grew up on Rambo with my dad then later on it was The Expendables and now it's this and I love it. It has everything a good story needs and the way he performs in this show is beyond anything I ever expected, it was like he was made for this role and everything up till now was just prepping him for it because that is just how good he performs in this series. I honestly can't wait for season 2 to come out which is tomorrow and I hope and pray that they'll be many more seasons to come."
9.0,23 January 2023,"Stallone re-invents himself again. If you grew up with him he's our under dog, champion, crazy war hero and mercenary. It is very cool to see him taking on the role of a nasty criminal that pretends to care about anybody other than, himself...which is how real gangsters are, it's all about earning and he gets the ""GO"" from the start.

The casting and director made 1st class decisions on this one because there is chemistey abound in this tome. You got a rag tag goodfella exiled to tulsa, ok...he makes the best of it. If you love Stallone and crime dramas...this is a golden experience to see him give us a new version of him. Check it out."
8.0,18 December 2022,"Sly seems to know the formula for coming up with very likable characters, no matter what their lifestyle. Tulsa King has a slight feel of The Sopranos meets Ozark. Storyline is pretty good so far and good cast mix of 'knowns' and 'unknowns.' His driver, Tyson, adds a fresh and interesting dynamic to the story, and the bartender, Mitch (Garrett Hedlund), creates a strong presence that seems to be commanding more attention (around ep. 6). At first, I didn't realize he was played by the same guy who played Brad Pitt's young cousin in the movie ""Troy"". He also played the younger brother of Mark Wahlberg in ""Four Brothers"". Very versatile actor! I expect TK to pick up steam and develop into a solid series."
8.0,2 April 2023,"""Tulsa King"" is a captivating television series featuring the legendary actor, Sylvester Stallone. The series delves into the narrative of a notorious New York-based mafia, who after serving a 25-year prison sentence, is released into society. However, rather than returning to their familiar stomping grounds in New York, he is tasked with establishing a new criminal empire in the remote and distant location of Tulsa, Oklahoma.

This gripping storyline showcases the challenges and hurdles that he must face in establishing their new base in Tulsa, far removed from their previous home turf. With intricate plot twists and turns, viewers are taken on an enthralling journey that explores the complexities of organized crime and the human condition.

The acting prowess of Sylvester Stallone further adds to the show's appeal, bringing to life the multi-dimensional characters and immersing audiences in the intricate web of relationships and dynamics within the show's narrative. Overall, ""Tulsa King"" is a must-watch for any aficionado of gripping crime dramas, offering a fresh and intriguing perspective on the genre with good writing and music."
9.0,19 August 2023,"Tulsa King is another Taylor Sheridan hit series on Paramount+. Sylvester Stallone acts as Dwight ""The General"" Manfredi named after Dwight Eisenhower who was just released from prison after serving 25 years for murdering someone who snitched against the mafia family. Upon his release he is exiled to Tulsa, Oklahoma to set up his own empire with his own ragtag crew. Jay Will acts as his driver, Martin Starr as the local pot dealer, Garrett Hedlund as a bar owner and operator, Max Casella who was part of Sly's group and is hiding out in Tulsa, Dana Delaney as a ranch owner along with Andrea Savage who was the local authority who also falls for Sly. Ritchie Coster acts as the leader of biker bang who has been dealing drugs in the area. Sly also has to deal with his former mafia family headed by A. C. Peterson and his son Dominick Lombardozzi. Love the characters, the series, the infamous quotes from Stallone, can't wait for the follow up seasons."
8.0,6 December 2022,"If you're into guys bursting with power and confidence, no matter how stiff in the hip they come across, then you've come to the right place. The washed-up stud Stallone - admittedly not aging badly - celebrates an incredibly silly one-man show with an extremely thin story and without the slightest premise. He and the car - an Escalade, of course, the mute main character, who is apparently contractually guaranteed to be highly present in the frame every 2 minutes - his black driver, who would also like to be a mobster, and a few completely unimportant supporting characters populate the set. Tulsa presents itself as a city full of clumsy farmers and stupid inhabitants who have been waiting for a superman to show them the ropes. Entertainment that is hard to undercut in terms of content and relies solely on an old horse. Shuddering."
10.0,18 December 2022,"This series is very enjoyable in our house. It's not Godfather, but it feels like it with the style Mr Stallone gives us. The complete cast is great, they all fit perfectly into the story. It goes from start to finish of every episode, leaving a desire for what's next but satisfying enough to wait till the next episode.

We just don't get as many shows like this and its a shame. The gang is a mix with each actor perfect in the parts they play, I look forward to season two already and the producers should be proud. I hope they will beable to keep M Stallone on the payroll you can tell he is enjoying it."
4.0,11 January 2023,"Years ago, who would have thought that Stallone would be more than a boxing hero? In this series, he surpasses himself and delivers an exciting and entertaining character. Coming out of nowhere, the series is a small masterpiece and entertaining from the start. I don't think any other actor could have played this role like that. The appearance of the now old Stallone alone is easy to convince. Sometimes there is not much more to it than a look or a smile from the old action hero. Just great and just the right mix of entertainment and emotional story. Absolutely worth seeing not only for action fans."
8.0,11 May 2023,"Each episode digs a little deeper, gets more complex, and more things get out of control.

Stallone is great in the role, and the rag-tag mob he employs elevate the usual Mafia drama.

Tulsa is a great backdrop for a 25 year plus convict to start over, using his skills to keep the Don and other capo's happy.

Mild infractions soon become murderous revenge and empire building. Binge worthy TV with superb writing and a brilliant cast.

If you don't know Tulsa King, it's about a mafia member who took the rap for a crime and spent 25 years behind bars. This is a story of his return to normal life, and how he manages the impact of his incarceration."
8.0,7 July 2023,"Just Sylvester Stallone alone makes this show worth watching. Every move he makes. Every word he says. Every little mimic is pure joy. He is Alpha, he is bad ass and he is funny quite often. Incredible to believe this man is 76 years old. The show itself is well written. Keeps you watching every minute. Often, when there are boring passages of a series I am on my phone scrolling and swiping. But with Tulsa King my phone lays flat on the table until the end of the show. I rarely write reviews. Heck, I even watch rarely any TV or series anymore since most are pure narrative propaganda with all the weird things going on in our world right now. But not here."
8.0,14 January 2023,"There is no deep storyline here or complicated characters. It does tend to wander a bit which seems like poor editing. However, Stallone is delightful making scenes pop and supporting actors carry their water as well. Comedic one liners are well placed and dramatic, ironic moments do not feel out of place. It's reminiscent of old school content that has been modernized which reflects the gangster who has been imprisoned for 25 years being released into a changed society. We know we shouldn't root for a bad guy but he's so charming we can't help it. So, even though it has some rough edges it's still very entertaining and a definite sit back with popcorn series."

10.0,27 December 2022,"After watching four episodes of ""Tulsa King,"" I can say it is thoroughly entertaining, mostly on the back of Stallone. To enjoy the show, however, one has to believe an aging mobster who was just released from prison can walk into Tulsa, OK and start taking the town over literally on day one. You have to buy the idea that a 75 year old, working basically alone, can terrorize people so much they start turning their money over to him. Oh, the same geriatric bad guy is also so good he's fully politically-correct (must have learned that in prison) and still manages to take the moral high ground at every turn. This man barely knows what a weed dispensary is one minute, then in no time he's telling the proprietors how to run the place and even using industry jargon like it's second-nature. And, we're to believe the fine people of Tulsa are so backwards it didn't occur to them to get a security camera or two for their business. They even have the stereotypical ""security guard"" buffoon literally eating from a bag of Cheetos while on duty. Stallone does a good job in a role that seems like it was written for him, and the overall production value of the show is good. But, if you are a thinking person in the least, you will have trouble with this one. It seems the only person in the cast with half a brain is the African-American driver Stallone hires to haul him around. That guy's family is so cool, his father, who is adamantly opposed to him getting involved in this organized crime world, goes out with Stallone's band of misfits one night to rough up some local opposing thugs. Sure, whatever works. Make no mistake, ""Tulsa King"" is entertaining in many ways, but calling it mindless entertainment is the understatement of the decade."
9.0,23 January 2023,"Probably one of the best roles played by Stallone lately.

Very amusing crime/mafia show that is easy to watch and doesn't bore. It's nothing really original or genius, however it is entertaining and it keeps you interested because of the mix of humor, dialogue, action and a well balanced cast.

It's great to see a show like this in 2022. Almost gives you a nostalgic feeling of the 90s gangster movies.

Dwight ""Stallone"" looks ever so stylish in this role as an Italian-American gangster who's been put away in jail for 25 years. After all this years it's funny to see him cope with today's society using smartphones and cryptocurrency."
2.0,12 December 2022,"This series feels like a direct ripoff off the comedy crime series ""Lilyhammer"" where Steven Van Zandt (Frank Tagliano), the wise guy who turns government witness, moves to a little town in Norway called Lilyhammer. Over there he takes over that little town and runs it with his newfound (hilariously unaware non-gangster associates). About the same thing happens to Sylvester Stallone (Dwight ""The General"" Manfredi). He's released from a long prison sentence but his boss doesn't wants him around and therefore sends him to run the small town Tulsa.

I won't spoil anything, I just gonna say, that if you were into Lilyhammer you will probably like this one too."
8.0,13 January 2023,"It is that type of TV series that we are always happy to return to. If viewers don't have to get up in the morning for work, they would most likely watch the entire season in one evening. You're just curious to see what happens next. Very well written, special attention is paid to small details and an attempt is made to faithfully depict everyday life. This is what viewers want, as realistic as possible. Several times during the season, you will have a good laugh at the high-quality humor. Perhaps the only negative is the feeling of haste in the last episodes, as if they wanted to shorten the number of episodes, the feeling of incompleteness due to premature preparations for the next season. It is wrong to make a TV series with an eye on future seasons. One gets the impression that this impairs the overall quality of the final product, i.e. Season one. Regardless, I look forward to future episodes."
9.0,16 November 2022,"Wow, and I mean wow. What a great vehicle for Sly Stallone. Have not had this much fun watching a new show since the first episode of Yellowstone. Of course this one has Taylor Sheridan's fingerprints all over it. Great pacing, clever dialogue and fantastic supporting characters. Every actor in this show is on their A game. Cannot wait to see where Dwight's (Sky's character) adventures lead. This is Tony Sopranos meets the Midwest. A delicious city mouse lost in the country tale, and not only adapting, but thriving. The irony of the story is how a long time made man, dropped in the middle of nowhere, somehow uses all of his vast life experience to make his mark."

10.0,17 November 2022,"A storyline done to death. Bad guy comes to town and thinks he can take over. How many times are we going to see that lame story. Taylor Sheridan may have had a hit with Yellowstone, but this just falls flat on its face. He couldn't even remember his own story about what happens to bullying thugs in a western town. Remember the Beck Brothers? No mafioso would survive in a cowboy town like Tulsa. They would make him dig his own grave in a pasture and bury him in it (biker gang). This won't make it 2 seasons, at best. And Stallone is just being over the top Stallone. A complete waste of time and effort."
9.0,18 November 2022,"I think this will be new best crime serie in end of 2022. Sylvester Stalone will be outstanding. He is in 75 and he want to take what they owe to him, he take the city on his own old school terms. Everyday he try to achieve new contact with bosses of local bars, restaurants and others. He want to give them protection in return for little % like in Italy. Strong silent type like Gary Cooper. He got a driver o[n you own and he running to the top. They call him boss but he want to be called as his name is. Anyway good drama, looking forward to new episodes to be looking like 1st one and keep going."
3.0,14 November 2022,"Sylvester Stallone is officially back with a non pc action/comedy, he actually has great comic relief and Timing! This is for your old school action /comedy fan's. There won't be a massive intellectual storyline but as long as we get to see Stallone beat up some people I'm happy. Martin starr is also very good as the wimpy dispensary store owner, He's a very good actor and is underrated in the roles he takes on. I love watching the action stars of the 70/80/90s. It's great too see them keeping this genre alive with old school action. You don't need them to dress up in skin tight uniforms and have magical powers to have a solid action movie/ tv show. This is a breath of fresh air and I hope they keep making programs like this and keep away from superhero stuff."
8.0,19 January 2024,"Sylvester Stylone is a pure gem even at his age. This show is very enjoyable the crew behind Tulsa King deserves plenty of praise! I've seen a few by Tye Sheridan he's got incredible writing talent and Sylvester has been a legend since the 70's it's impressive he's talented many years later. I probably would've watched sooner if it wasn't a paramount exclusive I definitely would recommend to anyone a fan of crime dramas. The series is smooth, tough guy feel, thrilling, and very entertaining! The 8.0 rating is well deserved I'm glad this has been nominated and I'm sure gets better as everything flows through."
10.0,18 December 2022,"You can't underestimate the brilliance of Taylor Sheridan and the quality of what he produces. The characters in this show are well cast with Stallone fitting the role like a comfy shoe. Andrea Savage is just a joy to watch as always and the premise of the show though not new is well disguised behind the western backdrop of Tulsa.

The show has started well and only time will tell how it will be received but I like the look of the show with that dusty dirty look about it rather than the bright clear look of Yellowstone which is it's thing. Sylvester Stallone is inspired casting as Dwight and his character and look make this a real gem with the fish out of water theme well in play."
8.0,14 November 2022,"I'm literally obsessed with this show. It's extremely engaging and fun to follow. Stallone is on fire and the cast around him don't disappoint. It's hard to take your eyes from the screen. The first episode goes fast and hard. It's very funny, yet never ridiculous. No fat, just the right amount of quality entertainment. Despite great cinematography, the picture looks slightly cheap. That's the only complaint. Other than that - magnetic! Props for a fascinating idea from Sheridan and amazing execution from Winter. I've only seen the first episode, but something's telling me that we are in for a wild ride!"
8.0,28 November 2022,"If you like Sylvester Stallone, you will definitely like this! This is completely entertaining from beginning to end. I'm on the third episode, and at the end of each episode, I can't wait for the next one. Stallone is a unique actor and he brings a certain quality to all of the characters he's ever played; you can't help but love the character. Despite some parts being a little absurd and somewhat unbelievable, it is a great show that encompasses mafia style storyline along with some witty one-liners and definitely some funny moments. Stallone is a great actor and episode two had me crying laughing It's a great show! I hghly recommend checking it out!!"
9.0,7 December 2022,"As soon as he arrives in Tulsa he starts strong arming people as is there is no such thing as common sense on the part of the People he is beating up. Wouldn't they call the police? When he goes into places, unknown to the proprietors and literally takes over, I thought, this is just ridiculously not credible. If I owned a business and someone walked in and started demanding me to show him where I keep my money or he'll hurt me terribly, I'd definitely call the police after he left, not agree to his terms that he'll be back every month to collect more. Or if I got beat up by someone and had totally access to information that would track him down,, wouldn't I go to the police? In a show like Breaking Bad, everything was pretty believable, like this could really happen. In Tulsa King, I just thought, who would react this way? I couldn't get past the first episode."
10.0,22 November 2022,"This show is worth watching.a real mafia series that builds up to something big. Stallone show he is a great actor once again. He gets a role where he needs to act and show emotions. And dialog. This show will definitley come a second season and even more. We had The Sopranos. Now we have THE TULSA KING. In the first episode you just know this si getting good. And the second episode is even better. They cant be released fast enough. Stallone is born a true mobster, this is his role to play. Cant wait to see what more this will show us and how he will take over Tulsa as a king. Stallone is KING."
2.0,29 November 2022,"My first post. Didnt even know this was out until it popped up on Paramount.

The positives - Sly still has it. The kind of series where it could on for series after series....

Now the bad - Up until episode 3 it was really funny and interesting. Unfortunately I didnt realise that the other episode were not available right away so pegged it home after work to watch it and what do I find.... I have to wait till next week. Not funny Sly, not funnt at all. I cant wait until the next episode comes out and am going though the other items in the script writers catalogue (Yellowstone) whilst waiting for the next episode."
8.0,20 March 2023,"/refers to Season 1/

Despite the fact that Sylvester Stallone reprises his ""conventional"" role as mobster, his approach and skills have not decreased, often the other way round, and the creators of the Series have the ""decency"" to put him in a role appropriate for his age. Although Tulsa King is undoubtedly always with and around him, there are multiple other pleasant characters and performances so Sly does not have to ""break through"" the script on his own...

The events and background seem logical, his past and its shadows provide pleasant touching moments, and the actions and ideas of Mr. Manfredi are not always ahead or circumventing the long arm of the law... I am really content with the balanced, yet catchy approach and looking forward to the next season(s)."
8.0,8 July 2024,"I recently finished watching the series Tulsa King (2022) on Paramount+. The storyline follows Dwight, a man who went to prison for 25 years and is now out, looking forward to restarting his life. However, his ex-wife and children want nothing to do with him, and his old boss sends him to Tulsa, Oklahoma, to essentially stay out of his way. Once in Tulsa, Dwight links up with a ""legal"" weed shop and starts a new racket.

This series was created by Taylor Sheridan (Yellowstone) and stars Sylvester Stallone (Rocky), Andrea Savage (Step Brothers), Martin Starr (Knocked Up), Tatiana Zappardino (Superstition), and Jay Will (Rob Peace).

The show has a classic mob feel in terms of terminology, behavior, and mannerisms, which are then inserted into today's society. The premise works well as Stallone's portrayal of an aging New York mobster is spot-on. The dialogue is sharp, and the interactions and circumstances feel realistic. The attire, shootouts, and fights were a lot of fun. Anytime Stallone turned into a ""tough guy"" was entertaining, and his adjustments to modern society were also enjoyable to watch. This is one of those series with a full-circle beginning, middle, and end that closes the story perfectly and would be fine with or without a second season.

In conclusion, Tulsa King is a unique gangster series with authentic characters and engaging circumstances. I would score this series a 8/10 and strongly recommend it."

""Hi"" is a common greeting used to acknowledge someone's presence or initiate a conversation. It is often used in casual and informal settings, but can also be used in more formal situations depending on the context.

Regarding the series Tulsa King (2023), I am delighted to provide you with a user review in a formal tone.

Tulsa King is a thrilling and captivating series that tells the story of a young musician's rise to fame in the Tulsa music scene. The series is set in the year 2023, and it offers an insightful perspective on the future of music and the impact of technology. The plot is well-crafted, and the pacing is superb, making it an enjoyable viewing experience.

The characters in Tulsa King are relatable, and their performances are exceptional. The lead actor delivers a standout portrayal, bringing depth and nuance to his character. The supporting cast is equally impressive, adding texture and complexity to the narrative.

The production quality of the series is top-notch, with stunning visuals and sound design that immerse you into the world of Tulsa King. The cinematography is particularly noteworthy, creating a visually stunning and engaging atmosphere.

Overall, Tulsa King is a must-watch series for anyone who loves music, technology, and captivating storytelling. It is a well-rounded and engrossing series that will leave you wanting more. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an entertaining and thought-provoking viewing experience."

1.0,24 November 2022,"Love the show, but this isn't the Tulsa I live in ! So many oil rigs and cowboy hats ! They haven't been here in a long, long time!

I understand the restaurants, hotel names, stores, etc are made up but was hoping the exterior shots would be Tulsa, with maybe some of the nicer parts too, not just the seedy side. Did enjoy seeing the downtown areas.

Sylvester Stallone is very good. I like his sense of humor in the show. Really enjoyed seeing him as an older actor. A lot different than the old Rocky movies. Dana Delaney was good too. The driver is good casting, plays well with Stallone.

I really like the show !"
5.0,21 January 2023,"The show was engaging from the start and I found myself binge-watching it, which is a rarity for me. The story was well-crafted with interesting conflict and exciting scenes featuring Stallone's character. It reminded me of the feeling I got while watching Breaking Bad, with each episode ending on a satisfying cliffhanger that left me wanting more without feeling overly dramatic.

The show had a few drawbacks, including an unnecessary and unskippable sex scene during a fight scene. The scene had no relevance to the story and the characters involved were not even established prior to the scene. The inclusion of this scene felt gratuitous and unnecessary. Another issue was the inclusion of current political themes, which felt out of place and added nothing to the story. While not as problematic as some other shows, it was still an annoyance."
1.0,28 September 2024,"Imo the IMDB score points out how much bad content is out there, produced every day, trash Netflix and other streaming platforms create to have volume, otherwise such an unremarkable show like this one will not have 8+ stars. It is not too bad but does not come close to Sopranos or Breaking Bad. It's an unremarkable gangster story with soap opera nuances, watchable but not really special in any way. Having Silvester Stalone cry is like Hulk playing ballerina ...something that no one should be put to see. I really wanted to see anything surprising but each and every event is so predictable and so from the gangster folklore that not even accidents happen. Idk, it would be a pain, but the world would be a better place if 90%, maybe 95% of TV writers would just get a different job and there will be less show but written by only top 5% of writers that trully have talent in this line of work."

3.0,15 April 2023,"The guy who created this show should stay away from mob fiction. It's got to be one of the most inauthentic mob series I have ever seen. Only Stallone fanatics will pretend to like this bland, unimaginative effortless series that stole its concept from an author's novel (Hard Time) that was based on the same author's Saturday Evening Post short story. Can anyone say ripoff?

There's no complexities to this character Stallone plays. None of the characters on the show have any depth or unique attributes. They're all interchangeable. I don't like any of the characters and they're not even convincing as real characters, much less real people.

""Tulsa King""=unoriginal, lazily written trash."
1.0,16 January 2023,"Created and written by Taylor Sheridan (Yellowstone, Mayor of Kingstown) and Terence Winter (Wolf of Wall Street, Boardwalk Empire), Tulsa Kings follows Dwight Manfredi (Sylvester Stallone), an aging New York mafia capo just released from a 25 year sentence, who is exiled to Tulsa, Oklahoma where he must restart his protection game, extorting local businesses, and getting rough with the local biker gang. A series that doesn't necessarily stick out in the writers long list of ""sometimes a punch to the mouth is a perfectly good solution"" kinda macho demographic driven shows, Stallone's performance is fairly good for a 75 year old, he does decent drama and comedy when the scene requires it. The rest is hit and miss, a few of the plots are a little bit eye-roll, and I didn't find the writing anything particularly special. If you've seen the previous works listed as loved them all, then this is definitely another to add to the list, its perfectly fine. Definitely not a reason on its own to pay for Paramount+."

3.0,13 April 2023,"This is a ripoff of Jack Bristow's much superior novel 'hard time'. Couldn't the creators have come up with a better idea than to steal a story idea from a disabled writer? How low have they sunk???? And Mr. Bristow gets no credit for this story that took so much from his book??? Incredible!

In Bristow's novel, the protagonist is more likeable. The novel is also more realistic to mob life. This series is just a goof and a bad parody of Bristow's work!

Stallone's character has no depth. The other mobsters are bland an unconvincing. B-rated acting and writing all-around.

Avoid this trash at all costs."
5.0,19 January 2023,"Nothing about this series has any intellectual value. Watching an aged actor playing a burned out mafia thug in of all places but Tulsa is nothing but boring. I'm told the review is too short. That's how I feel about this series. No substance. Annoying. No quality. Idiotic. It's not a crime show, but another old man with too many facelifts trying to recreate his career. I truly wonder the mindset of people who enjoy Tulsa King. An ex-con out of touch with reality but that's the majority of old men in this country. Out of touch with reality and wanting life to be the ""way it use to be."" Review is still too short just like Stallone who has to stand on a box to look tall."
2.0,16 July 2024,"So in Hollywood this show would be realistic...in Tulsa it's laughable that an old Right Coast gangster would fly in and claim Tulsa as his own.

There's still considerable oil and natural gas influence in T town that carries some weight...not to mention black gangs on the northside and Latino gangs on the eastside that are serious OGs who would 187 him in a heartbeat if he crossed them.

The show is entertaining but too Hollywood...do your homework.

Get to know Tulsa better...the history of petroleum...why there's still big players in natural gas...The growing rate of Native American casinos in the state...race riot history...and I guarantee you ain't gonna find weak little muhfuggers in Tulsa pot dispensaries...and a guy your character's age ain't never gonna score on a Tulsa barfly...no matter how drunk she is.

Live the Tulsa life day and night...pretty sure you'll change your storyline."

2.0,14 April 2023,"Simply put, I don't like Stallone as a gangster. Stallone is an okay actor, but he does not have the nuances of other actors who play Mafia guys like Pacino and Robert DeNiro. This Dwight Manfredi character is just a petty thug with no dimensions whatsoever. He gets old fast. I liked the character better when he was Tommy Roma from the book ""Hard Time,"" which this series rips off mightily heavily.

It also borrows liberally from ""Lilyhammer,"" but it takes from ""Hard Time"" the most.

Can hollywood come up with anything original these days?

There's not one vaguely redeeming thing about this show. The only interesting thing is the plot which has already been done before.

Boooooooo."
1.0,22 March 2023,"Scrolling through the streaming services to find a new show, I came upon this... I don't try anything less than a 7.5 on IMDb, so when I saw an actor I like and a score of 8.1, I figured how could I miss? Well, it missed. Badly. I gave it a 3 because there may have been a few likes and scenes that weren't a 1. But not many. For the life of me I can't figure out how, after 45,000 ratings, this show comes away with an 8.1. Does Stallone know that many people that he can ask to rate it highly? Has the world gone mad? 8.1. 8.1!! I can't believe what I just watched earned an 8.1. This may be the first time IMDb has failed me."
5.0,27 June 2024,"I was looking forward for the Stallone/Sheridan collaboration. But after three episodes it was clear that this is one of those series, which has an interesting premise but doesn't really know what to do with it. It is a mix of The Ozarks and Sopranos, leaning more towards the former with it's plot-driven approach. But could have been easily told with half the episodes. A lot of stuff feels meandering rather than engaging, precisely because nothing feels fresh here idea-wise. None of the mob guys are interesting. The police is mostly played off as clueless for plot convenience. A lot of characters are strangely gung-ho with entering or re-entering a world of crime. A world, that you can't get out of easily. Again, lots of it felt too convenient.

I finished the whole season, and a couple of sub-plots seem almost lifted from The Sopranos but without the subtlety. Which is a shame since Sheridan proved with Sicario, Hell or High Water and even Wind River that he's capable of creating nuanced characters. So this season was underwhelming, not bad, but not very interesting either. If they wrap it up in season 2 I might watch, but it's definitely not a premise that you can stretch out too much, judging by it's first season."
3.0,31 March 2023,"It's just too dumb to enjoy, and requires waaaay too much suspension of disbelief. It makes a terrible first impression. Nobody carries holy water in a spray bottle, even in Oklahoma, cops would have been called immediately in most of the situations in the first 30 minutes, good people were presented as dumb/weak yokels, and the attempts to humanize the protagonist were weak and lazy. I'm trying, but as someone from the ""Bible Belt"" this is just a parade of stereotypes. I'm not necessarily offended, but it's certainly insulting. Taylor seems to have taken a ton of shortcuts. Either that or someone is just using his name for the clout. More likely that some arrogant Yankee is behind the keyboard. Oh, but of course: Terence Winter. And NYU/St. John's educated lawyer. Hmm. Figures."
5.0,28 December 2022,"What happened to the master Taylor? After three great and one decent seasons of Yellowstone and an even greater season of 1883, this just does not compute. Syntax Error. I read an interview recently where Taylor Sheridan worried he is spreading himself too thin with all his projects. May be. Is he churning out some of these newer efforts using OpenAI? This here godawful mess of a show, with Stallone's ulcerous moaning about all things the young'uns are up to, while mafioso-menacing a whole town Sleepy Joe Biden style, just does not convince. Here's hoping forthcoming 1923 gets the laser-focus it deserves from Sheridans brilliant talent."
2.0,15 April 2023,"Balboa Productions and Taylor Sheridan have ripped off a novel written by someone with neurological Lyme Disease. ""Tulsa King"" owes everything to Jack Bristow's hard time, without ""Hard Time,"" there would be no ""Tulsa King."" Simple as that.

Knowing that this show is a ripoff of an author with a chronic disease I gave it a 2. Had I not read ""Hard Time"" myself and known this was a ripoff I would have given it a 4, just because I like Stallone, though not as much anymore, because he shouldn't be attaching his production company and name to such a horrible plagiarism.

I understand that Taylor Sheridan has shamelessly copied in the past, but I expected better from Terence Winter.

Dwight Manfredi is ""Hard Time's"" Tommy Roma! It'd be funny if it weren't so sad and pathetic, these folks' shameless and unscrupulous plagiarism...."
4.0,6 October 2024,"I dont know why how and why this show is rated 8/10 at imdb which ""tricked"" me into watching this show. The show is extremely bad and not in an entertaining way. It seems the write of the show have watched too many 70-80s movie about the 30-40s mobs. The entire premise is extremely dated and unbelievable.

Grandpa Sly goes to legit business, threat the owners with violence and extorts money out of them all the while using his non-existent leadership qualities to recruit everyday people into committing violent crimes for seemingly no reason. Young and rich women are falling head over heels for the 75 years old convicted criminal. The dialogue is stupid and corny.

Sylvester is pushing 80 and looks like it. He might have pulled off this role 20 years ago, but his attempts to come across as a tough guy fall flat. His character (and him) has no charisma or personality. All of the other characters are dumb, stupid and unlikable.

I was hoping to see some nice locations from Tulsa at least, but the show wasnt even shot in Tulsa. Dont waste your time on it, just watch (or re-watch) Sopranos."
5.0,22 November 2022,"Tulsa King is actually a Crime Drama/ Comedy. Stallone plays a fish out of water mafia boss forced to set up shop in Tulsa, OK. He pulls off a pot dispensary takeover with little to no resistance, punches people without retaliation and gets instant compliance from everyone in town with a couple hundred dollars. I call it mislabeled as a crime drama because none of the situations are even slightly realistic, but they are sometimes funny.

I don't understand the high ratings because I was bored towards the end of the first episode once I realized it wasn't really a crime drama. I mean, I love shows like Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul...crime dramas with a dark comedic bent. This is kinda weak in that vein of show if that was the intent."
1.0,26 August 2024,"I'm really not sure what all these 9 and 10 start reviews are about. I watched this until the end of season one hoping for something better to come but it never did. Kinda regret regret wasting my time watching this.

Every other scene, the characters reaction to the situation doesn't make any sense. People just make strange decisions and accept things that a normal person in their situation never would, which is really offputting to me. The whole show just feels hollow, it seems like lazy writing. Stallone nails the role and the cinematography is good, but that's about it. 5/10 is being generous."
1.0,15 November 2022,"Watching gave me a hard ""no"" on this series. I gave it five stars for the dialogue and Sylvester Stallone, but the stars drop drastically for all the other parts.

I watched because I love mob movies and shows and have always been a fan of Sylvester and Taylor. Unfortunately, what could have been a classic fish out of water starting from scratch story turned out to be a mess. Not a hot mess, just a mess. I get that he doesn't know how much the world has changed, but to get him to roll over on a medical marijuana store? I spent that whole scene wondering if it was a big joke. Yes, even when he came back.

Don't get me started on the ageism. She'll sleep with him when she thought he was a mid-fifties, but practically throwing up in her mouth a little to find out he's 75? Really, Taylor? Was the sex really bad then so we'll blame that on his age?

I usually know right from the first episode if a show is worth continuing and this one screams ""run away, run away fast"" to me rather than watching a second episode."
5.0,18 January 2023,"Not sure if this show is trying to take itself seriously or not. I hope they are not as the acting is terrible asn the director not cutting and reshooting is also resonsible. Watching the actors, you can tell they even know they are in a terrible show which is waiting to be cut.

The only reason it hasn't been is due to Stallones pulling power which people will see through after watching this.

Sorry Stallone, you were always a bad actor and remain a bad actor.

Its like Stallone has to put himself front and centre of every scene and make himself out to be such a hero nice guy in - every - scene.

Did I say terrible?

My wifey and I are constantly laughing at the script and some of the scenes due to how bad they are.

Terrible."
2.0,30 September 2024,"I give this 4 out of 10 because Stallone but everything else about this show is absolute trash, after watching last weeks episode with a cameo of ""JellyRoll"" the singer/rapper I knew this show had hit an all time low, Ricky Gervais made fun of this kind of thing in extras in the Coldplay Chris Martin episode when Chris magically appears on Ricky's fictional show When The Whistle Blows, I tell you what blows, Tulsa King blows!

You can tell Taylor Sheridan has nothing to do with this one as this is way below Yellowstone standards, seriously get some real writers, everything in this show is pure make believe, in this version of Tulsa you can do anything you want, intimidate anyone you want and they smile and pay you for it and at the centre of it all you have Stallone who is 78 years old accompanied by a bunch of one dimensional cardboard cut-out's, do yourself a favour, avoid this one and go and rewatch the Rocky Films you'll have much better time trust me!"
1.0,25 May 2023,"""Tulsa"" was based off the Jack Bristow novel ""Hard Time,"" but the series does not do the novel justice.

Stallone's character in ""Tulsa"" is an unlikeable bully and brute. He's not even one of these anti-heroes that picks on the bullies. He's an equally opportunity scumbag not even worthy of a show. The character is petty and has zero depth whatsoever, unlike his progenitor Tommy Roma in the Bristow novel.

Tulsa King relies heavily on the fish out of water premise that was so prominent in ""Hard Time,"" but it does so ever so poorly and unconvincingly.

The boss in this series, Pete Ivernizzi, is a mixture Mr. Spirochete and the oxygen tank toting Salvatore DeLuna from Bristow's ""Hard Time.""

Hardly anything in this series is original. Again: It's a total theft of another author's work. I do like Stallone. However, Sheridan's propensity to steal other writers work--this isn't the first time he's done this--and his inability to write deep, engaging characters renders ""Tulsa King"" essentially unwatchable and unrecommendable."

5.0,13 March 2023,"A shameless ripoff of Steven Van Zandt's old show Lillyhammer. Shame shame Balboa. You should know better ... but then again maybe one too many blows to the solar-plexes. Now while not exactly the same as Lillyhammer,; you know different settings and all; but the plot premise is more or less the same. But it is the same old Stallone. Limited acting ability, limited speaking skills and ability; and now in his old age limited physical ability. So when I say Stallone does not disappoint I really mean it. I went in expecting inferior work ... and what I saw was nothing but an inferior quality show top to bottom."
1.0,27 December 2022,"Well, I loved Stallone's movies where he wreaks havoc here and there and plays action hero. Tulsa King is not that, and it's ok.

My problem is that Tulsa King is using Stallone's legacy to convince us that This old gangster Manfredi is legit and can still take over business like a walk in the park. The failure in execution is here in this part, the part that exhibits how easy it is for a rusty convict alone to establish a kingdom in the middle of nowhere. Sorry Taylor, I'm not buying this. Ain't no Vito Corleone in 2022 in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

Does this show had its share of good laughs? Yes. And a character like Tyson could have done better with some extra depth."

2.0,18 February 2024,"It was ridiculous enough when 65 year old Liam Neeson asked us to believe he could beat up men a third his age in the garbage Taken series. And Stallone himself mocked the whole idea with his Expendables series.

But that's over the top 80s action series no one takes seriously including the stars themselves. Gangster films have always sold the believability, from the original Scarface in the 30s, Bonnie and Clyde, newer Scarface, Godfather I and II, Goodfellas, Sopranos.

Gangster comedies always suck, and this one is no exception. Stop or My Mom Will Shoot. Johnny Dangerously. Harlem Nights. All embarrassingly bad.

It's not remotely believable that Stallone could beat up men half his age two or three at a time. Tulsa has half a million people, some of them scary rednecks and bikers. Their grandparents burned down Black Wall Street.

If you believe a 78 year old can outfight them all, you probably are also dumb enough to believe those photoshopped images of Donald Trump's bloated old face cropped onto the body of Stallone in the first Rocky movie."
5.0,18 February 2023,
2.0,17 January 2023,"Tulsa King does not excel in anything. It's a random comic drama about criminals, trying very hard to resemble Sons of Anarchy or something like that, but failing drastically.

The history is poor, average screenwriting, you can't really give a rat's ass for the sake of any character.

Acting is almost ridiculous, especially Sylvester Stallone. As a matter of fact, Stallone is the main issue. It's hard to believe that he is a movie star. I can't remember the last movie with him I've watched, but I really didn't remember how bad he is. Maybe it's his age, maybe botox or something of the like, but he just can't act anymore. His face has no expression and his moves are very weird.

For reasons I don't really understand, I will finish season 1.

PS. Finished it. No surprises, it's really no good."
3.0,6 October 2024,
1.0,13 January 2023,"At the end of the day, is this entertaining? I'd have to say yes. But make no mistake, this is utter, utter drivel. The plot is totally ridiculous and every storyline is entirely improbable. Of course who doesn't love Sly? He has an enduring charm, but that charm is on a slippery slope, not least because having to look at his massively replasticked face is a huge distraction.

Were there other characters that I took to? The 'baddie' with the strong Ulster accent was interesting. He would make a good Bond villain but his performance was way over the top. There were of course two romantic storylines, which weren't finished either.

Looking at the way the series ended clearly they're going to make another series - which I won't be watching."
4.0,12 January 2023,"This show is so bad it made it almost watchable. Something stupid happens in every scene in every single episode. The dialog is laughable and filled with swearing for no reason.

A 75 year old man fist-fighting people is just so silly. Stallone can hardly turn his head let alone do anything remotely athletic. He's also a terrible actor.

One of the first scenes in the show is Dwight somehow intimidating the intelligent owner of a marijuana dispensary who seems to also be the most gullable person on earth. For some reason we are supposed to side with Dwight and think he's so noble for stealing part of this guys business. Its so cringe and cliche. I could go on and on. Yes, I did watch the entire season.

I grew up with and love mafia / crime movies and shows but this is a total disaster. I don't understand the high rating. Yuck."
4.0,30 March 2023,"The actors and characters are all superb. The setting, camera work and pacing are all very good. Unfortunately mobster plots are boring and predictable. Is someone offending someone and then having to make amends? Is there money changing hands? Is there foul language? Of course. I just can't fake an interest in it.

I only checked this out because I enjoy Andrea Savage so much. I'm glad I watched the first few episodes. The characters are engaging and the cast is great. I just wish they had something to do for forty minutes at a crack.

If you have Paramount plus, might as well check this out. Otherwise, skip it."
5.0,14 January 2023,
5.0,20 December 2022,"The runtime from opening to end is 60 minutes but the actual screen-on-time of the series is literally just 32 minutes, almost a sitcom runtime. I didn't time ads. I paid for Paramount+ and you get to watch without ads. Runtime is 37 minutes per episode but it has an INSANE 5 minute intro montage that cuts story to measly 32. That is unacceptable if they're trying to make a real TV series (paid). Imagine if HBO did this with The Sopranos. Sopranos had a real 60 minute episode run, no BS. And that is how it should be. It's hard to care when things just start moving and click, it's over in half an hour and you have to wait another week. The fact each episode ends of cliffhanger makes the short runtime all that much worse. For that - 3/10."
2.0,14 April 2023,
1.0,2 June 2023,"After watching the forst 3 episodes I can already see where this is going and its not good. The storyline is so predictable, unoriginal and ridiculously stupid. The scene in the sun where they are smoking weed after meeting the growers is some of the worst dialog I've ever seen and is just like smoking weed in high-school and the dumbest guy you know thinks he's got something highly insightful to say and it's just incoherent rambling for someone who's too high to realize just how stupid ghey sound. I don't understand how this show and Yellowstone are so highly rated when they are so poorly written and directed."
5.0,21 November 2022,"It's entertaining and will pass the time. Still, everything starts with great writing and here we find the weakness.

After 25 years in prison, our aging gangster is in a strange world where he knows nothing about iPhones and internet, yet instantly knows how to surf and research on Google. Not remotely realistic. He has a fast one-nighter with a much younger woman who turns out to be an agent on the lookout for aging gangsters.

Still, it's a fun role for Stallone who shows us that you can still look ruggedly hot at 75+. He's a pro with acting chops, still. Some of the character development is becoming fun. And heads up, Andrea Savage ... watch the vocal fry!"
4.0,4 September 2023,"Tulsa King is about 8% woke - enough to be periodically distracting and annoying, yet sufficiently low-key to allow the positive elements to shine through. Sylvester Stallone's performance generally rises above the caliber of the script, although he is limited by its lack of imagination and originality. The cast is self-consciously diverse, but many of the supporting actors give credible performances, including Jay Will, who brings some depth to a stereotypical role with the help of Michael Beach as his father, as well as Garret Hedlund, and Ritchie Coster.

The nine-part DTV series is a mishmash of familiar tropes, energized by Stallone's performance, but hampered by concessions to ""obligatory"" woke constraints. Dwight (Stallone) recruits a ragtag ensemble of diverse lowlifes who evoke memories of the Village People. The police are evil, corrupt, and incompetent. Dwight's love interests are frumpy, dumpy soccer moms. If even one young, attractive girl in a body-conscious outfit was onscreen for more than a single frame, she escaped notice.

Basically, it's a fish-out-of-water buddy film. The central characters who form Dwight's crew have good chemistry together and Stallone has tremendous presence. The various adversaries and villains are cardboard cut-outs with mannerisms in the place of characterization. The females are, almost without exception, horrendously miscast on an order of magnitude comparable to Sofia Coppola in The Godfather Part III. The script is serviceable, with enough positive elements to maintain interest, but also many elements that seem familiar and derivative. It's a bit like watching an updated version of a crowd favorite. There are no major surprises, but it is generally entertaining, although often disappointing due to plot holes and improbable devices. Production values are good, but don't rise above direct-to-video caliber."
3.0,14 October 2024,
5.0,6 October 2023,"This might be the dumbest, most comically horrible show I have seen in a long, long time

I get that Taylor Sheridan gets paid a boat load of money to write shows for Paramount + and I am a fan of some but this show is so poorly thought out and written that, out of guilt, he should give some of that money back

The whole season is one gigantic plot hole. Nothing is realistic. The depth of characters can be measured in tsp's.

Sylvester Stallone is the big draw but his character is laughable and his acting is ridiculous.

I believe if I had a lobotomy with an ice cream scoop I might have enjoyed this mess a lot more."
2.0,5 March 2023,"Was looking forward to watching this series seeing it was getting good reviews and hoping it would be up there with The Sopranos. Watched 2 episodes so far and not impressed at all. This show is ludicrous. Taylor Sheridan must have intended this to be a parody of the mafia. I have watched a few series and movies about the mafia and Tulsa King is by far the worst. I usually enjoy Stallone's flicks, but this should have been called "" Over the Hill""!! Taylor Sheridan has some great series on the go, too bad this is not one of them. I will force myself to watch a couple more episodes to see if it does get any better but I don't have high hopes!"
5.0,29 November 2022,"Upsetting to see Hollywood elites portraying Tulsa as such a small town. While it is nowhere near a large city like LA - they show it to be more like a smaller country town. For example - when leaving the airport, they show farming fields and barns. The Tulsa airport is a highly populated area and there are no large farming fields for miles outside the city.

Interestingly Stallone has said the weather in Tulsa was brutal. This from someone who has filmed the Rambo series in jungle locations. Seems like he had an agenda against the area to begin with.

The characters and acting is good, and the story is compelling. Just wish they portrayed Tulsa more accurately."
3.0,8 December 2023,"I was really excited about watching this series. After all it's Stallone doing TV, and he's playing a gangster, and Sheridan isn't a bad show creator. But, the situation is so far fetched, and the characters unrealistic and undeveloped, you really have to turn your brain off. This is a step backward for the recent TV golden age. It's formulaic with a big name, and it doesn't deliver. I can think of a half dozen shows easy, which are doing this style better. It's almost like this was created without anyone having seen The Sopranos, Breaking Bad, Peaky Blinders. Sons of Anarchy, Justified, etc.

Stallone is ok (better early on as a menace, before he became a rah rah coach/father figure). The pot guy is pretty funny. The gangsters are laughable. I may watch more...I may not."
4.0,23 February 2023,"I mean... it would take longer than the season 1 run time to describe what a monumental piece of nonsense this is. However, it is wildly unintentionally funny peak ""boomer"" nonsense. Stallone is hilarious for all the wrong reasons, there are no actual characters in the sense that they have motivations and arcs and behave in a way consistent with a human being. The plot is contrived at its best and nonsensical garbage at its worst, but if you want to hear Stallone deliver cliché dialogue just like your drunk uncle that claims he's 1/8th Italian and ""knows connected people"" then boy are you going to get a kick out of this."
2.0,17 May 2023,"I was actually looking forward to this, but after a few episodes realized that this is just the same stuff we've seen in every other mafia/knockaround story. This only happens in movies and tv. One guy taking over a city. Yeah, wouldn't happen anywhere else but in movies and tv.

A felon in his 70's that's been in prison for 25 years is going to be mentally and physically a shell of his former self. He's not taking over anything anywhere.

I mean, it's fiction and maybe this could've worked 20 years ago, but we've seen all this already countless of times. It's a cliched mess. Old guy kicking ass and getting all the women. LOL, never seen that before.

I stopped watching around episode 5. Just didn't care about the story. Life's too short to waste it on something this cliched."
3.0,24 January 2023,"This Taylor guy is just pumping out screenplays every year for multiple episodes on multiple shows and even has spin offs as well.

Me thinks he is outsourcing.

There is no possible way he can be writing, directing, producing and sometimes acting in all of these productions year after year, there just isn't enough time.

The quality has drastically dropped from the 1st season of Yellowstone and this show is just absolutely trash television.

So many cliche's and wannabe gangster scenes and somehow he overlooks the primary motivation for setting up shop in Tulsa. Anything? This should be detailed in the first episode.

Then we have the obvious cop involvement backstory. The I'm going to make you pay protection backstory and so on. Total cringe all around. I made it to the end of the pilot and can't do any more.

If Taylor continues to churn out flounders like this I fully expect more grammatical errors, logic errors and unbelievable characters. I'm convinced his work is outsourced from India and written by high school students who barely speak any English. My only hope is that he gets exposed soon and this nonsense can stop."
5.0,5 February 2023,"And this is getting 8-10 ratings among a rash of praise ?

How much is hype and statistics manipulation and how much is genuine love for the series?

Is this really the fashion- Mumbley Mobsters ?

Well, there was Brando for that in the Godfather; 'Mind the Oranges Marlon!'

To these old eyes Tusla King (2022-) is typical adolescent junk, done with a bit of style, decent direction and with some decent-ish actors- many familiar HBO stablemates doing what they do with a rather mediocre story, and increasingly cliched scripts.

The series starts with Stallone in prison, where hes been educating himself reading notable writers. He rarely resorts to any of these during the 9 part first season though, probably because the writers of the meagre scripts have never read any of them ?

The writing is poor. Its ok for these types of light-hearted action dramas, but over time has become a stale cliche, the only thing surprising is the utter STUPIDITY of the events and decisions occurring on screen.

Everything about this 'violent attempt at comedy' is devoid of any REALITY. Gangs, gangsters,Don's Capos etc do not EVER act like these twerps on screen- its pure LA LA LAND HOLLYWIERD INVENTION for children...well, probsbly teenagers .

Which is in some way surprising because Hollywood has a lot of 'gangster/mob' connections & shared history.... maybe that's why they feel the need to fictionalise it to such a silly extreme?

Anyways , Stallone's character is in no way a hero, although that is how he is intended to be seen.

He's a smarmy bully and intimidates people under his influence.

He will resort to violence without though of consequence, while antagonising and escalating easily managed situations.

To any Christian-minded folk he would obviously be seen as a devil, corruptor and bringer of misfortune. The later two designations are impossible to deny.

For me , the most entertaining thing about this series was the utter chaos and destruction Stallone's bull-headed behaviour results in. All the while he's claiming to be helping and protecting those around him .He's a violent parasite in human form.

The misery and misfortune he brings upon almost everyone he knows during the 9 part first season is quite staggering... yet at the end of it they are all grateful !

This is similar to the mediocre PLANE (2013) film where everyone undergoes extreme trauma, and is thankful, as if they've just passed some sado-masochist initiation ritual.

This is even worse. Peaceful folk are induced by Stallone's actions and encouragement to beat people up with baseball bats, shoot a rival gang,, killing them, and selling Nitrous Oxide in Balloons at the local fair. The later isn't such a bad thing - yet their charge of $10 a hit is an utter rip-off....ahem.

Like most of these types of un-realist drama, no one in this has any friends. Its a hermetic bubble of narcissism and stupid brutality. This basic failing means that no realistic portrayal of 'gangs /gangsters' could EVER be realised in this series.

Without a NETWORK you cant work a net, or weave a web.

Did the writers/producers decide to make it more violent and stupid than originally intended ? There are many moments when it seems Stallone has an actual plan using stealth, and a lifetimes worth of tactile decision making,... then he just starts a club-bash or guns blazing battle.

Everything about the story is stupidly childish or so cliched it will induce instant Deja-vu.

Anyone with even the slightest knowledge of the 'mob', gangs, gangsters' and their ilk, knows about 'soldiers' etc etc... yet Terrence Winter is such a poor writer here that its all ignored for plot convolutions and dramatic turns instead. He did a better job with season 1 of Boardwalk Empire.

This series doesn't really warrant a proper critique. Its problems are endless. Yet, it is technically so well made that its easy to watch 30 minutes of this rubbish and just accept it for what it is- an excuse to keep decent actors & technicians employed, while allowing a showcase for an amiably psychopathic, mutilated, sadistic Stallone to have some fun, smirk , pout and puff his chest out.... An archaic icon of the fallen Italian Nobility, in the deserts of Americas Imagination."
5.0,24 November 2022,"The first two episodes are an advertisement for marijuana, showing that there is no problem for those who use it. It's a real disappointment that Stallone is in a show like this. Stallone's performance is a disappointment, the script is at least naive and the cast is one of the worst in this kind of series. Generally a bad show with the sole purpose of showing that if you pass drugs you're not going to get hurt, while statistically 75% of those who pass marijuana end up on hard drugs. I wouldn't recommend it to any stallone fan or anyone expecting to see a good cop show. Excuse my English, but I'm still learning."
3.0,14 February 2023,"This is a straight-to-video VHS movie from the 80s repackaged as a new TV series.

I'm fine with nostalgia, and it was nice to see Dana Delaney, Anabella Sciorra and other familiar faces, even if those faces are now immobilized by botox and filler. It's really the shallowness of the script and the plot that make this show so bad. Lone wolf facing off against evil biker gang. Villains are stupid and easy to kill; our hero and his sidekicks shrug off flesh wounds. There is little wit and even fewer surprises. Try to picture how a caveman would handle a challenge and you can predict the next scene. More could have been done with the dilemma of an old time gangster, getting out of prison after 25 years and facing a new reality. Instead, everyone around him accepts his dated sensibilities and instantly joins his entourage, willingly allowing him to extort them and horn in on their businesses.

Also, the depiction of the black cab driver-turned chauffeur seemed quite racist and tone-deaf. When the driver subserviently calls Stallone, ""My gangsta,"" and does his bidding, he might as well be Steppenfetchit. I feel sorry for the actor who had to play the part.

Finally, when Phil Collins' ""In the Air Tonight"" started playing in an important scene, I really felt I was watching a rerun of a Miami Vice episode, though at least that show seemed cutting edge at the time. This show is a sad retread.."
5.0,23 January 2023,"Excellent premise, decent acting, but the writing is a dumpster-fire from another era. Stallone plays a 75 year old old-timer, and it seems the show was written by one, too.

You can count on one hand the number of scenes where a woman is talking about anything other than her insatiable need for d**k or booze. The lead female character is an alcoholic ATF agent who loses all professionalism at the prospect of jumping Stallone's 75-year old bones. Other female ATF agents are portrayed as having nothing better to do than scroll Tender at their desk. A rape is revealed in the most comically insensitive manner I have ever seen broadcast. It's like this show was written in the coarse of one afternoon by a bunch of highschool boys huffing Axe body spray in the locker room. After looking at the directors/writers credits, I can't imagine I'm too far off.

The show has one thing going for it though, and the reason I gave it two stars: the sheer effort required for Stallone to say intelligible words is both highly apparent and absolutely hilarious. If viewed as a comedy about a man with a speech impediment living in Harvey Weinstein's imagination, this show is just barely tolerable."
7.17,19 January 2023,"This is the weakest Sheridan effort I've seen. Sorry, but Stallone cannot act. Plus, he's ugly, sorry. He has no chemistry with the female lead. Story line, character development is also weak. Villains are two-dimensional bad guys. This is all so formulistic. Not the Sheridan I'm used to seeing. I repeat: This is the weakest Sheridan effort I've seen. Sorry, but Stallone cannot act. Plus, he's ugly, sorry. He has no chemistry with the female lead.

7.17,15 October 2024,"I like this show, I really do, I think it has great bones and good potential. The cast is amazing, the plot and the delivery is fantastic but there's something that's killing this show outright, Stallone.

Now I want to be clear, it's not because he's a bad actor, because he's not, he's pretty good actually. It's for a completely different reason. He's entirely unbelievable in this. The combination of being 78 years old, and jacked up on steroids like he's an olympic cheater is just horrible. Because the problem is his movements are entirely animatronic. So it makes him seem like he's in a costume where he has no range of motion but pretends he does. And for the sake of the show. They keep up this charade and it's just sad.

I know he made this show, and I know it was his idea, and it was a great one, but the further along this show goes the more obvious it becomes that he was just a mistake as a cast member, she should have just been an executive producer and left it at that.

5/10 Stallone will singlehandedly kill this show, the best thing that can happen to it, is if he gets wacked and someone in his crew replaces him."
7.17,1 April 2024,"Disclaimer: I dropped this after one episode. My parents talked me into watching this show with them but unfortunately I am not the biggest fan of Sylvester Stallone to begin with and his role/character really didn't help the situation for me. Dwight Manfredi is (likely) supposed to be funny with his ""I own all this"" attitude and lack of knowledge about the modern 2024 world but to me it's annoying and arrogant. Funny is the last word I would describe this protagonist with and therefore just had to drop this. There are some other actually promising characters (like the driver or the bar owner) but that didn't balance it for me."
7.17,26 September 2024,"Actually this would have been so great with clint eastwood for 10 years ago

I never liked lilyhammer when it came out some years ago , but loved the idea, it was clever and really could have been something, but it went down as a submarine with a screen door, so I was happy when this came out, kind of reinvent the wheel again with real acting and money behind it, and most of all better storywork

But it just didnt worked out that well again, jumped in the same pit as lilyhammer did with a corky feeling and stupid jokes , and stallone is just too old , its just funny how they must avoid scenes when he have to move faster than a zombie, actually not sure he was understand he was in a movie time to time

Overrated, but its total ok to watch, but 4-6 stars is more justice."
