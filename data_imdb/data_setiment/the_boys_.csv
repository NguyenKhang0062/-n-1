2,2,8.0,6 December 2021,"I've had big expectations about this show, because I thought that is going to be exactly that kind of show, in which the good guys (the superheroes) fight the bad guys (the villains) and of course, they win. I couldn't have been more wrong, especially because ""The Boys"" it's not about a desperate attempt of superheroes to save the world from evil, instead this show takes a much more realistic approach, about what is going to happen if superheroes had really existed.

I'm saying that I had big expectations in the beginning, because I thought that it would be the same usual show with superheroes and villain, that is most likely to find everywhere. In the first couple of episodes I've been a little bit disappointed, or rather shocked, because like I've already said, ""The Boys"" describes what the MCU never did. Of course, the movies and shows from Marvel are destined to other public's category, but this show is tough. It has all you could not expect from a TV series with superheroes. It has violence, gore, nudity, astonishing CGI effects and a very unpredictable and solid storyline. In the end it seems that this one delivered what I didn't expect it to and I am pleased with that. The show is definitely worth watching.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",ive had big expectations about this show because i thought that is going to be exactly that kind of show in which the good guys the superheroes fight the bad guys the villains and of course they win i couldnt have been more wrong especially because the boys its not about a desperate attempt of superheroes to save the world from evil instead this show takes a much more realistic approach about what is going to happen if superheroes had really existed im saying that i had big expectations in the beginning because i thought that it would be the same usual show with superheroes and villain that is most likely to find everywhere in the first couple of episodes ive been a little bit disappointed or rather shocked because like ive already said the boys describes what the mcu never did of course the movies and shows from marvel are destined to other publics category but this show is tough it has all you could not expect from a tv series with superheroes it has violence gore nudity astonishing cgi effects and a very unpredictable and solid storyline in the end it seems that this one delivered what i didnt expect it to and i am pleased with that the show is definitely worth watching,POSITIVE

12,12,5.0,5 July 2024,"Season 4 of The Boys is close to unwatchable.

Violence and gore are ok as long as they're justified and part of the plot, in season 4, it feels like it's there just to A, fill up the time and B, because the writers are simply deranged

But the biggest problem, as many other viewers point out, is that it is way too political

Hollywood and Hollywood-adjacent screenwriters and showrunners need to understand that the audience does not want political views shoved down their throat

I guess it's going to take a few more years, box office bombs and scathing reviews for them to understand it, but they'll get there in the end

14,14,9.0,22 October 2020,"This Amazon series is set in a world where there are superheroes; they aren't typical superheroes though; they work for the powerful Vought Corporation and consider ratings and profit to be more important than saving lives. They are also arrogant, disillusioned or generally unpleasant. The worst of these are 'The Seven', the most senior heroes who are heavily marketed by Vought. Working to expose them is a group known as 'The Boys'; led by Billy Butcher who is convinced that leader of the heroes, Homelander, is responsible for the disappearance of his wife. We are introduced to each group via new members; Hughie Campbell joins The Boys after ultrafast hero A-Train ran through his girlfriend; and Annie January an idealistic young heroine known as Starlight who joins The Seven. Hughie and Annie become friends before learning what the other is doing.

When I first heard of this I thought it was just a case of Amazon jumping on the superhero bandwagon but then heard a radio review which made it sound like a series I might like... it most certainly is! If you like your heroes to be heroic and good rather than self-centred egomaniacs you might not like this but if you like to see conventions turned on their head this is great. Another major difference between this and more typical stories featuring superheroes is that this is definitely not family friendly; there is a lot of strong violence, some sex and nudity and possibly the most swearing I've heard in a TV show. The story develops well over the two seasons that are currently available with some good twists and plenty of interesting character development. The characters on both sides are interesting and the cast does a great job portraying them. While the story can be a bit dark at times it is lightened by its humour; often being genuinely hilarious as we see events that wouldn't seem the most obvious source of laughs. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to older superhero fans who are looking for something different. I can't wait for season three.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",this amazon series is set in a world where there are superheroes they arent typical superheroes though they work for the powerful vought corporation and consider ratings and profit to be more important than saving lives they are also arrogant disillusioned or generally unpleasant the worst of these are the seven the most senior heroes who are heavily marketed by vought working to expose them is a group known as the boys led by billy butcher who is convinced that leader of the heroes homelander is responsible for the disappearance of his wife we are introduced to each group via new members hughie campbell joins the boys after ultrafast hero atrain ran through his girlfriend and annie january an idealistic young heroine known as starlight who joins the seven hughie and annie become friends before learning what the other is doing when i first heard of this i thought it was just a case of amazon jumping on the superhero bandwagon but then heard a radio review which made it sound like a series i might like it most certainly is if you like your heroes to be heroic and good rather than selfcentred egomaniacs you might not like this but if you like to see conventions turned on their head this is great another major difference between this and more typical stories featuring superheroes is that this is definitely not family friendly there is a lot of strong violence some sex and nudity and possibly the most swearing ive heard in a tv show the story develops well over the two seasons that are currently available with some good twists and plenty of interesting character development the characters on both sides are interesting and the cast does a great job portraying them while the story can be a bit dark at times it is lightened by its humour often being genuinely hilarious as we see events that wouldnt seem the most obvious source of laughs overall id definitely recommend this to older superhero fans who are looking for something different i cant wait for season three,POSITIVE

I could easily binge the first 2 seasons seasons (and even season 3 for the most part)... but the subtle & clever political undertones of earlier seasons, which were an afterthought to the storyline & character building, has become the sole purpose of the show now it seems. I barely get through each new episode, but continue to hold on in the hopes of some kind of glimpse of The Boys seasons I fell in love with in the first place. There are still a few good scenes and humor sprinkled in, but it's mostly just the writer shoving their extreme political view down your throat every chance they get. It's becoming predictable and very repetitive at this point. I hope things will start to get better, and I'll most likely tough it out for the remainder of the season as something to put on in the background while I'm doing other stuff, but if it continues this trajectory, I won't be around for season 5 (if it even gets there).","July 26, 2019 (United States)",its a sad year for the boys what started as a captivating and entertaining show has devolved into a painful hour of viewing each week i could easily binge the first seasons seasons and even season for the most part but the subtle clever political undertones of earlier seasons which were an afterthought to the storyline character building has become the sole purpose of the show now it seems i barely get through each new episode but continue to hold on in the hopes of some kind of glimpse of the boys seasons i fell in love with in the first place there are still a few good scenes and humor sprinkled in but its mostly just the writer shoving their extreme political view down your throat every chance they get its becoming predictable and very repetitive at this point i hope things will start to get better and ill most likely tough it out for the remainder of the season as something to put on in the background while im doing other stuff but if it continues this trajectory i wont be around for season if it even gets there,NEGATIVE
24,24,10.0,17 November 2020,"(Review updated after Season 4).

Hughie Campbell's life is turned upside down when the love of his life is accidentally killed by a superhero, a member of The Seven, the most elite and adored of superhero teams. The Seven are the rock stars of the age and untouchable but the more Hughie investigates, the more he discovers they're far from perfect. His moral crusade sees him drawn into a band of anti-superhero vigilantes: The Boys.

I'm generally not into superhero movies or series but this is different. Here the superheroes are more the villains than the heroes, making for a very interesting and original take on the genre. Throw in some very intriguing sub-plots involving the superheroes' private lives, the politics of their jobs and machinations within their team plus some profound observations and themes involving the (forced) superficiality of public figures, the intrusiveness and control of the media and the influence of social media status and you have a series that is original, entertaining and a mirror of the times.

Action scenes are well done, with some great CGI and graphic grittiness - this is definitely not Disney! While mostly a drama there's some wonderfully funny moments too. Just about anything involving The Deep was always bound to raise a laugh.

Not perfect though. The central plot - The Boys vs the superheroes - often appears clumsy and seems to go around in circles. It starts well enough but after a point, towards the end of Season 1, it just seems to get bogged down in endless escapades that have no point and occur based on the flimsiest of excuses. Plus these escapades often got resolved in silly, plot hole-riddled ways.

The writers would have done better to initially concentrate on the internal machinations within The Seven with the superheroes vs The Boys plot starting as a sideshow and then amping it up as the series went on.

Things do come together quite well in Season 3 though as the plot finds its focus. Season 3 is action-packed and intriguing with some great internal machinations within the superhero camp and a very interesting new character. It was heading for a fantastic showdown but the writers fluffed this somewhat in an effort to prolong the series. The final episode of S3 is a bit confusing and disappointing.

This disappointment continues into S4 as the main plot doesn't develop much. Instead we have heaps of sub-plots that don't add much and are just there to kill time. I was expecting showdown between The Boys and the superheroes but instead we have heaps of politics, all very polarising and I assume meant to be some sort of commentary on US politics and society. Before there was some engagement with the superheroes, now they're just plain cartoonish, malevolent villains. The middle of the season is the low point with meaningless space filler galore.

Things do improve towards the end and the season ends on a high. However, I suspect that S5 will be more of the same: two or three episodes of plot development, five or six episodes of padding. Why would the producers give us a tight, development-filled plot when they can stretch this out for several more seasons and make more money that way?

31,31,6.0,24 April 2022,"Review of Season One:

This was a real treat and by far my favourite superhero show. An out-and-out satire of modern America, taking broad swipes at consumerism, celebrity, religion, politics, big business, big pharma, you name it. Very well acted (Karl Urban gets the role of his career) and with every episode packed with twists, good characters, action, bloodshed, you name it. I bingewatch this and loved it.

Review of Season Two:

I was worried this one wouldn't match the first but it did. The story expands, the action and mayhem is ramped up, the new characters leave a real impression, and all of the good stuff from the first season is back. Looking forward to the third...

Review of Season Three:

I was a little worried about this third season when it first started. It felt like the freshness was gone to be replaced by the crudity and forced outrageousness that marred PREACHER. However, after a few episodes this finds its feet with the introduction of a great new character, some strong acting and all of the twists and political intrigue we know and love.

Review of Season Four:

Sadly, the series begins a downward trajectory with season four, in which very little happens of note from beginning to end. There isn't even much in the way of decent gore or action as in previous series.

34,34,10.0,24 June 2024,"This show was always a satire of America, particularly of the populist right, this was obvious. It also took shots at virtue signalling corporations, but it was obvious that its true target was the right of the culture wars.

However it wasn't too preachy and the show's tone was still anarchic, cynical and amoral - i.e. It gleefully offended everyone which, in our over-sensitive times, was refreshing. But in season 4, it has shifted to preaching standard issue, mainstream liberal talking points which is boring.

The black comedy associated with Homelander - the character who carries the show - isn't quite as good and you have this feeling that all the usual US Culture War talking points are going to be addressed. The writers no longer want to poke fun at the pieties of our age; now they want to 'use their platform' to address important topics. Snore.

Thia is one of the best shows around, best show since Game of Thrones.

You'll love characters, then hate them and the opposite, there's all the grey area that is needed with character development.

The series has a great story, great characters, crazy twists, awesome special effects and so on. A lot of the story is pretty much how we Americans and corporations are. Yes there is a lot of sexuality, nudity and gore but it's an adult series. Did people complain about how much nudity l/sex GOT had? Nope! If this bothers you then don't watch it but don't give it a bad rating for that. Was it needed? I think so, every part of that makes the story more intriguing. It plays to all the different characters and storylines in the series.

All I can say without mentioning any specific content is that I was disappointed that season 1 wasnt longer. It really got me into the story wondering what's going to happen next and the season finale had such a twist that you have to wait until season 2 to see how it will pick up from there.

They ARE the show, such is the force of the roles and how they are played. But after 4 seasons it has become repetitive and worse, seems to have lost most of the crazy humor that was a signature of the first two years. Frenchie has become tiresome, Kimiko as well.

45,45,10.0,3 July 2024,"""The Boys"" initially captivated audiences with its first two seasons, offering a fresh, irreverent take on the superhero genre that was both darkly humorous and thrillingly intense. The show's early success was driven by innovative storytelling, complex characters, and a gritty, unfiltered portrayal of a world dominated by corrupt superheroes.

However, starting with season three, the series began to lose its way. The narrative became less sharp and witty, with some story arcs feeling forced or unnecessary. Despite occasional flashes of brilliance, the overall quality and coherence of the storyline started to falter, leaving many loyal viewers disappointed.

Season four, unfortunately, continues this downward spiral. The latest season struggles to recapture the magic of its earlier years. The plot is increasingly convoluted, and character development takes a backseat to over-the-top spectacle. Instead of delivering the biting satire and character-driven drama that made the series a hit, season four often feels like a hollow imitation of its former self.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",the boys initially captivated audiences with its first two seasons offering a fresh irreverent take on the superhero genre that was both darkly humorous and thrillingly intense the shows early success was driven by innovative storytelling complex characters and a gritty unfiltered portrayal of a world dominated by corrupt superheroes however starting with season three the series began to lose its way the narrative became less sharp and witty with some story arcs feeling forced or unnecessary despite occasional flashes of brilliance the overall quality and coherence of the storyline started to falter leaving many loyal viewers disappointed season four unfortunately continues this downward spiral the latest season struggles to recapture the magic of its earlier years the plot is increasingly convoluted and character development takes a backseat to overthetop spectacle instead of delivering the biting satire and characterdriven drama that made the series a hit season four often feels like a hollow imitation of its former self,POSITIVE

52,52,5.0,6 September 2022,"Now I admit I will be in the minority, but I didn't really like season 2 of the boys. After an excellent season 1. 2 was a stepback. Sure there was a larger scale. But the slow pace, so many flashbacks, so many side stories that divert from the main story. I lost my interest in the season. Only 3, 6 and 8 were the good ones in season 2

Season 1- 9/10 Season 2- 7.5/10

Now let's talk about season 3. What a return back to form. Crazy from the minute go. More violent, intense and gripping than seasons 1 and 2. The addition of the V24 and Jensen Ackles as soldier boy just adds to the fun. Although Ackles enters late, he takes the spotlight the minute he enters

Now, the character development is the most interesting this season. Homelander is crazier than ever. Butcher and Hughie go down a dark path. Starlight taking a huge step against Vought (really, she had enough of them). The deep coming back into the game. A-Train coming to the realization what's it like to watch one's own get hurt. MM's past with soldier boy. Really interesting development

Below are the episodes in season 3 I found best to worst. There is no episode I found bad, it's just the ranking I found them most interesting

Herogasm (without a doubt, the best episode)

Glorious five year plan

The instant white hot wild (yeah, a bit rushed, but definitely not bad as everyone says it is)

The only man in the sky (the ending of this episode, Oh My God!)

The last time to look on this world of lies

Here comes a candle to light you to bed

Barbary coast

Payback

Coming to the performances. Antony Starr went to another level this time. This guy really deserves an emmy for this role. Karl Urban, as delicious as ever, bringing his unique style of saying sarcastic lines. Amazing. Jack Quaid got some really good scenes to shine this season and he did. Erin Moriarty proved why she will always remain the best choice to play starlight. Laz Alonso had the emotional part this season, I think he handled it well.

Always lovely to hear Tomer Capon's French in every season. He doesn't disappoint. Karen Fukuhara really dominates the action scenes. She's a boss! Ackles's Soldier Boy appears late and takes the center stage in the second half. His deep voice really supports in making us believe that he is a force to be reckoned with. Cameron Covetti doesn't get much to do except the last episode. Same goes for Chace Crawford. Jessie T Usher didn't get much screen time to perform what he had to. Others do well in their parts

So. Final word, I thought season 2 was bad and it got me to lost interest in the boys and wasn't really excited to watch season 3 but I decided to give it a try and thank god I did. Just amazing. Without a doubt, the best season for me out of the trio

61,61,2.0,22 July 2024,"The Boys really turns the superhero biz inside out. Hilariously disgusting adventures abound, yet there's still a lot of heart to the show. Great characters & character dynamics. Antony Starr as Homelander is brilliant. I really love seasons 1 & 2. Season 3 is also excellent. The vibe is slightly different, but still super enjoyable.

I don't know what to make of season 4. It had been a well balanced show - there were always political parallels but they were more in the background. They gave the show a nice bit of weight without being too in your face. That balance is off in season 4. Also, most of the characters have been given depressing storylines - where did all the fun go?

64,64,10.0,2 August 2019,"I have FINISHED this frickin gem on AMAZON PRIME VIDEO! This show is a must see! It is based on the comic series of the same name by Garth Ennis!

The show follows four men who take it upon themselves to keep Superheroes under control, specifically Vought International's elite team, The Seven.

The Boys:

Karl Urban (you MUST know this Star). He was Eomere in Lord of the Rings: Two Towers, Return of the King, Judge Dredd in Dredd, Vaako in the Riddick Film Series, and Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy in the Star Trek reboot films. A damn good actor, peeps! In this black comedy, he portrays Billy Butcher, the violent leader of The Boys who is willingly to do almost anything to ""spank the people (superheroes who get outta line) back in place"".

Jack Quaid portrays main character Hugh Campbell, who joins team after horrifically witnesses his fiancee killed by one of The Seven and suffers PTSD throughout the first season.

Tomer Kapon as Frenchie, a multi-talented Merc who has a shared history with Butcher as part of the original The Boys time prior to the series's events.

Laz Alonso (Fenix Calderon Fast & Furious 6) as Mother's Milk, the sensible, well spoken, and educated team member. He and Frenchie share a mutual hatred for one another.

Karen Fukuhara as Kimiko / the Female, the mute member of The Boy and their most lethal physical weapon.

The Seven:

Antony Starr plays Homelander, the All-American team leader of The Seven who wants autonomy of his image.

Dominique McElligott as Queen Maeve, long-time member of The Seven experiencing burnout.

Erin Moriarty is Starlight, the newest member of The Seven. Naive, genuine, and heroic.

Jessie T. Usher as A-Train, a speedster of the group who wishes to keep his rep as ""the fastest man alive.""

Chace Crawford as Kevin / The Deep (the Series' Aquaman), the self-absorbed dolt of the team.

Nathan Mitchell is Black Noir, the strong and silent type hero.

Alex Hassell portrays Translucent, a Supe possessing invisibility.

Recurring Characters:

Elisabeth Shue as Madelyn Stillwell, the VP of Vought International.

Simon Pegg (Star Trek, Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz) plays Hugh Campbell, Hughie's dull dad.

This show is amazing from start to finish! It is a Black Comedy Superhero series that explores contemporary issues surrounding media's narrative of celebrities as larger than life icons. Ironically, they're people like us all, who through the pressures/stresses of maintaining their status, make choices that have severe layered consequences on themselves as well as the everyday folk who worship/cross them. The Seven (5 this season) are as developed as The Boys they encounter over the 8 episode arc. Each character expresses a relatable side of humanity (specifically the primitive sides).

66,66,10.0,15 February 2023,"There have been other shows and movies which have tried to give us a realistic take on superheroes but none of them do it as well as ""The Boys"" does. The Show is dark, violent, gritty and sometimes even humorous. It doesn't pull any punches especially with the amount of violence being displayed. I personally think the shows biggest achievement is bringing in politics and somehow not making it seem forced like most of the shows do nowadays. The Characters are extremely well written and the show has one of the greatest protagonist-antagonist dynamics I have ever seen.

Last but not least, take a bow Anthony Starr. Anthony Starr puts on a terrifying and sometimes a downright disturbing performance as Homelander which is what the character demands. No one else could have played Homelander like he did. In fact the show wouldn't have even 50 percent as good without him. Hats off to him.

67,67,10.0,7 January 2020,"Summary before seasonal reviews:

Most people who are sick of Marvel or have general superhero fatigue will love this show. It's so far outside the norm and satirizes the genre. However, I think the bigtime superhero fans will get the most out of it.

I watch basically everything superhero related, Marvel, DC and other. The Boys gives me another entry in a genre I love, but so different from all the others, while taking numerous jabs at specific movies. There are so many small references that will go unnoticed by most. It makes fun of some of my favorite superhero movies and I eat it all up. Num num num num num ;-)

Season 1: 10 stars (4 viewings, 1/5/2020, 9/2/2020, 5/22/2022, 10/7/2023)

I love this show a lot. I treasure the concept. The characters are fantastic. The humor is extreme. The cast is awesome. NUMEROUS memorable moments. Multiple great emotional moments. Several uncomfortably intense scenes. ""Adore"" really is the best way to describe how I feel about this show. Its only flaw is that the fight scenes are bad with lots of quick cuts and shaky-cam close-ups.

Season 2: 10 stars (3 viewings, 10/9/2020, 5/29/2022, 10/11/2023)

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Everyone involved in making this show, you are so amazing, I love you all. Keep up the good work, and THANK YOU.

There is a scene near the middle of the season involving Homelander that legitimately might be my favorite moment in television history.

Season 3: 10 stars (3 viewings, 7/7/2022, 7/19/2022, 10/19/2023)

I don't even know what to say. No point in listing out what I like. It's everything. It has 2 of my all-time favorite episodes (episodes 2 and 6). There is a scene in episode 6 where I literally couldn't sit down. I watched the entire scene standing up.

Best first 3 seasons of any show ever. I considered making this the second time I give a season 11 stars. And I still might. It feels like a step up from the previous two seasons. Again, THANK YOU.

Season 4: 8 stars (1 viewing, 7/17/2024)

First half of season 4: I could not have been more bummed out. My amazing, beautiful, perfect show is suddenly mediocre. A show satirizing politics and agendas suddenly has politics and agendas. They take one of my favorite characters in Frenchie and absolutely destroy him for no apparent reason. It's unforgiveable.

I love every casting, at first I didnt like Hughie, but I've come to realise he was was perfect for that role, and now I cant imagine anyone else doing it that well.

The stories are interesting, sometimes grotesque. Sometimes you're glued to the screen, and sometimes you're absolutely horrified. It's a rollercoaster of a show, and it deserves a lot of love.

Homelanders, Starlight, Translucent, The Deep, Maeve, Lamplighter, and many more casting all really convincingly tell a different story. I really liked Shawn Ashmore as Lamplighter as it's a subtle nod to the 2000's x men trilogy which I also love.

Jensen Ackles as Super Boy was incredible for any Supernatural fans (like me). He played that role incredibly well.

76,76,10.0,5 July 2024,"First 2 seasons were great. Season 3 was good. Season 4 is just going downhill in a hurry. The violence and sexual content has always been extreme and even sometimes disturbing, but this season it goes into the disturbing realm more and more and for no real reason aside from perhaps shock value or cheap laughs. Not only that, but the plot and characters for the most part seem to be going in circles or scattered feeling with little real sense of purpose save for maybe some aspects (don't want to give spoilers).

I believe they are another show that's sacrificing quality content for political narrative and personal interests. There was an element of this in the early seasons but it was much more subtle and wasn't the focal point like it has now become. Maybe if they had some more of the principles of the side they're bashing they would have more viewers because I know I'm not the only one getting put off by their grotesque violence and disturbing sexual content.

The show is funny. Lots of quirky, clever, and laugh-out-loud scenes. There are, however, many over-the-top, outlandish and vile scenes that go too far. I'm not too keen on shows that use shock value to draw in viewers and this show has a lot of them.

With that aside it's an interesting take on how we generally view superheroes. What is the gist of the show? Imagine a below-average person: overly emotional, bad habits unchecked, and a slew of addictions. Take a bunch of them, give them superpowers, and throw them in positions of power and authority...

You'll quickly see how messy and funny this can get. It's very comedic and refreshing to see something not commonly done before.

The fact that so much of the plot is happening right now in front of our eyes, in the real world of US politics, only adds to the genius of this show.

The depiction of the right wing lunatics of America feels especially spot on. Goodness, how I´ve laughed.

Antony Starr´s performance as Homelander is second to none. None I tell you. Those facial expressions! He IS a psychopath. Haven´t seen this kind of 100% in- character since the glory days of Al Pacino. Just stellar. (Imagine Trump with a brain and superpowers. Gives me the chills.) There isn´t a single bad performance from any of the other casts, either. I thought for a while that ""the English element"" of Carl Urban´s Butcher might have been a bit over the top, but no. He is exactly who the show needs him to be, and he is absolutely brilliant.

105,105,10.0,18 August 2024,"If you're looking for something that completely flips the superhero genre on its head, *The Boys* is the show to watch. I went into it expecting another typical superhero series, but what I got was something far more intense, dark, and surprisingly real.

The characters are what really hooked me. They're so flawed and human, even the ones with powers. Karl Urban as Billy Butcher is just awesome-he's rough around the edges, but you can't help but root for him. And Homelander? Easily one of the scariest villains I've seen in a long time because he's so unpredictable and disturbingly charismatic.

The show does a great job of mixing brutal action with moments that make you think about the world we live in. It's not just about superheroes punching bad guys; it dives into issues like corporate greed and the dangers of hero worship. It's dark, it's funny, and it's super smart.

Honestly, The Boys isn't like any other superhero show out there. It's got a ton of twists and turns that keep you guessing, and it's not afraid to go places that are uncomfortable or shocking.

The first season is 10/10 for me. Yes the second season isn't as good, but still great. In the second season they reveal more secrets that was kept in first season. So in a way it feels slower. And there's some unnecessary plot, but maybe if they will make third season there's an explanation for this.

And I think people misunderstood the second season. They complaint about the series were forcing SJW agenda. Or forced LGBT theme, white power, etc. They missed the point. This series is actually exposing about how things work. It's all about money.

Here we see Superheroes, but they were just a pawn for big company. They don't care who you are, what your feeling, what your sex reference as long as you make money for them.

110,110,9.0,27 August 2024,"This is probably the only time you could fathom comparing a superhero show to another, normal show. I get immediately that seems a bit weird. There's not been many superhero live action projects as of recent or at least not a variety. Marvel with their Disney money put out a lot of stuff before, but are slowing down when they realise they can't really rival their back catalogue with absolutely dreadful writers.

So I haven't really watched any superhero projects as of recent that I've liked. I was immediately skeptic of the Boys as an uber-violent show and I didn't quite fancy it. I feared it would be, much like the work Garth Ennis produced in the comics, a good excuse for a lot of bloodbaths and edgy revenge storylines. Now I'm not saying this isn't partially in the show, especially in the immediate, but Erik Kripke and co. Have produced something a lot more with such a simple concept which could've been wasted on plotless blood spilling.

The concept of the Boys is simple. Supes are real, and they're everywhere. All superheroes are owned by the private multinational Vought Industries. As a result, Vought are the richest company in the world. Products, media coverage, movie franchises, everything is this one capitalist dystopia where a single company is a government sized power with massive influence. Vought have an Avengers, the Seven, headed by Homelander, a character not unlike Superman.

So we have this world which draws parallel with DC and Marvel. So what? What good does that do us? Well it's the GTA V to your SimCity. The world is messed up, superheroes are all corrupt, and the system is flawed. As a result, next to the massive evil industry tycoon and their superpower cronies, we allow ourselves to make any character who stands against them redeemable enough in the initial, motives and values aside.

This is where the show starts in season 1 - a group of social outcasts, miscreants and muscle trying to take revenge on the society that left them in awkward positions. Hughie Campbell, the protagonist is the most redeemable, however we see even he becomes more comfortable with ruthless action to stop the society around him.

This is the season 1 and 2 plot to a tee without any major spoilers - living in the dark, hiding from supes, blackmail, murder, all paralleled with the thuggish actions of the company who are supposed to be on the side of the good guys. This formula of revenge could start to be repetitive, but every season different core issues are tackled and different new variables come into play. With good writing, some of the best acting performances I've seen in a long time from an original show in its own separate sci-fi universe.

I feel however where the show really takes off is season 3 and 4. Now a lot of people say 4 is the worst season of the show. Take it from me, who watched the whole show in the last 3 weeks: it's not. At all. The concept still feels fresh, the ideas are great, there are just notable differences in tone and pace to season 3 which had the most action.

Season 3 and 4 move on from the revenger ideas and move more to explore the concept of superior life forms and the potential influence they could have on politics, the divisions they could form and the consequences of allowing them too many freedoms. It throws these ideas at all different angles with different powers: superheroes in plain sight, super-intelligence, you name it they've done stuff with it. And the show becomes more comfortable in the comedic value of some of its characters. It was great in the first 2 seasons but in the third season the show truly starts to understand what it wants to end on and we see this goal being progressed towards. Character growth is non-linear, with characters seeming to veer in one direction then being set on a completely different path, and I think this is what really makes the show entertaining, in that you physically cannot predict all the ridiculous ideas the superhero concept has never even attempted.

The show is a witty mockery of both society and superhero films. The satire is top notch and the enjoyability isn't ruined by concepts. Quite the contrary. The concepts define the show and its entertainment. It's a show so self aware of what it shouldn't be that it actively inserts what it could've been into the Vought TV channels and movies.

And then came the (inevitable) WAY OVER THE TOP obvious and extreme politically motivated and biased stereotyping nonsense..

138,138,9.0,23 July 2024,"I've watched all four Seasons now: Season one was good as it was fresh and new, two was ok and then it started to slide downhill from there. The series has it's characters stuck in a perpetual cycle, they make some progress and then they get slapped back down to start the cycle again. Which is fine and works for a bit but by season 4 it's feeling bit long in the tooth.

The gore throughout is somewhat over the top, the humour in places is just puerile relying on getting the most offensive words out just for shock but again by season 4 it's wearing a bit thin. Some of the jokes land but, honestly most of them feel like they were written by someone far too obsessed with reproductive organs and sexual acts.

I like to watch things to experience another reality of sorts, a fictional world with new dynamics however Season 4 seemed very blunt in drawing many parallels with real-world America (I'm not American and I don't even live there) which ruined bits for me. I want to know about the fictional world of ""The Boys"" not some champagne-socialists' world-view. This coupled with some bizarre character changes/decisions that come out from left-field and a fairly weak story left Season 4 on a fairly low-note. I'm not even remotely excited for the next season.

At most, given it's trajectory, it's got one season left where it should close out the storyline.

151,151,9.0,20 April 2021,"There are several hundred people in America with supernatural powers, led by The Seven, a team of the seven most famous, who operate under the powerful and all-pervading corporation Vought. The official purpose of this corporation is to take care of superheroes and perform logistical work related to their heroic deeds, but the corporation as a corporation is concerned primarily with profit, and the lives of their Supes are reduced primarily to PR and marketing, commercials, and superhero movies. And when, here and there, they set aside some time to fight crime and terrorism, ""Vought"" is there to cover up the collateral damage. However, some people refuse to accept that they are collateral damage, so they organize into a guerrilla unit, a kind of resistance movement, with the goal of exposing the true faces of selfish and arrogant superheroes and overthrowing the all-powerful corporation that has risen above of the law.

In essence, ""The Boys"" is a satire of the corporate system and society in which the individual is nothing and the flow of money is everything, presented in the form of a parody of the superhero genre and its rising popularity. Genre-wise, the series is a black-humored action thriller, explicitly vulgar, violent, and bloody. Over-the-top gorefest, spiced with just enough drama and romance to give it an emotional note and allow us to connect with the characters. Superheroes are diverse and I think there is a counterpart in the DC and Marvel universes for each of them. The parallels are obvious enough for an effective parody, and they differ just enough that the series does not risk a copyright lawsuit. Consistent with this, the other, non-superhero characters are clichéd, but they have a good enough characterization to be convincing and enough originality and variety not to be boring.

Karl Urban plays Billy Butcher, a seemingly intimidating, ruthless, cold-blooded vigilante who will not rest until the last superhero is dead. But when you get to know him a little better, his hard face, with a combination of macho attitude and British accent, will quickly charm you. Jack Quaid plays a nerd who does not know what hit him. Here we have someone to identify with, and to show us that each of us, no matter how we feel insignificant, can make a difference if his heart is in the right place. There's also Frenchie, my favorite character in the series. Israeli actor Tomer Capon, with a perfect fake French accent, plays a charming expert in weapons, drugs, and improvisation and, as he says himself, ""the troubled teenager of the group"".

The series is full of various characters, and I didn't list even the leading ones. I stayed on these three because they left the strongest impression on me. It's up to you to see the show and maybe get attached to some completely different ones. I believe that there is something for everyone. It's not a masterpiece of television and may not even enter the top 100 TV series in terms of quality, but for those who, like me, have long been tired of movies that cover up shallowness with special effects and visual spectacle, ""The Boys"" brings more than a touch of freshness to the superhero genre.

182,182,8.0,11 September 2019,"Garth Ennis penned a great series indeed.

So how do we make a big flip on the superhero genre and make it fun again after the comic fatigue has set in? We make the series about non-superheroes who hate and want to kill the superheroes of course! This is not your typical cape story, this is about the public at large around the superheroes in a world that's written realistically about how superheroes would exist.

Hughie was having an ordinary typical day with his girlfriend, the future seemed bright. Only for everything to change in a quick flash of red, his girlfriend is no more, leaving him standing on the sidewalk, unable to even comprehend what is happening. He watches as an intoxicated superhero stumbles away, and is left with the aftermath. Understandably upset, he is approached by a man named Billy Butcher, and if he'd been in the right state of mind, he'd probably have told Billy Butcher to tottle on. But this is where the story begins.

This series is intelligently written, and downright hysterically comedic. There are so many elements that I'd love to write about, but that'd be spoilers. Hughie is played by Jack Quaid, whom I've never seen before but has a great delivery that makes the role believable, and his father Hugh is played by Simon Pegg (who is always amazing). Billy Butcher is played by Karl Urban in what I would say is possibly his best performance to date. This series is not about superheroes, this series is about the people who are disillusioned and despise the superheroes. The superhero characters are the driving force of the plot, but they are not the main characters by any means. And our antagonist is Homelander, played by Antony Starr, who basically comes off as the Christopher Reeve superman if he hated humans and lost the fight with his evil half in the junkyard. He's great in the role.

If you're a fan of the comics, you might have a few nitpicks here and there, the series is a DRASTIC contrast to the comic books. Some of the base elements are unchanged, but the actual events tend to be drastically different. When the series reveals how and why there are super ""heroes,"" and then reveals how and why there are super villains it really elevates the entire thing.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",garth ennis penned a great series indeed so how do we make a big flip on the superhero genre and make it fun again after the comic fatigue has set in we make the series about nonsuperheroes who hate and want to kill the superheroes of course this is not your typical cape story this is about the public at large around the superheroes in a world thats written realistically about how superheroes would exist hughie was having an ordinary typical day with his girlfriend the future seemed bright only for everything to change in a quick flash of red his girlfriend is no more leaving him standing on the sidewalk unable to even comprehend what is happening he watches as an intoxicated superhero stumbles away and is left with the aftermath understandably upset he is approached by a man named billy butcher and if hed been in the right state of mind hed probably have told billy butcher to tottle on but this is where the story begins this series is intelligently written and downright hysterically comedic there are so many elements that id love to write about but thatd be spoilers hughie is played by jack quaid whom ive never seen before but has a great delivery that makes the role believable and his father hugh is played by simon pegg who is always amazing billy butcher is played by karl urban in what i would say is possibly his best performance to date this series is not about superheroes this series is about the people who are disillusioned and despise the superheroes the superhero characters are the driving force of the plot but they are not the main characters by any means and our antagonist is homelander played by antony starr who basically comes off as the christopher reeve superman if he hated humans and lost the fight with his evil half in the junkyard hes great in the role if youre a fan of the comics you might have a few nitpicks here and there the series is a drastic contrast to the comic books some of the base elements are unchanged but the actual events tend to be drastically different when the series reveals how and why there are super heroes and then reveals how and why there are super villains it really elevates the entire thing,POSITIVE
183,183,10.0,8 August 2024,"I was really surprised by how good the first season was. When I reviewed the show back then I gave it 9 stars. I wish there was a way to rate seasons separately in IMDb.

Super hero fatigue hit me several years before this show first aired. The umpteen installments from Marvel and DC have bored me to tears as it's more or less the same thing over and over again. But The Boys came as a complete surprise to me. It has real characters and an intriguing story. And it's funny! Unlike the tepid humor and dad jokes in the neutered Marvel kids movies. Furthermore, the acting was really good for the most part (Frenchie being the glaringly obvious exemption). I can't remember if I've seen the guy who plays The Deep before, but he's a real find. Homelander is fantastic as is Kimiko. And Starlight was truly the heart of the show anchored by an excellent performance.

Although not as good as the first, the second season was still good.

The decline begins in season 3, which I rewatched after the release of season 4. It is essentially eight episodes of fluff. At the end of the season every character essentially ends up where they started with nothing really changing, kind of like an episode of The Simpsons. Crazy shenanigans ensue, but next week they're right back where they started. It was also at this point that this show was beginning to feel pretty drawn out and with no clear end goal in sight (because why kill a cash cow?).

The fourth season is not very good. It's as if both the actors and the creators are starting to get fed up with this show and are only going through the motions.

Karl Urban is good as Butcher, although his ""Oi govna!"" routine is starting to get a bit old.

The writers obviously have no idea what to do with Kimiko and Frenchie, so they're mostly off on some inconsequential sidequest. Despite spending three seasons building up the relationship between Frenchie and Kimiko, he's apparently gay now. That is, until he's not at the end of the season. I guess that counts as character development in the 2020's. I wish the writers could come up with something real for Kimiko to do. I would not mind one bit if they killed off Frenchie, one of the hammiest hams that have ever hammed. Same with Mother's Milk to be honest. In season 4 he's more or less a glorified extra. Shame, because he had the potential for an interesting story.

Starlight's change in both physical appearance and acting is jarring. In the fourth season she looks bored out of her mind and is slurring her words like she's constantly hammered. As I said, she was the highlight in the early seasons of this show, little traces of which can be seen in the later ones.

203,203,10.0,4 August 2024,"The Boys started as a remarkable series, but it seems destined to end poorly. During the first two seasons, I frequently recommended it to friends, especially when it was still relatively unknown. It was original, with a compelling story that was entertaining to watch. Although it always had subpar acting, the captivating plot overshadowed this flaw. Now, with the conclusion of the fourth season, my perspective has completely changed.

The first season stands out as the best by far, introducing a unique world filled with perversions and human-like traits in superhumans, bringing a realistic touch to a fantastical scenario. The story progressed rapidly, keeping the audience's attention despite the limited budget and mediocre performances.

The second season, while slightly inferior to the first, still featured numerous iconic scenes and a well-developed plot. However, the third season marked a significant decline in quality. Despite this, there was hope that the fourth season would restore the series to its former glory.

Unfortunately, the fourth season was a complete disappointment. The director seemed more focused on making political statements than on continuing to develop one of the best series in history. This approach would be better suited for political debate programs rather than creating propaganda caricatures. The season was riddled with competing subplots, poorly developed characters, and left viewers confused, resembling a mediocre Disney or Netflix series. It's important to note that I am from Chile and have no affiliation with the Republican Party in the USA, as some might assume.

As of this comment, the fifth season has not yet been released, but given the current trajectory, it seems likely to be a significant letdown.

206,206,7.0,20 September 2019,"First, I love this show. It feels a lot like 'Watchmen' with a Dark Comedy twist to it. It's fun and crazy!

Now, I've seen a lot of Movies and TV series. Sadly, it's much more than the average person. I'm not even sure if Dark Comedy is extreme enough to describe it. There are so many 'over the top' dark moments that are or could be funny, but at the expense or in the wake of extreme graphic brutality.

I'm not saying this is bad, it just is. Film and television go through these kind of evolutionary jumps where something extreme is done and the 'shock and awe' of it creates a new level where it then becomes the new standard. Then Hollywood does what it always does, rinse and repeat, until we become desensitized to this new standard. Think back to the first 'Saw' movie. It was graphic and shocking, but now 20 years of that standard and that same movie seems almost tame. As for rinse and repeat, do I need to bring up 'The Blair Witch Project""?!

This series is awesome and graphic and funny, and funny in the dark recesses in your mind, and fun! It's well worth the watch, but be warned......It's got everything left in! If you are opposed to your kids watching sex, nudity, drugs, graphic gore scenes, language, rape, sexual harassment, video game type violence....you better keep them away.

Up until season 4, this is a solid 10/10 for its genre, no question.

Season 4 sadly goes the classic political route and sacrifices every other episode to just straight up hammer on republicans in every possible way.

Season 3 goes further downhill in this regard and by the time you make it to season 4 it takes up so much of dialogue that it's almost unbearable.

It's impossible to ignore it because it takes up so much of the dialogue.

223,223,10.0,26 July 2019,"Very interesting and dare I say frighteningly realistic take on the superhero genre, combining it with everything that has corrupted the modern real world - out of control capitalism, corporations and money controlling politics and basically everything, and the across-the-board corruption of moral values that ensues. Now that might sound gruelling but the show mostly keeps a pretty light tone of black comedy satire while it makes its pointed social critiques.

I don't love the Hughie character or performance but Karl Urban is an absolute riot in every scene he's in and the rest of the cast is pretty good. Visually and in terms of score it's not quite on par with the best things out there but definitely above average, and there's a wit and creativity to the writing that you'd expect from a show created by Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen. I just hope they keep their eyes on the road this time, given their last show Preacher (also based on an insane comics) took a serious dive after its fantastic first season when it seemed like they got distracted with other projects.

230,230,10.0,27 July 2019,"Well finally visual superhero media begins to catch up with comics. Unfortunately it's only just caught up with the superhero deconstruction that began waaaayy back in the eighties. Witness the enthusiastic and overly glowing reviews of people who've never encountered this angle before. Sadly this is already ""old hat"" for many of us.

I quite like Garth Ennis but his work has never been the pinnacle of the ""superhero as flawed icon"" trope. Ennis is known for his darkly humourous plotlines but they always seem a little bit juvenile to me. Always crude and frequently cruel with a toilet humour bent not forgetting his perpetual adolescent treatment of female characters.

I think this series is so busy trying to be so edgy that it actually fails to be entirely compelling.

Don't get me wrong it's very well made and occasionally very entertaining but copious swearing, sex scenes and crudely intentioned bloody violence are not a valid substitute for a well crafted story.

236,236,1.0,13 October 2024,"Previously, I always considered television series as a form of entertainment that was too long and boring. However, The Boys managed to change my view completely.

Since the first episode, The Boys has succeeded in attracting my attention with its dark plot, full of surprises, and complex characters. This series presents a superhero world that is very different from the one we know before. The superheroes here are not perfect heroes, but rather a group of corrupt, selfish, and power-hungry individuals.

What makes The Boys so special? First, this series dares to reveal the dark side of the superhero industry. With sharp satire, The Boys satirizes big companies that control superheroes and use them for personal gain. Second, the characters in this series are very interesting. Starting from Billy Butcher, the leader of The Boys who is thirsty for revenge, to Homelander, a superhero who is hungry for power and has a very narcissistic personality. Each character has a complex background and motivation, thus making the audience continue to be curious about the development of the story.

One of the things I admire most about The Boys is its courage to show violence and explicit scenes. Despite its brutal appearance, the violence in this series has a clear purpose, namely to show the dark side of superpowers and the consequences of abuse of power. Apart from that, the dark humor that often appears in this series also succeeded in making me laugh out loud.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",previously i always considered television series as a form of entertainment that was too long and boring however the boys managed to change my view completely since the first episode the boys has succeeded in attracting my attention with its dark plot full of surprises and complex characters this series presents a superhero world that is very different from the one we know before the superheroes here are not perfect heroes but rather a group of corrupt selfish and powerhungry individuals what makes the boys so special first this series dares to reveal the dark side of the superhero industry with sharp satire the boys satirizes big companies that control superheroes and use them for personal gain second the characters in this series are very interesting starting from billy butcher the leader of the boys who is thirsty for revenge to homelander a superhero who is hungry for power and has a very narcissistic personality each character has a complex background and motivation thus making the audience continue to be curious about the development of the story one of the things i admire most about the boys is its courage to show violence and explicit scenes despite its brutal appearance the violence in this series has a clear purpose namely to show the dark side of superpowers and the consequences of abuse of power apart from that the dark humor that often appears in this series also succeeded in making me laugh out loud,POSITIVE

First of all is the amazing setting, a world very closely related to ours, apart from the obvious. The twist of having the supes be the bad guys is just incredible. But everything here really has to be praised about the original works. Let's get that out there.

What really stands out here is the efficiency with which they translated the great story into video, and this is just from a technical point of view. The world is immersive, the preformances believable, the visuals impressive, and the blurred lines between drama and comedy blend in in such a way that you find yourself drowning in its glory for 8 episodes that just pass right trhough you in a flash, and I'm talking hour longs.

247,247,10.0,17 June 2022,"I don't like superhero tv show adaptations so I have no idea what made me start watching this but I'm sure glad I did. You don't have to like superheroes you just have to love a laugh. It's unorthodox and isn't afraid of getting gory. Heroes in Marvel and DC universe are great, it's la la land where the heroes always save the day but you might have read a thread on how we'd hate to live in a city with heroes... imagine Hulk using your car as a shield, Batman assaulting people, apartment building torn down during an invasion, or if luck has it, have the Flash on drugs running through your girlfriend. The collateral damage would be insane. We would hate superheroes if we're pragmatic about it and that's what The Boys is about. It's filthy, vulgar, violent and realistic take on them.

One way to distinct this from Marvel/DC is how the writers of endgame refused to give us Antman crawling up Thanos's butt to save half the universe from obliteration, small price to pay. The writers over at Amazon tv however, went a step further on that, and it wasn't to save the world, nope, just some random suped up villain that had no significance to the series. They did it just because they could and I love them for it. I love how the characters in the show take everything sternly, nothing's funny, they're out for revenge or putting a stop to corruption, searching for justice, or doing their jobs, none of them are trying to be funny but it all just ends up humorous. The story is so well written and the series is paced well so it has no dull moments. Homelander's character depth is unrivaled in the genre, almost on par with some of the best drama series characters. Had high expectations after watching the first season, it somehow surpassed them in S2, S3 is off to a decent start as well and I hope this never loses it's essence.

252,252,10.0,28 July 2019,"I had never heard of this source material before and upon seeing this trailer I, being a cynic, initially thought this dark, bloody, violent, Rated R superhero type of tone they were going for was a studio's blatant attempt to copy Deadpool because of that franchise's recent success. Or maybe they took the fighting superheroes thing from Marvel's Civil War or DC's Batman v Superman.

Boy was I wrong! This was such a different and original concept that organically grew throughout the season. If I had to compare it to something it'd be Watchmen, but that really doesnt do this show justice.

From the second scene you already started caring for the characters. The characters are genuine, and deeper than they initially seem. Acting was phenomenal, the writing was fresh and original, and the thing I really liked about the show was the pacing. There was never a dry scene and I never checked my watch, because there was constantly something happening or some tension building for a big payoff.

253,253,10.0,12 July 2022,"What starts out as a fresh, inventive superhero satire devolves into drab plot lines in season 2. The Butcher persona is a hoot of a caricature in the beginning, however he quickly turns into a tired, same old one-note character. Starlight is uninspired and is someone I never feel like rooting for, and her storyline with Hughie is equally boring. I do like Maeve and wish that she gets more airtime. Certain episodes do stand out (Herogasm, anyone?). But the true savior of the series is the emergence of Jensen Ackles as Soldier Boy in mid-season 3. He is perfectly cast with his handsome manly looks, strong presence, and the funniest delivery of non-PC acerbic lines that only a vintage supe could utter. I hope there will be more Ackles in future seasons to come.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",what starts out as a fresh inventive superhero satire devolves into drab plot lines in season the butcher persona is a hoot of a caricature in the beginning however he quickly turns into a tired same old onenote character starlight is uninspired and is someone i never feel like rooting for and her storyline with hughie is equally boring i do like maeve and wish that she gets more airtime certain episodes do stand out herogasm anyone but the true savior of the series is the emergence of jensen ackles as soldier boy in midseason he is perfectly cast with his handsome manly looks strong presence and the funniest delivery of nonpc acerbic lines that only a vintage supe could utter i hope there will be more ackles in future seasons to come,NEGATIVE

255,255,6.0,29 July 2019,"I will start by saying that I have yet to read the graphic novel series by Garth Ennis though I intend to start it since I have bought the entire series. I'm strictly basing this review off of the show and not the contrasting differences of the comic. The show is about The Boys AKA a specialized group of people seeking to take down the conglomerate known as Vought who use The Seven whom is an alternative JL of sorts down. Simple yet very effective with a handful of really well done twists. The acting was Incredible. The standouts being The Homelander played by Antony Starr whom I'm overjoyed is coming off of his hit show Banshee. Literally killing it as a clone of Supes. The second being Billy Butcher played by Karl Urban. Incredible acting with multiple dashes of humor. Everyone as a collective did an outstanding job of selling the world minus one or two whom seemed out of place. The action was fire; this is what happens when you have a company like Amazon take the reins on a Mature comic and have no censorship and allowing the team to make it how it deserves to be made and in-turn allowing your fan base to be delighted. Lots of cursing and limbs flying to make the Cirque du Soleil jealous. The cinematography was stunning. The world being sold even though it's on a small scale with it seeming to expand in S2. I'd recommend this show in a heartbeat if you enjoy the likes of Deadpool, Logan and other M rated versions of comic related material. 8 episodes goes by way too fast.

256,256,2.0,10 March 2024,"Initially, I had some reservations about this series, but those doubts quickly faded once I started watching it. Typically, I'd recommend giving it 2-3 episodes to really get into it, and then you're hooked.

Finally, we're presented with a universe where heroes aren't necessarily good, despite similarly being considered gods. It explores what happens when the world isn't just good, but evil, even for superheroes. While there are some forgettable characters (heroes), they often don't stick around long enough for you to care about them, which seems to be a deliberate choice by the writers.

And then there's Homelander... Love or Hate him, but you simply can't help but have strong feelings about that guy!

270,270,10.0,23 July 2024,"To begin, I am a fan of the concept behind The Boys. The idea that superheroes are a reality and that they are monetized in every feasible way is not only hilarious but fascinating. However, that idea works on its own and does not require any injection of progressive political leanings or references to current events to work. Homelander represents conservatives and Hollywood writers hate them, we get it. Making him needlessly brutal is not necessary. Similarly, Starlight represents progressivism, but making her a champion of everything from feminism ro abortion is just unnecessary. Had the writers been more subtle about it, it would have been a lot easier for viewers to get attached to them.

However, that's just one part of the problem. Since the writers seem to be focusing on their political leanings, they are completely butchering the story. Nowehre is this more apparent than in the constant use of fuilthy sexual imagery in the fourth season. I don't have a weak stomach and it takes a lot to get me to flinch, but even I think that much of the content is gratuitous and does nothing to advance the story. If it's meant to be funny, the writers have clearly missed the mark. Nevertheless, it doesn't seem to be meant as funny as much as an insult to people who lean right. I can't help but notice that Homelander's allies in the story all have extreme sexual perversions while Starlight's all appear wholesome and decent. It is definitely getting very exhausting.

Much like with The Witcher, I wish writers would just stick to the stellar storylines that have already been written for them and simply reproduce them for the screen. Their adaptations are genuinely awful, and it should not be a secret to them why the industry is struggling as it is. I don't want to root for artificial intelligence but I don't think a computer could do any worse than they are at the moment.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",to begin i am a fan of the concept behind the boys the idea that superheroes are a reality and that they are monetized in every feasible way is not only hilarious but fascinating however that idea works on its own and does not require any injection of progressive political leanings or references to current events to work homelander represents conservatives and hollywood writers hate them we get it making him needlessly brutal is not necessary similarly starlight represents progressivism but making her a champion of everything from feminism ro abortion is just unnecessary had the writers been more subtle about it it would have been a lot easier for viewers to get attached to them however thats just one part of the problem since the writers seem to be focusing on their political leanings they are completely butchering the story nowehre is this more apparent than in the constant use of fuilthy sexual imagery in the fourth season i dont have a weak stomach and it takes a lot to get me to flinch but even i think that much of the content is gratuitous and does nothing to advance the story if its meant to be funny the writers have clearly missed the mark nevertheless it doesnt seem to be meant as funny as much as an insult to people who lean right i cant help but notice that homelanders allies in the story all have extreme sexual perversions while starlights all appear wholesome and decent it is definitely getting very exhausting much like with the witcher i wish writers would just stick to the stellar storylines that have already been written for them and simply reproduce them for the screen their adaptations are genuinely awful and it should not be a secret to them why the industry is struggling as it is i dont want to root for artificial intelligence but i dont think a computer could do any worse than they are at the moment,NEGATIVE

The way the story is told, from the perspective of the people that are usually regarded to as ""bad guys"" in super hero movies makes this an even better watch, as it's different. It's definitely not aimed at kids, which is one of the key reasons that it works, it doesn't care if it offends anyone, and therefore the universe engulfs you entirely.

Home-lander is a devilishly well acted character, he feels like an Ed Kemper (From Mindhunter) but rather in a comic way, which makes him feels even more psychotic than he already is.

Hughie is a great character as well, with great comedic prowess throughout the story, however I don't think I'd call him a main character, but rather an introductory character. He's one of the people that make me think a bit more about the series as his development arc is really good.

Cinematography is very good as well, with some shots that I swear will become classics, and shots that people in film school will be looking at in the future. The contrasty tone makes the entire series feel dark.

The one thing that makes me rate this series just slightly lower, is the incredibly annoying product placement in some of the scenes, some are just so obvious it can distract from the story and break the flow of the show. I don't care about the product placement itself, just the fact that it break the flow of the show sometimes.

Gore aside the acting is top notch from everyone even characters that only get a scene or two. The story is pretty good but I did find with a short 8 episode season it moved along almost to fast. It would have been nice to get a bit more in depth but still considering it was only 8 episodes I really shouldn't be complaining.

300,300,9.0,5 August 2024,"The Boys was easily one of the greatest shows on television!! Season 1, Episode 1 will get you addicted, all the way till the end of season 2. But, the show quickly becomes disjointed and drawn out by season 3 with excessive perversion and exhausting/needless plot twists. It's obvious that with its initial popularity, the producers of The Boys are now using it as a ""cash grab"" to keep it on the air longer. A great disappointment, The Boys would've done better with a shorter plot line, and intentional storytelling, as a limited series.

303,303,10.0,8 August 2019,"Bottom line, this is this is one of the better TV shows in the last several years, and the best thing to happen to superhero media since Watchmen. For film fanatics that would be a good place to start with a comparison. I admit my opinion of superhero movies and TV may be slanted more toward story driven experiences like Logan, vs more pure action experiences.

To offer some explanation of what The Boys offers, the world is one where superheroes exist, but their activity is tied into big business, corporate interests, politics and religion. The Boys displays some insane version of what our world would be like if people with superpowers existed. The viewer gets to experience this world from the eyes of civilians, mercenaries, superheroes, and those who are trying to exploit their power. The world is unique, but speaks to contemporary themes, and while grounded enough to be very convincing? One could also draw from The Boys a great deal of symbolism that would parallel modern events. But like the best of any given media, the entertainment comes first, and that entertainment is delivered from the first to the final scene.

The Boys, having 8 episodes to travel across the story arc, delivers a deep, rich experience. The Boys also has a consistent humor, despite the violence, corruption and other negative themes present. Even though so much is wrong in The Boys, there is an underlying feeling of optimism that I really, really appreciate.

The Boys does have shock value, right from the beginning - but I'd still call this a show for everyone. Well, anyone prepared for graphic violence, intense sexual situations, and otherwise mature themes.

The major strengths are writing, production, casting and (in terms of storytelling) - perspective. Everything is at least good, but the writing is absolutely fantastic. Every episode has mesmerizing dialog that ranges from very convincing situations to, ""did he really just say that?"". The production is AAA film quality, but The Boys knows what it is, and doesn't (ever) rely on special effects the way many comic films do. Karl Urban is always good, and this is a great role for his tool set. He leads the way, but all the characters hold up, and it's amazing how much texture each character has by the end of the show. They all have a story.

Which brings me to the strongest storytelling element: Perspective. The viewer gets to see the story from multiple perspectives, and since so much changes, the characters evolve throughout this changing perspective. And this would come back to the complexity of the writing, which is why The Boys is so refreshing in the superhero sub-genre. The complexity is delivered with such stunning ease, analysis becomes challenging - the immersion is real. I would give my highest recommendation.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",bottom line this is this is one of the better tv shows in the last several years and the best thing to happen to superhero media since watchmen for film fanatics that would be a good place to start with a comparison i admit my opinion of superhero movies and tv may be slanted more toward story driven experiences like logan vs more pure action experiences to offer some explanation of what the boys offers the world is one where superheroes exist but their activity is tied into big business corporate interests politics and religion the boys displays some insane version of what our world would be like if people with superpowers existed the viewer gets to experience this world from the eyes of civilians mercenaries superheroes and those who are trying to exploit their power the world is unique but speaks to contemporary themes and while grounded enough to be very convincing one could also draw from the boys a great deal of symbolism that would parallel modern events but like the best of any given media the entertainment comes first and that entertainment is delivered from the first to the final scene the boys having episodes to travel across the story arc delivers a deep rich experience the boys also has a consistent humor despite the violence corruption and other negative themes present even though so much is wrong in the boys there is an underlying feeling of optimism that i really really appreciate the boys does have shock value right from the beginning but id still call this a show for everyone well anyone prepared for graphic violence intense sexual situations and otherwise mature themes the major strengths are writing production casting and in terms of storytelling perspective everything is at least good but the writing is absolutely fantastic every episode has mesmerizing dialog that ranges from very convincing situations to did he really just say that the production is aaa film quality but the boys knows what it is and doesnt ever rely on special effects the way many comic films do karl urban is always good and this is a great role for his tool set he leads the way but all the characters hold up and its amazing how much texture each character has by the end of the show they all have a story which brings me to the strongest storytelling element perspective the viewer gets to see the story from multiple perspectives and since so much changes the characters evolve throughout this changing perspective and this would come back to the complexity of the writing which is why the boys is so refreshing in the superhero subgenre the complexity is delivered with such stunning ease analysis becomes challenging the immersion is real i would give my highest recommendation,POSITIVE

315,315,9.0,5 August 2022,"I just finished watching 3 seasons of this great show. The acting is terrific, especially by the guy who plays Homelander (Antony Starr).

Homelander is by far the best villain I've seen executed in a comic book, live-action show or movie; beaten by the previous best, Heath ledger's legendary joker and even Omni Man from Invincible.

He is unpredictable, terrifying and downright disturbing to watch at times; while still being a superbly written complex character.

Butcher is also an amazing anti-hero character, played by the charismatic and talented Karl Urban. He does things unconventionally but gets the job done superbly.

The rest of the cast is amazing as well, including Hughie, MM, Annie and the others.

Most people knew they were crooks, somehow the news sources were play three blind mice as long as the checks cleared. And that's just in my small community.

This kind getting away with things because the money is good happens all over. Not only getting away with it, but having it reversed on the victims, it was somehow their fault. Like in the very first episode.

But enough preaching about not believing things like these guys must be the best lawyers to hire because they're on TV the most. (it actually means they're looking to settle your case five minutes after you hire them with the least amount of work)

The dialogue is probably the best on TV right now. They define what motivates each character. They writing is superb.

427,427,9.0,27 July 2019,"I'm heavily into the MCU films; they're extraordinary to me. So when I saw the trailer for ""The Boys"" I was immediately interested. I had feelings it may be kinda over-done due to how excessive the trailer was, but man, it really blew my expectations out of my head. With laser beams.

Plot- A man hellbent on vengeance (although not explained right away) aims to take down the corrupt superhero organization ""The Seven"" which just acquired a new, innocent hero. He seeks the help of a young man who lost his girlfriend in a superhero accident, and from there it completely rocks you. I thought at first ""how will they do it?"" But the show is purely clever. The plot never slags.

Writing- I thought this show would totally rely on non-stop profanity, sex, violence. While it is heavily explicit, the show pops with its highly likeable and multifaceted characters, a wild storyline, intensity, and most of all- substance.

Characters/Acting- While not every single character gets an extensive backstory (no idea who Black Noir is but he looks cool and doesn't speak) I still felt myself feeling for them. The Seven ""heroes"" are always interesting even though you might not see exactly what they are totally capable of. Homelander is completely chilling as a manipulative Superman-esque figure. The actors have the power to make you tear up. Perfect casting (although I'm not a fan of Elizabeth Shue... woman stop smiling in every scene!)

Quality- It's got a gritty, yet focused style that truly has some good special EFX. The violence is very realistic yet downright nasty and relentless. The cinematography is awesome, very tense. The music is great, often starting the show with a quick song snippet and an inciting incident.

Overall, if you like action, dramedy, and can handle gore, you should not turn it down. Every episode felt like a movie- there was no slag in the story (unlike Netflix's shows that continually waste whole entire episodes monotonously chatting.) If you have Prime and like a wild show every now and then, check it.

436,436,9.0,7 August 2024,"""The Boys"" is a groundbreaking web series that has redefined the superhero genre with its dark, satirical, and unapologetically gritty narrative. Premiering on Amazon Prime Video, this series, based on the comic book of the same name by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson, presents a world where superheroes, or ""supes,"" are not the paragons of virtue typically seen in traditional comic books. Instead, they are flawed, corrupt, and often morally bankrupt individuals, driven by greed, power, and a desire for celebrity status. This subversion of the superhero archetype is one of the show's most compelling features, providing a fresh and cynical perspective on the genre.

At the heart of ""The Boys"" is the titular group, a ragtag team of vigilantes led by Billy Butcher (played by Karl Urban), whose mission is to expose the truth about the supes and the powerful corporation Vought International that controls them. Butcher's personal vendetta against Homelander (Antony Starr), the most powerful and sociopathic supe, drives much of the series' tension and drama. The dynamic between Butcher and his team members, including Hughie Campbell (Jack Quaid), Mother's Milk (Laz Alonso), Frenchie (Tomer Capon), and Kimiko (Karen Fukuhara), adds depth to the narrative, showcasing themes of loyalty, revenge, and the fight for justice in a corrupt world.

One of the series' strengths lies in its ability to blend intense action with sharp social commentary. ""The Boys"" is not just a show about superpowers and explosive battles; it is a biting critique of contemporary society, exploring issues such as corporate greed, media manipulation, and the cult of celebrity. The supes, managed by Vought, are depicted as commodities, their images carefully curated and marketed to the public. This reflection of real-world celebrity culture and corporate exploitation adds a layer of realism to the fantastical elements of the series.

Moreover, ""The Boys"" does not shy away from depicting the brutality and consequences of violence. The graphic and often shocking scenes serve to underscore the moral ambiguities of its characters and the world they inhabit. This unflinching portrayal of violence and its impact is a stark contrast to the often sanitized action sequences found in mainstream superhero media, making ""The Boys"" stand out as a more mature and thought-provoking alternative.

The performances in ""The Boys"" are another standout aspect. Karl Urban's portrayal of Billy Butcher is intense and charismatic, capturing the character's relentless drive and underlying pain. Antony Starr's Homelander is chillingly effective, embodying the menacing charm and hidden psychopathy of a supe gone rogue. The supporting cast, including Erin Moriarty as Starlight, Jessie T. Usher as A-Train, and Dominique McElligott as Queen Maeve, deliver nuanced performances that add complexity to their characters.

Visually, the series is impressive, with high production values evident in its special effects, cinematography, and set design. The urban landscapes and corporate environments are meticulously crafted, creating a believable and immersive world. The attention to detail in both the mundane and the extraordinary aspects of the setting helps ground the fantastical elements in a recognizable reality.

""The Boys"" is a masterful blend of action, drama, and satire, offering a unique take on the superhero genre that challenges conventional narratives and explores darker, more complex themes. Its success lies in its ability to entertain while provoking thought and reflection on the nature of power, corruption, and heroism. As it continues to push boundaries and defy expectations, ""The Boys"" has firmly established itself as a must-watch series that resonates with audiences looking for something different from the typical superhero fare.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",the boys is a groundbreaking web series that has redefined the superhero genre with its dark satirical and unapologetically gritty narrative premiering on amazon prime video this series based on the comic book of the same name by garth ennis and darick robertson presents a world where superheroes or supes are not the paragons of virtue typically seen in traditional comic books instead they are flawed corrupt and often morally bankrupt individuals driven by greed power and a desire for celebrity status this subversion of the superhero archetype is one of the shows most compelling features providing a fresh and cynical perspective on the genre at the heart of the boys is the titular group a ragtag team of vigilantes led by billy butcher played by karl urban whose mission is to expose the truth about the supes and the powerful corporation vought international that controls them butchers personal vendetta against homelander antony starr the most powerful and sociopathic supe drives much of the series tension and drama the dynamic between butcher and his team members including hughie campbell jack quaid mothers milk laz alonso frenchie tomer capon and kimiko karen fukuhara adds depth to the narrative showcasing themes of loyalty revenge and the fight for justice in a corrupt world one of the series strengths lies in its ability to blend intense action with sharp social commentary the boys is not just a show about superpowers and explosive battles it is a biting critique of contemporary society exploring issues such as corporate greed media manipulation and the cult of celebrity the supes managed by vought are depicted as commodities their images carefully curated and marketed to the public this reflection of realworld celebrity culture and corporate exploitation adds a layer of realism to the fantastical elements of the series moreover the boys does not shy away from depicting the brutality and consequences of violence the graphic and often shocking scenes serve to underscore the moral ambiguities of its characters and the world they inhabit this unflinching portrayal of violence and its impact is a stark contrast to the often sanitized action sequences found in mainstream superhero media making the boys stand out as a more mature and thoughtprovoking alternative the performances in the boys are another standout aspect karl urbans portrayal of billy butcher is intense and charismatic capturing the characters relentless drive and underlying pain antony starrs homelander is chillingly effective embodying the menacing charm and hidden psychopathy of a supe gone rogue the supporting cast including erin moriarty as starlight jessie t usher as atrain and dominique mcelligott as queen maeve deliver nuanced performances that add complexity to their characters visually the series is impressive with high production values evident in its special effects cinematography and set design the urban landscapes and corporate environments are meticulously crafted creating a believable and immersive world the attention to detail in both the mundane and the extraordinary aspects of the setting helps ground the fantastical elements in a recognizable reality the boys is a masterful blend of action drama and satire offering a unique take on the superhero genre that challenges conventional narratives and explores darker more complex themes its success lies in its ability to entertain while provoking thought and reflection on the nature of power corruption and heroism as it continues to push boundaries and defy expectations the boys has firmly established itself as a mustwatch series that resonates with audiences looking for something different from the typical superhero fare,POSITIVE

When of course heroes only ever do the right things and sometimes refuse to sacrifice for the greater good, it can sometimes be somewhat annoying.

However this show, revolves around a small group of people that are sick and tired of heroes does the exact opposite of this. The 'supes' in this show are selfish and morally debatable, and that in itself is refreshing. The show of course depicts people trying to prove that superheroes aren't super at all but are just selfish and destructive. Which gives a refreshing twist to the common superhero formula.

488,488,9.0,5 June 2022,"The quest to create the perfect human using secret methods is as old as time - Hitler invented cocaine in his efforts to create a super human military. I normally like reading reviews but most here are, not surprisingly, from a very young crowd who mainly see this as a new twist on the super hero theme. All in all, it's a well done fantasy with great attention to detail right down to the cheap gaudy costumes, dramatization of the idiotic way the public reacts to celebrities, how celebrities control the media, and how the giant corporations control politics. It's very graphic & violent w/fetish situations. The characters are people we get to know and have an investment in even if we don't necessarily like them. Lots of interesting characters, situations, & surprises. It's dark but humorous although not in the black humor genre. I haven't gotten to S3 yet so the many saying the series bends to the woke theme at that point, I haven't experienced. But so far it's more of a lens at how rediculous the far end of each narrative is. All I can say on that is, anyone who sees Homelander as a rep of the Republicans had an extremely warped sense of what the Republicans actually stand for. But I guarantee many libs watching think that's exactly what they stand for. But I see this as more of an extreme caraciture of how the media interprets ideals, and in that sense it's intended as a sad comment on those who buy into their hype.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",the quest to create the perfect human using secret methods is as old as time hitler invented cocaine in his efforts to create a super human military i normally like reading reviews but most here are not surprisingly from a very young crowd who mainly see this as a new twist on the super hero theme all in all its a well done fantasy with great attention to detail right down to the cheap gaudy costumes dramatization of the idiotic way the public reacts to celebrities how celebrities control the media and how the giant corporations control politics its very graphic violent wfetish situations the characters are people we get to know and have an investment in even if we dont necessarily like them lots of interesting characters situations surprises its dark but humorous although not in the black humor genre i havent gotten to s yet so the many saying the series bends to the woke theme at that point i havent experienced but so far its more of a lens at how rediculous the far end of each narrative is all i can say on that is anyone who sees homelander as a rep of the republicans had an extremely warped sense of what the republicans actually stand for but i guarantee many libs watching think thats exactly what they stand for but i see this as more of an extreme caraciture of how the media interprets ideals and in that sense its intended as a sad comment on those who buy into their hype,POSITIVE
489,489,10.0,18 September 2020,"Season 1 was superb and I don't need to say any more on that. I remember reading that due to the success if season 1, season 2 was going to have a shed load of money spent on it so I went into this expecting something extravagant and jaw dropping but it doesn't seem to be happening.

Although this show knocks spots off the CW's Wokefests such as Supergirl and The Flash, the producers of those shows at least take the trouble to show their characters doing stuff on screen that relates to their super powers. Supergirl flies, The Flash runs...

In this season of the Boys I don't think Homelander has actually flown yet. Yes we see him land and there was one 0.5 second shot where he flew across the a city sky. Freight Train cant run due to a heart condition (A convenient money saving plot line) and the creepy fish man has been interviewing potential victims to marry. There was some action at the end of episode 2 but for the most part this is just a moody drama.

I'm still looking forward to the rest with hope that something spectacular will happen. I'm writing this after watching episode 5.

493,493,6.0,25 May 2020,"Very entertaining, well acted, and a times hilariously over the top- The Boys may not be as unique as people say it is, but it has enough clever and fun moments to make for a more than decent time. The casting is surprisingly very well done, with Karl Urban as Billy Butcher being the overall stand out of the show- and most likely proving to be quite an iconic character for future watchers. Other notable performances include Jack Quaid as Hughie, Antony Starr as Homelander, and Erin Moriarty as Starlight. The idea is a fresh concept and it can lead to some ridiculous and often fun situations over time, but often enough, The Boys seems to rely too much on tropes from previous superhero entity's before it, and it feels a bit too predictable and formulaic for its own good. That being said, if you can push aside the lower quality standards of writing throughout the show, and focus on the pure entertainment value, the show will be incredibly easy to watch. At times it does take a dip or two on pacing, but for the most part, The Boys is able to be a quite entertaining and interesting satire with some quite clever ideas. Some moments in the show seem a bit too drawn out, and there are quite a few plot holes within the show that are never really explained. It's characters are interesting to watch, but before you get to dive deeper into each of them, they can seem a bit generic and a bit of a copy off of other characters from D.C. comics- such as Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Starfire, and Superman. However, if you are looking for a fun and raunchy watch that can surprise you at times and entertain you pretty much all throughout, The Boys is the show for you. It lacks the strengths that other recent superhero television shows, such as The Umbrella Academy, have in terms of unique formation of story and situations, but it has enough to keep you going and more than enough to keep you wanting more. My Rating: 8.75/10

Season 2 was fantastic, very few seasons have been as consistent and breathtaking to watch as that one, especially that season finale.

494,494,10.0,2 August 2019,"What's great about 'The Boys' is the envelope doesn't just get pushed they pick it up and throw it for a mile. A superhero themed show that gets into the weeds concerning the mentality of a world that commercializes humans with gifted powers has never before been told in such a pragmatic way. It's really hard to believe this isn't exactly how the world would be if hero with powers like superman and aquaman actually existed. The nuances of this series are astounding it really delves deep psychologically without going all out Sigmund Freud. The special effects are used perfectly and look amazing the acting across the board is timely and crafted specifically for the tone of each episode and there isn't much I can say that doesn't bode well for 'The Boys' except it's name. 'The Boys', I thought by watching each episode and really trying to extrapolate the defining messages that were coming across I would be able to figure it out but no. The truth is there's no good reason they call it 'The Boys' or why the original creators came up with that name ots really the biggest mystery revolving around this series and the main reason it isn't a 10 on my list. With that being said I would recommend this series for all adults to see and rate it a 9 which garners Heavy Worship and should be a show that everyone should see.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",whats great about the boys is the envelope doesnt just get pushed they pick it up and throw it for a mile a superhero themed show that gets into the weeds concerning the mentality of a world that commercializes humans with gifted powers has never before been told in such a pragmatic way its really hard to believe this isnt exactly how the world would be if hero with powers like superman and aquaman actually existed the nuances of this series are astounding it really delves deep psychologically without going all out sigmund freud the special effects are used perfectly and look amazing the acting across the board is timely and crafted specifically for the tone of each episode and there isnt much i can say that doesnt bode well for the boys except its name the boys i thought by watching each episode and really trying to extrapolate the defining messages that were coming across i would be able to figure it out but no the truth is theres no good reason they call it the boys or why the original creators came up with that name ots really the biggest mystery revolving around this series and the main reason it isnt a on my list with that being said i would recommend this series for all adults to see and rate it a which garners heavy worship and should be a show that everyone should see,POSITIVE

496,496,10.0,2 July 2021,"""The Boys"" is simply superb! An extremely adult take on the superhero genre, this series is DEFINITELY NOT for kids. Some of the violence and gore is even more intense than anything on ""The Walking Dead"" or ""Game Of Thrones"" and sex is equally over the top. It's got some of the sickest humor on TV right now but it's got drama as well and plenty of action. ""The Boys"" is pretty much everything you'd want in a series. The acting is superb, the casting is spot on and the production values rival those of a big action Hollywood movie. Each season plays out like an extremely fast paced, 8 hour film.

With this said, it's not a series for everyone. Some might thing this is just another ""superhero"" TV show yet nothing could be further from the truth. ""The Boys"" brings the superhero genre down to earth and begs the question of ""what if"" these supernatural humans were among us? Would they work for an almighty corporation like Vought? Would they have genuine private lives? Would they be like Hollywood stars? The premise keeps getting interesting as the show moves along.

Can't wait to watch the 3rd season. Fair to say this is my favorite series right now and a worthy replacement for those of us who still miss great shows like ""Game Of Thrones"" and ""Breaking Bad"". Yup, it is THAT good!

505,505,9.0,7 October 2024,"This is the perfect combination between brutal, dark, controversial, and funny, and sarcastic, witty. What I love about this show is how the scenes can go from very serious to funny and ironic.

The actors are cast perfectly for their roles, and every character is well written with a good story and development.

I think the boys is almost 10x better than Marvel and Dc. Everything about it is better, the characters, the actors, the plot, the brutality, the sarcasm and the irony.

I think it's hilarious how this show portraits the American politics and propaganda.

You can almost call it a parody of the American government.

Season one started of great, and season two was even better in my opinion. Season three is probably my favorite season and that's because of the fight scenes and because of a lot of characters backstory's. Many people thinks that season four is far from as good as the other seasons, but I enjoyed season four, and I saw it as kind of a build up to season five.

507,507,8.0,26 July 2022,"This series has a lot of aspects to it that help make it a memorable show and one of these things is the characters in the series. All of the characters in this series are incredible and I love how unique they all are. Sure there are some characters that overlap and seem similar but for the most part, all of these characters are unique and feel like real people. I dare you to watch this series and either not relate to one of these characters or say that you know somebody just like one of them. Every single character in this series feels like a real human being who could exist in our world and this wouldn't have worked if the actors didn't help bring these characters to life.

Every single actor in this series is amazing and brings so much to their roles which helps make them feel real. Now, I would love to shout out every single actor in this series for the performances but there are so many good ones that I'm going to keep it to three. The first one I want to talk about is Antony Starr, who plays Homelander. He plays Homelander in such a way that you legit can see why everybody is scared of this man and how mentally unstable this guy is. I love the way he was able to effortlessly switch between being this mentally unstable guy to being this cool, calm, and collected guy in the public eye. The next standout actor for me was Karl Urban, who plays Billy Butcher. Now, Billy Butcher is the kind of character who you're not supposed to like at first but he plays this character in such a way that you can't help but love him. I also love how out of all the characters in this he has the most character growth and Karl Urban does an incredible job showing it. From when you first see Billy Butcher in season 1 to season 3 he changes so much and Karl Urban showed that growth all while still maintaining certain aspects of the character that everybody loves about him. The last person I want to talk about is Erin Moriarty, who plays Annie January/Starlight. Annie is legit described to be this sweet and innocent all-American girl who could've been a boring character but Erin Moriarty made her a memorable one. She helps make this character a badass and gives her so much more depth that makes the audience feel for her. Just like with Billy Butcher it's interesting to see the change from when we first see her to the last. I know I said I was only going to mention three but just a quick shout out to Jack Quaid, who plays Hughie Campbell, for playing a character that I related to way too hard.

But it's not just the memorable characters that helped make this show a standout amongst other superhero shows but the story as well. How many shows or movies have the plot of superheroes that are only in it for popularity and money and don't really give two damns about regular people without powers? Not too many which is why this show stands out above the rest. The audience gets to see the dark side of having powers and what some heroes might actually be thinking. Another aspect of the story that helps keep it original and unique are the twists that it takes. This show might not have too many plot twists in it but it does have enough to keep you on the edge of your seat and want to click that next episode button. I will say though that for me personally, and this is mainly for seasons 1 and 2, that there are some side stories that just bring the series to a halt. I understand and see why those stories needed to happen but for me, they didn't need to happen in every single episode.

But even with those side stories that make the series come to a halt the pacing for this series is incredible given how short it is. Each season is only 8 episodes alone with each episode pretty much being an hour long and they keep it going smoothly. None of the episodes feel like filler episodes or that any parts in the episodes are rushed. Every moment in this series moves organically and helps the audience feel like a fly on the wall the whole time.

Another aspect of this series that helps the audience feel like a fly on the wall is the directing which felt like it was done by one director and not fifteen. Lots of directors have their own style of filming which can bring some conflicts in how a series feels but here you can't tell. Just like with the directors this series obviously had a lot of different writers which once again just felt like one.

The writing for this series was phenomenal and mixed between serious and more comedic perfectly. It was also thanks to the great writing for this series that the characters got fleshed out and felt like real people. The writing never fully felt cheesy, although I will admit there were some lines that were eye-roll-worthy, and just felt like real people. I also loved the fact that this series was not afraid to deal with real-world issues and make references to things that we do all the time, helping make the viewer feel like a part of this world. The last thing I'll say is don't do what I did which is to analyze this series as I did this and noticed a few plot holes in the series and certain things that just didn't add up.

In the end, The Boys has a unique spin on the superhero series that has barely been done with an outstanding ensemble cast. It might not be the most perfect series but is still definitely worth the hype and I can't wait for season 4.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",this series has a lot of aspects to it that help make it

515,515,10.0,30 July 2019,"The first four episodes are just downright amazing, reminiscentt of the times prior to all the PC/SJW nonsense. I had the time of my life throughout episode four, haven't laughed that hard in ages. Really great up until episode five.

Episode five itself isn't all that bad, but you notice that the tune of the series turns around from humor to darker and worse preachy. Yes, the PC crap slowly finds its way back sadly in to the series. Characters whine more, cry more, sorry for this and that, by the end of the season the humor is stale, stilted, rough and not in a good way as there can be funny rough humor but that wasn't it. You then start to have those token 'gay relationships' that has to be there to make that look normal as well like all other 'PC' series.

Not to spoil anything but the series opens up with a really funny moment that for a PC crowd may be hard to swallow, and regular folk laugh like crazy but this does not go unavenged sadly and we're back to the script of the past twenty years.

Not sure what happened, maybe producers, investors or otherwise saw the material up until episode 5+ and said it was too much out of line with the mainstream narrative and it had to be brought back in line or if this was the plan all along, to bait people to start watching then go back to regular PC 'programming'.

I started watching this series because of the humor element, and the return to saying and doing anything without having the make excuses for it later in some form of punishment for characters or constructed morals and that failed towards the end. For those that speed ran the series, reflect on this and rewatch it and you will eventually notice that the tone changed utterly from what it started as.

Cast itself, as you can see from the first four episodes, are really well put together and are able to deliver when they have great material. Karl Urban carries the show to some extent, but it is a team effort and the others do really well too.

Season 1 was great with a cute switcheroo of villans and heroes into anti-heroes and anti-villains. Production is great. Very worth watching. Series didn't take itself too seriously.

But once the starting premise got old, the second season gets into SNL level of parody aping everything from Xena warrior princess to The Politician. But worse, what started as a tongue-in-cheek twist starts to take itself too seriously and so becomes a parody of a parody with gratuitous violence and gore that serves no useful purpose.

I kinda don't like the quick cuts they do in the action scenes and they did get some woke stuff in there, but it's not too on the nose and people complaining about it are hilarious. I don't know what show they watched before season 3 if they think that now the show is political.

For now, I keep my rating on 9 and I'll change it after the whole show ends because it's fair to give a 10 then if they can end it well.

Anyway, about the show: Pretty much everything in this show is top-notch, from the direction, cinematography, and music choice, to the amazing acting from the whole cast but especially Karl Urban, and Antony Starr as Homelander. This guy has created and acted as one of the best and most memorable characters on tv and he deserves an award for his phenomenal acting.

This show is very mature in every way and most of the bad ratings you see are because they think the show is ""vile"" and against their religious upbringing or something. This show has everything, extreme violence, nudity and all that. (And lots of swearing, in case you're a weirdo who doesn't like that and thinks there shouldn't be swearing in movies and shows). So if you don't like this stuff please don't watch this and then ruin the rating by giving your dumb score because you were offended by one word in 23 hours of the show.

The story is really good and gets better with each season with new plot lines and great and iconic new characters. Writing is getting better in season 3 and the writers find really creative ways to make the show even more entertaining and not boring, like the way they did 2 flashbacks in episode 7 of season 3. Of course there are lots of clichés and tropes in the story, some that don't make sense at times and some that do, but they work really well for this story and you know what they say, if it ain't broke don't fix it.

In conclusion, the show is one of the most entertaining shows I've seen, with great acting and visual effects. It's one of the best most enjoyable shows I've seen.

544,544,10.0,31 July 2019,"From streaming services to buying movies and shows on digital platforms, the way of watching content will be forever shifting. With an endless slew of streaming services, there will eventually be too many to afford for most people, but while we have the ones we have, we should be able to bask in the fantastic content we are receiving from most of them. Amazon Prime has recently graced us with the first season of their highly anticipated The Boys, and all I can say is that it's worth all of your time to sit through it. It may be incredible gruesome and absolutely too violent for certain viewers, but I'm sure many viewers will call this one of the best new shows to be released in 2019.

In a world that feels like a rip-off of the DC Universe and has a very similar cast of characters to the Justice League, most of the ""heroes"" use their powers for evil but make themselves out to be heroes to the public. Throughout many vile and graphic sequences, the audience consistently gets a taste of what these people are truly capable of, but the protagonists are truly the characters who are on the hunt and believe the heroes to be what they truly are. This diverse collection of characters makes for a very enjoyable show.

All having their own reasons and backstories for where and why they are where they are, The Boys celebrates the Superhero genre, while also ripping it apart. This series, although bloody, will be a breath of fresh air for those who have grown tired of this medium in cinema and on the small screen. Personally, I don't find myself garnering any fatigue when it comes to superheroes in the live-action format, but I too felt this show was needed with the flood of content we're receiving at the moment.

Karl Urban as Billy Butcher steals every scene he's in and his back-and-forth with Jack Quaid as Hughie Campbell is worth watching alone. On top of these two great performances/characters, Erin Moriarty as Annie is really the catalyst that brings everyone together and her character evolves a great deal throughout the course of the season. The group of heroes known as The Seven are truly all twisted and likeable in their respective ways, but Homelander, played by Antony Starr made my skin crawl the most. This is a show about terrible people doing terrible things, and there are some truly jaw-dropping moments, but if you can find a way to get enjoyment out of that, I think you'll love it as I did.

In the end, this was a stellar first season for a show that wasn't even on my radar until recently. I can't wait to see what the future of this show has to offer. Amazon Prime has released one of the most refreshing shows of the year. From surprisingly great camerawork and direction that feels both inspired by generic superhero fare and horror alike, this group of directors gave it their best in bringing something special to the small screen.

545,545,9.0,7 August 2024,"I watched the first season on a friend's recommendation a couple years ago (it's now August 2024), and I liked it a lot. For some reason, the second season lost me almost immediately. I got back to the series a month ago and started from the beginning, this time skipping happily through the first two seasons. Sort of slowed down with S03. I got tired of The guy with the bad British accent as his character seemed to drift back and forth a bit too much.

Then they turned Frenchie gay? Like they didn't already check off enough boxes on inclusivity in the series that they felt they needed to double-down on gay? I never liked Hughie's dad and his character got stupider as the series progressed.

What I really hated, absolutely hated about the series were most of the fight scenes with the Supes. They dragged on forever and we as viewers never understood why one Supe was superior to the other. And why did the humans keep using guns against them when they were completely ineffective? For this same reason, I despise the traditional, comic book superhero movies. Some hero will be thrown through a brick building, only to spring back the tear into his opponent again and again.

Starlight seemed mostly freaking useless as a protector of her group.

546,546,10.0,31 July 2019,"As the title says, this show is very different from the comic series (which I have only read some of). But everything that is done here absolutely works. I watched the whole season in 3 nights because I couldn't stop. It's delightfully gory (featuring some of the best human explosions I've ever seen) and relentlessly brutal, which is primarily what interested me. What I didn't expect was being absolutely hooked by the characters, which are developed and interesting and have enough arcs to keep you guessing. They're all played excellently by their respective actors/actresses, especially Anthony Starr from Banshee as Homelander and Karl Urban as Butcher. Dialogue is expertly written and results in some seriously tense and even uncomfortable scenes where characters are just talking. Since the show retains the comic's brutality, darkness, mature themes, etc., the main difference is in the plot (although some characters have changed genders, but characters are generally consistent). Some things are taken directly from the comics, dialogue included, but in many cases characters are introduced differently. The relationship between Butcher and his ""Boys"" is fundamentally different at the beginning but grows into what we get in the comics. The show changed some background elements and some other minor things but the biggest difference is in the finale of the show vs. the finale of the comics (which I've only read about, not read). Anyway, I don't have a problem with the changes with the exception of one - not enough Butcher brutality. In the comics he's portrayed as an unstoppable beast that is perhaps ""the single most dangerous man on the planet"" or something. Karl Urban just doesn't kick enough butt in the show (physically - he's still an absolutely brutal blackmailer), so if you want to see that, watch Dredd. But don't get me wrong, he's still a total badass here. Deeper than the characters and the blood and the changes that ranged from minor to significant are the themes that the show tackles. #MeToo and female empowerment are major thematic elements here, and I love it. Same with religion (Butcher on religion is one of my favorite nonviolent scenes). Anyway, watch the show. It's really, really good.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",as the title says this show is very different from the comic series which i have only read some of but everything that is done here absolutely works i watched the whole season in nights because i couldnt stop its delightfully gory featuring some of the best human explosions ive ever seen and relentlessly brutal which is primarily what interested me what i didnt expect was being absolutely hooked by the characters which are developed and interesting and have enough arcs to keep you guessing theyre all played excellently by their respective actorsactresses especially anthony starr from banshee as homelander and karl urban as butcher dialogue is expertly written and results in some seriously tense and even uncomfortable scenes where characters are just talking since the show retains the comics brutality darkness mature themes etc the main difference is in the plot although some characters have changed genders but characters are generally consistent some things are taken directly from the comics dialogue included but in many cases characters are introduced differently the relationship between butcher and his boys is fundamentally different at the beginning but grows into what we get in the comics the show changed some background elements and some other minor things but the biggest difference is in the finale of the show vs the finale of the comics which ive only read about not read anyway i dont have a problem with the changes with the exception of one not enough butcher brutality in the comics hes portrayed as an unstoppable beast that is perhaps the single most dangerous man on the planet or something karl urban just doesnt kick enough butt in the show physically hes still an absolutely brutal blackmailer so if you want to see that watch dredd but dont get me wrong hes still a total badass here deeper than the characters and the blood and the changes that ranged from minor to significant are the themes that the show tackles metoo and female empowerment are major thematic elements here and i love it same with religion butcher on religion is one of my favorite nonviolent scenes anyway watch the show its really really good,POSITIVE

549,549,9.0,17 July 2024,"The Boys remains a standout in the superhero genre, earning a respectable 7 out of 10. This series delivers a potent mix of dark humor, intense action, and biting social commentary, making it a unique and compelling watch. Karl Urban's Billy Butcher and Antony Starr's Homelander lead an exceptional cast, each bringing depth and complexity to their roles. The show's willingness to delve into the murky waters of power and corruption sets it apart from typical superhero fare.

The Boys excels at blending brutal violence with sharp satire. Its critique of corporate greed, celebrity culture, and the dark side of hero worship is both entertaining and thought-provoking. The storytelling is bold, unflinching, and often shocking, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats.

The cast, led by Karl Urban's gruff yet oddly charming Billy Butcher, is exceptional. Each character is layered and complex, with the writing allowing for deep dives into their moral ambiguities and personal demons. Antony Starr's Homelander remains one of the most terrifyingly captivating villains on TV, and the ensemble cast around him brings a raw, emotional depth to the story.

One of the standout features of The Boys is its willingness to tackle real-world issues through its hyper-violent lens. The satire is biting, skewering everything from corporate greed to celebrity culture with a sharp, unrelenting edge. It's a show that doesn't shy away from showing the darker side of power and the corruption that comes with it.

However, my biggest gripe with The Boys is the painfully long wait between seasons. The two-year hiatus has significantly dampened my enthusiasm. In fact, I haven't even felt a pull to begin the new season after such a prolonged gap. This wait disrupts the show's narrative momentum and makes it difficult to stay invested.

The Boys is a gripping, provocative series that deserves its praise, but the extended breaks between seasons are a major drawback. This frustratingly long wait makes it hard to maintain excitement, and the show risks losing its audience's engagement. If the release schedule were more consistent, The Boys could easily score higher in my book.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",the boys remains a standout in the superhero genre earning a respectable out of this series delivers a potent mix of dark humor intense action and biting social commentary making it a unique and compelling watch karl urbans billy butcher and antony starrs homelander lead an exceptional cast each bringing depth and complexity to their roles the shows willingness to delve into the murky waters of power and corruption sets it apart from typical superhero fare the boys excels at blending brutal violence with sharp satire its critique of corporate greed celebrity culture and the dark side of hero worship is both entertaining and thoughtprovoking the storytelling is bold unflinching and often shocking keeping viewers on the edge of their seats the cast led by karl urbans gruff yet oddly charming billy butcher is exceptional each character is layered and complex with the writing allowing for deep dives into their moral ambiguities and personal demons antony starrs homelander remains one of the most terrifyingly captivating villains on tv and the ensemble cast around him brings a raw emotional depth to the story one of the standout features of the boys is its willingness to tackle realworld issues through its hyperviolent lens the satire is biting skewering everything from corporate greed to celebrity culture with a sharp unrelenting edge its a show that doesnt shy away from showing the darker side of power and the corruption that comes with it however my biggest gripe with the boys is the painfully long wait between seasons the twoyear hiatus has significantly dampened my enthusiasm in fact i havent even felt a pull to begin the new season after such a prolonged gap this wait disrupts the shows narrative momentum and makes it difficult to stay invested the boys is a gripping provocative series that deserves its praise but the extended breaks between seasons are a major drawback this frustratingly long wait makes it hard to maintain excitement and the show risks losing its audiences engagement if the release schedule were more consistent the boys could easily score higher in my book,POSITIVE

557,557,10.0,6 October 2024,"The Boys is an absolute must-see for anyone who loves original and hilarious series! This show takes the superhero genre and throws it into a blender with a hefty dose of satire, blood, and a pinch of chaos. You expect superheroes to be good and save the world, but instead, you get a group of heroes who are just as guilty as the villains they're fighting, my kind of humor!

The series is brilliantly crafted, with clever dialogue and a refreshing plot. The characters are so over-the-top that you can't help but laugh, especially when you consider that most of them care more about their Instagram followers than saving the world. It's a fantastic mix of action, drama, and hilarity that you simply can't resist.

But let's be honest: after a few seasons, it starts to feel a bit repetitive. It's like they're thinking, ""Why stop something that works?"" And yes, sometimes they do go a bit overboard. You can only handle so many shocking twists and outrageous superhero stories before you think, ""Okay, I've had my fill of absurdity for today.""

Still, if you enjoy a series that makes you laugh while also making you think about the absurdity of heroism, then The Boys is a great choice.

561,561,7.0,1 September 2024,"""The Boys"" is a gritty and unapologetic deconstruction of the superhero genre, offering a fresh and darkly humorous take on what happens when superheroes go rogue. The show, developed by Eric Kripke and based on the comic series by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson, dives headfirst into the corruption, greed, and moral decay that could arise if super-powered beings were controlled by corporate interests.

At its core, ""The Boys"" is a satire that exposes the flaws and dangers of idolizing superheroes, portrayed here as egotistical, violent, and often morally bankrupt individuals. The main protagonists, a group of vigilantes led by Billy Butcher (Karl Urban), are determined to bring down ""The Seven,"" a team of heroes who are anything but noble.

The series excels in its ability to blend shock value with meaningful commentary. The violence is graphic, the language is harsh, and the humor is pitch-black, but beneath this gritty exterior lies a scathing critique of celebrity culture, corporate greed, and the moral ambiguity of power.

""The Boys"" isn't just about blood and guts; it's a smart, subversive show that asks tough questions about the nature of heroism and the corrupting influence of power. Whether you're a fan of the superhero genre or a skeptic, ""The Boys"" offers something unique and thought-provoking, making it a must-watch in today's entertainment landscape.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",the boys is a gritty and unapologetic deconstruction of the superhero genre offering a fresh and darkly humorous take on what happens when superheroes go rogue the show developed by eric kripke and based on the comic series by garth ennis and darick robertson dives headfirst into the corruption greed and moral decay that could arise if superpowered beings were controlled by corporate interests at its core the boys is a satire that exposes the flaws and dangers of idolizing superheroes portrayed here as egotistical violent and often morally bankrupt individuals the main protagonists a group of vigilantes led by billy butcher karl urban are determined to bring down the seven a team of heroes who are anything but noble the series excels in its ability to blend shock value with meaningful commentary the violence is graphic the language is harsh and the humor is pitchblack but beneath this gritty exterior lies a scathing critique of celebrity culture corporate greed and the moral ambiguity of power the boys isnt just about blood and guts its a smart subversive show that asks tough questions about the nature of heroism and the corrupting influence of power whether youre a fan of the superhero genre or a skeptic the boys offers something unique and thoughtprovoking making it a mustwatch in todays entertainment landscape,POSITIVE

606,606,8.0,27 August 2019,"The Boys came out of nowhere: another superhero television show thrown into the mix, but nothing like those we've seen before. Not following the typical line of storytelling, this show presents superheroes far more in the light of abusing their powers under the guise of celebrity life. On the other side of the coin are those not blessed with powers, looking at superheroes with derision having glimpsed the truth of the situation. In the middle of this is Hughie, someone who has idolised heroes forever - only to see his girlfriend accidentally killed by one. From the word go, this dark outlook on the superhero genre is not afraid to tackle any issue, and is a better show because of it.

Clearly a sizeable amount of funding has been devoted to The Boys - the CGI isn't as sloppy as most of these action-based tv shows, and the acting is actually strong for the most part. The story needs time to develop; character building is essential when creating these hero characters, otherwise they become muddled and indiscernible. As a result, the first half of the season takes its time to actually get interesting, but pays off by investing in a story for the long term, rather than episodic plots for the sake of cheap thrills.

Amazon have provided an adult antidote to the Marvel/DC mediocrity, breaking the mould set as the precedent by the success of superhero films. Before now there has been conclusive proof of darker films being better received: The Dark Knight, Deadpool and Watchmen are prime examples of how a more gritty tone can elevate these sort of shows. Finally, something is giving television's heroes an update - hopefully the coming seasons are as well received as this opening salvo.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",the boys came out of nowhere another superhero television show thrown into the mix but nothing like those weve seen before not following the typical line of storytelling this show presents superheroes far more in the light of abusing their powers under the guise of celebrity life on the other side of the coin are those not blessed with powers looking at superheroes with derision having glimpsed the truth of the situation in the middle of this is hughie someone who has idolised heroes forever only to see his girlfriend accidentally killed by one from the word go this dark outlook on the superhero genre is not afraid to tackle any issue and is a better show because of it clearly a sizeable amount of funding has been devoted to the boys the cgi isnt as sloppy as most of these actionbased tv shows and the acting is actually strong for the most part the story needs time to develop character building is essential when creating these hero characters otherwise they become muddled and indiscernible as a result the first half of the season takes its time to actually get interesting but pays off by investing in a story for the long term rather than episodic plots for the sake of cheap thrills amazon have provided an adult antidote to the marveldc mediocrity breaking the mould set as the precedent by the success of superhero films before now there has been conclusive proof of darker films being better received the dark knight deadpool and watchmen are prime examples of how a more gritty tone can elevate these sort of shows finally something is giving televisions heroes an update hopefully the coming seasons are as well received as this opening salvo,NEGATIVE

615,615,10.0,18 May 2023,"It's been a while that a movie or a TV show based on superheroes caught my attention. Although DC fares better on my scale, both them and Marvel produced mostly unwatchable movies. The CGI is exquisite, yet the plot is usually non-existent, although there is a broader narrative connecting movies and shows.

And after an unspectacular experience with Jupiter's Legacy where the show never reached the potential of the comic book, I didn't have high hopes for The Boys. The first fifteen minutes or so of the first episode almost confirmed my preconception. Yet just before I wanted to quit, something changed.

Now, this is not the best superhero creation ever, but it offered considerably more than any of those mentioned above. The Boys has humor, action, drama, some character development and criticizes the society revolving around money, power and media.

Interestingly enough, the behavior of the good guys annoyed me so much that, at a certain moment, I almost rooted for Homelander and his gang.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",its been a while that a movie or a tv show based on superheroes caught my attention although dc fares better on my scale both them and marvel produced mostly unwatchable movies the cgi is exquisite yet the plot is usually nonexistent although there is a broader narrative connecting movies and shows and after an unspectacular experience with jupiters legacy where the show never reached the potential of the comic book i didnt have high hopes for the boys the first fifteen minutes or so of the first episode almost confirmed my preconception yet just before i wanted to quit something changed now this is not the best superhero creation ever but it offered considerably more than any of those mentioned above the boys has humor action drama some character development and criticizes the society revolving around money power and media interestingly enough the behavior of the good guys annoyed me so much that at a certain moment i almost rooted for homelander and his gang,POSITIVE

The series completely does away with Ennis' brilliant dialogue, sub-plots and motivations of the characters, leaving only the most bland and basic elements of the source material. Why, why oh why does Hollywood ALWAYS does this? Instead of using the brilliant source material, they replace anything worthwhile with endless amount of filler BS.

Reading through some of the 9 or 10 star reviews, I get a feeling they are bought reviews. It's either that, or people have very low standards these days. Don't get me wrong, The Boys is better than current Marvel series on Netflix - which isn't saying a lot - but compared the the awesome graphic novel, this is a huge let-down.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",as a huge fan of garth ennis graphic novel the tv series turned out to be exactly the type of mundane watereddown dumpster fire ive come to expect from presentday hollywood the series completely does away with ennis brilliant dialogue subplots and motivations of the characters leaving only the most bland and basic elements of the source material why why oh why does hollywood always does this instead of using the brilliant source material they replace anything worthwhile with endless amount of filler bs reading through some of the or star reviews i get a feeling they are bought reviews its either that or people have very low standards these days dont get me wrong the boys is better than current marvel series on netflix which isnt saying a lot but compared the the awesome graphic novel this is a huge letdown,NEGATIVE
619,619,10.0,24 July 2020,"Talking about the western cinema, they always provide their audiences with fascinating, interesting and thought-provoking premises followed by their brilliant storytelling and extra ordinarily visualization and ""The Boys"" is the recent addition to it. What makes ""The Boys"" so special and unique is its premise based on the Comic Book it gives the unorthodox concept for Superheroes. As since the inception of superheroes genre we've seen and we've been told that Superheroes sole job is to protect humanity from antagonists which popularly includes Terrorist organizations or Aliens who have nothing but sole agenda to destroy the world and in return they want nothing but peace and safety of this world. Now that's before the arrival of ""The Boys"" who gives the counter narration that what if the superheroes we admire, we love and we look forward to are being handled by the corporates and to clear it further let's say that any state of USA shows the upward movement in crime figures, so this organization known as Vought will just approach the State's mayor and offer them one of their employed Superhero to fight with crime against a heavy amount as their remuneration. Not only that they have their own Media, Brand and Business Development team to handle and promote their employed Superheroes and to cash them accordingly. Things get more darker as series develops with whole superhero concept of saving humanity is being flushed down and showcases the idea what if Superheroes gets corrupted and their sole mission is to serve their employers rather their people and for that they can do whatever it takes even on the expense of peoples life. That's only one aspect, series gets further darker but to avoid spoilers I'll just stop here and leave that on you to further watch and experience it by yourself. Full marks to the creators of the show who has given the unpopular concept a new direction and people have already liked the show including positive reviews from the critiques, Talking about the performances, the cast is not familiar at least to me except Simon Pegg, who have nothing but a cameo role. Leads are simply brilliant and to mention some of them is actually due in their credit so lets start with Karl Urban as Billy Buthcher he is BAdAss and Ruthless, Antony Starr as Homelander leading the superhero team he is just brilliant as unpredictable shady Superhero, Elizabeth Shue as leading corporate lady is very convincing with her looks and cunning nature, Jack Quaid as Hughie a young simple common guy is adorable and last but not the least Erin Moriarty as Annie aka ""Starlight"" a good Superhero and lovely to watch also she actually resembles with Selena Gomez so the whole series I've watched her as if she's Selena Gomez also knowing that she's not. The series is comprised on 8 episodes with almost 1 hour of runtime each and is being streaming on Amazon Prime since 2019.

Karl Urban is great as the over the top not job. The lines between good and evil are blurred so far its very refreshing to see characters that are not 2 dimensional in a super hero flick.

Elisabeth Shue.. Still very sexy.

She was sexy in The Saint all those hears back. She's still hot. The characters are all quite likeabke in very unlikable ways if that makes sense. Just love the show.

The dark humor almost goes too far sometimes.. But then you remember this is based on a graphic novel.

Some scenes are hilarious. The whale?!

Season 1: A series adapted from the comic of the same name, The Boys became a series that was so wild, brutal, deadly, rude that it appeared vulgar. The Boys tells how superheroes who have become gods and idols for society. Appearing full of vulgar scenes and bloody action is a strength for the series. This first season was able to explore well and deeply to build the world of The Boys for 9 episodes. The story is unique, interesting, entertaining and of course full of brutal and wild action. Presents a series of small problems that lead to large ones. Each episode is capable of giving rancidity and inflicting horror. This season is able to provide complex stories and conflicts. The conflict is so dense with problems that arise constantly from both The Boys and The Seven camps. This season has such a hard and cruel fighting action.

Season 2: Entering its second season, The Boys became a series that began to be loved by many people. The second season became a season that experienced good improvement and development, from the story, conflicts to the characters. The second season remained with the Boys attempting to fight and destroy the members of The Sevens. Increasingly complex stories with new conflicts emerging. The conflict between The Boys and The Seven does not degrade the quality of the story from this second season. Their feud is all the more exciting with the conflict they are experiencing personally. Season two gives us room to take a deeper look at the evil possessed by The Seven. This season has appeared even crazier and wilder. Did not let go of the same brutality of the previous season. Action scenes that are more amusing and look crazy. The last episode became the most good-looking episode, presenting a crazy fight.

Season 3: The third season did not detract from the intensity of the story of the series. A story that remains interesting, much better and still gives a crazy feel. This season is said to be a turning point season for Homelander, who is getting worse. The plot of this story focuses more on The Boys' actions to defeat Homelander head-on. Homelander, who this time has good character development, with his increasingly becoming-so nature that makes him even more devastated. Not only Homelander, but with other members of The Seven trying to raise their popularity. Likewise, Billy Butcher also started to become more selfish and create divisions in The Boys. In addition, this season also introduced the Payback group as the first group from Vought. Payback was introduced to provide a broad story for the world of The Boys. Payback itself actually has a relationship with Homelander itself. Therefore, this season has many new and branching conflicts so that the story is widening. Many conflicts have arisen either from the side of The Boys or The Seven with the personal problems of each of its members. This season doesn't have a strong enough story.

648,648,3.0,17 March 2023,"""The Boys"" looks behind the well-known beautiful facade of superhero existence. In this world, protecting the city and its citizens is not the top priority for superheroes, but marketing themselves.

A handful of people who know about the dirty business of superheroes and harbor a grudge against them band together to put the superheroes in their place. This group later became known as ""The Boys"".

What is noticeable quite quickly and can possibly also have a shocking effect on the viewers, who don't know what they are getting into, is that ""The Boys"" is very macabre. Death is often used as a means of comedy.

The series also doesn't stop at depicting very unusual scenes and situations. Be it that it is shown in great detail and realistically how a person is practically torn apart alive or that sexual intercourse is depicted in an almost unpleasantly detailed and absurd way.

Foul language is also considered good manners here.

That's why many will probably already suspect - ""The Boys"" is far from a family series.

But that's what makes the series so special - in today's world, when every production is hellbent on being as politically correct as possible and keeping its age rating as low as possible in order to reach the widest possible audience, ""The Boys"" is very refreshing. As disgusted as I was at times, the special effects team must be commended for doing their job beyond outstanding! And even if you might suspect that now, ""The Boys"" doesn't do the opposite either. Also, not every scene is portrayed as absurd and grotesque as possible just to make it seem particularly brutal and absurd. A very good balance has been found here.

Personally, I have to say that I was already used to softened productions and was therefore often shocked by what this series dared to do. But that's also what makes her so funny.

Nevertheless, ""The Boys"" still manages to pack all of this into a nerve-wracking story that practically glues the viewer to the screen.

Finally, the damn good acting has to be emphasized as well. Antony Starr in particular plays his role as Homelander almost too well. But the other roles like Billy Butcher with Karl Urban, Hughie Campell with Jack Quadid or Annie January aka ""Starlight"" with Erin Moriarty have all been cast extremely well.

I only have to criticize that the story development in the 3rd season seemed a bit sluggish to me.

The action scenes, cinematography and soundtrack are all 10/10.

The problems however relate to the show's writing. As the seasons roll on, it feels like the writers forgot what made ""The Boys"" standout from the saturated crowd.

697,697,10.0,8 October 2023,"Although it often delves into extreme vulgarity, with many explicit scenes (both sexual and gory), and displays a frenzy of violence that even Tarantino might envy, ""The Boys"" is a series that also touches on intriguing topics and even answered some questions I had. It's based on the comic book series ""The Boys"" created by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson and was developed by Eric Kripke. The story is a satire, focusing on a group of individuals trying to expose the truth about superheroes who are essentially products of large corporations and who, despite their positive public image, engage in corrupt and harmful behaviors behind the scenes.

If you're familiar with ""The Rock and Roll Machine"" (Little Heroes) by Norman Spinrad, ""The Boys"" takes the story to another level. In Spinrad's work, media products are carefully directed and written based on audience and market studies. Song lyrics are the result of focus groups, music is composed following such marketing studies, and the appearance of the singers is meticulously crafted.

In ""The Boys"", supermen and wonder-women are active on platforms like Instagram and TikTok, with dedicated Facebook pages, and their heroic deeds are, in fact, calculated by analysis and marketing departments. They combat crime in neighborhoods where the company's analysts estimate the highest media impact, where there's a likelihood of being extensively and favorably filmed by witnesses, or where the demographic profile of the beneficiaries is most profitable. Their appearance and public behavior are tailored to cover various audience segments, based on criteria like age, gender, residence area, race, income, and so on.

However...

Behind these heroes are jaded psychopaths with extraordinary superpowers, but controlled by the company that sponsors them. They have questionable sexual tendencies (like fetishes involving milk or mollusks, which are the ""tamer"" examples, making you wonder just how twisted the series' creators are), they are indifferent criminals (with the company also playing a role in covering up their misdeeds), and can even be sadistic when the mood strikes, often involved in promiscuous relationships.

If you've ever wondered how someone seemingly blessed by fate, having everything - money, power, fame, beauty, health - can fall into a dubious and inexplicable affair, or indulge in drug use and thrill-seeking, know that this series might provide an answer. It's simple, logical, and easy to deduce, but we often rejected it because it was always wrapped in clichés. Now, it's presented to me in a raw manner, thrust in my face, albeit in a rather sophisticated context with an acceptable dark humor.

I recommend it if you can set aside prudishness and lower your tolerance threshold for vulgarity, because the series doesn't rely on that to sell itself. On the contrary, it advocates for finesse and humanity, for beauty and goodness, even if it does so while resembling a chubby BDSM enthusiast dressed in latex wielding a chainsaw.

I can't wait for Season 4!

709,709,10.0,5 July 2022,"Now that I am watching Season 3, I have broken down and just need to write a review. Eric Kripke, creator, and primary writer of the Boys, reminds me of several works by Alan Ball , and Quentin Tarantino.

It's excellent because there's so much talent packed into every shot. It's very well cast, has excellent character-driven plots, and the stories it tells are extremely relevant to this moment in American popular culture. It explores situations of fascism, corporatism, Nazism, racism, misogyny, and many other forms of ideological violence so the stories it tells are extremely relevant to this moment in American popular culture. (It's no surprise some accuse it of having political bias, perhaps recognizing their own partisan shortcomings being represented amidst these ideological conflicts.)

Almost every character is wonderfully complex, but not overwhelming or staged- and yet each character often appears as both underdog, and anti-hero at different moments of their journey.

Every single cast member soars throughout each season- the actors are deeply inspired and it shows in every single shot.

The writers have also mastered using gore or cringe-humour, and often at the same time, to punctuate it's most significant plot points. Both the narrative thrust, and the tension are held very tightly in every episode.

712,712,10.0,10 July 2022,"I began The Boys on a recommendation from a friend who had seen the first two episodes. I had nothing new to watch except the usual Sunny seasons on repeat, so I took him up on it immediately.

Immediately I was immersed in this world that feels EXACTLY how our world right now would be if we had superheros. The entire show is incredibly well crafted and features fantastic satire. But above that, The Boys has an exceptionally talented cast that makes you believe everything that is happening.

I found each character well written and phenomenally acted. At the top of that list, and maybe the top of my personal favorite acting performances, sits Antony Starr: The Homelander. His performance is among the most captivating and authentic seen in recent memory. No other actor could convert the desperation, arrogance, the psychopathic mind, and insanity that is Homelander as well as Antony Starr. It is honestly, unbelievable how good this performance is. Next to Tony Soprano, Rust Cohl and Walter White, I have yet to see an actor convey this type of emotional roller coaster so well.

713,713,10.0,28 March 2024,"I forced myself to read the comics before committing to the show and I am here to tell you: 1) Don't read the comics, 2) Please don't read the comics, 3) Oh God please don't. The show blows the source material out of the water.

The Boys is the R-Rated answer to the question of ""What would it be like if the world had superheroes?"" The answer is obvious: American corporations commodifying and selling the shiny plastic lives of superpowered individuals to the unsuspecting public with the maximum amount of cynicism and profit incentive serving as the lifeblood to keep the money-making machine rolling. In reality, these superheroes are far more flawed than their public personas would lead one to believe, and coupled with super powers, the love and adoration of millions, and the legal protection of a multibillion dollar corporation that will automatically swoop in any time the casualties pile up while 'saving the day', they are celebrities on steroids.

This show is far smarter than a simple surface level satire of the slew of superhero films churned out by Hollywood in the past decade. It's a smart and sharp critique of America's moral compass overshadowed by the eminence of multibillion dollar business; cliched story beats stuffed into Marvel films; the role of social media in how it tweaks our perception of reality; Hollywood's role in manufacturing the truth; the empty pandering by businesses of humanitarian/social causes (poverty, gay rights, etc.); the hollow cheapness of life in a country where the bottom line overrides any consideration or compassion for others, and so on.

Everything from the storyline to the characters was given a new lease on life in ample departure from their comic counterparts. Garth Ennis, the creator of The Boys comic, had the kernel of a good idea but saw fit to squander it with needless mid-2000s edginess and shock for the sake of shock, devolving everything into a gorefest, a sexfest, a transcription of a COD lobby, or a combination thereof. The racism, homophobia, and misogyny that was present in the original comic was edge for edge's sake. There are elements of it present in the show, but the presentation is one of mature restraint and a deft hand, often presenting it with a frankness that simultaneously indicates its wrongness, and thus a darkly ironic humor. The violence and gore is plentiful but not oversaturated as Ennis is wont to do. The show provides the perfect balance of humor, horror, and humanity.

Every main player in this show is multi-faceted, including the villains. There is not a one-note character in the bunch. Everyone is interacting and navigating through this story with their own motivations and hang-ups. Relationships are formed, fragment, stagnate, rekindle, or otherwise spiral off into different journeys. There is never a dull moment, nor a stupid decision that isn't acknowledged within the show. Actions have consequences for the heroes and villains both, and they sometimes come to bite them in the butt in unexpected ways. Truly, this show is a must watch.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",i forced myself to read the comics before committing to the show and i am here to tell you dont read the comics please dont read the comics oh god please dont the show blows the source material out of the water the boys is the rrated answer to the question of what would it be like if the world had superheroes the answer is obvious american corporations commodifying and selling the shiny plastic lives of superpowered individuals to the unsuspecting public with the maximum amount of cynicism and profit incentive serving as the lifeblood to keep the moneymaking machine rolling in reality these superheroes are far more flawed than their public personas would lead one to believe and coupled with super powers the love and adoration of millions and the legal protection of a multibillion dollar corporation that will automatically swoop in any time the casualties pile up while saving the day they are celebrities on steroids this show is far smarter than a simple surface level satire of the slew of superhero films churned out by hollywood in the past decade its a smart and sharp critique of americas moral compass overshadowed by the eminence of multibillion dollar business cliched story beats stuffed into marvel films the role of social media in how it tweaks our perception of reality hollywoods role in manufacturing the truth the empty pandering by businesses of humanitariansocial causes poverty gay rights etc the hollow cheapness of life in a country where the bottom line overrides any consideration or compassion for others and so on everything from the storyline to the characters was given a new lease on life in ample departure from their comic counterparts garth ennis the creator of the boys comic had the kernel of a good idea but saw fit to squander it with needless mids edginess and shock for the sake of shock devolving everything into a gorefest a sexfest a transcription of a cod lobby or a combination thereof the racism homophobia and misogyny that was present in the original comic was edge for edges sake there are elements of it present in the show but the presentation is one of mature restraint and a deft hand often presenting it with a frankness that simultaneously indicates its wrongness and thus a darkly ironic humor the violence and gore is plentiful but not oversaturated as ennis is wont to do the show provides the perfect balance of humor horror and humanity every main player in this show is multifaceted including the villains there is not a onenote character in the bunch everyone is interacting and navigating through this story with their own motivations and hangups relationships are formed fragment stagnate rekindle or otherwise spiral off into different journeys there is never a dull moment nor a stupid decision that isnt acknowledged within the show actions have consequences for the heroes and villains both and they sometimes come to bite them in the butt in unexpected ways truly this show is a must watch,NEGATIVE

728,728,10.0,18 July 2024,"Since season 4 has already been released, you can write about everything a little bit.

I'm not going to tell you any detailed story about why the series is so cool, what characters are there, how they develop, because even I get mad when it accidentally catches my eye starting in 2019, so briefly about each season and a little more about the newest one.

The first season is just WOW!

Back then, movie comics were at their peak, but still the Marvel antipode with blood guts and obscenities looked unusual.

10\10 just because all the episodes were on fire and I didn't even want to rewind for a second.

Season 2 was the last thing I watched in the voiceover of Cubes, because I was still a young fool then, and she seemed to fit the mood.

Season 2 was also good, but the feelings of watching the first one certainly won't compare. The ending will also fly away!

Season 3 had already begun to sink in the plot, but the new character saved him with his presence. The ending is miserable, which essentially rolled back the plot to the end of season 2. It turns out to be some kind of filler, although there was character development and hooks were thrown for the next season.

Well, our favorite season 4.

You can not even watch the first half of the season and even start with episode 6 somewhere, because there is a plot twist there and at least some movement begins.

If earlier we watched literally one main storyline and there was a complete WOW effect, then by season 4 this scatter of unnecessary and empty timing reached its apogee.

Literally EVERY character has their own separate story to make the viewer sad, but the viewer doesn't care. Having watched the ending now, I understand a little the efforts of the authors, but I love the characters from the previous 24 episodes, so this is in the form: I have an abortion, I love my wife and daughter, I don't know if I'm gay or not, the other one has a sick dad. What am I supposed to do with all this now?

If you don't like it, don't look. I didn't even look, having safely skipped most of this circus.

The last episode, or rather the last 20 minutes, is cool. After that, I want to immediately turn on the next episode, but it will be at best in a year, and at worst in 2, so it is questionable entertainment to make such endings. Last seasons were not spoiled like this and did not look like half a season.

As a result, are these still the same 10 \ 10 as after 3 seasons? Well, of course... I don't want to let him go until 9/10, and he didn't deserve it. I hope the final finale will be good, but in the meantime I'm waiting for another spin-off to be rolled out to pass the time.

731,731,10.0,7 August 2019,"To start this re-review off, I'd like to state, that I would of given this show a 9 if it wasn't for Karl's Dick Van Dyke cockney accent.

The show is solid. IT ISN'T A SUPERHERO SHOW & that's perhaps what initially turned me off, because, i took it as such & if you do, this show comes off, initially, like a cynical teenage endeavour.

This show is actually a comedy-drama, that utilises the landscape created by the Marvel & DC cinematic universes & I like it, I like it a lot. It's a solid 8.

Cons: Karl Urban's attempt (at what I presume to be) a cockney accent. Far too Dick Van Dyke - Marry Poppins with a good slice of New Zealand. However, barring the accent he does a good job as do the rest of the cast.

Well written & acted.

This show is not worth its current IMDB rating. If the show is a 9 what the hell is the Sopranos?

734,734,1.0,3 September 2019,"The Boys seems like the perfect superhero series for an era in which trust in institutions is dying. In this series, our protectors are only pretending to be heroes as they live lives of casual corruption and a disdain for their fellow men.

The first episode of The Boys begins with a horrific, superhero-caused tragedy that is so ingeniously shot that I admired it even as I knew I would have trouble shaking it. Certainly one of the most disturbing things I've seen for a while, but I will acknowledge that the premise requires some horror.

That premise is that the most famous Superheroes, a group known as the Seven, is made up of psychopaths supported by a vast conglomerate that relies on merchandising and media. These superheroes mix the arrogance of celebrity with the monstrousness of unchecked power, but a small group of normal people are determined to bring them down for past crimes.

The one good superhero is Starlight, who looks like an Iowa beauty queen and has always dreamed of saving the world. She wins a role as one of the Seven and finds herself in a pit of snakes. She is harassed and objectified, but is too caught up her dream of doing good to walk away.

The series has a gritty, sour quality to it that made me uncomfortable. It's just such an awful world and even the human heroes are not necessarily the best of people. Starlight's degradation is disheartening, and Hugh's tragedy is heartbreaking and relentless.

What I'm saying is, as Superhero series go, this one isn't a lot of fun.

There are some clever visual ideas, an interesting plot, and good actors. But I couldn't get into it. The first episode is overshadowed by the opening tragedy. The second episode was better, although still dark and disturbing. By the third episode the unpleasantness became too much for me and I stopped halfway through.

An AMAZING villain.

Enough action to be called a superhero show, yet it is so much more than that.

The first 2 seasons are great, but s3 jumps ahead in connecting satire of celebrity culture with superhero genre in the most brilliant way.

Most revealing is the scene from maybe 5th episode, where we see from a voight employee, a crude (without an ounce of empathy), attempt at making a dub video of john Lennon imagine song!

Those who remember during covid lockdown by millionaire celebrities video of similar type, might realize it. Superheroes (instead of millionaire celebrities) who are living in mansions/yatchs etc trying to pander to normies by appeasing them for social media ratings.

The social media wars, where no-one knows who's true or faking is reflected and idiocy levels of the audience as well in this tv series. Its very similar to the millions who commented on a bitter divorce of 2 celebrities (depp & amber) as if each one is an eye witness could be an indication that the dumbo crowds in the boys are the most realistic thing and not fiction.

759,759,10.0,29 July 2019,"When I first came late to the table making up for lost time with good comics, a friend recommended 'The Boys' to me and it remains my favourite comics series that I have read. I was very pleased to hear that it would be made into a TV series and having watched the whole series during the past few days I can whole-heartedly say that I am fully down with this screen adaptation. There is invariably a great deal of naye-saying whenever a much loved comic series is adapted for the TV but in this instance it will be completely unfounded.

It is not a direct literal adaptation from the comics but all of the most significant themes are either accounted for or alluded to for subsequent exploration. The biggest departure from the books is that the TV series is has a noticeably more balanced approach to gender which in my view is definitely a positive, and will certainly appeal to a wider audience. The narrative surrounding the Vogelbaum Compound is also dealt with quite differently but I have a feeling that there are probably good reasons for this that will become apparent as the story progresses. The script and characterisation are excellent, the production is totally seamless and the overall tone is entirely faithful to the books that we have known and loved. This often seems to be an advantage of having the storys' creator closely involved with the production of a screen adaptation.

As usual most of the critical reviews that I read would appear to have been written by people who either haven't actually watched the whole series, don't know where the story has come from (and consequently have no reason to have faith in what we have not yet been told about it), or in some cases have dismissively attributed it to another streaming service.

783,783,9.0,13 February 2024,"The Boys, a series I started watching on someone's recommendation, grabbed my attention with its first two seasons but had me feeling a bit let down by the latest installment, leading to an overall rating of 8/10. Initially, the show impressed with its bold take on the superhero genre, blending dark humor with a gritty, more realistic view of what a world with super-powered individuals might look like.

The first two seasons of The Boys were particularly strong. They offered a refreshing and captivating twist on the traditional superhero narrative, with well-developed characters and a plot that was both engaging and thought-provoking. The show's ability to mix action, drama, and satire was executed brilliantly, making it a standout in the realm of superhero-themed entertainment.

However, the latest season didn't quite live up to the high standards set by its predecessors. The plot began to feel a bit too far-fetched, even for a show that revolves around superhumans. The shift towards more unrealistic elements seemed to detract from the gritty realism that made the earlier seasons so compelling.

The Boys is special in the way it manages to sneak in humor into even the most gruesome scenes (if you've seen it you know what I mean). Nothing feels one sided - you're never sure who's ""good"" or ""bad"" or whether to feel sorry for or hate the characters.

835,835,10.0,26 March 2020,"Recently, I've watched «The Boys» from Amazon Prime video. Directors of these TV Series are Eric Kripke and Garth Ennis.As far as I know, Garth Ennis is an excellent scenarist, who wrote many comicbooks about one of the coolest characters in comics-John Constantine. The characters of this TV-Product are played by Karl Urban, Jack Quaid, Antony Starr and Erin Moriarty. By the way, this superhero web television series is based on the comic book with the same name. And it's awesome. So, here is my review of this TV-Project.

First of all, the characters of it are brilliant, especially Billy Butcher who was very cruel, but at the same time, his violence and charisma make him incredibly badass, and Homelander who, in my opinion, is one of the best villains on TV. He is unkillable, powerful and he doesn't have a hint of humanity which makes him very dangerous for the team of Boys, as well as for the whole world. These characters were played by Karl Urban and Antony Starr.

Secondly, acting game of actors's cast is perfect. While watching this TV-Project, you don't even doubt that motivations of characters were badly decribed, because you just fall in love with them. Moreover, you really get enjoy from action in this TV-series. Brutal kills of heroes by the Boys' team will make everyone glad.

In conclusion, I'd like to say that «the Boys» is excellent TV-product which adds something new to superheroic genre. Of course, it's not for all, because not everyone likes cruelity in movies, but I think that it's a kind of fun view on movies about superheroes.

840,840,9.0,6 September 2020,"The Boys is a series quite ambitious in its extensions. On the one hand, it firmly presses on the classic who-watches-the-watchmen concern. On the other hand, the show is also trying something new. It is not enough for the TV show to demonstrate superheroism as conservative viciousness or as a state tool of repression. Instead, it attempts to represent a complicated superhero industrial complex that permeates almost all of mass culture and social life. So The Boys' superheroes, corrupt and arrogant as they are, become at the same time the most unexpectedly realistic as their actions are intertwined with business interests, advertisers, sponsorships, rights, fan culture, public presence and public order.

The Boys has the virtue of attempting to see superhero culture as a whole, as an industry and as an ideology. The series cuts through the simplistic superhero ethics of good and evil, the absence of complexity and the culture of collateral damage while balancing the themes it conveys with compelling and rich characters. In conclusion The Boys is a TV series that points to an increasingly diverse, demanding and multifaceted television superhero future.

870,870,8.0,24 October 2023,"The Boys is a satire show that boasts a gripping and subversive plot that explores the dark underbelly of superhero culture. And it is definitely for people who have dark humor, enjoy watching gory and violent scenes or anything explicit.

There are so many things that make this show so good (but I will just name some):

1. Well-written and structured characters Many shows don't stand out to me because it is hard to find characters that can truly take my interest or even if I do it is just one or two characters in one show. The Boys however, almost every single character hooks my interest.

Anthony Starr does an incredible job playing Homelander, when there is close shots of him, every single facial expression portrays as Homelander. What makes a good actor is when you see them in a movie, you see them acting a specific way, you know what character it is, and this is exactly what Anthony Starr gives. He is truly an exceptional actor and his character almost makes me want to relate and feel sorry for him.

Another actor that deserves a mention is Karl Urban. Karl Urban plays Billy Butcher, which is the arch enemy of Homelander. He is one of the main 'good' characters. He is a character that does the right things for the wrong reasons- revenge. He can play a tough, rude character but at the same time there is scenes where you can see a lot of emotion within him from micro expressions. Truly an amazing, underrated actor.

2. Good Plot What makes a good show/film is often and mostly depends on how good the plot is. In this case it is an exceptionally good one. Without spoilers, I'll just say that the plot is marked by intense confrontations between these anti-heroes and the morally corrupt superheroes, resulting in unpredictable and often gruesome outcomes. The show also delves into the past of the Supes, their disturbing origins, and Vought's sinister agenda. This mix of action, intrigue, and social commentary creates a compelling narrative that challenges traditional superhero tropes. I have seen many superhero type shows/ movies and nothing ever stood out to me to the point where I would pray everyday for a new release for a season.

Overall, The Boys cleverly delves into themes of power, corruption, and moral ambiguity, while offering a satirical take on the genre.

871,871,9.0,27 August 2022,"Through 3 glorious seasons, The Boys has managed to stay relatively high quality and thematically satisfying.

It's also sometimes absolutely bonkers and over-the-top.

It's not always perfect though.

Sometimes, The Boys gets too political and it's way too on-the-nose with its messaging, particularly in the third season.

It's not even that I disagree with the messages being espoused, but the series will veer from its incredible graphic-novel-esque, noir-inspired storytelling to relay these messages, like it's just ticking boxes.

Also, there are the occasional power-scaling conundrums that are common in this type of fantasy story and are even more prevalent in things like Shonen Jump anime.

There are also some fast-cut edits in some of the lower-budget action scenes that are confusing and restrictive.

But, when The Boys is firing on all cylinders, there's really nothing else like it.

From Kill Bill inspired martial-arts scenes involving superhero-themed sex-toys to congressional head explosions, when The Boys goes off-the-rails it's a blast to gawk in awe at its brilliant outlandishness.

It's also got some really solid worldbuilding and terrifying antagonists while still managing to strike a well-balanced spark of comedy and tension.

The acting is incredible all around, with the seasoned Karl Urban and the mesmerizing newcomer Antony Starr as particular stand-outs for their respective turns as Billy Butcher and Homelander.

These two really steal every scene they're in.

The Boys is also not afraid to embrace the comic-book schlock-writing that endeared so many fans to the likes of Marvel and DC, and it masterfully respects those fans while adding its own quirky lore and keeping its edge.

If Amazon keeps up this kind of momentum with The Boys, and allows it to gracefully end when it needs to, there's no doubt in my mind that The Boys will be a classic show that is long revered.

873,873,9.0,1 February 2024,"""The Boys,"" a series that initially captured the audience's attention with its bold and critical approach to the superhero genre, has unfortunately fallen into a common trap in television productions: prioritizing the series' continuity over the quality of the story. This approach results in disappointing season finales and a frustrating narrative, compromising the artistic integrity of the series.

The main issue with ""The Boys"" is the creators' apparent obsession with securing renewals for future seasons, leading to a narrative structure where character arcs and main plots are constantly sidelined. This creates a vicious cycle where each season finale seems incomplete or unsatisfactory, as the series is more concerned with setting up hooks for the next season than resolving the presented issues.

Furthermore, this ""always looking forward"" approach causes the series to miss opportunities to delve deeper into its characters and themes. Instead of exploring the complexities and nuances of the characters, ""The Boys"" often resorts to shocking twists and explicit violence, which, although exciting in the short term, ultimately diminish the emotional impact and thematic relevance of the series in the long run.

The series, which had the potential to make a sharp and meaningful critique of superhero culture and broader social issues, becomes a victim of its own success. Instead of telling a cohesive and well-developed story, ""The Boys"" gets lost in a sea of subplots and character developments that are never fully realized or resolved, leaving viewers frustrated and disappointed.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",the boys a series that initially captured the audiences attention with its bold and critical approach to the superhero genre has unfortunately fallen into a common trap in television productions prioritizing the series continuity over the quality of the story this approach results in disappointing season finales and a frustrating narrative compromising the artistic integrity of the series the main issue with the boys is the creators apparent obsession with securing renewals for future seasons leading to a narrative structure where character arcs and main plots are constantly sidelined this creates a vicious cycle where each season finale seems incomplete or unsatisfactory as the series is more concerned with setting up hooks for the next season than resolving the presented issues furthermore this always looking forward approach causes the series to miss opportunities to delve deeper into its characters and themes instead of exploring the complexities and nuances of the characters the boys often resorts to shocking twists and explicit violence which although exciting in the short term ultimately diminish the emotional impact and thematic relevance of the series in the long run the series which had the potential to make a sharp and meaningful critique of superhero culture and broader social issues becomes a victim of its own success instead of telling a cohesive and welldeveloped story the boys gets lost in a sea of subplots and character developments that are never fully realized or resolved leaving viewers frustrated and disappointed,NEGATIVE

Characters do and say things that do not fit their prior choices and character arc. I get that these characters are complex, but when characters travel too far beyond their histories and behaviors, it comes over as disjointed, disappointing and confusing.

Um, the first season was just as political as the second!!! It is practically shouting in your face throughout that the rising power of corporations due to unchecked ""free market"" policies and greed is ruining our society, stomping on the average person and creating a huge wealth gap where the rich keep getting richer. You just didn't see deep enough to recognize it. The first season is CLEARLY anti-capitalism, anti-misogynistic men, anti-military, anti-religious (especially Christian) power, hypocrisy of the people we look up to, privilege of white men to get whatever they want, manipulating the media, etc. That is all stuff those complainers would characterize as ""liberal wokeness."" The show didn't change from season one to season two. The only difference I can see is that they added a theme of white supremacy, which goes along with capitalism and all that other stuff anyway, so the people complaining here are really just complaining about a show discussing real racial issues that are prevalent in our society because it makes them uncomfortable to have to recognize. The fact that reviewers are mad about a show telling them white supremacy is bad is VERY telling about these reviewers. That being said, if you think about it, all the bad guy superheroes, even in the first season, are white, while the ""Boys"" are more diverse, so it was hinting at white supremacy all along. Anyway, this is clearly an anti-capitalism, anti-corruption, and anti-everything-unjust-about-this-world show. Take it or leave it, but don't kid yourselves. It has always been this way and will continue to be. If you're offended, good. I believe that was the intention all along. One more thing: it is incredibly hypocritical to be against the ""elites"" in power and also support free market capitalist, multi-conglomerate corporatism.

892,892,9.0,5 July 2022,"Season One WAS AMAZING 8.5/10 Gritty, brutal and punk. Was great, like a more fleshed out Watchman series without that gross bargain bin feel to it like 99% of Amazon Prime Video stuff has. Amazing characters, great actors all around. Homelander especially who can go from Icon of Justice to terrifying sociopath in an instant. It was great, very promising. Understandable. NO REAL WORLD POLITICS in there, just IN-UNIVERSE politics. TIMELESS.

Season 2 7/10 OKAY, someone's starting to get too high off their own petard and now hijacking this show for their own political soapbox but it still is 70% show 30% CURRENT THING politics, not offensive, noticeable but not offensive and still somewhat enjoyable.

Season 3 4/10 Now they're just drunk with their influence and good will they garnered for the show. It's now 50% The Boys world a la the comics, and 50% REAL WORLD issues treated with the poise and grace of a wrecking ball. A Train has always been the annoying token character and at first they hid that fact, and it made some sense in the beginning. BUT THEN season 2 and 3 they removed the slight depth he had built up in Season 1 by the end and made him 100% political/social issue prop. Sanded all that depth down til it was perfectly flat and 2D.

The 'BLM' episodes were so blatantly offensive, inaccurate and borderline inciting. Then again you remember who used to own Amazon, now owns the Washington Post, which has lost countless defamation cases, against children even in the past 6 years, so makes sense. Then there was the continuation of the whole ""Nazi"" plot that was from the previous season which again was only in there for ""THE MESSAGE"" purpose. Just seems like everyone's character except Quaid was sanded down to be super 2-dimensional, and maybe Homelander.

I know there's two episodes left this season, but I don't see how they redeem this show. You took Starlight who was a great 3D badass woman and neutered her this season, why? HUEY that's his, comes into his own and kind of makes her redundant, another thing happens and shackles her even more. There better be a hell of a redemption arch for her by the end of this season, since currently I haven't seen a strong female character done this dirty since Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn (which is not her fault, I think she's a great Harley, they just write her terribly, a character that in the animated series was a DOCTOR of PSYCHIATRY, one of the best in the COUNTRY).

Conclusion: DROP THE REAL WORLD POLITICS FROM THE SHOW, it will age this and not in a flattering manner. The writers aren't talented enough to treat serious sociol-political issues in a realistic light, or with the care they deserve. THE BLM episodes cartooned those events doing a disservice to both sides. BUT TO be expected when Seth Rogen, I laugh at stab victims who aren't on the same political side as me, even if they're minorities. Season 3 is at its best when it's dealing with ONLY IN-UNIVERSE topics. Like the change in power dynamics at Vought. That stuff was great, the stuff with A-Train comes off as minstrel show-like. Stick with the fantasy world of The Boys, and leave real world issues out of it.

900,900,10.0,2 October 2023,"""The Boys"" storms onto the small screen with a wickedly irreverent take on the superhero genre, earning its stripes as a darkly comedic and subversive delight. The acting, led by Karl Urban's gritty performance and a standout ensemble cast, injects a healthy dose of cynicism into the superhero mythos. The film editing sharpens the satirical edge, navigating seamlessly through moments of gore, humor, and jaw-dropping revelations. The strength of the series lies in its fearless dismantling of superhero tropes, offering a refreshing and often shocking perspective on the consequences of unchecked power. However, the weakness may arise for those seeking a more traditional superhero narrative, as ""The Boys"" gleefully subverts expectations at every turn. The music, with its cheeky song choices, adds an extra layer of irony to the chaos. With an 8/10 rating, ""The Boys"" emerges as a binge-worthy rollercoaster that doesn't just break the fourth wall but gleefully smashes through it, leaving viewers exhilarated and questioning the very concept of heroism.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",the boys storms onto the small screen with a wickedly irreverent take on the superhero genre earning its stripes as a darkly comedic and subversive delight the acting led by karl urbans gritty performance and a standout ensemble cast injects a healthy dose of cynicism into the superhero mythos the film editing sharpens the satirical edge navigating seamlessly through moments of gore humor and jawdropping revelations the strength of the series lies in its fearless dismantling of superhero tropes offering a refreshing and often shocking perspective on the consequences of unchecked power however the weakness may arise for those seeking a more traditional superhero narrative as the boys gleefully subverts expectations at every turn the music with its cheeky song choices adds an extra layer of irony to the chaos with an rating the boys emerges as a bingeworthy rollercoaster that doesnt just break the fourth wall but gleefully smashes through it leaving viewers exhilarated and questioning the very concept of heroism,POSITIVE

904,904,10.0,11 September 2023,"Review for (The Boys)

This series is VERY unique and NEVER done before , The story is so well written and I can't believe I haven't watched it when I've heard of it in the first time , BUT now that I've watched it I can safely say that THIS is EXACTLY the OPPOSITE of what you will think of a superhero Series.

It flips the thinking of the whole concept of super heroes , turning the evil into good and good into evil and it's done in a really good way.

The pacing is fantastic the plot moves from the first episode real quick and it shows how bad those supes are.

This series is entertaining but it has some episodes that are kinda boring and slow , but it's worth the slow burn of the plot.

The acting of Karl urban , Antony starr, Jack quid is PHENOMENAL especially Karl urban he is my 2nd favourite character known as William Butcher.

The best character here is of course , HomeLander , his acting is very amazing and EVERYTIME he's on screen you know that this is the best moments in that episode and I am not kidding he is really superior and really powerful as a character and I can say more but it's alright.

A lot of other characters have different roles and personalities and I like everyone of them , every other character in (The Boys) are amazing like , Frenchy, M. M Kmeku and more.

This series is really fun and the fun part is the superhero stuff and it's really the opposite of what I've thought about.

It's easily Amazon Prime's best series ever and I would recommend it if you have the time , Overall 9/10.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",review for the boys this series is very unique and never done before the story is so well written and i cant believe i havent watched it when ive heard of it in the first time but now that ive watched it i can safely say that this is exactly the opposite of what you will think of a superhero series it flips the thinking of the whole concept of super heroes turning the evil into good and good into evil and its done in a really good way the pacing is fantastic the plot moves from the first episode real quick and it shows how bad those supes are this series is entertaining but it has some episodes that are kinda boring and slow but its worth the slow burn of the plot the acting of karl urban antony starr jack quid is phenomenal especially karl urban he is my nd favourite character known as william butcher the best character here is of course homelander his acting is very amazing and everytime hes on screen you know that this is the best moments in that episode and i am not kidding he is really superior and really powerful as a character and i can say more but its alright a lot of other characters have different roles and personalities and i like everyone of them every other character in the boys are amazing like frenchy m m kmeku and more this series is really fun and the fun part is the superhero stuff and its really the opposite of what ive thought about its easily amazon primes best series ever and i would recommend it if you have the time overall,POSITIVE

908,908,9.0,25 May 2022,"Having just binged the first 2 series I really enjoyed this novel twist on the whole 'super-hero' genre.

Be aware it's not for the faint hearted though as there is lots of gore, blood and swearing. The latter being responsible for my wife stopping watching it and leaving me to watch it myself.

Whilst I don't mind 'normal' swearing as I do plenty myself, I'm afraid I can't condone the overuse of 'c**t' by Billy Butcher mainly. It simply isn't necessary and does not make sense. I haven't read the graphic novels this is based on but after reading other reviews it appears that Butcher is meant to be English but if that's the case then they've messed up completely here. I'm English and I can tell you for a fact that we definitely do not say 'c**t' in almost every sentence, in fact it's probably the most taboo swear word here and is used very rarely by anyone. Also Butcher's accent in the show is definitely not English/British at all. He's actually speaking Australian (not surprising as Karl Urban is from New Zealand) so I've had to take at least 1 star off my rating just for that.

Apart from those faults it's a very entertaining show and is a true indictment of modern corporations.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",having just binged the first series i really enjoyed this novel twist on the whole superhero genre be aware its not for the faint hearted though as there is lots of gore blood and swearing the latter being responsible for my wife stopping watching it and leaving me to watch it myself whilst i dont mind normal swearing as i do plenty myself im afraid i cant condone the overuse of ct by billy butcher mainly it simply isnt necessary and does not make sense i havent read the graphic novels this is based on but after reading other reviews it appears that butcher is meant to be english but if thats the case then theyve messed up completely here im english and i can tell you for a fact that we definitely do not say ct in almost every sentence in fact its probably the most taboo swear word here and is used very rarely by anyone also butchers accent in the show is definitely not englishbritish at all hes actually speaking australian not surprising as karl urban is from new zealand so ive had to take at least star off my rating just for that apart from those faults its a very entertaining show and is a true indictment of modern corporations,POSITIVE

Maybe my favorite part was when they got him, and at the same time they had to escape one of the most fearfull super ever. Two points for the humans. Unfortunately it didn't go that way, instead they go after the company behind the supers. Nothing wrong with choosing a deeper story than action. First season deserved a 9.

926,926,6.0,24 February 2024,"In my opinion ""The Boys"" had potential. However it was just like they didn't care. The only thing the creators did care about was to make it as gruesome as possible. Season 1 took so long to start, it took me a few months to finish it because it was just so boring and there was no plot the first episodes. It was just violent and sexual. That's it. That was the entire plot. The characters had no character development at all! In my opinion Starlight should have been the main character, she was this obviously good character who was innocent and didn't know what she was getting herself into. She was the kind of character that you could have empathy for. The other characters however didn't, for example Homelander. He was just evil, and being controlled by the council or whatever. Like he could have killed them all with a look but he just didn't, he just kept acting like their little pet (aggressive little pet). Also something I don't get is why starlight didn't just quit when she got there, yes the money would have been good but really, was it worth it? And when A-train was kicked out of the seven and then he just came back with no hard feelings, is just unrealistic. It's nothing against any of the actors, they were good at their jobs but the plot point and the character development was just nonexistent. Yes, I get that this is a tv series that is making fun of superheroes, but having no characters that you can relate to and or have empathy for is just stupid tbh.

Like you can make characters that are evil and that you can feel for.

For example, the joker, Ultron, Anakin skywalker, Lucifer, Loki, John wick, Deadpool. These are characters who are inherently evil, but in the boys there was just 0 effort in making these characters have anything that could have made us care about them.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",in my opinion the boys had potential however it was just like they didnt care the only thing the creators did care about was to make it as gruesome as possible season took so long to start it took me a few months to finish it because it was just so boring and there was no plot the first episodes it was just violent and sexual thats it that was the entire plot the characters had no character development at all in my opinion starlight should have been the main character she was this obviously good character who was innocent and didnt know what she was getting herself into she was the kind of character that you could have empathy for the other characters however didnt for example homelander he was just evil and being controlled by the council or whatever like he could have killed them all with a look but he just didnt he just kept acting like their little pet aggressive little pet also something i dont get is why starlight didnt just quit when she got there yes the money would have been good but really was it worth it and when atrain was kicked out of the seven and then he just came back with no hard feelings is just unrealistic its nothing against any of the actors they were good at their jobs but the plot point and the character development was just nonexistent yes i get that this is a tv series that is making fun of superheroes but having no characters that you can relate to and or have empathy for is just stupid tbh like you can make characters that are evil and that you can feel for for example the joker ultron anakin skywalker lucifer loki john wick deadpool these are characters who are inherently evil but in the boys there was just effort in making these characters have anything that could have made us care about them,NEGATIVE

1. The over sexualization of everything in the show and I mean literally everything. Without saying too much... the amount of sexualization you will see in this is a bit too much. It's okay to have a few here and there but be prepared as in this show it will be almost everywhere.

2. America = Bad according to these Hollywood writers lol. You may see a running theme in this show where anyone who has an American flag are pretty much 'evil'. Although that is the theme of Homelander I feel like the way they depict the typical patriotic American is far from the truth and it is important to remember that if you are to watch this and believe ""wow that's how Americans really are"" or ""wow that's so true for a certain demographic of Americans"" is very far from the truth. It's always good to remember that Hollywood writers exist within their own echo chamber as well, surrounded by like-minded peers.

979,979,9.0,11 March 2021,"I was never familiar with The Boys comics, but I am a fan of the show. The story of how real people with real ideas and emotions combined with god-like powers act with contempt and corruption is a welcomed fresh take on the genre. There's no need for one-dimensional villains. All the focus is on the superheroes because they are also the supervillains. For some characters this allows an incredible amount of development. Sadly, a weakness of The Boys is that it doesn't develop ALL of these characters, and wasted screen time is given to the flatlined. I was most interested in The Deep's arc going into season 2 because it was not a typical one. He wanted redemption. He wanted to be good. He just sucked at it - it's hilarious. However, he might as well not have been on the show...ever. He's gone nowhere and has practically never even been a part of The Seven as far as the time where the show starts. When The Boys fleshes out characters well you have outstanding stories and brilliant acting that gives you Butcher and Homelander. When it fails you get The Deep and A-Train.

When the characters you can't help but love are on the screen it is pure entertainment and increasing depth. Anthony Starr is unbelievably unhinged as Homelander. He's the most deranged villain since Ledger's Joker. A truly disturbed psychotic that you cannot wait to see what he'll say and do next as he's fearless and unpredictable. He never disappoints. Likewise for Butcher. Karl Urban is in the role he was born to play. Never a wasted moment and every line is nothing but sweet, vulgar music.

Though the show suffers some repetition (Homelander is evidently very easy to bribe or blackmail and Starlight is incessantly hopeless) it is a great show that reflects what would happen in real life. Ordinary emotional and mental trauma suffered by unordinary people with extraordinary abilities leads to deliciously evil and disgustingly gory TV...as it should be.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",i was never familiar with the boys comics but i am a fan of the show the story of how real people with real ideas and emotions combined with godlike powers act with contempt and corruption is a welcomed fresh take on the genre theres no need for onedimensional villains all the focus is on the superheroes because they are also the supervillains for some characters this allows an incredible amount of development sadly a weakness of the boys is that it doesnt develop all of these characters and wasted screen time is given to the flatlined i was most interested in the deeps arc going into season because it was not a typical one he wanted redemption he wanted to be good he just sucked at it its hilarious however he might as well not have been on the showever hes gone nowhere and has practically never even been a part of the seven as far as the time where the show starts when the boys fleshes out characters well you have outstanding stories and brilliant acting that gives you butcher and homelander when it fails you get the deep and atrain when the characters you cant help but love are on the screen it is pure entertainment and increasing depth anthony starr is unbelievably unhinged as homelander hes the most deranged villain since ledgers joker a truly disturbed psychotic that you cannot wait to see what hell say and do next as hes fearless and unpredictable he never disappoints likewise for butcher karl urban is in the role he was born to play never a wasted moment and every line is nothing but sweet vulgar music though the show suffers some repetition homelander is evidently very easy to bribe or blackmail and starlight is incessantly hopeless it is a great show that reflects what would happen in real life ordinary emotional and mental trauma suffered by unordinary people with extraordinary abilities leads to deliciously evil and disgustingly gory tvas it should be,POSITIVE

986,986,2.0,5 June 2022,"I really liked the first season of The Boys, I was still moderately enthusiastic about the second season but by the time I'd reached the third, well, I feel I've probably had enough.

Good writing not gory sensationalism, is what defines a decent series. The Boys has always had both but when one overrules the other, which is what I feel has happened with season 3, it gets tiresome, fast.

I was, quite frankly, bored by the first three episodes of season three. For me, it lacked the direction, pace and sense of urgency, of the previous season. Perhaps in an attempt, to balance this out, we get lots of pretty cheesy and at times, downright ""yukky"", gore. Mixed with outrageous over the top comments, that really do nothing, I can see, to enhance, this series.

As it stands, I'm on the fence about whether I'll take this any further or walk away. My instincts, tell me to walk away, so that's the more likely outcome.

In summary, season one's a cracker, two's still has some punch but season three, to me at least, feels like its spark has been extinguished. Buried as it is, beneath gore soaked, cheesy visual ""death"" gags, that might, at a stretch, amuse a gormless teenager.

994,994,9.0,24 July 2024,"Initially, I enjoyed the series. It started with a strong concept and engaging plot, but over time it has evolved into something less coherent. The characters, who were once smart and relatable, now often make irrational and stupid decisions. This shift has transitioned the series into a mediocre one, similar to what happened with shows like Vampire Diaries, Originals, and The 100. It's disappointing to see a series that started off so well decline into something that requires the audience to turn off their minds to enjoy it.

In the beginning, the storyline was captivating, with well-developed characters and intriguing plot twists that kept me hooked. However, as the seasons progressed, the writing seemed to lose its direction. The once sharp and intelligent characters began to act in ways that were inconsistent and illogical, detracting from the overall quality of the show.

1031,1031,9.0,10 August 2024,"The Boys is a standout series that delivers a thrilling and subversive take on the superhero genre. Its success is largely due to the exceptional performances of its cast, who bring depth and intensity to the show's dark and satirical narrative.

Karl Urban is electrifying as Billy Butcher, infusing the character with a gritty edge and raw emotion. Urban's portrayal of the anti-hero with a vendetta against corrupt superheroes is both compelling and multifaceted, making Butcher a standout character in the series.

Antony Starr is equally impressive as Homelander, the sinister and psychopathic leader of The Seven. Starr's chilling performance captures the character's terrifying blend of charisma and malevolence, making Homelander a truly formidable antagonist.

Jack Quaid brings a more grounded performance as Hughie Campbell, the everyman drawn into the chaotic world of vigilantes and corrupt heroes. Quaid's portrayal effectively anchors the show's emotional core, offering a relatable perspective amidst the chaos.

Erin Moriarty delivers a nuanced performance as Starlight, a superhero grappling with the dark realities of her industry. Moriarty's performance is both vulnerable and strong, making Starlight a compelling character who navigates complex moral dilemmas.

Karen Fukuhara as Kimiko provides a powerful and emotional portrayal of a silent but fierce warrior. Fukuhara's physical performance and expressive eyes convey a deep sense of pain and determination, adding depth to Kimiko's character.

Laz Alonso and Dominique McElligott also contribute strong performances. Alonso's portrayal of Mother's Milk adds a layer of complexity and vulnerability to the team, while McElligott's performance as Queen Maeve provides a compelling mix of strength and internal conflict.

Claudia Doumit offers a standout performance as Victoria Neuman, the ambitious congresswoman with hidden agendas. Doumit's portrayal adds layers of intrigue and danger to the political machinations within the series.

Jensen Ackles makes a notable addition to the cast as Soldier Boy, bringing a rugged charm and complex backstory to the role. Ackles' performance injects a new dynamic into the series, blending humor with a darker edge.

Aya Cash delivers a memorable performance as Stormfront, the extremist superhero with a menacing and controversial agenda. Cash's portrayal is both captivating and unsettling, adding a provocative layer to the show's exploration of power and ideology.

Colby Minifie shines as Ashley Barrett, the PR executive navigating the treacherous world of superheroes with a mix of ambition and anxiety. Minifie's performance brings a unique blend of humor and desperation to her character.

Giancarlo Esposito further elevates the show with his role as Stan Edgar, the shrewd and calculating head of Vought International. Esposito's commanding presence and nuanced performance add an additional layer of menace and sophistication to the series.

However, while The Boys excels in its character development and dark humor, some parts of the show can be overwhelming. The relentless edge and provocative content, while often incisive and entertaining, can sometimes feel excessive. The show's intensity and graphic elements might be too much for some viewers, making it a challenging watch despite its many strengths.

Overall, The Boys remains a gripping and audacious series with a stellar cast. The performances are consistently excellent, adding depth and intensity to the show's biting critique of superhero culture. With its engaging narrative and standout acting, it's a must-watch for fans of edgy, character-driven drama, even if its provocative style can occasionally be over the top.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",the boys is a standout series that delivers a thrilling and subversive take on the superhero genre its success is largely due to the exceptional performances of its cast who bring depth and intensity to the shows dark and satirical narrative karl urban is electrifying as billy butcher infusing the character with a gritty edge and raw emotion urbans portrayal of the antihero with a vendetta against corrupt superheroes is both compelling and multifaceted making butcher a standout character in the series antony starr is equally impressive as homelander the sinister and psychopathic leader of the seven starrs chilling performance captures the characters terrifying blend of charisma and malevolence making homelander a truly formidable antagonist jack quaid brings a more grounded performance as hughie campbell the everyman drawn into the chaotic world of vigilantes and corrupt heroes quaids portrayal effectively anchors the shows emotional core offering a relatable perspective amidst the chaos erin moriarty delivers a nuanced performance as starlight a superhero grappling with the dark realities of her industry moriartys performance is both vulnerable and strong making starlight a compelling character who navigates complex moral dilemmas karen fukuhara as kimiko provides a powerful and emotional portrayal of a silent but fierce warrior fukuharas physical performance and expressive eyes convey a deep sense of pain and determination adding depth to kimikos character laz alonso and dominique mcelligott also contribute strong performances alonsos portrayal of mothers milk adds a layer of complexity and vulnerability to the team while mcelligotts performance as queen maeve provides a compelling mix of strength and internal conflict claudia doumit offers a standout performance as victoria neuman the ambitious congresswoman with hidden agendas doumits portrayal adds layers of intrigue and danger to the political machinations within the series jensen ackles makes a notable addition to the cast as soldier boy bringing a rugged charm and complex backstory to the role ackles performance injects a new dynamic into the series blending humor with a darker edge aya cash delivers a memorable performance as stormfront the extremist superhero with a menacing and controversial agenda cashs portrayal is both captivating and unsettling adding a provocative layer to the shows exploration of power and ideology colby minifie shines as ashley barrett the pr executive navigating the treacherous world of superheroes with a mix of ambition and anxiety minifies performance brings a unique blend of humor and desperation to her character giancarlo esposito further elevates the show with his role as stan edgar the shrewd and calculating head of vought international espositos commanding presence and nuanced performance add an additional layer of menace and sophistication to the series however while the boys excels in its character development and dark humor some parts of the show can be overwhelming the relentless edge and provocative content while often incisive and entertaining can sometimes feel excessive the shows intensity and graphic elements might be too much for some viewers making it a challenging watch despite its many strengths overall the boys remains a gripping and audacious series with a stellar cast the performances are consistently excellent adding depth and intensity to the shows biting critique of superhero culture with its engaging narrative and standout acting its a mustwatch for fans of edgy characterdriven drama even if its provocative style can occasionally be over the top,POSITIVE

1037,1037,8.0,3 August 2021,"This show is so highly regarded and so highly spoken of by a lot of people, and I feel like it's an overreaction. Now, don't get me wrong, this show is entertaining to watch; I feel like every little detail is highly praised by a lot of people. From what I've seen, people make this show out to be much better than it is. Every little detail is brought up as another reason why this show is the best show they've ever watched. It's odd and, well, very ridiculous.

I think that it has to do with the themes in the show, including the way things are written to mirror the real world, as well as more minor details that get people all excited, for some reason, using them as a way to express how great this show is. It doesn't make sense to me. Another thing that I think is one of the reasons that people think makes this show the greatest show they've ever watched is that this show reinvents the superhero genre or something to do with the superhero genre, and I don't understand that.

To me, these reasons seem very shallow. None of those things should matter. None of those things should play a factor in whether or not you enjoy an episode of a show or the show itself; whether or not you think an episode of a show or the show itself is great; the level at which you enjoy an episode of a show or the show itself or think it's great. None of it should matter so much to where you'll not like an episode of a show or the show itself as much as you would've if things like that were present, to where it has such an impact on how you react and feel, and your outlook. When I see people reacting so strongly, positively or negatively, about stuff like that, I think it's ridiculous that they seemingly matter so much to them. Because, for me, it's only a matter of whether I enjoy what I watch.

Speaking of which, another one of those reasons that I've seen people provide as to why they love the show so much is that it's way better than the comic book series was; that they liked various aspects that the show did or made a lot better than the comics did. I can understand that reason, but that still shouldn't elevate the show higher than it is. And I think it does for a lot of people, as does the themes in the show, the way the writers write some things to mirror the real world and on-going situations, the way that this show reinvents the superhero genre or whatever that assertion is all about. I don't understand that way of thinking.

Personally, I enjoy watching this show. There are instances where the writing is lazy, convenient, or contrived; instances of inconsistency. And there are plenty of moments that come across as ridiculous but may not completely fit within any of those categories. But I never had that big of a problem with them. There were only a few that I caught, and they didn't bother me; hell, the ones that I caught may have explanations that make enough sense and aren't too convenient. There were more instances like that of which were revealed to me through other means, but they still didn't bother me that much.

The only thing that's an issue with this show for me is that the main plot and subplots aren't written in a captivating way, most of the time. I'm still entertained enough while watching episodes that feel that way, but it's something that I wish wasn't the case so I can be as entertained as possible. Other than that, I have always been entertained by this show. I don't think that aspect will change, thankfully. It's the entertainment value that matters the most to me. And while I don't understand the high praise or reactions to practically every little detail in the show, it's not my problem.

And boy does this show deliver. The acting is excellent, special shout-out to Tomer Capon for his performance. The story and the character differ noticeably from the comics, but that's not a problem at all, in fact it's better because it gives a fresh spin and you don't really know what's going to happen even if you have read the print.

The only problem I have with the show is just how tame it is compared to the comics. When I saw the TV-MA rating I expected this to be a festival of debauchery, cruelty, violence and blood and gore. And while it does have plenty of these it pales in comparison to the source material.

1049,1049,10.0,7 September 2024,"So an adult show ( not taking itself seriously at all ) with Super ""human"" ( though some ""Supes"" consider themselves not human but Gods ) non Binary Superhero/Villains, as the characters are more complex so not just 100% good or 100% evil as each main character has both evil & good in them so makes each character's arc more interesting to see.

( Too many other Super Hero TV shows or Films have heroes that are binary so one side is too good & the other side is too evil so boring ).

Of course Superhero shows for young children to watch ( U or PG ) need to give clear guidance on the difference between right & wrong, where adult shows like ""The Boys"" can make fun with adults being mature enough to understand the difference between right & wrong.

The show does question throughout the morality of what being a human is & whether vengeance or forgiveness should be given & how each can either perpetuate a situation or possibly help resolve it. Again this is not a binary issue as sometimes one way work better depending on the circumstances ( however it is good to make the viewer think ).

Unfortunately in the show some of the writers to get their own personal political ( humour ) views across make peripheral 2D ( Binary as in 100% Good or 100% Bad ) to try to make their political joke work in their own personal favour, which is both disingenuous & therefore is a false point of view ( which then alienates some of the audience which is very stupid to do ). Better to always give both sides of a debate & then let the audience decide for themselves which they prefer then.

Generally though the show just tries to be funny & put in jokes to gloss over any writers political opinions ( which sometimes works but also sometimes doesn't work ), so makes the prospect of Series 5 being the final season the correct choice ( as it's time for the show to finish up ).

Because the show keeps devolving into a show that doesn't take itself serious at all, with it's humour, it works, so as long as the audience can accept how farcical it is, you can enjoy the dark comedy ( well mostly ).

Some of the scenes though are shockingly gross which again can be either shockingly funny or off putting ( depending on the individual audience member watching ) as don't watch while eating your food at home unless you have a strong stomach ( as what's gross & funny to some people will be gross & want to make you throw up to others ).

Overall I think The Boys is much funnier than gross ( in my opinion ).

What makes this show entertaining to watch is it does reveal some thoughts on real life ( whether you agree or disagree ) so therefore can be thought provoking to a basic level only which helps make the show interesting ( even with it's plot holes that take a star off it 's score ) as in general you can kind of allow the show's ridiculously rollercoaster script to get away with a lot more latitude because it is a ""SUPER FARCE"".

The question is if you can allow yourself to accept this is obviously not a serious attempt at a Super Hero TV drama Show, as if yes then as an adult it's worth a watch as chances are you enjoy the entertainment in the main as the actors generally do a good job with their characters.

So Karl Urban, Jack Quaid & Anthony Starr as the 3 most important characters all do 10 out of 10 with their acting & the rest of the cast are generally good to very good ( 7 to 9 out of 10 ) in supporting roles.

I will say though Giancarlo Esposito is another 10 out of 10 ( as he always is & as expected ) + ( unexpectedly ) Elisabeth Shue, Simon Pegg & Nicola Correia-Damude for me also put in 10 out of 10 also.

As I always enjoy seeing supporting cast members giving it there all.

Tomer Capone & Karen Fukuhara have great chemistry together & though I'd give them 9 out of 10 for their individual performances which is still great, as a pair they deserve a 20 out of 20 when together.

Like I say the rest of the cast are all still very good to great ( 7 to 9 out of 10 ), as everyone in the audience will like who they prefer like I do.

Watching a Superhero TV show though where ""normal"" humans can survive & compete with ( sometimes defeat ) Super ""people"" who have Super Powers, can sometimes be rewarding to watch however after a time the odds of them surviving each time becomes so slim it starts to get ridiculous, though in a ""SUPER FARCE"" we give a lot of latitude.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",so an adult show not taking itself seriously at all with super human though some supes consider themselves not human but gods non binary superherovillains as the characters are more complex so not just good or evil as each main character has both evil good in them so makes each characters arc more interesting to see too many other super hero tv shows or films have heroes that are binary so one side is too good the other side is too evil so boring of course superhero shows for young children to watch u or pg need to give clear guidance on the difference between right wrong where adult shows like the boys can make fun with adults being mature enough to understand the difference between right wrong the show does question throughout the morality of what being a human is whether vengeance or forgiveness should be given how each can either perpetuate a situation or possibly help resolve it again this is not a binary issue as sometimes one way work better depending on the circumstances however it is good to make the viewer think unfortunately in the show some of the writers to get their own personal political humour views across make peripheral d binary as in good or bad to try to make their political joke work in their own personal favour which is both disingenuous therefore is a false point of view which then alienates some of the audience which is very stupid to do better to always give both sides of a debate then let the audience decide for themselves which they prefer then generally though the show just tries to be funny put in jokes to gloss over any writers political opinions which sometimes works but also sometimes doesnt work so makes the prospect of series being the final season the correct choice as its time for the show to finish up because the show keeps devolving into a show that doesnt take itself serious at all with its humour it works so as long as the audience can accept how farcical it is you can enjoy the dark comedy well mostly some of the scenes though are shockingly gross which again can be either shockingly funny or off putting depending on the individual audience member watching as dont watch while eating your food at home unless you have a strong stomach as whats gross funny to some people will be gross want to make you throw up to others overall i think the boys is much funnier than gross in my opinion what makes this show entertaining to watch is it does reveal some thoughts on real life whether you agree or disagree so therefore can be thought provoking to a basic level only which helps make the show interesting even with its plot holes that take a star off it s score as in general you can kind of allow the shows ridiculously rollercoaster script to get away with a lot more latitude because it is a super farce the question is if you can allow yourself to accept this is obviously not a serious attempt at a super hero tv drama show as if yes then as an adult its worth a watch as chances are you enjoy the entertainment in the main as the actors generally do a good job with their characters so karl urban jack quaid anthony starr as the most important characters all do out of with their acting the rest of the cast are generally good to very good to out of in supporting roles i will say though giancarlo esposito is another out of as he always is as expected unexpectedly elisabeth shue simon pegg nicola correiadamude for me also put in out of also as i always enjoy seeing supporting cast members giving it there all tomer capone karen fukuhara have great chemistry together though id give them out of for their individual performances which is still great as a pair they deserve a out of when together like i say the rest of the cast are all still very good to great to out of as everyone in the audience will like who they prefer like i do watching a superhero tv show though where normal humans can survive compete with sometimes defeat super people who have super powers can sometimes be rewarding to watch however after a time the odds of them surviving each time becomes so slim it starts to get ridiculous though in a super farce we give a lot of latitude,POSITIVE

1079,1079,8.0,1 August 2019,"Everywhere you look these days, it's all about superheroes - tv, cinema, comics, toys, cosplay... Every person on the planet has heard of Batman or Spider-Man, these fictional vigilantes are so embedded into pop culture that it's hard to think of a world without these characters. Some websites and fan fiction even show we're at the brink of worshipping these ""gods"". When one of these superhero films becomes the highest grossing film at the box office and we get conventions dedicated to these group of talented individuals, that's where The Boys would step in to shake things up. What would a universe with superheroes actually look like in this day and age?

The Boys is one of the most relevant TV series made in a while. Seth Rogen, Eric Kripke (Supernatural) and Evan Goldberg created the series, which was originally a comic series written by Darick Robertson and Garth Ennis. These 'supes' (short for superheroes) have publicists who write apologies for the multiple mistakes these caped crusaders make, and believe me, there's plenty of those. Accidentally running through normal citizens or not caring enough to save a by terrorists taken over plane, these situations are daily business and some of them are even set up by media outlets to raise their social media following. They look like your usual superheroes, fake and all smiles in your face, but when you look beneath the surface this group of entitled brats are nothing but monsters with too much power.

When the ordinary Hughie Campbell (Jack Quaid) loses his girlfriend in a very bloody way in the hands of speedy superhero A-Train (Jessie Usher), this shakes up his simple life and attracts the attention of Billy Butcher (Karl Urban). Billy used to lead a squad, ""The Boys"", to keep an eye on these out-of-control superheroes. While this all develops, the cheerful and starry-eyed Starlight (Erin Moriarty) gets recruited by The Seven, the world's most famous superhero team. Her team members are the fishy The Deep (Chace Crawford), silent killer Black Noir (Nathan Mitchell), femme fatale Queen Maeve (Dominique McElligott), the invisible Translucent (Alex Hassell) and their leader Homelander (Antony Starr), who looks a lot like the grown up version we recently witnessed in Superman-goes-bad film Brightburn.

Billy's band of misfits fell apart when his wife tragically passed away after a range of personal events. He's ready to bring the Boys back together, to fight evil and to expose the biggest conspiracy that could end the world of ""supes"" once and for all. Mother's Milk (Laz Alonso) and Frenchie (Tomer Capon) need little convincing to come back from retirement, but soon find a new member in force-to-reckon-with The Female (Karen Fukuhara). The Boys isn't just a superhero-tale, it's comedy is so dark and realistic, Marvel Studios could never show this true side of what their heroes are up to behind closed doors. Eyes getting lasered out of skulls, superhero-orgies and lots of guts flying everywhere. Nothing is too crazy for this team.

The world we live in is ruled by pompous people as authority figures, with too much money and time on their hands. Every day we wake up with another celebrity scandal or politician screwing things up. This is exactly what the writers of the show wanted to stay true to, and used this idea but replaced it with superheroes and put them in a position that makes them almost untouchable. Almost I said, because this is about fighting back at those who lost touch with the real world.

The cast shines in every aspect. Antony Starr as borderline psychopath Homelander makes your blood boil, while Erin Moriarty is bright and bubbly kicking ass and standing up for herself as Starlight. Karl Urban stands out as Billy Butcher, shooting at everyone who blinks at him and shouting every cuss word you could possibly imagine, while talking about the Spice Girls *chef's kiss*. Not to forget is Oscar-nominated Elisabeth Shue, who plays the icy and mysterious Madelyn Stillwell, Senior Vice President of Superhero Management at Vought. Her character rules the world with Homelander, smiling at the faces of helpless victims.

The Boys is awesome, explosive, gruesome fun that punches you in the gut when you least expect it.

Season 2 was good, but it's rating is likely inflated because it was coming after a good season 1 and it didn't fall flat. There was still promise and potential within the show.

Season 3 was overly stale and formulaic.

The first few episodes are just melodramatic talking and suddenly I realized that a show about super heroes had almost zero 'super heroing' and all conversation. If this was character development fine, but it seemed like time filler. Secondly, characters should 'grow' with their environment, meaning when you spend a season facing impossible odds and over come them, you are not the same person in the beginning. Here the characters are making worse mistakes then they would have made in Season 1, which means there are new writers, or they got really lazy.

In a lot of ways, many of episodes look like 'cut scenes' from the first season and someone hack together additional scenes to make it seem like a season 2.

1096,1096,9.0,5 February 2021,"I have to say, I was somewhat sceptical about this one. But a friend recommended it to me and I started watching. And boy, oh boy, was I in for a surprise.

The first scene with A-Train got me really glued to the TV and I couldn't wait to see more. The plot really well written and the idea behind the show really came to life. I have to be honest, I have never seen a show like this one. Every action had a reason and you could relate to why the characters were doing, what they were doing.

I liked every single episode. So far, that I binge-watched the entire first season.

But theeen... came season two. Somehow they lost it. I don't know if they picked up other writers, or whatever happened, but the series lost its soul. Funny to say that, since some of the characters were actually ""finding their soul"" through religion. The plot was dragging along and I could litteraly see every single ""plot twist"" and ""surprise moment"" coming from miles away. And the characters felt like they stagnated in one place and they themselves didn't know, what was coming next. They did try to mix it up with some provocative topics, but they just fell flat on the ground and never got up again.

The performances of some actors were really great. Especially Antnoy Starr (Homelander). He really carries this entire series. Sadly they lost Elisabeth Shue (Madelyn Stillwell). I think she was one of those, who stood out. The other ones are kinda flat and undeveloped characters.

I really hope season 3 will be better, because it would be a shame if this show goes down as one of those, that could've been great but didn't live up to its potential.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",i have to say i was somewhat sceptical about this one but a friend recommended it to me and i started watching and boy oh boy was i in for a surprise the first scene with atrain got me really glued to the tv and i couldnt wait to see more the plot really well written and the idea behind the show really came to life i have to be honest i have never seen a show like this one every action had a reason and you could relate to why the characters were doing what they were doing i liked every single episode so far that i bingewatched the entire first season but theeen came season two somehow they lost it i dont know if they picked up other writers or whatever happened but the series lost its soul funny to say that since some of the characters were actually finding their soul through religion the plot was dragging along and i could litteraly see every single plot twist and surprise moment coming from miles away and the characters felt like they stagnated in one place and they themselves didnt know what was coming next they did try to mix it up with some provocative topics but they just fell flat on the ground and never got up again the performances of some actors were really great especially antnoy starr homelander he really carries this entire series sadly they lost elisabeth shue madelyn stillwell i think she was one of those who stood out the other ones are kinda flat and undeveloped characters i really hope season will be better because it would be a shame if this show goes down as one of those that couldve been great but didnt live up to its potential,POSITIVE

1107,1107,8.0,15 June 2024,"I waited a long time before watching this because I don't like waiting for a whole week per episode in case I really liked it. Although in this case it wasn't going to be a problem.

I felt this way as soon as I finished watching the 1st episode but I decided to give it a chance and at least finish the season hoping it might finally blow me away like it has so many.

It didn't. My initial thoughts sadly didn't change at the end of the first season. That it is extremely overrated. Its true selling point is the wanton gore & debauchery. Without it, it would've been just another superhero show to get cancelled early.

Its story isn't anything to write home about. I get what the show is: a parody of Superhero culture, but the story itself is just not interesting.

I also watched a video titled ""how The Boys ended Marvel"". I'm as critical of Marvel as anyone, and I see that both Captain Marvel & The Boys debuted in the same year.

However, Carol Danvers didn't need nudity, over-the-top gore or an atrocious english accent by Karl Urban to gross over 1 billion dollars worldwide. I can't help but flash back to Brie's ""neck"" and ""beard"" comment which triggered so many worldwide. I keep thinking that the only reason this show is so popular is because there's so many of ""them"" in the world.

Sure, it has its standouts. Antony Starr is most definitely a highlight, but he does have plenty of experience with portraying dual natures - if you're familiar with his stellar work in ""Outrageous Fortune"" 20 years ago portraying twins Van & Jethro West. Jethro, a cold-hearted upstart lawyer with an unhealthy mommy fixation (also seen here). And Van, who suffered brain damage as a little kid, is a much kinder and simpler young man with a heart of gold. And a stoner for life.

Unfortunately he's only one character, and that's where the standouts really end. The rest of the day-to-day cast is filled with a legion of side faces that don't really go anywhere, do much of anything or are all that interesting.

When speaking of ""The 7"" it's really just Homelander. You got a masked Swat guy, an invisible guy, black Flash, Discount WonderWoman who only has one face and doesn't amount to anything, and Fish Guy who's momentarily relevant only in the first episode because he's used as a plot trauma source for the doe-eyed newcomer who has to learn that the world isn't just fluffy bunnies and roses.

And ""The Boys"" themselves? Other than Karl Urban's tiresome faux-English accent and his cartoonish overacting, you got the perpetual-bamboozled-faced Jack Quaid, a mute rabid girl and 2 other dudes who serve as the stereotypical bickering elderly couple.

The writers also ruined the mystique of the Supes when they revealed their origin so early. They should've kept that under wraps for at least one more season. It completely took away their aura of invincibility and made everything else that much more predictable.

Ending Marvel? I extremely doubt that. Watch the series once out of curiosity if you have to, but don't let its overall rating fool you.

I thought this show was about a group of D-list super heroes that decided to band together to take down the A-list super heroes that have gone bad and I was really excited to see it. Well I was wrong. It is about a group of non-powered humans who hate super heroes and are trying to find proof to take them down by bumbling around and putting themselves in danger (which sounds like it would be funny but it isn't). As it turns out pretty much ALL super heroes are bad and the private company that runs them is worse.

That being said, the actual story line wouldn't be totally without potential, but that potential was completely thrown out the window. This show has no real plot line that I can follow just lots of hints about conspiracy and darker things than the already gratuitous awful stuff they do pack the episodes with. None of it seems to propel the story forward or explain anything. It is filled with dark, evil deeds that seem to have no purpose to the story other than shoving down your throat how bad super heroes and their company is.

1127,1127,10.0,6 January 2023,"Man this is such a step up compared to the comics as of right now after the end of season 3. Probably one of the few shows that does a better job than its original counterpart.

Plot/Story: 8.9

The concept, the idea of ""bad"" heroes has been done multiple times but for a whole universe that is quite deep and expansive compared to most others have never been done before. Each season was bigger, better, more explosive, but it always stuck to its recipe. The intro, the buildup which was the longest and most important, the climax, and then the conclusions. The pacing was well done for the most part with resting periods after each grotesque, adrenaline pumping scenes. The consistency was there with a few minor hiccups and flaws but overall amazing writing and character development. Its bitter, sweet, funny, and VERY violent. No deep philosophical thinking or any deep themes, just a very good series that I enjoyed very easily from the gecko

Characters: 8.2

The heroes, the villains, I mean they were all well done for the most part. Each one of them were unique with their own stories and defining personalities. They felt human, they felt real..

Overall well done for the most part just had a hard time connecting with most of them other than 1 or 2 characters.

Visuals/Sound: 9.8

The directing, the sounds, it was really ridiculously well done. Watching the series I could see that they put a lot of effort into it.

1131,1131,1.0,23 December 2021,"Due to being away, it took me a while to watch the last episode of the fourth season of The Boys but I have watched it and here is my review for the fourth season of Amazon's acclaimed show The Boys. The premise of the season sees The Boys attempt to finally kill Homelander after he starts to use his powers in public to cause fear.

Main Character Karl Urban is once again back as Billy Butcher and I really like his character this season. After taking Temp V last season it is clear that Butcher is dying and doesn't have much time left and Urban really sells that. He is more brutal this season and trying to achieve his goals before he goes and Urban kills it this season.

I have always believed that Homelander played by Antony Starr is one of the best performances in any medium and this continues here. Homelander goes through so many emotions this season and I just love watching his mind work and I can't emphasise how great Starr is in this show.

Supporting Characters Over the last few seasons A-Train played by Jessie T Usher has been one of the more interesting characters and this season really gives him plenty of screen time to further flesh out his character and he nails it. You see the conflict in him and that he actually wants to be a hero and not just Homelander's pawn.

On the contrary is a fantastic performance by Chase Crawford who plays The Deep, he becomes more committed to Homelander's cause and you really see the violence come out in him and Crawford plays this sleezy bad guy so well.

But I do think some of the characters get treated poorly this season. Jack Quaid plays Hughie and he goes through the ringer this season, his story does feel a bit disconnected from the main plot and Quaid is given very little to do and I just didn't care too much about him.

Erin Moriarty as Starlight is kind of insufferable this season, they do plenty of things to make you really not like her character but I never really felt any real redemption for her and I just wanted to see her get taken down and taken off of the show.

There is a huge cast and new characters such as Sister Sage, Firecracker & Joe Kessler are fantastic but characters we already had such as Frenchie and Kimiko are really misused and are actually pretty annoying.

Story The overall story is pretty interesting, it shows The Boys and Butcher going to extreme lengths to try and take down Homelander. With Homelander really trying to hit his endgame and put supes in charge of the world. It is showed really well and I really like how the stakes have been risen for the last few seasons of the show. But, similar to previous seasons every character has to have their own individual stories and some of it just sucks, too much is going on and certain plot elements just aren't very interesting. But the show has a fantastic ending which has me excited for the fifth and final season.

Script The show is still really well written, there is the combination of humour and drama here. The show is as outlandish as it has been before and this season it definitely leans into the politics within The USA but I always believed the show has made fun of elements of US politics so it has always been there.

Style The show has kept the violence in their action and it just works for The Boys and the crazy elements makes it stand out to other shows of somewhat similar ideas. It is paced well enough despite the amount it tries to cram in and I think it was really fun weekly entertainment.

Overall Overall, The Boys Season 4 is one of the weaker seasons of the show but it is still a great watch for fans of the show. With the next season confirmed to be the final. It has me excited for how they are going to give this show the send-off that it deserves.

1156,1156,10.0,1 June 2024,"This is some graphic violence with intense dialogue regarding a group of superhumans. Superficially they act as heroes but are truly villains and though many comic books show the dark sides this is the first hit live action i've seen execute this well.

The critical part of an anti hero story is showing and having the internal struggle of being who they are and accepting it. Though most of them show a 9/10 performance, Anthony Starr's Homelander is above and beyond.

The team's backstory and development are very well done showing how they came to their current and what motivates them to do what they do. And frankly very few dull or dragging moments in this show.

I think it deserves 10 stars because it actually pushed into a boundary that most superhero media doesn't go often. It creates a sense of fear, belief that if superheroes were once human this is exactly how they'd behave making this a new journey. Not a typical 21st century ""marvel/fox/dc"" superhero or antihero which is why it deserves an extra star to address the vulgar, ugly, practical side of what having superpowers can mean.

Be warned this is hella graphic, showing everything you could imagine with CG or prosthetics absolutely NSFW/Kids/conservatives. At first I actually stopped watching midway through the first episode because it was breaking so many social barriers but got through and enjoying it ever since.

1192,1192,10.0,21 October 2023,"The Boys is a show that dares to challenge the conventional superhero genre, by presenting a dark, twisted, and hilarious take on what happens when the heroes are not so heroic. Based on the comic book series by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson, the show follows a group of vigilantes who are determined to expose the truth about the corrupt and powerful corporation that manages the superheroes, known as the Seven.

The show is not for the faint of heart, as it features graphic violence, gore, sex, and profanity. But it also has a lot of heart, humor, and satire, as it explores themes such as celebrity culture, corporate greed, media manipulation, and moral ambiguity. The show does not shy away from tackling relevant and controversial issues, such as racism, sexism, homophobia, and religious fanaticism.

The cast is phenomenal, with Karl Urban stealing the show as Billy Butcher, the leader of the Boys who has a personal vendetta against the superheroes. Antony Starr is equally impressive as Homelander, the leader of the Seven who is a twisted and narcissistic version of Superman. The rest of the ensemble is also great, with Jack Quaid as Hughie, the naive and sympathetic protagonist who joins the Boys after his girlfriend is killed by a superhero; Erin Moriarty as Starlight, the newest member of the Seven who struggles to maintain her ideals in a corrupt system; and Laz Alonso, Tomer Capon, and Karen Fukuhara as Mother's Milk, Frenchie, and the Female, the other members of the Boys who have their own motivations and skills.

The show is also visually stunning, with impressive special effects and action scenes that rival any blockbuster movie. The show does not hold back on showing the full extent of the superheroes' powers and their consequences. The show also has a great soundtrack that adds to the mood and tone of each scene.

The Boys is a show that will keep you hooked from start to finish, with its unpredictable plot twists, witty dialogue, and memorable characters. It is a show that will make you laugh, cry, gasp, and cheer. It is a show that will make you question your own morality and what it means to be a hero.

The face of the company are these 7 heroes: as any other job, they needed to pass an interview, they have a contract and need to respect some PR policies. I was honestly expecting a funny parody about superheroes movies, in fact some costumes are clearly inspired by famous characters from Marvel and DC, but in reality this series is much more. It is a deep analysis of our society and what people can do in order to reach their goals, disregarding completely any law, any common sense and any moral, especially if they become famous. This is perfectly represented by Homelander, a manipulative and egocentric person and his other colleagues, that in order to cover their mistakes, will take controversial decisions.

A group of men called The Boys, will try to stop this abusive behavior, in every possible way. What I really appreciate is that superheroes this time are villains and humans, are the real heroes, how to turn cards in an efficient and creative way. It is the most original stuff that I have watched regarding superheroes since Watchmen and The Dark Knight Trilogy by Nolan. Don't get me wrong: I like MCU movies, but they never really push boundaries, Marvel and DC decided to realize ""family friendly"" movies lately, and that's okay, but after you watch a couple of movie from the MCU or from the DCEU, you basically watch all of them, because they are always the same thing, so when finally networks do something different, I am always happy.

Let me be clear: this is NOT a series for everyone and there are many, many sequences that are really hard to watch and process, so approach this series carefully. Of course there is the right dose of comedic moments, but most of them fall under the black comedy humor category, and may offend someone.

Unfortunately, the show gets worse and worse. The storytelling has huge holes, the character building is mediocre, the violence gets annoying. I kept on hoping to ger another turn but the spiral kept going down. The characters of 'the boys' even started to be more and more annoying.

1224,1224,9.0,9 June 2022,"The Boys remains one of the streaming era's top-notch productions because it's satire doesn't pull its punches or criticism of modern (pop-)culture, it is brutally honest about the 'absolute power corrupts absolutely' philosophy, and its mixing-and-matching criticism of Marvel and DC's Avengers and Justice League archetypes alike make this show a real treat for longtime superhero fans, as well as less genre-centric tv audiences too.

The world-building is some of the most seamless, the characters are like inverts on the Good Guys vs Bad Guys' Thugs routine: except The Boys themselves are like more like self-commanding thugs than flunkies for the likes of The Joker and some such; The Seven are like the completely corrupted versions of Justice League in the Injustice video game, and their opposition are totally powerless in stopping Homelander unless they themselves play dirty like the people (Supes) they hate so damn much.

The Boys is still great stuff; three seasons on and it's still got a lot of bite and critiques to make about the world today. It's also Amazon Prime's flagship series for sure. That last note MAY be a controversial one in light of The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, but I haven't seen it to compare the two programs fairly (yet).

The Boys is like an antidote to all the superhero cliches we're getting accustomed to, and it's still a 'refreshingly cynical' antithesis to Marvel Studios' and DC Entertainment's stuff. It's like the third one of an unofficial 'Big Three' of superhero entertainment: Disney, Warners and Sony/Amazon (thanks to this and Invincible).

The Boys is still going strong; the characters are as deep and morally-grey as ever, the stories get more intricately detailed and delightfully contrived, and the world it's making feels just as fleshed out as any other shared universes on-screen.

If I were to sum The Boys up in one phrase, it would be ""shock and awe."" It's a ""WTF did they really really do that"" kind of show. And it's mesmerizing.

I have a vision of the writers collaborating in a smoke-filled room and frequently determining that a scene has to be rewritten because it wasn't offensive enough.

There's so many reviews from people that Just. Don't. Get. It. And it shows from what they write about it. Liberals are shocked. Conservatives are offended. Both are completely missing everything that's epic about this show. These types of reviews are almost as entertaining as the series itself, and are a testament that the writers had goals, and that they exceeded said goals.

The writing is solid. It's shocking, and spares none, whether human or living creature, and even a few inanimate objects. That so many people don't get it makes it even better.

Solid casting too. I can't think of one poorly cast character. I wasn't sure about the addition of Jensen Ackles, but his lines... I laugh just thinking about some of the antiquated things that Soldier Boy brings up.

1247,1247,10.0,2 August 2019,"Eric Kripke and other people behind CW's Supernatural really tanked what could have been a 10 rated show. It suffers from the same writing flaws, out of place campiness, and shallow character development.

However, it seems that a dozen adolescent school boys have been substituted for skilled script-writers and are feverishly competing for shock effect.

1253,1253,10.0,29 July 2019,"Edit: Thank you fanboys and hired cheerleaders / claqueurs for your ""not helpful"" marks, I am wearing them with pride. Going down from 6 to 5 stars with my rating. Now back to the original review: There are not many things in ""The Boys"" I didn't see in ""Powers"" (2015). Does anybody even remember ""Powers"" ? It was a real groundbreaking dystopian Superhero show where the ""Powers"" (here they are called ""Supes"") already are out of control, godlike, abusing their power, manipulating the media, using (or creating) drugs, have a fan base that finances their company....but aren't ""man-made"". Of course, if superheroes aren't an evolving species, or created in an energy accident, there has to be a scientist with a German name who experimented on humans...(greetings from Painkiller Jane !) So, for me, ""The Boys"" is a show that isn't very creative. It is, though, well-made and well-played, especially by Anthony Starr (Homelander). The plot, although, is paper-thin and has a summary that is only a few words - People in power are dominating powerless people. The humor is rather grim or absent. There are a few scenes which could be funny if someone where there who had a sense of humor, but those scenes are merely tending into bloodbaths. Any half episode of ""The Tick"" is more funny than the complete Season of ""The Boys"". If there is something funny with bloodbaths, then maybe this show deserves 8 or 9 stars from all people who tend to give bloodbaths 8 or 9 stars, but I do not. I give 8 or 9 stars to exceptionally and creative scripts and dialogs, which this show doesn't have - mostly. And I give 8 or 9 stars for being surprised and getting excited by a show, and honestly, I wasn't - mostly.

At the top of the Supe heirarchy sits Homelander (Antony Starr) - an invulnerable megalomaniac with laser eyes and flight - who despite being propped up with positive PR, is constantly letting his god complex and inferiority complicate the image of Vaught International, the business brand of superheroes.

1260,1260,10.0,9 March 2021,"Yes, you read the headline right. *Mild spoilers*

The Boys off the jump grabs your intention immediately in Season 1's pilot episode and from then on it's a heck of a rollercoaster ride filled with surprises. Have you ever been at a rollercoaster park on a slow day and the person working the rollercoaster let's you go again without you having to get out from your seat? That satisfying enjoyment in getting another go is comparable to The Boys Season 2. As you start season 2, stakes are high and that is displayed immediately in a natural way that feels like a nice warm welcome back. From then on flow of each episode never spikes or twists, it is always comfortably right and eases in viewers well. Without going into detail as The Boys already has 250k+ reviews, I can say that once you finish bingeing season 2 you'd be left with wanting more ASAP! The ending is very well-rounded and tells a complete story (aside of certain conflicts) that is always satisfying when having to wait another year or more to be able to watch new episodes again. I compare The Boys to Breaking Bad because even though both shows could be argued that they are one of the best TV originals of all time, there are still flaws that are proudly embraced.

Season 2 episode 7 falls perfect for an example; ever watch a show where characters find themselves progressing through a conflict and before they can execute their plan of action(s), an unexpected turn of events befalls them? This was expected at some point in every show, it's just the matter of execution on if it's done right, The Boys seemed to consist all story arcs to face their ""the all is lost"" moment within the same episode. Being that the show is almost finished however (as it is second to last episode), the ""all is lost"" moment seems easily forgiving which may question some viewers why were they even included in the first place? Aside from this and the final scene that included a heavy surprise twist that throws off the ending's rhythm, overall The Boys is to say a controversial dramatic masterpiece.

Now, for the demographic it is intended for the Series thus far has done well establishing backgrounds for its characters, with room for further depth, development, & investigation that will aid in bolstering the scope & immersion of it's own Universe in future seasons. Many of the characters have developed a deep & comprehensive pathos, which helps blend the story's fiction almost seamlessly with our own Universe, despite a few unavoidable gaps. The story, per its own synopsis, revolves around a world where Superheroes exist, but in conjunction with Corporate Enterprises, & it does a decent job depicting how that would realistically work within the confines of an unreal reality.

I would highly recommend watching it to any who are on the fence, I look forward to many more seasons (Barring the stream-series Curse that seems to be sweeping across platforms at the moment).

1271,1271,10.0,3 December 2020,"The boys is a diabolical series with its own class in terms of shock value. The directing, script, acting, costumes, lighting, colorization, special effects are all terrific, and would put a lot of films today to shame.

The characters have depth and with many flaws, their goals and motives are clear which makes it easy to root for them or not. The psychologically disturbed leader of The Seven - Homelander played by the wonderful Anthony Starr is both terrifying and fun to watch, anytime he walks into a room with other characters, you can't help but wonder if they will walk out alive. He always grins, always puts on a friendly face, but is also sinister and has such an unstable mind. Anthony Starr deserves some recognition for his performance. The cunning leader of The Boys - Billy Butcher played by Karl Urban, is also another interesting character, he is fueled by personal vengeance against supes most especially Homelander. Throughout the course of the series, we see him, along with the rest of the Boys, achieves his goals of eliminating supes for good. He is vengeful, foul-mouthed, yet charming and has a quirky, off-beat sense of humor but that's all what makes him such a compelling character.

It's a whole different take on the superhero genre. it's dark and twisted, as it is shocking and hilarious.

1323,1323,10.0,19 April 2021,"A few years back I was starting to gain some interest in superheroes. I had just begun to watch Marvel and DC movies. Then one of my friends suggested me aboutThe Boys back when season 1 had just begun. I wasn't very much interested in in Amazon Prime so I thought should give it a try when I get time to do so. And when I got the subscription this was the very first thing I saw.

The Boys is set in a dystopian society where superheroes a something of a cultural identity. Unlike Watchmen where people were shown to have lost their interest and superheroes because of their existence in the real world, people in The Boys absolutely adore the superheroes. They watch the movies, buy their toys, read their books, and do everything with way more passion than we do for superheroes. Homelander is given the same reputation as Superman, and is worshipped like a demigod. The truth, however, is completely different.

Nowadays it has become a trend to show that superheroes are flawed people. They also have many wrong habits and tend to make mistakes. But this show takes it on a completely different level. Superheroes are not interested in in doing their job of serving humanity at all. Rather they are owned by corporations like Vought, who use them for marketing purposes and for selling the dream of becoming a superhero by injecting children with Compound V as kids. And the gullible people do not question this as it has become something of a taboo to speak against these gods who live among us. The only people who dare to speak against them are The Boys, a team of misfits led by Billy Butcher. In the beginning of the show they are able to take out Translucent and use his dead body to taunt Homelander.

Starlight is is one of the members of the seven who actually wants to serve humanity but is tried to be bullied into submission by The Deep, A-Train and Homelander. I really like how all of them get their comeuppance, do I feel a little bad for The Deep. In season 2 he was shown to have been bullied as a kid and that is word changed his personality. This is something which clearly states how false Vought's propaganda about having the happy life of being a superhero is. Homelander is also shown to hate faking his origin story just for the entertainment of the people. A-Train was also a bad guy but helps out in season 2 and can also be excused for being a drug addict.

Season 2 introduced Stormfront, and I really like how they showed her to be the forward thinking member of the The Seven and ultimately her true personality was slowly revealed. Finally she also got what she deserved and everything went back to normal. I am really hoping that season 3 also turns out to be as good as the other two and the series doesn't drag on for no reason other than cash grabbing, because in that case they would just become what they are fighting against.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",a few years back i was starting to gain some interest in superheroes i had just begun to watch marvel and dc movies then one of my friends suggested me aboutthe boys back when season had just begun i wasnt very much interested in in amazon prime so i thought should give it a try when i get time to do so and when i got the subscription this was the very first thing i saw the boys is set in a dystopian society where superheroes a something of a cultural identity unlike watchmen where people were shown to have lost their interest and superheroes because of their existence in the real world people in the boys absolutely adore the superheroes they watch the movies buy their toys read their books and do everything with way more passion than we do for superheroes homelander is given the same reputation as superman and is worshipped like a demigod the truth however is completely different nowadays it has become a trend to show that superheroes are flawed people they also have many wrong habits and tend to make mistakes but this show takes it on a completely different level superheroes are not interested in in doing their job of serving humanity at all rather they are owned by corporations like vought who use them for marketing purposes and for selling the dream of becoming a superhero by injecting children with compound v as kids and the gullible people do not question this as it has become something of a taboo to speak against these gods who live among us the only people who dare to speak against them are the boys a team of misfits led by billy butcher in the beginning of the show they are able to take out translucent and use his dead body to taunt homelander starlight is is one of the members of the seven who actually wants to serve humanity but is tried to be bullied into submission by the deep atrain and homelander i really like how all of them get their comeuppance do i feel a little bad for the deep in season he was shown to have been bullied as a kid and that is word changed his personality this is something which clearly states how false voughts propaganda about having the happy life of being a superhero is homelander is also shown to hate faking his origin story just for the entertainment of the people atrain was also a bad guy but helps out in season and can also be excused for being a drug addict season introduced stormfront and i really like how they showed her to be the forward thinking member of the the seven and ultimately her true personality was slowly revealed finally she also got what she deserved and everything went back to normal i am really hoping that season also turns out to be as good as the other two and the series doesnt drag on for no reason other than cash grabbing because in that case they would just become what they are fighting against,POSITIVE

For instance, it's easier to kill time and fill much of an episode with a useless and irrelevant discussion, than trying to build a solid script that keep us interested from beginning to end.

The first season of the series was quite exciting, even with the stereotype superheroes. Because this season had a reason for everything and everyone driving towards something. The script has crafted with moderate care, characters had a backstory. Superheroes were clearly abusing their position and power and that is why human started to stand up against them.

But the second season was quite opposite because of the sloppy writing. Most of the superheroes became part of good guys. So there was no extreme reason to go against them or their organization. Even after fulfilling their purposes the main characters keep on going doing extreme things.

1337,1337,10.0,4 July 2023,"""The Boys"" is the perfect antidote to the flood of never-ending superhero films and shows. With its biting humor and gritty realism, this Amazon original series offers a refreshing reality check for fans tired of the same old formula.

In a world where superheroes exist, ""The Boys"" dares to ask what would really happen if they were controlled by profit-driven corporations. Say goodbye to the squeaky-clean heroes and hello to a group of self-centered, arrogant, and downright unpleasant characters. It's a delightful departure from the typical superhero tropes.

This series doesn't hold back. From intense violence and nudity to an abundance of colorful language, ""The Boys"" isn't for the faint of heart or the younger audience. But if you're craving a series that turns conventions on their head, this is the one for you.

What sets ""The Boys"" apart is its exceptional cast. Karl Urban's portrayal of Billy Butcher is a standout performance, and Antony Starr delivers a chilling performance as Homelander. The characters are complex and well-developed, making it easy to become invested in their journeys.

With a healthy dose of dark humor and unexpected twists, ""The Boys"" keeps you entertained from start to finish. It's like Watchmen meets Breaking Bad, with a touch of sarcasm and a big middle finger to the Disney superheroes. Amazon has hit a home run with this series, and it's a must-watch for anyone craving a fresh and entertaining take on the superhero genre.

1370,1370,9.0,2 August 2024,"""The Boys"" is a masterclass in deconstructing the superhero genre, delivering a gritty and unapologetic take on what happens when superpowers fall into the wrong hands. The show's exploration of selfishness is compelling and multifaceted, providing a stark contrast to the idealistic portrayals of heroism typically seen in pop culture.

At the heart of ""The Boys"" is a cast of characters driven by their own self-interests. The so-called ""heroes"" of the show, The Seven, are a corrupt and self-serving group whose actions are dictated by their desires for fame, power, and wealth. This selfishness is personified in Homelander, whose terrifying blend of narcissism and megalomania creates a chilling antagonist. His lack of empathy and relentless pursuit of his own agenda underscore the dangers of unchecked power.

The show doesn't shy away from portraying the consequences of this selfishness. The collateral damage caused by these ""heroes"" serves as a brutal reminder of the human cost of their actions. This is juxtaposed with the motivations of the titular Boys, who, while flawed, are united by a desire to bring justice and accountability to the superpowered elite. Even so, their methods and motivations are often tainted by personal vendettas, highlighting the complexity of human nature.

What makes ""The Boys"" particularly engaging is its ability to balance these dark themes with sharp wit and dark humor. The show's satirical take on corporate culture, media manipulation, and celebrity worship adds depth to its critique of selfishness, making it not only a thrilling watch but also a thought-provoking one.

In summary, ""The Boys"" offers a riveting and unflinching look at selfishness in its many forms. It challenges the notion of what it means to be a hero, presenting a world where the lines between good and evil are blurred by personal ambitions and moral compromises. This makes for a show that is as intellectually stimulating as it is entertaining.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",the boys is a masterclass in deconstructing the superhero genre delivering a gritty and unapologetic take on what happens when superpowers fall into the wrong hands the shows exploration of selfishness is compelling and multifaceted providing a stark contrast to the idealistic portrayals of heroism typically seen in pop culture at the heart of the boys is a cast of characters driven by their own selfinterests the socalled heroes of the show the seven are a corrupt and selfserving group whose actions are dictated by their desires for fame power and wealth this selfishness is personified in homelander whose terrifying blend of narcissism and megalomania creates a chilling antagonist his lack of empathy and relentless pursuit of his own agenda underscore the dangers of unchecked power the show doesnt shy away from portraying the consequences of this selfishness the collateral damage caused by these heroes serves as a brutal reminder of the human cost of their actions this is juxtaposed with the motivations of the titular boys who while flawed are united by a desire to bring justice and accountability to the superpowered elite even so their methods and motivations are often tainted by personal vendettas highlighting the complexity of human nature what makes the boys particularly engaging is its ability to balance these dark themes with sharp wit and dark humor the shows satirical take on corporate culture media manipulation and celebrity worship adds depth to its critique of selfishness making it not only a thrilling watch but also a thoughtprovoking one in summary the boys offers a riveting and unflinching look at selfishness in its many forms it challenges the notion of what it means to be a hero presenting a world where the lines between good and evil are blurred by personal ambitions and moral compromises this makes for a show that is as intellectually stimulating as it is entertaining,POSITIVE
1371,1371,10.0,11 August 2019,"Wasted acting talent thanks to awful direction, script, and editing. This show is incredibly cheesy and not in a cute way. I love anti-hero stories such as Deadpool. I enjoy satire like Team America: World Police. But this production is just not enjoyable after giving 2 episodes a try.

While Marvel has the secret sauce for effective superhero movies, The Boys basically takes a big dump on DC and Marvel and takes joy in doing so.

The corporate angle is surprisingly logical and relevant in today's climate. Yes there are some major christian overtones but again, not surprisingly different from a big swathe of the United States.

1386,1386,10.0,6 May 2022,"Having watched the beginning of season 3, I understand the three eps we were given in the first drop--so that fans at least see Jensen Ackles in action a bit.

But I wonder why the press blitz if he's just a traditional guest star as far as screen time (and not an addition to the main cast.)

The character seems pivotal, true, but I feel like Kripke has used a sort of bait & switch advertising, especially including him in this last press junket.

And that he underused a good actor who could have averaged things up a bit.

And of course like most fans, I watched the up & down quality of the first two seasons to prep.

The first season, broad frat style humor which was pretty effective if you like that style. The second, an abrupt course correction, weighted with ""messaging"" that felt false for the sudden change.

Hopefully it gets better, though professional reviewers I read (again in the press blitz--hope you like clicks) thought season 3 was messy.

Given the lack of screen time and the early reviews, I may wait and binge at the end.

1389,1389,10.0,27 July 2019,"First off: If you're expecting a show you can watch with the kids, unless those kids are over 18 this ain't it.

That said, this was a pretty good show. The acting was incredible; these were well-developed characters that when combined with the acting were nicely believable, even with all of the weirdness. These are definitely also pretty examples for what would happen if supers existed in the real world, from the noblesse oblige and pure arrogance of the characters to those that were just amazed that they had powers.

Just because: Homelander was way too much fun. That guy was just pure evil. Maeve was also pretty good, as she could from jaded to sensitive; she was arguably be the best-developed character of the show. The Deep was also pretty good, especially when he was out of his depth (pun intended).

The plot twists were deserved; not only were they hard to predict but they were built up prior to their showing. Sure, there were some predictable points, but that's fine as those were based off character development; they were a natural evolution of the character in question. The real plot twists worked pretty well, up to the dreaded final reveal, although I dislike the end.

The special effects were exactly what were needed. While I would have liked to have seen more use of powers, especially in non-combat roles, overall the effects were pretty good. There's a lot of blood, digital and otherwise, but it works within the context of the show. You just don't expect to see a lot of niceness and that is definitely the case here.

There was some really nice world-building, especially as you were able to see what would happen if supers were real. You had challenges between supers, drugs for supers, and what would happen if supers got into religion. Again, while I would have liked to have seen more non-combat use (such as in construction and medicine) this was done pretty deftly.

The only other major flaw was that The 7 were an obvious pastiche of the Justice League (Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Aquaman, Dr. Light). While this allows it to make some interesting points, none of them haven't been done to death elsewhere. Even Translucent only works to show how dark the world is, and is quickly killed when the point is made.

Nonetheless, this is a pretty good show and definitely recommended. I wish it would have ended differently, but it definitely the way it should have.

1450,1450,8.0,26 July 2024,"Well...it was bound to happen. This season ending, that kept a lot of open plot lines for the last season of this Anti-Heroes masterpiece of a series. It was a sick, disgusting and intensive joyride on one of the most hard-core contents that the small screen can offer his viewers. I couldn't wait for each and every episode and yes...they did it one more time.

It was a season of learning the characters' arc and set them for one word: ""forgiveness"". Each and every one of the characters got her own depth, for the sake of getting a better view of the wider picture. Sometime it went just great and sometime not so much, but the show didn't derail from its course, not even once and got us into the road to our own actual hell.

The Trumpism is getting its head high in this show and you can see that Eric Kripke got his targets ready to ram into Trump's ass. No matter what is your political stand is, you can still understand that what you see in this show might be what, someday, everybody will get, from this side of the other.

The show is still written remarkably and almost flawless, the acting and gore got to all kinds of next levels and this show will always make the maximum efforts to make you sick to your stomach, just to make sure that you are not losing any interest in it, due to the content. It has a lot to say about each one of its characters and also to add some more.

It has The Boys that are leaderless and sometime torn apart between the need to do what's right against doing what they actually want - each and every character get to say something meaningful for several occasions, during several episodes, but they sometime pale...when talking about the gang, which awaits on the other side.

The gang is led by the best villain in any superhero cinematic universe and a villain that seems like he is trying to breaks his own glass ceiling, but manages to stay in his safe place. In this season Homelander is discovering that he is aging, he is hurt from the people who did him wrong when growing and faces two characters that doesn't dance to his tunes, not all the time...and both are doubting him seriously.

All will lead to the final season (and probably to another ""Gen V"" season in between) which pull the curtain on one of the best TV shows that television had to offer for last decade or something from this scale. When the world of superheroes slowly going into oblivion and getting very tired from itself, this is the only show that justifies the remining of superheroes days of glory.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",wellit was bound to happen this season ending that kept a lot of open plot lines for the last season of this antiheroes masterpiece of a series it was a sick disgusting and intensive joyride on one of the most hardcore contents that the small screen can offer his viewers i couldnt wait for each and every episode and yesthey did it one more time it was a season of learning the characters arc and set them for one word forgiveness each and every one of the characters got her own depth for the sake of getting a better view of the wider picture sometime it went just great and sometime not so much but the show didnt derail from its course not even once and got us into the road to our own actual hell the trumpism is getting its head high in this show and you can see that eric kripke got his targets ready to ram into trumps ass no matter what is your political stand is you can still understand that what you see in this show might be what someday everybody will get from this side of the other the show is still written remarkably and almost flawless the acting and gore got to all kinds of next levels and this show will always make the maximum efforts to make you sick to your stomach just to make sure that you are not losing any interest in it due to the content it has a lot to say about each one of its characters and also to add some more it has the boys that are leaderless and sometime torn apart between the need to do whats right against doing what they actually want each and every character get to say something meaningful for several occasions during several episodes but they sometime palewhen talking about the gang which awaits on the other side the gang is led by the best villain in any superhero cinematic universe and a villain that seems like he is trying to breaks his own glass ceiling but manages to stay in his safe place in this season homelander is discovering that he is aging he is hurt from the people who did him wrong when growing and faces two characters that doesnt dance to his tunes not all the timeand both are doubting him seriously all will lead to the final season and probably to another gen v season in between which pull the curtain on one of the best tv shows that television had to offer for last decade or something from this scale when the world of superheroes slowly going into oblivion and getting very tired from itself this is the only show that justifies the remining of superheroes days of glory,POSITIVE

1455,1455,10.0,17 September 2024,"The Boys is a dark and satirical take on the superhero genre that stands out for its subversive approach and gritty storytelling. Set in a world where superheroes are corrupt celebrities controlled by powerful corporations, the series explores themes of power, morality, and vengeance with a raw and unapologetic edge.

Storyline and Characters The plot centers on a group of vigilantes known as ""The Boys,"" led by Billy Butcher, who seek to expose and take down corrupt superheroes who abuse their powers. The series balances intense action with sharp social commentary, presenting a cynical view of heroism and the consequences of unchecked power.

The cast delivers exceptional performances, particularly Karl Urban as the relentless Billy Butcher and Antony Starr as the sinister Homelander. The character development is deep and complex, with each member of the cast bringing unique depth to their roles, whether they are a hero or a villain.

Direction and Production The direction is bold and fearless, with the series pushing boundaries in both its narrative and visuals. The dark humor and graphic content are used effectively to enhance the story's impact and highlight the absurdities of a superhero-centric society. The production values are high, with impressive special effects and well-choreographed action sequences.

Final Thoughts The Boys offers a fresh and provocative take on the superhero genre, combining intense drama, biting satire, and a critical look at fame and power.

1477,1477,10.0,22 September 2020,"Over eight episodes, ""The Boys"" offers plenty of surprises. Some come through unexpected and exaggerated bloodshed - which, considering the regular rollout of graphic violence, it's a credit to the writing and editing teams that so many of these moments are still shocking - while others are rooted in well-orchestrated plot twists. Season 2 gives casual fans plenty of entertainment value, even if the episodes run long, as well as plenty to chew on during the downtime; if you thought Season 1 did a good job twisting Homelander's pristine red, white, and blue image into a knotty mess better fit for our current administration, just wait til you see what he comes to represent this year. Rarely has ""the American way"" been stripped so thoroughly of its historic infallibility, and rarely have those who demand unquestioning loyalty to the flag been so justly put in their place.

Yet an expanded critique doesn't keep ""The Boys"" from stumbling into past mistakes. One of the nagging issues with Season 1 was that both its main characters were given purpose by the untimely deaths of their wives. Hughie and Butcher both lost their partners, and it pushed them to join and form this titular team. While last year's finale made the effort to reverse half of that issue - revealing Becca (Shantel VanSanten) is alive, as is the son she had after Homelander raped her - Season 2 somehow sees more of the same problem. ""Fridging"" is a term that first gained infamy in comic book circles, and its growing notoriety led Kripke to say he wanted to specifically avoid killing off supporting female characters in order to motivate men. To say who, when, or how many times he breaks that intention would be spoiling things, but it's prominent enough to put a cloud over a few razor-sharp feminist speeches.

""The Boys"" is still an imperfect beast, but it gets so many parts right - I haven't even talked about the skilled stunt work or expertly staged action scenes - that you're likely to get caught up in its gorging satire. Performances, moments, and specific lines will sneak up and level you.

It's a shame he isn't the Scottish Hughie but he is there.

The thing is the reviewers who havent read the graphic novels have no idea how the story is brilliantly fu*ked up and definitely changes the idea of what 'superheroes' have been depicted to be. Changing the narrative to self serving, egotistical megalomaniacs with humankind being the last thought on their minds. It gives the 'superheroes' a human touch in relation to the 7 deadly sins.

It's a complete contrast to our modern superhero films in which they are safely digestible and full of light-hearted humor.

So when I say that this season has some of the most disgusting and funny scenes I mean it. I love that the show tackles what people and celebrities would do if they had real superpowers.

That sounds simple enough, but the execution of the series gives us a story worth experiencing, because everything is turned upside down into the absurd.

Yet even if I offended you just now, forget about me, this show is worth the watch. It's visceral, funny, endearing and right on the money. It's also, fair warning, extremely bloody. Yet the gore serves a purpose: making us laugh at loud. The blood is so absurd at times, it just becomes too funny.

Man, did we need this show. And the actors and actresses know it: they play with utter glee, enjoying the fact they are messing with the audiences' heads. Heads that in the show, play quite the prominent and explosive role. In its vileness, it's the breath of fresh air we did not know we wanted.

1504,1504,10.0,26 August 2023,"After each episode in Season 1, I was like that was fine I guess I'll keep watching, but by the end of Season 3, I was hungry for more.

I'm not really into superhero movies and shows, so the only reason I check any of them out is if they promise to be different from all the standard cookie-cutter MCU movies.

The Boys promised something different, something that subverted all the tired tropes. And Season 1 delivered that. It was as advertised.

But just subverting superhero tropes is not enough to keep me engaged. Anticipating something to be different and then seeing that it is different is almost like getting just what you expected, and where is the fun in that? So like I said, I was barely hanging on through Season 1, but the season finale left off in a rather interesting place, so I figured I'd check out Season 2. And here's where things start to get good.

Season 1 spends its time subverting all the superhero tropes and giving you some good laughs and shock from them, while subtly touching on some larger issues. But then Season 2 delves deeper into the stark reality and consequences of those Season 1 issues, so that what first seems like just taking the piss out of superhero tropes, soon becomes something way more complex and layered than merely poking fun at superheroes.

Through Season 2 and 3 the underlying themes take center stage as the story shines a light on something far more terrifying and seemingly more inescapable than evil superheroes. And this is the heart of the show - the reason why it's a must watch. Not because it's a show about superheroes, but because it isn't a show about superheroes at all. It's a show about something else entirely. A very real danger that threatens all of us.

But instead of leaning into the heroism aspect of that movie, or the conflicting morality of what heroes can do vs what they should do, this series pushes the boundaries on social metaphors and asks the question: what if super-powered individuals were morally corrupt test tube experiments? The plot delves deeply into those queries, and embraces the horrific things superhuman people can do when they're not held accountable.

While season one had some good things going for it, there are enough disgusting visuals and plot points to drag it down. I'm a Karl Urban fan, and Quaid is excellent in his role. But the depravity of the ""supers"" is beyond the pale. The Aquaman placeholder is a serial rapist. The Superman wannabe is a serial killer and engages in stuff that no one should have to look at.

I've got a family member that liked this show (at least season one) and even he had to admit that the gross out deaths (that get amped up in season two) and the oppressive sexual perversion stuff was over the top.

It's a sad statement of our times (or at least who rates stuff on this site) how many people rate this a nine or a ten. How can anyone watch this stuff and not feel disgusted? I don't care that it's supposedly drenched in satirical metaphor. It's just gross.

SEASON ONE

In a world where the identities of prominent superheroes are known to the public, with their own marketing teams and PR representatives, behind the scenes many are not as scrupulous and heroic as they portray themselves to be. Homelander (Antony Starr) tries to portray himself as a virtuous Captain America type, but is arrogant and immoral behind the scenes, with more than a few dark skeletons in his closet. The brash A-Train (Jessie T. Usher) is reckless and ends up killing the girlfriend of young Hughie Campbell (Jack Quaid) right after he proposes to her. This sets him on a course for revenge, when he teams up with the gruff Australian Billy Butcher (Karl Urban) who has his own score to settle. Meanwhile, the young, beautiful Annie January/Starlight (Erin Moriarty) becomes disillusioned at the murky world the people she looked up to inhabit.

The superhero craze, which began in the early 00s and shows no signs of letting up, has morphed from something aimed at the pre-teen crowd, to something grown adults have come to have a subversive fondness for, intent on exploring the deep, dark inner turmoil of the tortured heroes, or what they serve as some kind of subliminal metaphor for, blah blah blah...And so we have this part light hearted, part dark and brooding Amazon Prime series, that takes a wildly counter cultural approach to the genre.

Regarding the aforementioned grown adult superhero love in, of all those blamed for this trend, British actor Simon Pegg is one of those whose name most frequently pops up to get the blame, so it's fitting here that he has a supporting role as the unfortunate Hughie's dad. But he's largely forgotten in the background, leaving us with the lead stars to really carry the thing. Starr has charisma and presence as Homelander, matched by Urban's dark, brooding turn as the man who's eventually revealed as his nemesis. Usher is really the token black role as the immoral A-Train, while Moriarty is a quiet revelation as the innocent, unassuming Annie/Starlight, with an alluring beauty that does her no problems.

It's an original and clever idea, that's biggest problem is that it is just never as engaging, effective or funny as it could be. But it's certainly got buckets of potential, and if this series doesn't really blow your socks off, there's loads of hope for Season Two. ***","July 26, 2019 (United States)",star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning season one in a world where the identities of prominent superheroes are known to the public with their own marketing teams and pr representatives behind the scenes many are not as scrupulous and heroic as they portray themselves to be homelander antony starr tries to portray himself as a virtuous captain america type but is arrogant and immoral behind the scenes with more than a few dark skeletons in his closet the brash atrain jessie t usher is reckless and ends up killing the girlfriend of young hughie campbell jack quaid right after he proposes to her this sets him on a course for revenge when he teams up with the gruff australian billy butcher karl urban who has his own score to settle meanwhile the young beautiful annie januarystarlight erin moriarty becomes disillusioned at the murky world the people she looked up to inhabit the superhero craze which began in the early s and shows no signs of letting up has morphed from something aimed at the preteen crowd to something grown adults have come to have a subversive fondness for intent on exploring the deep dark inner turmoil of the tortured heroes or what they serve as some kind of subliminal metaphor for blah blah blahand so we have this part light hearted part dark and brooding amazon prime series that takes a wildly counter cultural approach to the genre regarding the aforementioned grown adult superhero love in of all those blamed for this trend british actor simon pegg is one of those whose name most frequently pops up to get the blame so its fitting here that he has a supporting role as the unfortunate hughies dad but hes largely forgotten in the background leaving us with the lead stars to really carry the thing starr has charisma and presence as homelander matched by urbans dark brooding turn as the man whos eventually revealed as his nemesis usher is really the token black role as the immoral atrain while moriarty is a quiet revelation as the innocent unassuming anniestarlight with an alluring beauty that does her no problems its an original and clever idea thats biggest problem is that it is just never as engaging effective or funny as it could be but its certainly got buckets of potential and if this series doesnt really blow your socks off theres loads of hope for season two,POSITIVE

1531,1531,10.0,20 June 2023,"The Boys is an absolute triumph of a series that shatters the conventions of superhero storytelling, delivering a gritty, exhilarating, and thought-provoking experience like no other. From the very first episode, it hooks you in with its unapologetic blend of dark humor, jaw-dropping action sequences, and deeply complex characters that leave an indelible mark on your psyche.

One of the show's greatest strengths lies in its fearless approach to dismantling the notion of heroes as infallible saviors. The Boys presents us with a world where superheroes are nothing short of narcissistic, corrupt, and power-hungry individuals, carefully manipulating their public image while indulging in immoral activities behind closed doors. This stark contrast between the public facade and the truth behind the capes creates an atmosphere of suspense and constant tension that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats.

The writing for The Boys is a masterclass in subversion. The plot is intricately woven, with each episode building upon the last, leading to a crescendo of shocking revelations and unexpected twists. It fearlessly tackles themes such as corporate greed, media manipulation, and the corrupting influence of power. The moral ambiguity of the characters adds layers of complexity, forcing us to question our own notions of heroism and villainy. It's a testament to the writing team's skill that they can simultaneously make us despise and empathize with these flawed and damaged characters.

The cast of The Boys is an ensemble of phenomenal talent, delivering performances that are both riveting and nuanced. Karl Urban as Billy Butcher is a force to be reckoned with, infusing the character with equal parts charisma and rage. Antony Starr's portrayal of the Superman-inspired Homelander is nothing short of chilling, expertly balancing an air of superiority and deep-seated insecurity. The entire cast, including Erin Moriarty, Jack Quaid, and Chace Crawford, bring their A-game, creating a group of characters that feel authentic and fully realized.

The production values of The Boys are second to none. The action sequences are visceral, intense, and often brutal, showcasing the sheer power of the supes while never shying away from the consequences of their actions. The visual effects are seamless, enhancing the already gripping storytelling and immersing us in this dark and twisted world. The attention to detail in the set designs and costumes further reinforces the show's gritty realism, making it feel like a plausible reflection of our own society.

Moreover, The Boys has an uncanny ability to balance its dark and twisted narrative with moments of genuine emotional depth. It explores the intricacies of relationships, trauma, and the lengths people are willing to go for their ideals. The character arcs are compelling and evolve organically, allowing us to form deep connections with these flawed individuals. It's a testament to the show's emotional resonance that it can tug at our heartstrings even amidst the chaos and carnage.

In conclusion, The Boys is a genre-defying masterpiece that raises the bar for superhero storytelling. Its relentless subversion, impeccable writing, stellar performances, and top-notch production values make it a must-watch for anyone craving a fresh and audacious take on the superhero genre. Brace yourself for a wild, thrilling, and emotionally charged journey that will leave you questioning everything you thought you knew about heroes and villains.

1561,1561,10.0,11 January 2020,"I wanna start by telling anyone that's not seen this to go and watch this now. The boys is amazing in almost every way, but let's start with the negatives. Some of the dialogue is a bit dry, some of the one liners said by the characters fall flat, it's could either be bad writing or poor execution fro, the actor(I doubt it though). Homelander season 2, he wasn't nearly as great in the first season, mainly because stormfront stole his thunder,no pun intended. The first seasons homelander was one of the most menacing and villainous characters ever on tv, it drops a bit in season 2 when people stop being scared of him, he is not as heavily featured as he was in season 1 which I hope they change for season 3. Some parts also get a slight bit repetitive or may seem a bit slow but nothing major. That's it for the negatives. The positives: I don't know how the writers do this but every character in the show feels like a main character, every memeber of the boys and of the seven are in every episode and feel like a key part of the story. The acting is great, Karl Urban in the role of Billy Butcher works so well but come no where near to Antony Starrs performance as homelander. He really completes the character and is the reason he is such a good villain. The story as well is amazing, every character has a backstory and something to add to the plot. The comedy is excellently timed, the action is brutal and enjoyable, the costumes are absurdly bright for a dark show. This show cannot and will not be Beaton by any other. It's incredible!

1562,1562,10.0,30 July 2019,"What would happen if there were super enhanced people, worshiped by the masses they protect, but who are flawed like us all. This series may be more honest in the portrayal of these characters than any written until now. And, if you look deep enough it is almost an inside honest appraisal of actors who are in essence the closest people we have to heroes. But while actors have less evident flaws and keep those things hidden to let their roles and out front deeds make them shine, these super heroes are covering their misdeeds in very similar fashion as written.

This is a refreshing take on popularity and the super hero fad of the time. It is surprising and well written. The effects are very good, as is the acting, and they provide you an insight into the problems and strife that befits the roles they play in a world buying into the mass hero worship.

1564,1564,9.0,30 July 2019,"I just had to create my first review for this amazing series. This is great fun whether you're a huge superhero genre fan, or starting to feel 'franchise fatigue' set in. I'd recommend this to anyone really who likes intelligent, funny, and (very) adult subject matter, even if they would typically avoid caped hero antics.

Some fans of the source material may not like some of the changes to characters and the rearranging of the timeline for certain plot points. I was skeptical after reading the comic and seeing how Preacher was adapted for TV, but I finished this first season thoroughly satisfied and eager for more. The acting, effects, and story-lines are all top notch, with Antony Starr and Karl Urban completely owning their roles. Jack Quaid's character looked like he had been changed the most from the comic, but this turned out to be another non-issue. Another engaging performance and can't wait to see more of him as Hughie and other starring roles!

One of the most common gripes with the Netflix Marvel shows especially was their pacing, and filler episodes. Only 8 episodes for The Boys initially was disappointing, but there are no 'fast forward' scenes in any of the episodes. Everyone involved here hit this one out of the park - we need more content like this.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",i just had to create my first review for this amazing series this is great fun whether youre a huge superhero genre fan or starting to feel franchise fatigue set in id recommend this to anyone really who likes intelligent funny and very adult subject matter even if they would typically avoid caped hero antics some fans of the source material may not like some of the changes to characters and the rearranging of the timeline for certain plot points i was skeptical after reading the comic and seeing how preacher was adapted for tv but i finished this first season thoroughly satisfied and eager for more the acting effects and storylines are all top notch with antony starr and karl urban completely owning their roles jack quaids character looked like he had been changed the most from the comic but this turned out to be another nonissue another engaging performance and cant wait to see more of him as hughie and other starring roles one of the most common gripes with the netflix marvel shows especially was their pacing and filler episodes only episodes for the boys initially was disappointing but there are no fast forward scenes in any of the episodes everyone involved here hit this one out of the park we need more content like this,POSITIVE

1580,1580,10.0,5 April 2021,"Don't get me wrong, I really like this show. I have watched every episode of the first two series and will continue to do so when the third season launches later this year.

So, first the good. Great premise - bunch of superheroes ('soops') grown lazy, complacent and corrupt, policing a version of contemporary America. 'The Boys' of the title are a group of ill-matched vigilantes who seek to expose and generally fight back against the crimes and casual violence wrought by the superheroes.

'The Boys' are led by Billy Butcher played as a screen dominating tough guy by Karl Urban. And yet...and yet...time to address the elephant in the room. It's his accent.

What it is that Mr Urban is essaying here is anybody's guess. I actually watched the first two episodes of season one convinced his character was meant to be Australian. Thereafter, his vocal contortions have taken in South Africa, Zimbabwe, south east London (occasionally) and some notional mid-Atlantic zone normally associated with cheesy radio jocks.

To compound what is a heinous crime against English dialects, the sloppy scriptwriters have even made gross errors with (UK) English vernacular. For example: 'lost your bottle' used in context of the plot to mean losing one's temper actually means losing the courage to do something. Losing your temper would be referred to as 'losing your rag'.

So, Karl Urban is the new holder of the worst 'British accent' in a TV series or film, finally taking away that particular accolade/ stigma from Dick van Dyke in 'Mary Poppins'","July 26, 2019 (United States)",dont get me wrong i really like this show i have watched every episode of the first two series and will continue to do so when the third season launches later this year so first the good great premise bunch of superheroes soops grown lazy complacent and corrupt policing a version of contemporary america the boys of the title are a group of illmatched vigilantes who seek to expose and generally fight back against the crimes and casual violence wrought by the superheroes the boys are led by billy butcher played as a screen dominating tough guy by karl urban and yetand yettime to address the elephant in the room its his accent what it is that mr urban is essaying here is anybodys guess i actually watched the first two episodes of season one convinced his character was meant to be australian thereafter his vocal contortions have taken in south africa zimbabwe south east london occasionally and some notional midatlantic zone normally associated with cheesy radio jocks to compound what is a heinous crime against english dialects the sloppy scriptwriters have even made gross errors with uk english vernacular for example lost your bottle used in context of the plot to mean losing ones temper actually means losing the courage to do something losing your temper would be referred to as losing your rag so karl urban is the new holder of the worst british accent in a tv series or film finally taking away that particular accolade stigma from dick van dyke in mary poppins,POSITIVE

1593,1593,10.0,17 July 2024,"The first season of The Boys was unlike anything you had seen on TV. It was subversive, dark, rebellious and funny. It was Punk. The show's heart was Billy Butcher, ferociously waging a war against The (Super)Man. Power corrupts, the show kept reminding us, as it mercilessly pilloried power misuse, celebrity worship and corporate hypocrisy.

But with every season, the show lost a little of its integrity, originality and freshness even as it chose to drag the story out over a few too many seasons. It felt like they had exhausted all their original ideas in the first season and kept copying them in the subsequent seasons. Only Soldier Boy's backstory and revenge arc had some of the same feel to it.

By its fourth season, The Boys has turned into run-of-the-mill hero vs villain story with little to distinguish itself.

I have some issues with it though. There are some concepts that are very and I mean very overused, like blackmail which actually gets quite boring quite fast and really shows some lack of writing variety and relying way to much on one way to solve problems.

1640,1640,10.0,27 December 2019,"Just finished watching The Season 1. It was totally great and I entirely relished the show. So excited for The Season 2!

First of all, «The Boys» is not just that another «S» series, implying that they're in good faith, all saint and blessed, as it has been a tendency for now. The show's aim is to prove it all wrong - to paint the «S» in a bad light and to reveal who they really are. Sure, they might have some extraordinary and, in fact, tremendous abilities. Nevertheless, having such a «gift» doesn't necessarily mean that the person who's got it, is doing right.

«The Boys» is definitely more focused on human beings, rather than the superheroes - the latter got about 25-30 of total screen time. Meaning that, the show is much more of «a human in the world where there are superheroes», rather than «we have a supe, let's make a story based on them». «The Boys» sheds a new light on, in particular, a superhero (-es) based series, showing it (in) the way you never expect them to behave.

Having said that, «The Boys» is an outstanding title with a cunning plot. It's the new kind of experience of watching a superhero cinema; a bit more realistic, and reasonable, in a way.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",just finished watching the season it was totally great and i entirely relished the show so excited for the season first of all the boys is not just that another s series implying that theyre in good faith all saint and blessed as it has been a tendency for now the shows aim is to prove it all wrong to paint the s in a bad light and to reveal who they really are sure they might have some extraordinary and in fact tremendous abilities nevertheless having such a gift doesnt necessarily mean that the person whos got it is doing right the boys is definitely more focused on human beings rather than the superheroes the latter got about of total screen time meaning that the show is much more of a human in the world where there are superheroes rather than we have a supe lets make a story based on them the boys sheds a new light on in particular a superhero es based series showing it in the way you never expect them to behave having said that the boys is an outstanding title with a cunning plot its the new kind of experience of watching a superhero cinema a bit more realistic and reasonable in a way,POSITIVE
1641,1641,8.0,15 November 2021,"Going into this I knew it would be a subversive take on the superhero genre but that's basically it. I really enjoy fresh takes on such an oversaturated genre, but I typically do not enjoy shows/movies that are very political, so at first I was very unsure about if I would enjoy this show.

Thankfully I was very surprised: the writing, acting, pacing, directing, and subversions of this show never cease to surprise me. When I see Homelander on screen, never knowing if he is about to snap, I am just smiling at how well his actor is pulling off such an effective and hate-able villain. The Boys themselves are all great in their own ways, with realistic flaws. Speaking of realistic, the way this show handles the ideas of trying to take down such a large business and organization is always done so well. There is basically a point in every episode that I would never have expected but it never overstays its welcome. Just an excellent show, shows like this make me happy knowing that there really are some talented people out there that care about the content they are making.

Edit: I just finished season 3 and wow. Amazing! This is one of my favorite shows of all time now, up there with Breaking Bad and some other near perfect shows. Why? I love everything about this show: I am invested in every single character, whether I love them or hate who they are, I always want to see more. The writing is stellar, always throwing in twists but also always staying clever and to the point. The show has amazing pacing, I am never bored watching The Boys.

1670,1670,10.0,11 July 2022,"One of the paramount reasons all Marvel TV shows are not reaching fan expectations has been the enormous success of the irreverent, delightfully deranged ""The Boys"" series on Prime, that has redefined the entire superhero genre for a significant section of OTT audiences. Season 3 rides on the coattails of the fan-favorite characters developed by Seasons 1 & 2 and adds its own sheen by taking the stakes higher, the violence gorier and the tensions between the characters to astronomic levels.

We follow the journey of a vigilante team called the Boys, led by the now cult-favorite ""Billy Butcher"" (played with some aplomb by Karl Urban) as they look to keep a check on the morally bankrupt superhero team knows as ""the Seven"", headlined by the megalomaniacal ""Homelander"". Why Anthony Starr's depiction of this character isn't buried with Emmys and Golden Globes is beyond my understanding, such is the tour de force performance he has churned out season after season, not just in building up one of the most hated antagonists in TV history but also by adding layer upon layer of increasing complexity and moral turpitude to the character arc as the audiences progress deeper into the story.

While staying within its superhero alternate reality, writers Craig Rosenberg, Anslem Richardson, Geoff Aull and co. Subtly drop in relevant political commentary into their narrative, painting scathing critiques of authoritarianism, the rise of neo-fascism and vilification of mainstream media. ""The Boys"" tells us the story of the other, uglier side of superheroes and enhanced humans and is perhaps the best depiction of the quote ""Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely"".

Jensen Ackles is the new face in the cast this season, and makes a strong early impression as the legendary ""Soldier Boy"", the superhero that started it all and a clear parody of ""Captain America"". Without the use of high end CGI and special effects that Marvel has access to, creator Erik Kripke has made a strong performance oriented superhero drama series that is disturbing yet diabolically ingenious and one of the most addictive, engaging and binge-worthy series I have seen on TV in recent times.

When I first started watching this show, I enjoyed it. It was not great, but it was good. Too much ""shock value"" for my taste, but the story lines and arcs were great.

I am on the opposite end of the political undertones of this show, but I am used to this coming from the TV and film industry. I simply disregard it and just follow the stories.

Unfortunately, psychology and psychiatry have both something to say on this subject, you might want to check that one up (or not..).

The general superhero premise is that they are good guys, who help common people and fight off supervillains. Unfortunately, that is not how such people would behave. There would be almost no ""good"" ones because power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.

The Boys is a good and refreshing view of such world. It is much more realistic in nature that usually depicted. In boys superheroes are spoilt, savage and don't care at all about others or human life in general.

The first seasons is amusing and nice to watch. Captivating, even. However, after about half of the season, they have watered down the show. It ends without real conclusion, and is increasingly stupid and illogical towards the end.

Even the superheroes are prostitutes How everything is about ratings and being liked and well-perceived by a shallow public How corporate America is amoral, unprincipled, heartless and soulless The public's indifference to gore and violence to the extreme How much of the world is in love with comic book garbage involving superheroes.

1714,1714,9.0,19 May 2022,"This is a series that seems to take Marvel/DC as a starting point, but then mixes in the heart of Game of Thrones (at that show's height) sly, snarky corruption tropes, and violence. Daring then, but the premise works more often than not.

There's quality acting, writing, satire, emotion, and effects here consistently. It's never less than entertaining, at least going into Season 3 as I write.

Only loses a few points for me with a couple of weird side plot storylines and character niggles (e.g. A certain secondary character's 'church story', in the second season, felt often lightweight, odd and out of place for me); and for perhaps going over the top and outlandish at a few points, as time has gone on.

Yes, we know it's about comic book superheroes, but for me The Boys always works at its best when at gritty, small scale scenarios, rather than trying to ever build up anything to match (and struggle to keep up with) say the MCU's often now boring and redundant, ever expanding, timelines.

If it then maintains the overall quality, and enough small scale centring so far that its excelled on, season 3 is going to be a blast. Along with the Invincible series, Amazon I have to say seems to be leading the way right now with this when it comes to the best superhero themed fare on the screen.

It has superb acting performances by most of the cast. The ones I loved more were Homelander, Queen Maeve and The Female (quite a natural performance)
It sets the mood in a very good and convincing way, but in the process gets many disconnections in terms of storyline, development and plots. That's the weakest part of the show.
It is superhero cheesy and has black comedy, while funny at times and making laugh, that is not enough, because the entire atmosphere of the show is all but funny. It's serious, grim and a little depressing.


What season 1 most of all needed was 2-3 more episodes, increased development and sense of dangerousness. That's not a theatrical show in which actors ""happily"" jump up and down together and die ""randomly"" together. Give it a purpose, a straightforward path and real brilliance.

If it's too late and the second season's already been shot, then, I guess we just have to wait and see if the writers understood the little minuses and worked, hopefully hard on correcting them.

That said, the series is a solid 7.

Without providing spoilers, the series feels that it tries too hard to shock, to be vulgar, and when you realize Seth Rogan is a producer you can begin to understand the thought process. The story of bad people with special abilities who are posing as an analogy for whatever sociopolitical message the producers and writers want to preach isn't even remotely unique. This one has some quality actors who do a good job in their respective roles, but too much of it feels forced and comical. Too much of it is over the top ""shock you"" material. Sure there's some lead in with cutesy innocence that's shattered by brutal vulgarity, but they return to that well too often, and the same methods are used here that are worn out on all series that try to survive the cuts.

1743,1743,9.0,5 November 2020,"This series attracted quite a bit of buzz with both season 1 and then even more so with season 2. I was not passionate about watching a gritty, mature superhero series that capitalized and focused on gore. However, I was wrong because there is a lot of character development and the writers take several risks with its characters.

I am a huge fan of Jack Quaid now. I would even say that he is a better actor than his father, Dennis Quaid. His character Hughie is the heart of the show. He seems to be a constant, the one character that has a moral conscience and desire to truly be good. One of the best attributes of Hughie is his kindness and ability to empathize with several of the characters, including Billy Butcher. Karl Urban plays the rough Billy Butcher who is on a warpath to avenge Supes who have wronged him.

Billy Butcher creates a team named The Boys. Each member has been wronged by a Supe, besides Frenchie who seems to have a certain knack for determining weaknesses of Supes. The focus of the series is Supes vs. The Boys, but using a cloak and dagger structure in the first season. There are no outright conflicts, but continuous spying or reconnaissance throughout the first season.

This is why in season 2, it is surprising to see backstory for certain characters. They even allude to a certain mystery regarding Hughie's mother that will most likely be solved in season 3. The audience does not actually ask questions about the Boys' past or even Supes that belong to the Seven. I inferred incorrectly that Hughie's mother had passed away, so I was shocked when I was wrong. I wonder what other secrets the writers could be hiding.

Season 1 is far more focused on building this new world full of superheroes. A lot of time is spent with Homelander, the leader of the Supes. Most of the superheroes are modeled after heroes from Marvel and DC; Homelander is modeled after Superman. He does not have the same positive qualities of Superman. He is a complete sociopath and mentally deranged. There are very many examples of this throughout both seasons. His teammates, notably Queen Maeve and A-Train, are also explored in season 1. The Deep and Black Noir remain mysteries in season 1, but they are featured more in season 2.

Another surprise is the high mortality rate amongst the characters of the show. The writers are not scared to swiftly kill off characters. Some of the characters they kill off I disagree with. I feel that there could have been a fascinating exploration of character dynamics, it felt like a missed opportunity.

Lastly, there are a couple actors that appear from Timeless and Supernatural. I know this is because of Eric Kripke, but it is nice to see. I do highly recommend the show.

I hope that you watch it and like it!","July 26, 2019 (United States)",this series attracted quite a bit of buzz with both season and then even more so with season i was not passionate about watching a gritty mature superhero series that capitalized and focused on gore however i was wrong because there is a lot of character development and the writers take several risks with its characters i am a huge fan of jack quaid now i would even say that he is a better actor than his father dennis quaid his character hughie is the heart of the show he seems to be a constant the one character that has a moral conscience and desire to truly be good one of the best attributes of hughie is his kindness and ability to empathize with several of the characters including billy butcher karl urban plays the rough billy butcher who is on a warpath to avenge supes who have wronged him billy butcher creates a team named the boys each member has been wronged by a supe besides frenchie who seems to have a certain knack for determining weaknesses of supes the focus of the series is supes vs the boys but using a cloak and dagger structure in the first season there are no outright conflicts but continuous spying or reconnaissance throughout the first season this is why in season it is surprising to see backstory for certain characters they even allude to a certain mystery regarding hughies mother that will most likely be solved in season the audience does not actually ask questions about the boys past or even supes that belong to the seven i inferred incorrectly that hughies mother had passed away so i was shocked when i was wrong i wonder what other secrets the writers could be hiding season is far more focused on building this new world full of superheroes a lot of time is spent with homelander the leader of the supes most of the superheroes are modeled after heroes from marvel and dc homelander is modeled after superman he does not have the same positive qualities of superman he is a complete sociopath and mentally deranged there are very many examples of this throughout both seasons his teammates notably queen maeve and atrain are also explored in season the deep and black noir remain mysteries in season but they are featured more in season another surprise is the high mortality rate amongst the characters of the show the writers are not scared to swiftly kill off characters some of the characters they kill off i disagree with i feel that there could have been a fascinating exploration of character dynamics it felt like a missed opportunity lastly there are a couple actors that appear from timeless and supernatural i know this is because of eric kripke but it is nice to see i do highly recommend the show i am disgusted by the amount of gore depicted so i always had my phone near me so i could look at something else when visually repulsive scenes occurred i suggest you watch the show and recommend it to friends i hope that you watch it and like it,POSITIVE

1766,1766,10.0,11 June 2022,"I haven't read any reviews for this here, but I'm guessing that many of them share my relief that this isn't just another MCU or DC Comics superhero series.

It's about time someone made a superhero show that's not only believable, but has a deeply cynical - and IMO quite accurate - outlook on modern corporate-sponsored life and late-stage capitalist dystopia.

Each of the characters is, in their own way, very relatable and complex. The writers and directors don't seem to be in a rush and yet they manage to cram in so much social/political/economic commentary that you really have to pay attention to catch it all. Quite an accomplishment given that it's also great as a standalone superhero soap opera.

I don't remember a character in any television show or film that I love to hate as much as Homelander. What a prick. And he personifies all that is wrong with our militaristic forays into the world at large along with all the ritualistic jingoisms, propaganda and lies we seemingly must be told in order to continue supporting it despite decades of unmitigated foreign policy failures. I mean really, Homelander is basically Dick Cheney with a cape and superpowers!

The other characters are also very good, despite a few of them taking a while to develop during seasons 1 and 2. To wit, A-Train and The Deep start off a bit shallow, almost placeholders to keep the plot going. But by the end of the 2nd season and 4 episodes into the 3rd, they are fully developed human beings and important parts of the story.

On the corporate side, Vought stands in as the evil mega-company with nefarious and secretive plans for world domination. It's all about money and power (and superpowers, no spoilers here though).

This series meticulously builds a backstory through references both subtle and explicit and by season 3 we've got a fully developed universe, alive and breathing.

Just as good, The Boys is one of the rare exceptions in superhero themed content where great CGI and effects are not over the top or used too frequently. That's not to say they're not awesome because they are. Just the right amount of blood and guts keeps it believable.

You won't have to switch off your brain to enjoy The Boys, quite the contrary. This is the grown-up superhero story for those of us who've become jaded and annoyed at the rampant class inequality and unaccountable powers that be which have totally captured our ""democracy"" for all intents and purposes.

Anyways, very good show, does a good job of having the ""supes"" be the fantasy parralel of people in power, like famous actors, and athletes, who are trappend working under the thimble of huge and wealthy corporations. It basically takes such concepts and applies the narative's to those born with super powers.

Even though it is well written and doesn't stray away from the continuities, there is a main flaw, maybe I'm just being picky, but it's a VERY formulaic series, the motivations, story lines amd plot points are just re-hashed versions of what we've seen over and over again. Sometimes a character might throw a line out there and you can accurately predict where the story will go from there. Or maybe you'll predict it right off the batt. But that's modern screen writing, stick to what works they say.

Still, a great watch amd the gore combined with ""superhoroness"" makes it stand out from a lot of tv and I will certainly be hoping for another season.

On another note, Supernatural is coming to its final season, that makes me well sad.

The boys looks at a scenario where their powers are abused and how they might be taken down by ordinary citizens. And if you think the MCU has made a fortune from that franchise it doesn't take much imagination to envisage the commercial value of a company that controls(as much as they can) a team of the most powerful super heroes. Having powers doesn't make someone a hero by default. The characters have depth and the casting is perfect. Don't let Karl Urbans London accent put you off. Being from London myself it was annoying me a first. But I've always had a gripe with why thry couldn't just use an English actor but he pulls it off and Anthony Starr as Homelander is excellent.

It's no surprise that Marvel has been losing its touch since the end of Phase 3.

With cookie cutter plots and a confusing way forward, I needed a break from it.

I got recommended The Boys by a few friends and decided to dip my foot in the water and watch the first few episodes, a few hours later I found myself getting water and snacks to fly straight into season 2, and the finale of season 3.

Watching these heroes fall apart, making mistakes and being milked for money and ratings. The ""behind the scenes"" feeling this series brought me was perfect and I have never felt this invested into characters that I'm rooting for and against. This realistic approach to ""superheroes"" and what they would really be like in the real world.

Normally, the human characters in superhero films/series are nothing but roadblocks or an attempt to bring these films back to reality. The human characters are well written, have a purpose and you can feel how vulnerable they really are against the likes of Homelander. But they pull through, even barely but the human characters feel realistic and don't feel forced into the narrative. Having their own personal issues and reasons they're fighting these ""heroes"" which brings the audience closer to them.

Overall, The Boys felt like a breath of fresh air compared to most of the cookie cutter superhero films and series being released. Having a narrative where it leaves you wanting more and more, characters that have personality and interests and most importantly, amazing action scenes.

I give The Boys a 9/10.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",no spoilers its no surprise that marvel has been losing its touch since the end of phase with cookie cutter plots and a confusing way forward i needed a break from it i got recommended the boys by a few friends and decided to dip my foot in the water and watch the first few episodes a few hours later i found myself getting water and snacks to fly straight into season and the finale of season watching these heroes fall apart making mistakes and being milked for money and ratings the behind the scenes feeling this series brought me was perfect and i have never felt this invested into characters that im rooting for and against this realistic approach to superheroes and what they would really be like in the real world normally the human characters in superhero filmsseries are nothing but roadblocks or an attempt to bring these films back to reality the human characters are well written have a purpose and you can feel how vulnerable they really are against the likes of homelander but they pull through even barely but the human characters feel realistic and dont feel forced into the narrative having their own personal issues and reasons theyre fighting these heroes which brings the audience closer to them overall the boys felt like a breath of fresh air compared to most of the cookie cutter superhero films and series being released having a narrative where it leaves you wanting more and more characters that have personality and interests and most importantly amazing action scenes i give the boys a,POSITIVE

1791,1791,8.0,11 November 2020,"Season 1 was brilliant in how the story slowly lets the characters unfold in time with the story (there's a sense that something massive is going to happen, something to change course of time as we know it, forever). Season 2 speeds up that pace, which is fine. But it's repetitive in its dramaturgical build-up, and when characters aren't threedimensional it just gets boring. Breaking Bad is an excellent example of a tv-show that needed time to develop the character's story arch, and they deserved it due to world class acting and writing. Hughie's attempt at portraying himself as the centrepiece of the story, the protagonist if you like, the one who battles with the morale aspect of it all, when all we see is just a whimp or a sad pathetic little cunt. The pay-off for watching him walking around making faces for 10 one-hour episodes straight, is not even close to enough considering how outright painful and frustrating it is to see him trying to master complex emotional distress for his character. Having said that, his ending for season 2 makes sense, as does the others, it tails off nicely, saves it by a thread, but there's not much suspense left to play on. Another character that became one-dimensional is Butcher, and the sad lacklustre attempt at trying to give him some depths by introducing his father and the backstory of his brother, why did we even need to know that?? So him hanging out with Hughie would make sense? Yeah sure, but did you really have to spend an entire episode on it?? Juggling around different character archs seemed to be difficult for the writers on season 2. and the show's strengths from the first season; explicit scenes thru blood and gore and sex and shocking fetishes - became the shows cheapshots for the second season. It didn't really have much more to offer. There's a lot complexity with surrounding characters that aren't allowed enough time and space. I honestly got mostly pissed off watching it all unfold as I was so fascinated by the first season. Hearing midway thru season 2 that they're doing a spin-off series to just makes me sick, and dreadding the upcoming spam of content from amazon that is just full of gory cheapshots.

'The Boys' has made the groundbreaking move in the era of superheroes. Remembering all of those villains in DC and Marvel, this series provides us with something more human, which is even more vile than the psycho mind of Joker and company. Here, all deadly sins that are swarming the society corrupt the ones that should be pure and saint. That is a dark side that has not been been shown enough to us and feels so novel.

Intrigues are everywhere and new stories and characters are dropping at you like those fainting fans seeing Superman. The episodes are so pumped up that it makes you angry at creators for only making 8 of them.

The problem I have with this show is the writing is incredibly dull and simplistic. It's also gratuitously crude. I actually feel like this is written to appeal to children with no life experience, but then there are a half dozen scenes in every episode that just make that impossible because of the gratuitous sex and nudity.

So, who are they appealing to, mentally deficient, immature 20-somethings? I guess so, because that's the only group who could possibly continue watching this.

Now, after saying all that, it still doesn't rate a 5 or less. No, it's a good show worth watching.

But, after you realize all of this, you still end up constantly asking yourself why the writers were too stupid to see the truck-sized plot holes they leave in every episode, just because it's a cool story. I mean, I'm a master at suspending disbelief, but this is just too much to ask anyone.

The most important flaw is the lack of bright elements. Continuous dark things are shown to us one after another which drowns us.

The colors are always dark and gloomy, most conversations are full of lies, and hypocrisy, selfishness, spite, hate, greed, and evil are given to us without breath.

1845,1845,1.0,26 December 2022,"Imagine a universe in which Superman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Black Panther, and The Flash were not independent contractors, but corporate employees managed by corrupt executives who are motivated by power and greed. Imagine if what you knew about your favorite superhero was all a facade, and that behind the scenes they were actually a terrible person concerned more about their public image and popularity ratings. Imagine that instead of saving lives they were taking lives. Instead of preventing crimes they were committing crimes. As powerful as they are, could anyone really stop them? ""The Boys"" may be the world's only hope to expose the truth and put an end to this dangerous enterprise once and for all.

This show is without a doubt one of the most interesting, addictive, and brilliant streaming service series to have graced our television screens in years. Mostly because there's nothing else like it; there's no other series it can fairly be compared to. The best way I could describe it would be like if House of Cards starred a corrupt Superman instead of Frank Underwood and he was being investigated by Walter White and Jesse Pinkman from Breaking Bad.

This show has everything: it's exciting, it's dramatic, it's funny, it's full of over-the-top comic-style gore, morally ambiguous complex characters, love, sex, violence, and plot twists for days. It's easy to develop a love-hate relationship with several of these characters. You'll go back and forth between despising them and having empathy for them. The series is thought-provoking to say the least. It invites viewers to not just merely judge a character's actions, but to consider their personal history which motivates them. This isn't intended to excuse the behavior, but rather, it is to simply understand it.

These are not one-dimensional characters that are ALL ""good"" or ALL ""evil"" (with VERY few exceptions); super powers or not they're just people capable of doing good or bad things (on a spectrum, of course). You'll find yourself questioning whether certain characters are innately good or evil, or whether circumstances outside of their control ultimately shaped and influenced the person they became. The multi-faceted ""human"" qualities these characters possess is what makes each episode and season unpredictable as to their outcome.

There is definitely an underlying theme throughout the story which is loneliness. Nearly every character is experiencing it to some degree, and struggle to form and maintain meaningful relationships. Each character has felt betrayed by someone they once trusted and have each suffered a personal loss. This isn't a mindless and meaningless superhero TV show. What it is, is a window into human nature itself and our desire to feel loved, wanted, and accepted by others. That, if we could just take a step back for a minute and look at who we perceive as the enemy, we may find there is more that unites us than divides us.

This is a series filled with complex characters that are actually interesting to watch and see how they develop over time. Their interactions with one another and relationships are also ever-changing. These are just some of the reasons for why The Boys is so compelling as a story and so addictive as a TV series. It's just so well-crafted, acted, and directed that the only bad thing about it is the waiting time between seasons.

1877,1877,10.0,12 December 2022,"EDITED FOR SEASON 4

When I first laid eyes on this show I just thought, ""what an amazing concept and execution"", how would super heroes actually behave in our current society? How come no one has thought of this before?

I am a fan of (some) of the super hero movie / TV show genre, but this is a breath of fresh air and one of the most realistic depictions of how society would actually be if such ""species"" existed.

It got me hooked from the start; it's entertaining, shocking, twisted, great characters and even though it gets a bit graphic / suggestive in many scenes I always felt (up until recently) that it served a higher goal, the shock factor of what these ""people"" are actually capable of doing and of course the analogies to the world we are living specially in the US, right on the spot .

The major villain is outstanding, I don't remember hating so much a character in recent years and also at the same time making the audience actually fear for whatever other character he is interacting with, given how unexpected the series is and how psychotic the character is, there is this amazing tension every time that he appears, amazingly done.

With that being said, I am feeling, having watched all 3 seasons, that the magic of the early ones is fading away... Within the show context for the most part I found that what happens is fairly realistic and based on how they build up and introduce the characters and the super heroes I would have already some expectation based on that and there are many parts throughout the show where it becomes a little bit foggy and questionable how people with no super powers manage to escape such extreme scenarios, I felt there was more than one occasion where the main guys and girls could easily be wiped off yet they magically got away.

And it gets worse in the last season, not only it becomes way more graphic and weird for no good reason but also the last episode had so many nonsense things happening I would even argue that the ultimate goal of the main characters could've easily been achievable based on the events that took place yet they seem to drag it out for another season... It seems to have become slightly more goofy and filled with a lot of actions that seem way of character for a lot of the protagonists. I was ready to give a higher score but I need to wait for the next season to see.

EDIT, SEASON 4 Well, I don't think this was an overall good season, it was okay, it had some good moments but if I had to put it in a few words: this could've been the last season.

Not because of the events that take place but because it was really dragged out. Most of what happens in this season could've happened in 2 or 3 episodes yet after a full 3 seasons they now decide to take their time exploring characters backgrounds, also they continue the trend from the previous season where the violence and the sexual aspects are graphic and explicit just for the sake of it, we get it, heroes are depraved that has been well established there's no need to continue to remind us with unnecessary grotesque scene, it just feels pointless.

The plot seems to have paused, Butcher is sidelined for the entire season, the feeling of these flawed group of people going against the untouchable power to better the world is just not there anymore.

It feels like a generic action movie with some good pop culture references, some nice political jokes and graphic violence.

At least they confirmed the next is the final season so I lowered my score because the show it's on a weird stage, but let's see the final season.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",edited for season when i first laid eyes on this show i just thought what an amazing concept and execution how would super heroes actually behave in our current society how come no one has thought of this before i am a fan of some of the super hero movie tv show genre but this is a breath of fresh air and one of the most realistic depictions of how society would actually be if such species existed it got me hooked from the start its entertaining shocking twisted great characters and even though it gets a bit graphic suggestive in many scenes i always felt up until recently that it served a higher goal the shock factor of what these people are actually capable of doing and of course the analogies to the world we are living specially in the us right on the spot the major villain is outstanding i dont remember hating so much a character in recent years and also at the same time making the audience actually fear for whatever other character he is interacting with given how unexpected the series is and how psychotic the character is there is this amazing tension every time that he appears amazingly done with that being said i am feeling having watched all seasons that the magic of the early ones is fading away within the show context for the most part i found that what happens is fairly realistic and based on how they build up and introduce the characters and the super heroes i would have already some expectation based on that and there are many parts throughout the show where it becomes a little bit foggy and questionable how people with no super powers manage to escape such extreme scenarios i felt there was more than one occasion where the main guys and girls could easily be wiped off yet they magically got away and it gets worse in the last season not only it becomes way more graphic and weird for no good reason but also the last episode had so many nonsense things happening i would even argue that the ultimate goal of the main characters couldve easily been achievable based on the events that took place yet they seem to drag it out for another season it seems to have become slightly more goofy and filled with a lot of actions that seem way of character for a lot of the protagonists i was ready to give a higher score but i need to wait for the next season to see edit season well i dont think this was an overall good season it was okay it had some good moments but if i had to put it in a few words this couldve been the last season not because of the events that take place but because it was really dragged out most of what happens in this season couldve happened in or episodes yet after a full seasons they now decide to take their time exploring characters backgrounds also they continue the trend from the previous season where the violence and the sexual aspects are graphic and explicit just for the sake of it we get it heroes are depraved that has been well established theres no need to continue to remind us with unnecessary grotesque scene it just feels pointless the plot seems to have paused butcher is sidelined for the entire season the feeling of these flawed group of people going against the untouchable power to better the world is just not there anymore it feels like a generic action movie with some good pop culture references some nice political jokes and graphic violence at least they confirmed the next is the final season so i lowered my score because the show its on a weird stage but lets see the final season,NEGATIVE

At some points, ""The Boys"" does succeed to be great. The way Not-Superman is displayed, for example, and the way he is being controlled by humans. The way the superheroes commit ""evil"" actions out of mere carelessness. The CGI is cool, the images are very dark and fit the setting.

But that's about it in terms of atmosphere. Every life-threatening situation for one of the protagonists is accompanied by a ""cool"" (better: goofy) punchline, every action scene ruined by some rock- or pop-music or other juvenile atmosphere-breaking track. Some scenes are meant to be satiric/funny but they just don't work. The result is a very strange patchwork of action, ""satire"" and tragedy, which just does not work for me.

Btw: if they had made it a comedy in the style of the ""hands-scene"" from the beginning, it might very well have worked, too. It is the mix that ruins the experience.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",what if beings with godlike abilities abuse their powers to push dark agendas what if their actions even if virtuous have destructive sideeffects on their environment and worst what if someone succeeds to instrumentalize them what can mere mortal humans do against such injustice the boys is all about this very interesting subject and it starts off with everything a series would need to tell a suspenseful tragic and action packed story with a very original setting at least to cinematv at some points the boys does succeed to be great the way notsuperman is displayed for example and the way he is being controlled by humans the way the superheroes commit evil actions out of mere carelessness the cgi is cool the images are very dark and fit the setting but thats about it in terms of atmosphere every lifethreatening situation for one of the protagonists is accompanied by a cool better goofy punchline every action scene ruined by some rock or popmusic or other juvenile atmospherebreaking track some scenes are meant to be satiricfunny but they just dont work the result is a very strange patchwork of action satire and tragedy which just does not work for me btw if they had made it a comedy in the style of the handsscene from the beginning it might very well have worked too it is the mix that ruins the experience,NEGATIVE

I could see the creator was angry at the comic books industry with his very obvious portrayals of the big IPs and political landscape of the time. But it felt real and whilst the main characters were not good people, they were holding worse people to account and in the end nobody won.

I struggle not to judge this series based on the source material of the same name. I understand that there is a lots of things this story might not want to cover or just can't be shown. However, they have just thrown the source material out storywise now and that I think is a travesty, and smacks of them thinking they can tell a better story. They can't, and thus the story is filled with moments that miss the point or do not give characters their just desserts.

As for the casting, I think they did on the whole a good job apart from Huey. The actor simply can't depict the character, as he simply can't embody what the character was meant to be (Huey was meant to be a Joe everybody - I can't see this with this actor).

Karl Urban is perfect as Billy but he is a great actor so I expected that (his portrayal of Dredd was the same).

1974,1974,9.0,8 December 2022,"Superheroic movies and series are real atractions. They're shot every year in a very big amount. There're prequels, sequels, everything at your preferences and wallet. The plot is as old as time: the battle between superheroes, who are certainly good and superheroes, who are evil or for the peace in the whole world and now we've got the Boys.

I khow the showrunner of this series by another famous series '""Supernatural"", tha was actually ruined after his leaving out this project. He can shoot, write scripts, which are full of unexpecred twists and jokes, choose actors for their roles and skillful people, who can turn any idea into a real sweet candy. Also he can choose a soundtrack and make out of an unknown person a real famous star.

The Boys has got an interesting plot full of blood, well-written dialogues, high-quality special effects and talented actors.

The Boys

The Butcher is very charismatic, ruled by anger and revenge, has real motives. The power of the team.

Hughie. Very uncertain at first, then a real leader of the team, ruled by justice. A conscience and the brain of the team, the canary.

MM. The family-man protecting his family.

The Frenchie. The former junkie with french accent. Kimiko. Frightened at first, willing to hurt everyone around to rescue her relative, than the part of the team, ruled by revenge.

Superheroes:

The Homelander, The real American superhero. The face of America. Hypocritical, ready for everything just for the money and fame. Unscrupulous, can frame his colleagues.

The Mave. Firstly, it seemed that she's a woman-copy of the Homelander, then she showed her other human side, it's really interesting to follow her story.

A-train, a flunkey, don't like him. He is in the team for fame and money and is afraid of losing it.

The Deep. A Flunkey number 2, don't like it. But hilarious and funny.

The Starlight. The most human out of all superheroes, the fighter for justice. The member of a team playing by her own rules, a secret agent. Love her.

The Soldier-boy, Oh, my gosh, I do love Jensen, he showed his other side, the acting (as well all the other cast, no-hate) is realy brilliant, it's super-interesting to look at him after the role of Dean Winchester. He's totally different here.

1997,1997,9.0,12 April 2021,"""The Boys"" is unique, jocular, and most importantly a layered iteration of Superhero storytelling. A rudimentary example of an aptly incorporated satire that rests among the facets of black comedy & unfettered gore!

As a fervent fan of Comicbook movies, I was eager to see what sort of narration this show brings to the table! After witnessing two seasons so far; I can safely say, it is unquestionably a fascinating piece of art.

A Social Satire depicting toxic Celebrity Cultures & unmasking the dual-faced personalities that our so-called 'Idols' inherit. Politics, Religion, Race; pick any contentious subject matter and you would find the obvious trails in here. Looks like the makers knew exactly how to cash in on the relevant issues people talk over nowadays!

This kind of narrative might not appeal to everyone but if you can keep your conscience clear enough; it's quite worthy of your time I figure! Diversified characters and fairly eminent performances from the entire ensemble will help you during those proceedings. Specifically, two prominent names come out in front! Karl Urban as 'Butcher' and Antony Starr as 'Homelander'; two immaculate enactments that do leave a solid impression.

That being said, the Screenplay does suffer from recurrent phases of languor. Moreover a slew of brusque edits worsened the eventual outlook.

Therefore, it appears to be more prolonged than necessary. Albeit I gotta admit: Season one didn't have half the concerns the second one seems to bear!

Nevertheless, I look forward to its continuation!

""Progress is Providence without God. That is, it is a theory that everything has always perpetually gone right by accident. It is a sort of atheistic optimism, based on an everlasting coincidence far more miraculous than a miracle.""

""There are those who hate Christianity and call their hatred an all-embracing love for all religions.""

""The Christian ideal has not been tried and found wanting; it has been found difficult and left untried.""

""These are the days when the Christian is expected to praise every creed except his own.""

""But the new rebel is a skeptic, and will not entirely trust anything. He has no loyalty; therefore he can never be really a revolutionist. And the fact that he doubts everything really gets in his way when he wants to denounce anything. For all denunciation implies a moral doctrine of some kind; and the modern revolutionist doubts not only the institution he denounces, but the doctrine by which he denounces it. . . . As a politician, he will cry out that war is a waste of life, and then, as a philosopher, that all life is waste of time. A Russian pessimist will denounce a policeman for killing a peasant, and then prove by the highest philosophical principles that the peasant ought to have killed himself. . . . The man of this school goes first to a political meeting, where he complains that savages are treated as if they were beasts; then he takes his hat and umbrella and goes on to a scientific meeting, where he proves that they practically are beasts. In short, the modern revolutionist, being an infinite skeptic, is always engaged in undermining his own mines. In his book on politics he attacks men for trampling on morality; in his book on ethics he attacks morality for trampling on men.

2014,2014,10.0,8 August 2019,"I am a movie and TV show buff. I have seen thousands of hours over the last 15 years. Almost everything that has come out. One thing I love about good cinema is its ability to draw you out of the world and put you in a realm of belief. If you have ever read Ann Rice, she does a wonderful job of depicting all the horrors that go bump in the night, especially vampires into a realistic value. This was so well done because it gives you the satisfaction of how this is so extremely likely of what it would be like if ""super heroes"" were real. It plays off the average person's envy of walking with Gods. Raw, diabolical at times, funny at others. It plays with your emotions while also keeping you grounded thinking ""I would totally be like that guy"". The only reason it's not a perfect 10 for me, is because at few points the show is predictable.

2015,2015,9.0,11 November 2019,"Honestly, didn't expect to like this show as much as I did. Binged the entire series over a weekend and rewatched it with my wife.

It's possibly the best superhero show ever. Everything from the acting, writing to the cinematography are just top-notch. No glaring oversights. No sloppy scenes or acting. The writing is tight. Concept is original for a bloated scene and topic.

All of the leads perform really well and sell their roles through their acting. The writers add just enough mystique to keep you guessing and on your feet. The comedy aspect is more of a mature stance in contrast to Marvel's, whom also achieve this well to lighten the mood at times.

I'd even go to say that this shows debut was up there with the likes of Chernobyl.

2016,2016,9.0,5 February 2021,"First season, I don't think anyone (outside of fans of the comic) had any idea who The Boys were or what they were about. I like to watch movies/ tv with as little background knowledge as possible, so I can appreciate the shocks and plot twists as intended.

And Season 1 was full of twists I've not seen in a long time. This was like Heroes (2006-2010), but for a more mature audience. Not afraid to offend, with oft-colourful c-bombs dropped by Butcher and Co on a regular basis, to the extent where we (the audience) are totally de-sensitised to what should be offensive language. Perhaps used more sparingly, they would no doubt have more the desired reaction.

Anyway, solid start. 8/10.

Second season. Oh dear. TV shows (particularly superhero ones) tend to struggle in season 2 - a case of ""Second-Season-Itis"".

It feels like it's being spread out thin. But unlike how the writers' strike affected season 2 of aforementioned Heroes back in 07-08, there's little excuse for poor writing now. I can only presume producers are running out of source material, or trying to stretch the show for another 2 or 3 seasons.

The content in the first 7 episodes could have been packed into 4, but for show pacing. The non-stop action from season one has been replaced with talking - lots and lots of talking - and it's getting kinda boring.

There are still occasional shocks and twists, in fact some are bigger than Season one. But they are too few and far between. To compare, in season one, each chapter felt like they were getting to a point; progress was made in the plot. If you missed an episode, you would maybe struggle to catch up as there's quite a lot packed into each one. Season Two just feels like I'm watching the same episode, just tweaking the formula over and over. Butcher is the same potty-mouthed-tough guy in nearly every scene. There's little character development. MM, Frenchie, even Hughie - who you saw evolve from a softy pushover to being one of The Boys - could be analysed from any episode and you would not think anything major had happened.

On the positives, it's good to see some storylines for the other members of the Seven. It was starting to feel like the Homelander Show. Perhaps that's the point? Meh.

Anyway I give season two a 6.5/10, saved by some great action scenes and some great acting from the new cast members.

There's a great quote from season two, it was something like 'Remember what made you a superhero! Go back to basics!' The Boys need to remember this.

Overall I give it 7.5/10.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",first season i dont think anyone outside of fans of the comic had any idea who the boys were or what they were about i like to watch movies tv with as little background knowledge as possible so i can appreciate the shocks and plot twists as intended and season was full of twists ive not seen in a long time this was like heroes but for a more mature audience not afraid to offend with oftcolourful cbombs dropped by butcher and co on a regular basis to the extent where we the audience are totally desensitised to what should be offensive language perhaps used more sparingly they would no doubt have more the desired reaction anyway solid start second season oh dear tv shows particularly superhero ones tend to struggle in season a case of secondseasonitis it feels like its being spread out thin but unlike how the writers strike affected season of aforementioned heroes back in theres little excuse for poor writing now i can only presume producers are running out of source material or trying to stretch the show for another or seasons the content in the first episodes could have been packed into but for show pacing the nonstop action from season one has been replaced with talking lots and lots of talking and its getting kinda boring there are still occasional shocks and twists in fact some are bigger than season one but they are too few and far between to compare in season one each chapter felt like they were getting to a point progress was made in the plot if you missed an episode you would maybe struggle to catch up as theres quite a lot packed into each one season two just feels like im watching the same episode just tweaking the formula over and over butcher is the same pottymouthedtough guy in nearly every scene theres little character development mm frenchie even hughie who you saw evolve from a softy pushover to being one of the boys could be analysed from any episode and you would not think anything major had happened on the positives its good to see some storylines for the other members of the seven it was starting to feel like the homelander show perhaps thats the point meh anyway i give season two a saved by some great action scenes and some great acting from the new cast members theres a great quote from season two it was something like remember what made you a superhero go back to basics the boys need to remember this overall i give it,NEGATIVE

Dark, gritty and gruesome are just a few words I would use. I think this is a modern, (if they actually existed) super hero TV show.

Most shows are afraid to show things that a lot of us debate in the comic world. I won't spoil anything, but themes like power and corruption, vengeance and greed are all showcased in this brilliantly written show.

Karl Urban is great, along with a great supporting cast. Action is not over the top, which I hope picks up a little more. But the story is really good. I was so bummed when it ended. I wanted more.

My favorite thing about ""The Boys"" is its concept. The idea of a team of super ""heroes"" being owned by a big, multinational conglomerate and a team of regular, superpowerless individuals who are trying to expose them as the monsters they are is a concept I've never seen done in a superhero series.

You have plenty of mainstream superhero films and shows where the ""heroes"" are seen as vigilantes by some, but seen as saviors by others (i.e., Captain America: Civil War, The Dark Knight trilogy, etc.), whereas the Seven, as they're called, are essentially gods to the everyman.

As far as the production quality goes, the cinematography, the effects, and the acting are all top-notch. Karl Urban's performance is a darn good one to say the least, along with Jack Quaid's.

Overall, The Boys is a well done subversion of the superhero genre, and if you haven't seen it yet, definitely check it out if you like the superhero genre.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",as someone who does like watching superherobased shows and films from time to time the boys feels like a breath of fresh air to me at the time of me writing this im just about wrapped up with the first season and it is pretty good my favorite thing about the boys is its concept the idea of a team of super heroes being owned by a big multinational conglomerate and a team of regular superpowerless individuals who are trying to expose them as the monsters they are is a concept ive never seen done in a superhero series you have plenty of mainstream superhero films and shows where the heroes are seen as vigilantes by some but seen as saviors by others ie captain america civil war the dark knight trilogy etc whereas the seven as theyre called are essentially gods to the everyman as far as the production quality goes the cinematography the effects and the acting are all topnotch karl urbans performance is a darn good one to say the least along with jack quaids overall the boys is a well done subversion of the superhero genre and if you havent seen it yet definitely check it out if you like the superhero genre,POSITIVE

The idea isn't new. The comic book industry has flirted with the notion of highly flawed, corruptable superheroes that succumb to their own folie de grandeur, narcissism and egoism with the likes of Watchmen, Zenith and The Ten Seconders to name a few. Eric Kripke has taken Garth Ennis & Darick Robertson's comic book series and fully realised the world that they created. Karl Urban shines here as the brusk, manipulative yet deliciously droll Billy Butcher, while Jack Quaid almost faithfully concieves the nervous & skittish Hughie Campbell. For me though it's Antony Starr's diabolical Homelander that takes centre stage & is a joy to watch, even if he leaves you recoiling in revulsion.

2056,2056,10.0,2 September 2022,"The Boys is really good, it's a outing to your usual marvel superhero movie where the superheroes all tend to the people and no one gets hurt, it gives you a realistic view on what will probably happen if superheroes come to real life.

The characters are all a solid 10/10, they have their distinct personalities and backstory yet they synchronize with the others extremely well, even the villains have their own traits that makes some people want to justify them as being good.

The storyline is a 9.5/10, the reason I'm taking half a point off is because of a little bit of filler content here and there that seems rather pointless, other than that the storyline is perfect, the ""twist"" that The Boys applies to the common superhero genre plays into it's storyline extremely well, I reccomend you watch every second of it.

The writing is another 10/10, each scene where a character is alone or with another character makes you be on the edge of your seat, you don't know if the two characters will talk normally or will kill one another, it compliments the story and doesn't play into cliche interactions that other superhero movie producers make so as to ""add depth"" to said characters.

The atmosphere is 10/10, the music doesn't feel pointless and rather than adding minutes to the episode, it acts as a break from the usual ""tone"" that the show has, each time a character interacts with another one the atmosphere plays into that conversation really well, making you feel immersed into the conversation yourself.

Overall, The Boys is a extremely good show, while it not might suit all audiences (especially because of the gore in it), it is certainly something to add onto your watchlist.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",the boys is really good its a outing to your usual marvel superhero movie where the superheroes all tend to the people and no one gets hurt it gives you a realistic view on what will probably happen if superheroes come to real life the characters are all a solid they have their distinct personalities and backstory yet they synchronize with the others extremely well even the villains have their own traits that makes some people want to justify them as being good the storyline is a the reason im taking half a point off is because of a little bit of filler content here and there that seems rather pointless other than that the storyline is perfect the twist that the boys applies to the common superhero genre plays into its storyline extremely well i reccomend you watch every second of it the writing is another each scene where a character is alone or with another character makes you be on the edge of your seat you dont know if the two characters will talk normally or will kill one another it compliments the story and doesnt play into cliche interactions that other superhero movie producers make so as to add depth to said characters the atmosphere is the music doesnt feel pointless and rather than adding minutes to the episode it acts as a break from the usual tone that the show has each time a character interacts with another one the atmosphere plays into that conversation really well making you feel immersed into the conversation yourself overall the boys is a extremely good show while it not might suit all audiences especially because of the gore in it it is certainly something to add onto your watchlist,POSITIVE
2057,2057,9.0,13 August 2019,"(SEASON 1): The show is great and I loved it. If I have to find some flaws they could be the slow narration that characterizes a few plot points and the lack of a real ending. I know there will be a season 2 but I feel like almost every important plotline is left open, instead I have preferred their conclusions and the tease for the future ones. ""The boys"" is a great show that I'd strongly suggest because of its freshness but also for its compelling story, a fantastic villain and the reflection on some moral subjects. So, go and watch it! Ps: the show is very violent and gory so be aware if that's a problem for you. However I feel like it's a bit over the top, similar to what can be found in the Deadpool's movies but slightly darker.

(SEASON 2): Season 2 of ""The Boys"" is an expansion of the first one. Indeed it has all the ingredients that made the first one such a good show and in almost every aspect this second season is even better. The only thing that this one does probably worse is the cohesiveness of the plot, that in same cases is more dispersive and less balanced.

Yes, there are many references to all known superheroes in this thrilling new series but from a different point of view which makes it different then all the other superheroes stuff. Billy Butcher would say, with strong New Zealand accent; ""They're taking the p*ss"". And that's exactly what makes The Boys so brilliant.

Long story short; superheroes are the new popstars of the world, admired as gods, keeping their social media appearance and their likes higher then Bieber and the Kardashians, while behind the scenes they're a bunch misbehaving rascals. But hey, what would you do if you got superpowers? Can't blame them for blowing off some steam after saving the world day in day out, right? Well, The Boys don't agree.

2084,2084,10.0,28 July 2019,"The boys

Without any doubts this is best superhero TV shows right now. DC and Marvel does not have anything like this. Let's wait what HBO Watchmen will shows us, but for the now - we have a winner. Wildstom ""The Boys"" comic book has seen the world in 2006 and in fall 2012 was ended, with 72 issues total. And thanks God, Amazon has buy right for it screening. Not sure if Netflix would did a better. By compering different shows, as for me, ""The Boys"" very close to Justice League: Injustice. It no not so brutal like it was in DC and doesn't cover questions of what is the cost of justice and power, but the Show has only first season, so I believe if fans like what the saw in July 2019, Amazon will go deeper and will raise shows brutality. Shortly about plot, in the world where superheroes (Supes) are exist, all of them were legalized and all of them are working for Vought International. Transnational company with HQ in US, which: control, assign a missions, build a marketing strategy, commercialized and later known, develop a new Supes, around the world. Most popular heroes and those who bring more money to company are members of The Seven. Old materials Supes, who does not bring money are sent to 2nd leagues of losers. With great power comes a great responsibility but when your heroes are TV superstars with huge salaries and their actions could not be judged by any country and government, they turned into bunch of self-lovers jerks and jack asses. The first thing which you see it's how superhero team, almost recreate in some ways Justice League. Homelander - copy of Superman. Well, more cocky, narcissistic, with pseudo patriotism ideals. Leader of the team. The most powerful of all team members. Absolutely understructable being. Main antagonist.

Queen Maeve - reference to Wonder Woman. Probably best person who see true Homelander intentions. Previously she was in relations with simple woman, then move to Homelander, now alone. Have a problems with alcohol. From time to time trying to act following her heart and the ideals she was grow on. Almost every time when she's trying act right - encounter a resistance in the Homelander face. The Deep - analogue to Aquaman. And maaaaaaaan, writers together with Chace Crawford did an amazing job. That character has a problems with self confident probably because no one is really takes a seriously a guy, whose only power talk with fish. (Reference to Aquman in Robot Chicken ,maybe?) He has a serious issue with sexual life also. Vought knows that a dude is sexual abuser, but trying to cover this fact(spoil the entire 8 episodes). The Deep needs it's own series, because some of his intension are truly good but his actions are so dumb! A train - link to The Flash. The guy with drug-anabolic addiction. Earlier he was ""The fastest man alive"" and this title belongs only to him, but now world full of speedsters. And in order to protect his reputation, well, yes, he is usually on anabolic. Black Noir - you want to believe it is a copy of Batman, but No, It's analogue to Snake Eyes from G.I. Joe. We don't know a lot about him, only that he: never speak, good at martial arts & knives , parkour, ............aaaaand he is great piano player. If Susan ""Sue"" Storm-Richards aka Invisible Girl from Fantastic 4 was a man, he's nickname would be Translucent. One of the famous Seven team members. TV star. Most of the time use his powers to spy on girls in bathroom. Total jerk. Starlight - she is a newbie in the team. Almost at the first day on work she was abused by one of members. She is a light inside the ""The Seven"" darkness. I think her character has something with Supergirl and Stargirl, because she is also young and sometimes naïve, believe in all good, against all bad etc. One of series protagonists. Of corse there is a Vought International - VC president. But lets leave her story. I don't want to open all cards. Now let's go to our heroes aka simple humans. The Boys are team created by Billy Butcher, CIA agent who hates everything related to Supes. There are also: Hughie Campbell, the guy whose girl was killed by A-Train; Frenchie - specialist in bombs, weaponry and spy tech; Mother's Milk - former CIA agent, probably the voice of logic in the team; Kimiko - girl with inhuman ""abilities"", but lack of communication skills, previously was test pet of Vought. The show full of blood&meat, nudity, dirt language and this is exactly what you need from modern Superhero genre shows. It is not completely ""Deadpool"", but it is more combination between DC ""Doom patrol"" & ""Titans"" + Marvel ""Daredevil"". Entire picture of ""The Boys"" not full of grey paint and pain, even the opposite it is colorful and sunny. But behind bright colors of heroes costumes and perfect Hollywood smiles there is always darkness and dirty world of money, unlimited power and politic manipulations.

In other words, its a superhero series that goes deep it what it would really be for us as a society if we really have people with superpowers. How could we control them? How would this superheroes be, if they can do practically anything? Would they really be good guys?

Theres a lot of funny jokes, violence and gore, mixed. So you get that kind of movie-series where something brutal happends but you laught. Some other times, something brutal happends and you feel like crying. The Boys manages really well it dramatic and it funny moments.

The action scenes are in par with the ones of big superheroes movies and the acting is really good.

For me, this series is way better than anything I have seen in Netflix and its on par with some stuff from HBO. If you can, give it a go.

2101,2101,7.0,11 July 2022,"Fourth season has wrapped, with one more fifth being announced as the finale, I'm struggling with this one. Not for the faint of heart, this gritty, realistic, action thriller is extremely violent and features significant amounts of gore. Following a group of powerless humans, the boys, as they take on The Seven, an elite group of corrupt superheroes working under Vought industries, the mock equivalent of Avengers / Super Friends. The scripting is quite good, at least at the beginning, the acting is superb, and the production quality has certainly stayed constant throughout all its seasons so far. Based on a comic of the same name by Garth Ennis, I understand his material takes on some of the darkest, most morbid, and frankly twisted plot lines. This show is no different, especially in its latest two seasons, there were points at which it felt more like I was watching a live action episode of Happy Tree Friends. That amount of gore and adult themes appeals to some, for me it was a bit much, I found this really difficult to binge. Unfortunately also as things went on the writing gets significantly worse, with lines feeling stiff, and constant new characters and backstories being introduced that only go one layer deep, and so much cringe. A big fan of Preacher, Garth Ennis' other well known work, and especially loved the AMC adaptation of that, which I think I had a lot more fun with than this series. At this point, I don't know, I moved its score down one after season three, and I feel like I need to again, but I'll definitely check out the last season whenever that comes around to see how it finishes out.

2111,2111,7.0,22 August 2024,"Since the advent of the internet, I must admit: complaining or defending a movie, TV series, or anything else has become a habit for everyone, and you have to choose whether you want to participate actively or just watch others squabble. This series, like EVERYTHING, has strengths and weaknesses. I've noticed that in ALL TV series, as the seasons progress, certain things become increasingly evident. If a TV series has a characteristic that makes it stand out, that trait will become more extreme over time. Well, ""The Boys"" has several such traits, including: It's irreverent, political, and satirical. Period. There's no point in splitting hairs over the writing, what happens, whether it's believable or logical. But don't get me wrong. It's not that mistakes can't be pointed out... all series have them. The point remains the same: ""The Boys"" is a successful series, and like all successful products, it's full of haters. I particularly enjoyed this season. There's more action, and compared to the previous season, although it takes a few episodes to really ""get going."" After the criticism of the eighth episode of the third season, which some found a bit underwhelming, they decided to make the final episode of this season ""rich"" in events.

As for the ""idiotic"" criticisms directed at the series, I can respond quite easily:""Only the first season was good!"" No. The first season was simply new. Then you just got tired of it.

2150,2150,6.0,20 July 2024,"Another season of The Boys, another year where little changes -- and once it does, it's largely contrived. Still, it remains entertaining, and frankly, as hard as its writing is to defend at this point, I'm almost kind of enamored with how dumb it is -- whether we're talking about the cast photos where everyone is flipping the bird to let us know how ""edgy"" the show is or the current state of its political ""commentary"".

And I get it. I understand perfectly why the satire at this point is so unsubtle that it occasionally makes Dhar Mann look deep: it's to make it obvious enough to chuds that this isn't ""their"" show, even to the extent that it ""makes fun of both sides"" (the show's criticism of performative gestures would often be construed as making fun of the left just as much as the right), that they don't glom onto it the way they did with Homelander and Soldier Boy after Season 3.

Regardless, what you end up with is a pretty dumb season of television but as I said, I was entertained by it, and I'd even go so far as to say that some of the actors are at their absolute best this time around.

Anthony Starr and Karl Urban are sensational, bolstering how perfect the casting is; it's damn near impossible to imagine anyone else in the roles. Less succesful are characters like Hughie (Jack Quaid), seeing as the writers clearly don't know what to do with him anymore; his arc is effectively abandoned halfway through the season and he's put through weird rape scenarios for the remainder of it -- one of which is played for laughs, one of which his beloved Starlight (Erin Moriarty) blames HIM for. (Needless to say, the Starlight-Hughie romance isn't as cute this season.)

But the action is as fun and violent as ever and there is the occasional joke that semi-cleverly lampoons the social media age as it might look in a world where superheroes exist, but it's rare. I've recently learned that Garth Ennis, the author of the original Boys comics, actually loathes superheroes and that there was never a greater point to his writing than ""superheroes sure suck"".

Therefore, I'd advise you to seek out Invincible (also on Amazon Prime) if you want a deconstruction of the Superman story -- wherein the parallels between a world like Krypton and the paradise envisioned by fascists are emphasized -- that has a little bit more to say, yet also says it more quietly than The Boys does with its Stormfronts and QAnon spoofs. Still, if you want musical numbers and disturbing dick jokes, I guess go with The Boys.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",another season of the boys another year where little changes and once it does its largely contrived still it remains entertaining and frankly as hard as its writing is to defend at this point im almost kind of enamored with how dumb it is whether were talking about the cast photos where everyone is flipping the bird to let us know how edgy the show is or the current state of its political commentary and i get it i understand perfectly why the satire at this point is so unsubtle that it occasionally makes dhar mann look deep its to make it obvious enough to chuds that this isnt their show even to the extent that it makes fun of both sides the shows criticism of performative gestures would often be construed as making fun of the left just as much as the right that they dont glom onto it the way they did with homelander and soldier boy after season regardless what you end up with is a pretty dumb season of television but as i said i was entertained by it and id even go so far as to say that some of the actors are at their absolute best this time around anthony starr and karl urban are sensational bolstering how perfect the casting is its damn near impossible to imagine anyone else in the roles less succesful are characters like hughie jack quaid seeing as the writers clearly dont know what to do with him anymore his arc is effectively abandoned halfway through the season and hes put through weird rape scenarios for the remainder of it one of which is played for laughs one of which his beloved starlight erin moriarty blames him for needless to say the starlighthughie romance isnt as cute this season but the action is as fun and violent as ever and there is the occasional joke that semicleverly lampoons the social media age as it might look in a world where superheroes exist but its rare ive recently learned that garth ennis the author of the original boys comics actually loathes superheroes and that there was never a greater point to his writing than superheroes sure suck therefore id advise you to seek out invincible also on amazon prime if you want a deconstruction of the superman story wherein the parallels between a world like krypton and the paradise envisioned by fascists are emphasized that has a little bit more to say yet also says it more quietly than the boys does with its stormfronts and qanon spoofs still if you want musical numbers and disturbing dick jokes i guess go with the boys,POSITIVE

2172,2172,10.0,1 November 2020,"The Boys season 2 is a fantastic continuation of the Amazon Prime show. The whole show is great thanks to the directing, writing and acting. Every actor does so well with their roles. It is very difficult to single out any one performer. My favourites are, 1. Anthony Starr as 'Homelander' who brings something new to this character and makes us feel sorry for him after he massacred seven people just minutes before. 2. Karl Urban as 'Billy Butcher', someone who does his best work in the season finale. 3. Aya Cash as 'Stormfront', the only actor who I am convinced can portray a Nazi as having redeemable qualities. We saw some well needed development for Queen Maeve (Dominique McElligott) and Black Noir (Nathan Mitchell) with more about the latter coming in season 3. The newcomers work really well within the confines of the show. Stormfront, she is brilliant and works well as a foil for Homelander. Another great newcomer is Lamplighter (Shawn Ashmore), he is used to forward the plot but also shows the terrible nature of most of the members of 'The Seven'. 'The Church of the Collective' side plot is very intriguing. Their entire gimmick is trying to get former members of 'The Seven' (A-Train and The Deep), back into the group. They have an interesting relationship with 'Vought International' whilst trying to get the members back in. In an early episode of the season the writers are obviously mocking cringeworthy superhero tropes like the forced feminism scenes, however, in the final episode they bring it back and are able to do the fights themselves and make them feel organic and not embarrassing like the others. The best episodes are, 2:3 ('Over the Hill with the Swords of a Thousand Men'), 2:6 ('The Bloody Doors Off'), 2:7 ('Butcher, Baker, Candlestick Maker') and 2:8 ('What I Know').

2181,2181,5.0,5 March 2022,"Season 1 - 7/10.

This superhero show is a satire to you usual superhero movies. We have a fake superman, a fake the Flash, a fake Aquaman, etc. - so it seems that much inspiration is taken from DC.

The universe plays in a similarly corrupt worlds as the one we live in. The only difference is that they have superheroes, or ""supes"". On screen and in social media, they all seem like awesome righteous people but it quickly turns out that they hide more than one might expect. This is all for show and in reality there is a lot of corruption. Also, where do their powers even come from? The boys know about some of the supes heavy misdeeds and start fighting back.

It was alright. Honestly, I think the show was basically always super boring when the boys were on screen but it was often interesting when the supes were featured. They did a good show highlighting some of the corruption and ridiculing some of the superhero business but the motivation of the superheroes is not that clear. Why do they necessarily want to join the US military? One may argue about more money but the show does not at all show why these supes would need more money. I mean, Homelander is a freak who wears his superman outfit the entire day and his daily highlights is when he gets to have sex with his chef.

Season 2 - 5/10.

Meh, kinda boring. We get some new supes, get deeper into the mess Vought is in and Starlight gets closer to the boys, actually accompanying them occasionally. But man, why the heck is she so darn weak?

There is a focus on Homelander's child and quite a bit more on Homelander's insecurities. They continue to thematize some topics like religion, racism and white supremacy utilizing especially that this is an American series, as the black-white thematic and Christianity are especially prevalent in the US (but of course the same topics exist everywhere else).

But yeah. Meh. I wasn't convinced. Also not sure if some scenes needed to be added. Like the attack from the freak whose power is that he has a super long dick?

2182,2182,8.0,29 July 2019,"This was a great show for a while, and then the Christian-bashing starts. And before anyone assumes I can't look past my own religious affiliations, that's not the only reason I started to dislike parts of the show.

I'd you're looking for action, this really isn't the show for you. It's more of a drama series, and it is an odd mix with the unbelievably graphic violence, which really seems out of place and unnecessary-I really don't think it adds to the story at all. And neither does the graphic nudity. Kind of confused as to why these elements are included in this series.

The majority of the dialogue is in the form of long speeches, which get really boring. In fact, the dialogue between characters is pretty awful. From what I've read, the monologues are mostly lifted from the comic book which is probably why they work, but the rest of the script-writing is pretty terrible.

Production and story line are great, highly enjoyable. But now to my other complaint.

Don't get me wrong, I am a Christian, but I have no problem at all with portraying Christians as hypocritical characters in any show or movie-this is part of the reality of life. Anything from 12 Years a Slave, to A Time to Kill, great films with this kind of subject matter do not bother me in the slightest; even Easy A and other comedic portrayals of Christians, I don't find offensive and I think can be highly entertaining.

But this particular plot line has absolutely nothing to do with the story, and it feels totally out of place. It's inserted for some unknown reason as the main subject of episode 5. And I'm not talking just moderate poking fun, there is incredibly offensive language and subject matter specifically concerning the very core beliefs of Christianity. I mean, we are taking about Jesus here, right? The guy who said ""love your neighbor as yourself."" I wonder if the writers would have done this for any other religion?

2193,2193,10.0,5 February 2021,"With the seemingly endless wave of superhero flicks being churned out every year, The Boys is the critique of the genre I'd been wanting to see since the moment I realised I don't identify with any of them.

I love this show's more cynical, realistic reimagining of what our world would look like with superheroes integrated into it. It takes these beloved, celebrity-status ""supe"" archetypes we see all the time in Marvel movies and portrays a version them where severe corruption goes on behind the scenes. These ""heroes,"" while being forced to maintain a flawless media image, get involved with bribery, manipulation, sexual assault, drugs, political assassinations, and fight not for good, but to protect the interests of a shifty conglomerate. It's interesting to see superheroes using their power the way two-faced politicians might, instead of the usual melodramatic cartoon Hollywood portrayal. Through this approach, The Boys offers a lot of commentary on corporate America as well as the soulless nature of pop culture - its references are very much in date, and it generally comes off as a really socially-aware show.

There are many solid characters, especially the show's main antagonist Homelander, who is easily the most memorable part of the show, Antony Starr giving an outstanding performance. There's some great set and costume design on top of that - I'm not sure if it's intentionally so goofy but I can't get over how hilarious A-Train looks to me.

Some aspects of this show are however flawed in my eyes - there were a few weaker plot-points I wasn't a fan of, with me specifically struggling to get into the second season at first. An ongoing problem for me throughout was the fact it felt way too easy for characters to just break in and out of what would be some of the highest-security places in America. Also, the semi-comical violence in this show gets to a point where it just feels too over the top - when you see multiple bloody CGI flesh explosions in every episode, the shock value wears off pretty quickly.

All in all though this is definitely worth a watch - as someone that evidently isn't a fan of superhero media, The Boys gripped me straight away, and I really enjoyed most of it.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",with the seemingly endless wave of superhero flicks being churned out every year the boys is the critique of the genre id been wanting to see since the moment i realised i dont identify with any of them i love this shows more cynical realistic reimagining of what our world would look like with superheroes integrated into it it takes these beloved celebritystatus supe archetypes we see all the time in marvel movies and portrays a version them where severe corruption goes on behind the scenes these heroes while being forced to maintain a flawless media image get involved with bribery manipulation sexual assault drugs political assassinations and fight not for good but to protect the interests of a shifty conglomerate its interesting to see superheroes using their power the way twofaced politicians might instead of the usual melodramatic cartoon hollywood portrayal through this approach the boys offers a lot of commentary on corporate america as well as the soulless nature of pop culture its references are very much in date and it generally comes off as a really sociallyaware show there are many solid characters especially the shows main antagonist homelander who is easily the most memorable part of the show antony starr giving an outstanding performance theres some great set and costume design on top of that im not sure if its intentionally so goofy but i cant get over how hilarious atrain looks to me some aspects of this show are however flawed in my eyes there were a few weaker plotpoints i wasnt a fan of with me specifically struggling to get into the second season at first an ongoing problem for me throughout was the fact it felt way too easy for characters to just break in and out of what would be some of the highestsecurity places in america also the semicomical violence in this show gets to a point where it just feels too over the top when you see multiple bloody cgi flesh explosions in every episode the shock value wears off pretty quickly all in all though this is definitely worth a watch as someone that evidently isnt a fan of superhero media the boys gripped me straight away and i really enjoyed most of it,POSITIVE

2281,2281,10.0,5 October 2024,"The latest season of The Boys had been a disappointment. Television series, like any other form of art, often reflect the times and environments in which they are created. The creative direction of a show can be influenced by a myriad of factors, including current events, societal shifts, and even the personal experiences of the writers. It's not uncommon for shows to evolve over time, sometimes in ways that may not align with the expectations set by earlier seasons. The challenge for writers is to balance storytelling with messaging, ensuring that the narrative remains compelling and characters stay true to their established arcs. When a show takes a turn that seems to diverge from its original path, it can be jarring for viewers who have invested in the characters and the world they inhabit. It's a delicate dance between staying relevant and maintaining the essence of what originally drew audiences in. Feedback from viewers is crucial as it can help guide creators in understanding the impact of their work and shaping future content. As the landscape of television continues to change, the dialogue between creators and the audience becomes ever more important in crafting stories that resonate and entertain while also, perhaps, prompting reflection. The hope is that subsequent seasons can find a way to address such concerns, striking a balance that satisfies both the narrative ambitions of the creators and the expectations of the audience, and not just vomiting personal ideology on out screen. Writers and showrunners should leave their politics at home and just write good stories.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",the latest season of the boys had been a disappointment television series like any other form of art often reflect the times and environments in which they are created the creative direction of a show can be influenced by a myriad of factors including current events societal shifts and even the personal experiences of the writers its not uncommon for shows to evolve over time sometimes in ways that may not align with the expectations set by earlier seasons the challenge for writers is to balance storytelling with messaging ensuring that the narrative remains compelling and characters stay true to their established arcs when a show takes a turn that seems to diverge from its original path it can be jarring for viewers who have invested in the characters and the world they inhabit its a delicate dance between staying relevant and maintaining the essence of what originally drew audiences in feedback from viewers is crucial as it can help guide creators in understanding the impact of their work and shaping future content as the landscape of television continues to change the dialogue between creators and the audience becomes ever more important in crafting stories that resonate and entertain while also perhaps prompting reflection the hope is that subsequent seasons can find a way to address such concerns striking a balance that satisfies both the narrative ambitions of the creators and the expectations of the audience and not just vomiting personal ideology on out screen writers and showrunners should leave their politics at home and just write good stories,POSITIVE
2282,2282,8.0,26 February 2021,"It took me a couple of days to review this show, because of the impact it had on me. I'm not the biggest fan of really graphic violence and the depiction of it and it can be the reason for me to not watch a show. The Boys has this (sudden) graphic violence in it, but I took it, because the show is really gripping. Ok, maybe a couple of flinches and sideways looking :)

Urban is just fantastic as the main character and carries a lot of the grim energies together with Antony Starr. The latter develops as a really creepy and convincing sociopathic villain. The rest of the cast is well sought out and together they form a great team to portray the story.

The story itself is at some moments not the best told story. There are a couple of jumps and assumptions that the viewer must swallow to follow the storyline, but overall it's well laid out and it develops in a good way. The action, the cgi, the camerawork and the pace are great and keep the viewer very much engaged.

In all honesty... I can see that its tagged under dark comedy, but one could also argue that its just a really dark depiction of a possible universe not too far from our reality. I personally believe in a bright and open future, but if you put on some really dark glasses and let yourself be drowned in hopelessness... than The Boys portrays a really scary future. But in the end, it's a great sci-fi show with a very original twist and I would have rated it higher, if it wasn't for some abrupt moments and twists that didn't feel natural to me.

And, that's coming from someone who was fine with the first and second seasons. There are just far too many scenes in the third season that were too gross, and done only for shock value. It's not necessarily the violence, but the childish nudity/depravity and other really bizarre things that pushed it over the line for me. I probably won't be back for season four unless they dial back the shock factor/depravity quite a bit and go back to just the standard levels of obscene violence.

Like Gotham the serious edge is twisted with the whacky, resulting in enormous entertainment. For me, this is better than the Powers TV series (2015), though a very similar theme, basically because rather than a single fallen hero cop investigating superhero wrongdoings, the superheroes here are opposed by a very rogue, brilliantly resourceful and animated team of imperfect vigilantes. The characters in The Boys are deliciously chosen. It's super stuff, and great credit to the writers, totally engaging from beginning to end (I've only seen season 1), each episode highly satisfying, with characters you can either have great sympathy for or alternatively find reprehensible in the extreme (and many subtle colours between), with fantastic effects and a snappy script. For me, this was as much a classic revelation as was 2019's Brightburn the movie (though not as dark). I am increasingly being thrilled at comic universes coming to light.

I had zero expectations about this show when I started watching it, maybe because I only check it whenever I have free time, so I kind of enjoyed it at times but not much. Also, it doesn't really offer something new to the eyes; the here and there of the story are just copies of other superhero stuff that we see everywhere, so it really came out dry and predictable, and the characters' energy didn't really have any major impact on me at all. But, still, I finished all its seasons...and, as funny as it may sound...I think I'm going to have to watch another one when it comes out anytime soon....

That ending is one heck of a cliffhanger. Season 4 is just insane as hell, and that, I think, is what saved this from all of the boredom that I got in the previous seasons. Likewise, there's not a single episode in this that hasn't blown my mind; everything is just pure madness.

Also, I think the best thing that happened in this season is Sage; she's the highlight, the plot, and the villain, no doubt; and of course, I love some Gen V cameos and can't wait for them to appear again on screen, cause they're literally one of the reasons why I decided to give this show another go, and that is a game changer for me.

2391,2391,10.0,8 August 2022,"The series ""Boys"" is a phenomenon. A peculiar, but a phenomenon. The project interested in its unusual plot: the life of superheroes in modern society without embellishment. And this is an intrigue.

We're all used to comic book heroes. In recent decades, projects with diverse characters have been released one after another, recently almost every month. But all these projects are united by a common narrative concept, in which there are good or bad characters, or something in between. These characters are shown as fighters against evil, adjacent to it or hesitating. But not the heroes they could have been at their worst. ""Boys"" is a narrative without notes, without censorship, with all possible range of emotions and diversity of characters, among which the basest instincts, vices and a lot of negative things prevail. This is what hooked the series. At first. Well, then everything began to rest on the most interesting plots from season to season, where a lot of memorable characters are revealed to us, each of which is an amazing hero in its own way.

The series is sobering. It allows you to look at who people with superpowers could really become in our real world. They are beautiful in public, they are constantly working on creating a beautiful image in the media and social networks, but at the same time each of them is playing their own game, the underside of which ordinary people should not see. After all, then this action is shocking, and popular heroes will open up to their idols from a new side, not at all from the one you want to see them from. But this is what catches the series: the unprecedented intensity of realism, wild situations that occur during the development of the plot and, of course, behind the scenes of superhero confrontations, where each of the supers can be the enemy of the other. And with each season, the picture only improves, the plots become more saturated and interesting, revealing the characters from new sides. It would seem that the usual heroes of the work have already formed an opinion about themselves, but, believe me, they are ready to show something that will excite and make the viewer reconsider their opinion about them.

The production is good. The project is replete with atmospheric scenes, sometimes too violent, but this is one of the chips of the ""Boys"". There is a good black humor, excellent scenario moves, a lot of blood and not only. Special effects are performed at the proper level of a multi-part blockbuster, which is confirmed by the full canvas of the picture and its perception.

Acting is on top. Each character is terribly realistic: from episodic characters to the most important actors. I discovered the masterful play of actor Anthony Starr, who presents to the audience a kind of analogue of the famous Superman named Homelander (Stronghold, Patriot, Fatherland, Homeland - depending on the translation). Possessing almost all the same superpowers, this character is strikingly different from the usual kind Clark Kent. This is a really iconic character that makes you watch yourself with special interest. Starr makes it unforgettable and at the same time so disgustingly interesting. The Homelander is a controversial character. Throughout the series, he shows himself in a way that no one would want to see the true leader of a superhero team. However, this is the whole interest of watching ""Boys"". This is a project that tears up all superhero cliches, it is ready to show a completely different world in which I absolutely would not like to be.

The plot of the series is based on the confrontation of supers (people with superpowers) with a small detachment of their opponents, who believe that supers cross all boundaries and should not exist. But this is not a typical confrontation, where some are good and others are bad. You can't see the familiar world here. This is a fight in which all means are good, where each team has its own semi-groupings, and each hero must keep an eye out so as not to be thrown overboard by his team.

The project raises all the most pressing problems of modern Western society, not disdaining an abundance of violent scenes, arguments on racial, gender, sex topics. It seems that the project skillfully ridicules the stereotypes that have been established in recent years and at the same time carefully bypasses the sharpest corners. But as a spectator, it's damn interesting for me to watch what's happening.

Another important topic that is constantly on the screen is the representation of superheroes in the mass media. The ""boys"" draw a completely realistic picture when they openly show viewers (but not ordinary residents of the presented world) how the images of supers are formed for society, what tools are used for this, how they try to keep supers ""on a short leash"", and what happens if the situation gets out of control. It is a pleasure to watch what is happening.

I would especially like to mention the translation with which I managed to watch this series. This is a Cube-in-a-Cube for the first two seasons and a translation of RedHeadSound for the third. Translation with a mat, it should be noted, but for a project such a presentation of the material is perfectly similar, the vocabulary successfully falls on the original dialogues, everything is always harmonious and to the point.

The ""boys"" are good. A true masterpiece of its kind. This is an opportunity to see an unusual story, to come off to the fullest, to enjoy all the human vices, of which there are many here.

2392,2392,9.0,24 April 2023,"I could not get past the first three episodes. Overall, the show's premise is all about innocent, good, or naive people who are overpowered and victimized by a bunch of very disturbed and privileged individuals publicly viewed as superheroes. It's an understatement to say the characters were unlikable. The actions of these superhero characters with the positions of power that they had were so upsetting I felt that I was being violated just by watching it. They were all either apathetic, sociopathic, or downright repugnant, making it really difficult for me to care about the story as a whole.

Moreover, the show's attempts at dark humor often fell flat and felt forced, coming across as juvenile rather than witty. The female characters, in particular, were poorly written, reduced to little more than sexual objects or plot devices, which was both disappointing and uncomfortable to watch. I mean, look at the title, ""The Boys""...that kinda says a lot about how the female characters would be treated.

The original pitch for this show should have gone straight to the kitchen trash and stay buried under the rotten food.

2397,2397,4.0,8 July 2020,"In an age of endless mediocre superhero films that attempt nothing more than bringing mild entertainment to the masses, The Boys is here to save the day. What would happen in a world where superheroes are treated as celebrities? Where they are the ones with powers and so they call the shots? That's the central premise of this show.

The Boys begins with a bang, grabbing your attention before you even know it. With such an explosive start, you instantly realize this isn't about heroes saving the day, otherwise there would be a lead up to this scene, rather the show takes a different approach. The Heroes, having saved the day, are celebrated. Soon enough their darker side is exposed to us.

And so begins a tale of good and evil and everything in between. One filled with twists and turns and a variety of morally grey characters, as well as some flat out evil ones (I'm looking at you, Homelander). The characters are so well written and their stories are so well told that you will find yourself sympathizing with characters you hated to begin with.

Some of the subject matter can hit close to home. Questions are asked and statements are also made about the world we live in. In a sense, The Boys takes reality and dresses it up in alluring superhero costumes to make us look at the world around is from a new perspective.

I recommend checking this one out whether you hate superhero movies/shows or whether you love them.

The characterization was a bit spotty, they were dead right on some but the others, not so much. For example, I'm not sure they really knew what to do with Queen Maeve, nor with The Deep. I think they wanted him to the Comic Relief of the series, but he didn't come off as that funny.

Season one is genuinely fun. As Amazon demonstrates time and time again, they make amazing live action versions of other people's stories, so long as they don't try to do any writing on their own. The not-so-subtle comparisons between the superhero industry and Hollywood are really on point. Great action, and some serious tension.

Season two felt like a different writing team. Lots of (now past) current events crammed in everywhere, lots of group stereotyping, and generally just a lot less world building and character development. There was some good action and a few twists here and there, but mostly just came across as preachy and dated watching this in late 2021.

Season 3 is more of what we saw in season 2, but worse. The few decent characters are constantly emasculated, and the writers seem to think that gore and sex acts are a fair substitute for humor and tension.

It's an effective action thriller series with goofy exploitation-style gore. Karl Urban is great as Billy Butcher, their variation on the pseudo-hero Manchester Black, and Anthony Starr is fantastic as Homelander, their twist on Superman.

Meg Ryan's son is the heart of the story. He is very charming and charismatic, but sadly cannot act to save his life.

The show gets bogged down by it's simplistic commentary that is presented with an annoying self-importance.

In addition, I think the ""evil Superman"" schtick was kinda cool in 2011, but now can feel tiresome. This is not entirely the show's fault, but the oversaturation of this kind of story in the last decade definitely takes away from the enjoyment.

I wish we had more sincere, heartfelt takes on the Superman archetype, I guess it's not gonna come from the Lex Luthor streaming service. (although The Boys' version of Luthor is still a bad guy, played brilliantly by a sleepwalking Giancarlo Esposito).

2461,2461,10.0,27 August 2019,"The Boys, a new Amazon Prime original is a realistic take on what it would be like to have DC-ish superheros (Supes), in our world. There is Homelander (Superman), Queen Maeve (Wonder Woman), Deep (Aquaman), A-Train (The Flash), Black Noir (Elektra-Batman combo, maybe, kind of an enigma), Starlight (kinda like Static, she can draw electricity to her and use it as a weapon, also very strong), Translucent (invisible and indestructible, with skin harder than diamond). These heros make up The Seven (Justice League) and work for Vought Corp that handles their PR, marketing, legal, and arranges their heroic appearances (they are not supposed to do random vigilantism or leave the country). Vought also contracts out lesser supes to cities like Baltimore and Detroit that are overrun with crime. Vought predicts when and where crime will occur and arranges for the appropriate heros to appear and save the day. They supposedly do this with a sophisticated intelligence gathering and advanced computer algorithms. Supes doing unauthorized (by Vought) crime prevention may be liable for any criminal or civil issues that happen. The exception being Homelander who is so powerful that he can do as he pleases (although other countries have threatened war if he operates there without permission) because the govt is afraid of making him angry. The actor playing Homelander steals the show, plays the character with real depth, and keeps him from being a cheesy gimmick. Unlike DC and Marvel heros, these are fallible people, they make mistakes, they don't always do the right thing, and they might even be perverted at times. They say power corrupts and absolute power... Not everyone loves supes and Karl Urban plays Butcher, a man who has made it his mission to bring down supes and uncover corruption at Vought Corp. To do that he assembles a team with their own colorful names like Mother's Milk, Frenchie, The Female, and then there is Hughie, once a superfan of supes until he and his fiance have a close encounter with A-Train. Butcher and friends call themselves, The Boys, and the story behind that shouldn't be spoiled. The show is fun to watch, well acted, some minor pacing issues, laugh aloud moments, a few head scratchers, a few WTF moments, and the most diabolical scene involving a baby you've seen.

Anti heroes may have been touched upon in the likes of The Watchmen, but I feel this dark comic touch with its doping related undertones set itself a world apart from the others. I wanted to rate this a perfect ten, but I feel it was only let down by its unnecessary casting. Simon Pegg Has literally no place in this series. Anyone could have played his role and I feel it would have been taken more seriously without him. As soon as he put on the awful American accent, I put my head literally in my hands. As well as Butcher and the English/Aussie mash up which I still can't see any reason for. However I did like the randomness of the characterisation and found all of their traits were portrayed perfectly. I mean Deep, and his fishy fascinations were hilarious! Stole the laughs for me. With regard to the plot, there's nothing I can fault. The only downsides are that it started becoming slightly predictable in what should have been an unpredictable plot full of hangers and twists. Hopefully the rest of the series will add marks, and I hope they don't just cash in on the brand and ruin what is bound to be a second series.

Even though the series doesnt exactly follow the comic script the adaptation is superb. The premise of the series is what would happen if superheroes were real people? People with their flaws and merits endowed with terrific powers. You are immersed in a world were corporations are behind these beings, approval ratings matter, and not everything is as simple as superhero comics make it to be.

Writing and dialog is top notch. The series is full of twists and keeps you craving for more after each episode.

Acting is superb. I think Antony Starr as the Highlander is outstanding. He can really instill fear just with some stares and dialogue pieces. Also Karl Urban as Butcher does a wonderful job.

2503,2503,6.0,2 August 2019,"If you haven't read the comic, I can wholeheartedly recommend this to you. Thanks to the novelty of the source material and the right dose of trademark gore and violence it overcomes the already all too obvious weaknesses in it's narrative stucture. Great production values and acting really help at that front.

But.

You can already see them scurrying back to the original material whenever they realize that their own little ideas completely fail to get them anywhere. This may save viewers from more police-academyesque humour and having certain characters save seafood because the actor looks really good in his costume, which would be a good thing.

But since they have no real grip on the material they are throwing out the suprises and twists and turns as if they had an infinite amount of them. By the way: They almost do. But there's already so much of the underlying secrets and backgrounds spoiled and wasted that I would need far more confidence in the writers than I was able to build up when it comes to the next seasons.

They also don't know how to work on those small moments. An example: Having the female being beautiful and girlish for just one second would leave so much more of an impression if it had been a season of her usual getup, not something like 30 minutes of screentime. Once again: With this source material they don't have to be too careful about saving moments like that one.

But they have already written themselves into several corners and will need a far stronger vision on their own if the good first impression is supposed to last longer than one season.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",if you havent read the comic i can wholeheartedly recommend this to you thanks to the novelty of the source material and the right dose of trademark gore and violence it overcomes the already all too obvious weaknesses in its narrative stucture great production values and acting really help at that front but you can already see them scurrying back to the original material whenever they realize that their own little ideas completely fail to get them anywhere this may save viewers from more policeacademyesque humour and having certain characters save seafood because the actor looks really good in his costume which would be a good thing but since they have no real grip on the material they are throwing out the suprises and twists and turns as if they had an infinite amount of them by the way they almost do but theres already so much of the underlying secrets and backgrounds spoiled and wasted that i would need far more confidence in the writers than i was able to build up when it comes to the next seasons they also dont know how to work on those small moments an example having the female being beautiful and girlish for just one second would leave so much more of an impression if it had been a season of her usual getup not something like minutes of screentime once again with this source material they dont have to be too careful about saving moments like that one but they have already written themselves into several corners and will need a far stronger vision on their own if the good first impression is supposed to last longer than one season,NEGATIVE

2506,2506,9.0,15 August 2019,"Lets get some stuff out of the way...

The Verification Principle cannot be verified. ""Only statement that are scientifically provable are true"" is not true because it is not scientifically provable. It's just an idea. It's a self-contradiction idea. Yet this idea is the basis for all your secular BELIEFS. See, what I just did here? It's called LOGIC. You can prove something with logic alone. I just proved your secular epistemology is nonsense. :). Want more logic? It's stupid to demand physical evidence for something that exists beyond the physical boundary of the universe.

The empirical evidence from SETI and Hubble and FERMI says there are no aliens. Yet you people make up all sorts of nonsensical-fundmentalist-unverifiable explanations because you worship Star Trek. They retreated into cyberspace??? Issac Arthur is an ignoramus fundamentalist. All his ""theories"" cannot be proven. Secular people don't follow even their own dogmas.

Is believing in God like believing in fairies or spaghetti monsters? No, God provides the necessary prerequisites for the existence of the universe. Spaghetti monsters do not. Ya, it's called LOGIC.

""All morality is subjective"" is not scientifically verifiable but secular people assert this like a dogma. What about miracles? Well, these are one time (anomalous) events. Hence they are not repeatable by definition. Hence, to demand repetition (scientific verification) is nonsensical. Why do I need to say this? Because secular ignoramuses reject common sense. Eyewitnesses are a form of proof. You believe more where there are more witnesses and NOT AT ALL when there are NO witnesses. There are no witnesses for flying spaghetti monsters; so don't believe it. There were ten thousands witnesses for the miracle- of-the-sun at Fatima. Google it if you don't believe it.

2519,2519,10.0,30 September 2020,"The comic book for being so popular was really disjointed, hard to follow and about half the time mind-numbingly boring. Snapping between timelines without letting the readers know what was happening, keeping 'secrets' that all the characters knew about but the readers didn't. Basically a lot of cheap ploys to seem edgy and hide that the thousands of pages it ran was mostly padding to hide the fact the writer didn't have a coherent story when it started. Overall the comic was around a 4. Invincible was way better and even managed an HEA, pretty good for a 'realistic' superhero book. Why it hasn't gotten a show and something much lower in quality has is a mystery to me.

The series treats the audience with a tiny bit more respect. Though bashing on Christianity (admitted, it was in the comic too - but then again Stormfront was a guy and they changed that) is getting old at this point. Seems kind of cowardly since the studios know that Christians aren't going to show up at their offices and start murdering everyone when they are offended, unlike followers of the religion that must not be offended even though they account for almost all religious terror attacks. Or atheists for that matter. How about showing a more realistic event, like some atheist neck beard fedora wearer shooting up a church because it's cool to hate on Christians like they do on TV and in the comics.

Other than their slavish virtue signaling to current social hot button issues, things go boom often enough to entertain. The story flows way better than the comic and the acting is quality.

2536,2536,10.0,3 December 2019,"""The Boys"" is one of the most amazing superhero shows right now. It has all the gore (and more) of Deadpool but all the social commentary of the modern world. I enter the show with a strange premise; I thought this show was about a group who stop corrupt superheroes. But it's actually vastly different. ""The Boys"" is essentially about a world where ""Vought"" manages to make superheroes as rentable as they can be.

Our leading characters are a group that we will see unit forces to discover the dirty secrets and some evidence of the dark side of the most beloved superheroes of this universe, ""The Sevens.""

This adventure is full of social commentary as I already said. You can compare the corrupt world of superheroes with many different aspects of our world. From politics, corporations, religion and show business, this show is a critic of our world, the way some people or companies try to maintain a clean image even though they make grave mistakes and sometimes they are as***les. This show succeeds with his social commentary.

I'm so glad that I've found a TV show that's funny, entertaining yet very grown up, in being that it's definitely not for kids; the content is so centred on current and past events that it's quite remarkable how they're able to stay farely true to the comics, whilst at the same time creating some thing completely fresh and new.

2560,2560,9.0,1 August 2019,"The growth of the comic book super hero genre in movies today is spectacularly fecund. Marvel seems to be the biggest box office draw in the last 10 years. I hate to say this but it is part of the dumbing down of America; where once juvenile past-times and B movie drive-in and late night TV diversions are A list tickets these days. So, in that eruption of mega corporation mass marketing, a smaller ""counter-culture"" of movies and shows mocking and satirizing the genre. Ironically they are usually based on graphic novels like this one and Happy. And like Happy, this one is ultra violent and devoid of any really likeable or heroic characters. But this one ratchets the cynicism and violence up one more notch. For instance, the main super-""hero"", Homelander, is Super Man meets Captain America all star white guy stereotype. To top it off, he is an ordained minister. Of course, he is an utter evil and depraved man, the worst of the lot. The soups, as they are called, are run by a corporation called Vought, where the cynical jaded head of it, Madelyn Stillwell, played by Elisabeth Shue, manipulates and protects her screwed up heroes. The corporation is all about money and publicity and turn every super-hero mission into social media click-bait event. The corporation also wants to get into the Pentagon defense complex. Then enter Hughie Campbell, Dennis Quaid's son Jack, a computer service tech. He was talking to his girlfriend on the street when she got gorily and horrifically splattered by a soup called A-Train who is their Flash counterpart. Not only was that over the top violent, but it suggests that running people down is a regular item for A Train, since he seems unable to dodge obstacles in his way. Come on, that is a really stupid way to get about. Well, poor Hughie was jerked around by Vought's lawyers and let down by his amiable but weak dad. So enter Billy Butcher, aka Karl Urban, a fast talking con-man come vigilante who knows what conniving scum Vought's soups are. So he convinces Hughie to go along with a plan to bug Vought's inner sanctum. Then another brutish soup, Translucent, gets wind of this and follows Hughie back to his shop to beat and try to pump info out of our hapless Hughie. But Butcher returns in the nick of time to save Hughie from this warped soup and the two, with the aid of another comic book sort called Frenchie, imprisons then eventually ends up killing Translucent. From then on, we were exposed to one nasty brutish violent incident and gun fight after another, interspersed with scenes of ruthless corporate behavior and horrific sex. Such as where a female soup called Popclaw, a Wolverine knock off, sits on then crushes a hapless guy's head after she enticed him in her bedroom for sex. Then we have a #metoo subplot, there's the sleazy soup The Deep, an Aquaman imitation, coerced a new pretty female soup Starlight aka Annie January, for some sex. Ironically the Deep was one of the less evil soups and Starlight was a virtual goddess of a classic superhero and a small town conservative Christian woman to boot. Then the Deep has a bestiality streak with a dolphin, which is cheezy enough. But he kidnaps the dolphin and when he wrecks the van, the poor dolphin gets graphically squished by an 18 wheeler.

This show just loves trashing everything from religion to even motherhood, where Vought gets mothers to be to take a drug that causes their infants to be soups. The cynicism, like the extreme violence and sex it promotes, is plain ugly. The indie movie ""Super"" was a good take off on super heroes w/o the extremes of this. But it is addicting and Amazon's high budget and packaging makes it easy to binge watch. It also has the malignant Seth Rogen as its producer.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",the growth of the comic book super hero genre in movies today is spectacularly fecund marvel seems to be the biggest box office draw in the last years i hate to say this but it is part of the dumbing down of america where once juvenile pasttimes and b movie drivein and late night tv diversions are a list tickets these days so in that eruption of mega corporation mass marketing a smaller counterculture of movies and shows mocking and satirizing the genre ironically they are usually based on graphic novels like this one and happy and like happy this one is ultra violent and devoid of any really likeable or heroic characters but this one ratchets the cynicism and violence up one more notch for instance the main superhero homelander is super man meets captain america all star white guy stereotype to top it off he is an ordained minister of course he is an utter evil and depraved man the worst of the lot the soups as they are called are run by a corporation called vought where the cynical jaded head of it madelyn stillwell played by elisabeth shue manipulates and protects her screwed up heroes the corporation is all about money and publicity and turn every superhero mission into social media clickbait event the corporation also wants to get into the pentagon defense complex then enter hughie campbell dennis quaids son jack a computer service tech he was talking to his girlfriend on the street when she got gorily and horrifically splattered by a soup called atrain who is their flash counterpart not only was that over the top violent but it suggests that running people down is a regular item for a train since he seems unable to dodge obstacles in his way come on that is a really stupid way to get about well poor hughie was jerked around by voughts lawyers and let down by his amiable but weak dad so enter billy butcher aka karl urban a fast talking conman come vigilante who knows what conniving scum voughts soups are so he convinces hughie to go along with a plan to bug voughts inner sanctum then another brutish soup translucent gets wind of this and follows hughie back to his shop to beat and try to pump info out of our hapless hughie but butcher returns in the nick of time to save hughie from this warped soup and the two with the aid of another comic book sort called frenchie imprisons then eventually ends up killing translucent from then on we were exposed to one nasty brutish violent incident and gun fight after another interspersed with scenes of ruthless corporate behavior and horrific sex such as where a female soup called popclaw a wolverine knock off sits on then crushes a hapless guys head after she enticed him in her bedroom for sex then we have a metoo subplot theres the sleazy soup the deep an aquaman imitation coerced a new pretty female soup starlight aka annie january for some sex ironically the deep was one of the less evil soups and starlight was a virtual goddess of a classic superhero and a small town conservative christian woman to boot then the deep has a bestiality streak with a dolphin which is cheezy enough but he kidnaps the dolphin and when he wrecks the van the poor dolphin gets graphically squished by an wheeler this show just loves trashing everything from religion to even motherhood where vought gets mothers to be to take a drug that causes their infants to be soups the cynicism like the extreme violence and sex it promotes is plain ugly the indie movie super was a good take off on super heroes wo the extremes of this but it is addicting and amazons high budget and packaging makes it easy to binge watch it also has the malignant seth rogen as its producer,NEGATIVE

2591,2591,9.0,6 September 2022,"The boys caught me at an age where I had grown up with the marvel universe, starting at ten watching iron man on DVD as it had come out.

The Boys and it's universe address a fact that Myself and a lot of other's think to be true. That a superheroes powers would be independent of their own personal beleif's and agendas. Few are good and decent folks, most are power and attention hungry monsters, seeing 'baseline' humans little more than invaluable meatsacks.

2597,2597,10.0,2 September 2019,"Just when you think you're done with the superhero fatigue, a show like The Boys gives you hope. Which is ironic, because nothing about this story screams hope.

The Boys explores the introduction of super-powered individuals with much darker themes (like we don't have enough of those also). By focussing on the influence of social media and the marketable image of a 'hero', this series remains very grounded. It poses the real question of - How would the world look at superheroes today, and then dives into a very well thought-out reponse.

With no surprise, corporations begin trademarking Supers as their own product, carefully crafting their backstories, choosing their marketable demographics, using them for product endorsements and scripting out crimes for them to stop. Its House of Lies meets Watchmen.

The cinematography is stunning; there are some beautifully shot scenes. The characters are well-written,and quite funny. I also like how no one in this show, except Karl Urban, is famous in the US. So we're seeing relatively unknown actors, who do a good job with what they're given.

Its such a meta-relevant series for 2019; I think about how Tom Holland is basically now a multi-billion dollar property, being fought over by two megalomanic corporations,as easily something that the Boys can get into in future seasons. This series does a good job of blending comic book mythology with real world consumerism. Its a good example of how vast the comic lore expands into, how you dont always need a ""world-ending threat"" storyline, and how small scope think pieces actually hit the mark better.

2609,2609,7.0,6 August 2022,"My score is an average for what I would give each season Season 1= 8 Seasons 2 & 3 =7 Season 4 =- 10

Tl:dr: Season s1-3 america is the backdrop for a more interesting than real life, fantastical story. Season 4 the very concept of storytelling has been abandoned, events from seasons 1-3 are either rendered irrelevant or retconned and a world with a psychotic superman clone becomes a barely present backdrop and yank politics, that are relevant to less than 4% of the population are the sole focus.

I can summarize how objectively bad 4 is by covering 2 points

1: Neglecting over 7,000,000,000 people The show started as a story where there are super powered beings but they aren't the boy scout, incorruptible characters they are in most stories and a group of mostly ""normal"" people get caught up in the carnage that said deeply flawed but above the law beings create. However season 4 throws all of that out the window and instead becomes a soap box for the multimillionaire writer to pat himself on the back for ""saving the world"" because he arrogantly leans into his very clear bias and bastardizes the show turning it into nothing more than a platform for him to stroke his self-righteous ego and preach about matters he, as a multi millionaire, has zero comprehension of. This is objectively moronic because as I said above, there are over 7 billion people on this planet who are not easy living, upper middle class yanks, we do not care about yank politics, we have zero interest in spoilt rich people in-fighting, however season 4 only caters to 1 side of the coin, for 1 demographic in 1 country. The mass appeal that made the show an overnight success has entirely been removed, are you a well paid, ""gen z"", white yank? If the answer is no then nothing, literally nothing about season 4 will offer you any iota of escapism or entertainment. Sure homelander has always been an antagonist who wears a yank flag but he was the character, now the political beliefs of one easy living, out of touch writer is the character and the boys and the seven alike are just vehicles for his arrogance.

2: Nothing happens At the time of writing this 6 out of 8 episodes have aired and literally nothing has happened. The season has no over-arching plot, there has been no world building, no character development, no progress made from ""the boys"" collective, obviously I can't yet speak for episodes 7 and 8 but as of right now it is safe to say that someone could skip episodes 1-6, jump in at episode 7 and not be lost or confused. The screen time has been utterly wasted on moronic things, 1 spoiler free example is a character materializing out of the ether who we know nothing about, have zero reason to care for, yet we are supposed to believe that they have a real ""relationship"" with a recurring character and the best part about this forced character? It undoes build up that has happened throughout the previous seasons and is then dropped, so even if you are ok with chunks of screen time being wasted by a character you don't know, who has zero connection to the story, even then this is objectively handled poorly because nothing comes from it and then just as unceremoniously as it started it again fades back into the irrelevant ether it came from.

Another irrefutable example of sheer unbridled idiocy is that the above example happens not once but twice, in a season where there is no story whatsoever we get 2 different ""B storylines"" where characters are just plucked from oblivion, forced onto the screen, forced into ""relationships"" with the main cast, serving no purpose whatsoever other than padding the runtime and then just vanishes. Do you watch the boys to see homelander and butcher face off? How about seeing how starlight and hughies relationship evolves?

2611,2611,7.0,27 July 2019,"First of all, I read rhe comic years ago and I am very fond of it. Once a year I give it a re-read, while laughing out loud.

For the ones who loved the comic and are a bit with 'angst': The main difference is that there's less violence and sex in this tv show then in the comic series. And that's a bit of a shame when your adapting an 'Off the hook,very explicit adult (satyric) comic'.

The story's been simplified a bit and is alright to follow (roughly the same, and I expect that they want to make a lot of seasons of it)..

The good news is that they did capture the tone of the comic, and that rhe casting is TOP NOTCH!! Billy the butcher is spot on with these English punchlines, crazy Frenchie, MM is a big bloke with a good heart, Annie the naive Starlight, and the female is very wel cast. The homelander is as obnoxious as in the comic..

Although I didn't like preacher, 'The boys' is quiet allright for a geek like me 😉..and it's defintly enjoyable.

2616,2616,2.0,23 January 2020,"Heroes are amongst us, but they're not exactly like you expect them to be.

This is the incipt of The Boys in broad terms: a world where most heroes with incredible powers are employed by a powerful corporation called Vought which both manages them and gains lots of money and fame from their ""brands"" (movies, merchandise, advertisements and so on). In this strange yet potentially realistic setting comes the story of Hughie, a normal boy with a normal life who suffers a tragic loss by a superhero's ""accident"" and decides, when approached by an odd guy named Butcher who asks for his help, to try and bring down the great facade of heroism and perfection which surrounds Vought and its employed heroes.

The plot is what really strikes you during the view. It is strong, mature, yet sometimes hilarious, violent and convincing enough to leave you with the impression that this is what would happen if superheroes really existed.

The cast is good but not great: Karl Urban and Erin Moriarty give away a compelling acting whereas I'm not really sure I deeply liked Jack Quaid's performance and being he the main character that stung a little.

After it is released in its entirety, the cliff-hangers will lose their value, and the audience will be confused as to why each episode lasts 50 minutes, when skipping to the last 10 minutes of each episode provides all the relevant content in the most efficient way.

People lack uniqueness, the social media situation is out of control, information and knowledge have little to none value, and most movies have a number in the title.

2648,2648,7.0,13 November 2019,"*Review for season 1* When Garth Ennis said that The Boys would ""out-Preacher Preacher""... well, he was right. Maybe not in quality, but The Boys sure was a sick series, amazing and crazy also. The Boys was a different (but not that original) take on superheroes, presenting them as a bunch of psychos ('cause Ennins hates them), with an underground CIA team ready to take them off the map if they cross the line. The series managed to be horrifying and hilarious at the same time, developing a great history through it's almost 100 issues; and for me, a must read to all comic book readers. So I was quite amazed when this TV adaptation was announced because the trailer was pretty bad, and certainlly they wouldn't be able to be really faithful to the source material (because of the dark nature of it). Well, I certainlly was right... but also wrong. No, this is not a faithful adaptation, maybe not even a good one. One thing the show mantains is the name, but not that much else. The characters are different for the better (Hughie, the Female, the Deep, A-Train) and unfortunately also for the worst (Stillwell, Butcher, Homelander, MM, Frenchie, Queen Maeve...), with some of them being totally erased (the Legend, Terror, Jack From Jupiter). Not blaming the actors, all did a great job (especially Karl Urban and Antony Starr), but most of the characters were great from the start, so why change them that much? Maybe because this shows differs totally story wise from the comics. Now, I admire the risk of taking a different path, and so far this 1st season the history is great, but man, how tf they're going to continue it? They closed all the doors they could take if they followed the comic arcs, I think none of them will be used in the 2nd season (as almost none were used in this one), so i'm really worried for how the show is going to continue. I'd also like to mention how this show is lacking some blls. One of the hallmarks of the comic was the extreme violence. The show has some, but not really that much. Some people may say is better because the violence is the comic was pure shock-value... well that's true, but it was also used for a bigger impact in you, and for making you laught. The characterisic sick humour of the comic is also totally gone, maybe laughed 3 or 4 times, could they change that? Don't let my complaints intimidate you, this show is quite great. The timing for this to be released is perfect, considering we're living in a time were superheroe movies are the most successful and 90% of them suck, this show is a breath of fresh air, just as the comic was back in the day.

The good guys are the worst guys and there's no such thing as a straight line from point A to point B. This show definitely is NOT for everyone. In fact, the more warped your sensibilities are, the more fun you'll have. There are a few things in season three that become a bit cringe (it wouldn't be a Hollywood production without a little bit of ""THE MESSAGE""), but they pass and the story's back on track. It's great to see this show's a hot because Carl Urban is too great an actor to be riding the pine. Every second he's on screen is electric, and his chemistry with Hughie Campbell (played by Jack Quaid), his polar opposite, is great.

The whole ""superheroes but edgy"" genre is getting a little stale in 2024, but The Boys is enjoyable enough to continue on despite this, mostly due to the absolute joy that is seeing Karl Urban (Billy Butcher), Antony Starr (Homelander), Jensen Ackles (Soldier Boy) and Giancarlo Esposito (Stan Edgar) chew up Kripke's dialogue. Fine cinema this is not, but it's enjoyable. It's violent and crude without being solely shock jock tripe.

Where The Boys stumbles is the direct, on the nose parallels between Homelander and his fans/allies and the Trump presidential campaign of 2016, which was already getting stale in 2019 when season 1 hit Prime. The references would be obvious to anyone and Kripke himself has said Homelander is supposed to be a Trump figure. It is the year of our lord 2024 (2023 when season 3 debuted) and Kripke is leaning even further into the Trump/Homelander thing. Idk about you but I 1) watch TV to escape reality, not be reminded of the political circus of the modern era and 2) am sick and tired of hearing about Trump.

Unfortunately she is the highlight of the cast, and that to me is the weak point. The rest, except of Dominique McElligott, and a couple of others in B roles is disappointing to me.

SEASON 2 WOW! I just don't understand why it's so BAD. It felt like overwriting or trying to push too hard. They lost the chemistry between the main characters that made us keep watching season one.

Then the one girl Kimiko can be completely ruthless but then does nothing to help her bro. I was super lost in that episode. They drag on some of dumbest things but make the good parts very few. Homelander doesn't ever let anyone bully him.... and then everyone is bullying him.

All the super heros are super push overs and are always broke... so weird as all they talk about is money and ratings and add the social media garbage into it.

""The Boys"" was a show that started out solid, with soo much potential... but became an unwatchable mess. The cause, the people involved with the series and their self-hatred, nihilism and desire to use this show as a platform for their own ideological impulses.

2732,2732,1.0,2 September 2022,"I've been following The Boys from S1. And hot damn, it was genius.

I went in with the same expectations into S2, but I found it sometimes lacking. Still my enthusiasm and momentum carried me through, right into S3... and boy, if they dropped the ball in this season.

Let's get the positive stuff out of the way: Antony Starr and Jensen Ackles are both pretty awesome in their roles. And Kimiko's final decision about her power was really heartfelt.

OK, that was quick. Now, the rest...

The writing in the whole season is nothing short of abysmal. Gone are the intriguing premises of ordinary people fighting an evil company with superheroes. Gone are the reliance on grit and wit and street smarts to outmaneuver your opponent. Instead enter a**-pulled contrivances, half-baked subversions and downright stupidity.

Instead of an intriguing story you get everyday politics injected into the show - in spades. And with a subtlety of cracking a walnut with a sledgehammer. ""Oh You see? We mock woke corporate marketing! We mock Orange Man! Underground media! Mainstream media! We're bashing both left and right, aren't we kewl?""

The writers also had no idea what to do with their characters after S2. They had put half of the cast on pause or simply abandoned their storyline. Characters constantly make stupid and/or contradictory decisions that they would never have made in previous seasons. Power levels and power dynamics are being shifted on a dime. The last episode was especially full with eye-rolling moments, from Maeve dropping some of the deadliest nerve agent right onto the city to the awful final showdown.

Thank you show, you had such a promising premise, I even held my hopes high after S2 for all the ongoing storylines, but you let me down big time.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",ive been following the boys from s and hot damn it was genius i went in with the same expectations into s but i found it sometimes lacking still my enthusiasm and momentum carried me through right into s and boy if they dropped the ball in this season lets get the positive stuff out of the way antony starr and jensen ackles are both pretty awesome in their roles and kimikos final decision about her power was really heartfelt ok that was quick now the rest the writing in the whole season is nothing short of abysmal gone are the intriguing premises of ordinary people fighting an evil company with superheroes gone are the reliance on grit and wit and street smarts to outmaneuver your opponent instead enter apulled contrivances halfbaked subversions and downright stupidity instead of an intriguing story you get everyday politics injected into the show in spades and with a subtlety of cracking a walnut with a sledgehammer oh you see we mock woke corporate marketing we mock orange man underground media mainstream media were bashing both left and right arent we kewl the writers also had no idea what to do with their characters after s they had put half of the cast on pause or simply abandoned their storyline characters constantly make stupid andor contradictory decisions that they would never have made in previous seasons power levels and power dynamics are being shifted on a dime the last episode was especially full with eyerolling moments from maeve dropping some of the deadliest nerve agent right onto the city to the awful final showdown thank you show you had such a promising premise i even held my hopes high after s for all the ongoing storylines but you let me down big time,NEGATIVE

It skewers everyone and everything that needs skewering in today's social/political realm, while maintaining just enough humanity to allow viewers to identify with things that are really going on in life. Funny, gory and topical, I can't wait for season 3.

Edit: Well S3 continued the good, the bad and the gory and did not disappoint. Couldn't wait for S4. But I should have.

My questions? When did Disney buy HBO? Or did HBO have to give up creative control as part of its packaging agreement with Disney +? I know HBO is predictably left wing as is Seth Rogan. But both had been able to put aside their ideological leanings in producing this show for three seasons, skewering all sides with equal contempt. But I guess the pot (pun intended) finally boiled over and so far this year (must wonder if this being an election year had anything to do with it) it's just another in your face Orange Man Bad/pregnant single mother good trope and I won't be watching anymore. Starlight's ""heartfelt "" rapprochement with her aborting her baby rang so hollow it inadvertently made me laugh. Where was all this ""thinking"" when she was in the process of making this baby? Was she so weak willed and so enthralled with lust that she ""just couldn't help herself?"" What does this say about women? Are they really the ""weaker sex?"" That's certainly how she appears although I'm sure that's not the message the writers were attempting to get across. And Sister Sage, the smartest person in the world, who is Black, female and avariciously horney when she's around a horrible, immoral man she normally can't stand, but can't deal with all the pressures that come with being smart, so she occasionally has a lobotomy (unintended drug reference maybe?) just to ""get away."" Again if, as I assume, the writers purpose was to extoll the virtues of smart Black women, I just don't get it. And finally Homelander. I guess the best that can be said is they didn't have him dye his hair orange and give him a wild comb over, but they might as well have. So I've disabled my reminder for this show and will be letting this monkey ride off on the back of the shark that it jumped. And it's too bad. Thus was a nice companion piece to Doom Patrol.

Jack Quaid: Comes across as both naive, sensitive and as a man with a mission - he just keeps getting better and better. Karl Urban: Plays the same gritty/violent/edgy character he's played so many times before - for the love of Bob, give his character more depth - he can do it! Antony Starr: Wow... talk about a total uplift! This guy has really raised his game here. Erin Moriarty: Awesome ability. This is a lady to watch. Dominique McElligott: Excellent - pity that her role was so poorly implemented. No depth of character whatsoever. Jessie T. Usher: Again - not enough depth for the actor to gain momentum (pun intended) - but one to watch out for. Chace Crawford: Brilliant performance - despite the script doing truly weird event turns with his character. (Obviously someone wants him gone.) Tomer Capon - Absolutely wonderful. At times I could almost believe that he was talking from personal experience. Bravo! Laz Alonso - Good performance within the narrow bounds of the (clichéd) writing - not his fault, you can only work with the lines drawn. Elisabeth Shue: Fantastic as always - though, again, the characterisation was a little stilted. Simon Pegg - A British actor with a remarkable film career of his own... and you can see and hear the experience that allowed him to take a 'bit' role and make it his own. Jennifer Esposito: Why, oh why did she bother? Surely this fine actress could have been better utilised... what a waste of her and our time.

Overall: Despite the lack of depth of any of the characters (and realising that these are not 3 hour long episodes) - the show is superb.

There are so many 21st century shows and comic books - all the ones which pose the question 'But what if superheroes lived in the real world?' - that all lead directly back to the books Moore was writing 20, 30 years ago. This particular one is greatly indebted to, most obviously, Watchmen, but also to his great superhero cop series, 'Top 10'.

'The Boys' is horribly cynical, crass and violent. It feels the product of a generation raised on Grand Theft Auto, and emerges from the same bleak, empty, hollowed out void that Joker and Too Old To Die Young crawled out of. There's an awful, depressing, god-shaped hole at the centre of it all, with no more heroes or anything else left to believe in, seeing only the worst in everyone. Predictably, all the male superheroes are evil, while all the female ones are either good or conflicted. No change there, of course, but I keep wondering what these kinds of messages, now so common in popular culture (and everywhere else) are doing to the glue holding civilization together.

Anyway, all this is made bearable only by the fact that it is also very clever, surprising, and genuinely laugh-out-loud funny. I'm three episodes in and I have no idea where it's going to go. And I do like being surprised.

Karl Urban's accent is a thing of bewilderment and wonder, dogpaddling all the way from the Docks of London to Auckland harbour and back, often in a single sentence. There's a (seemingly mandatory in 2019) #MeToo subtext to the plot that emerges as the story goes on, but I have to say, it's at least dealt with interestingly and intelligently, without any placard waving, and seems believable in the way it unfolds.

The script is witty and sharp, with many memorable lines scattered throughout it. The placement and meaning and delivery of the sentence ""Don't you ever besmirch Billy Joel"" has so much more depth and poignance than one would have thought at all possible.

I also want to add, even though it's now a very common thing to remark, the show has a first-rate soundtrack - whoever's choosing The Damned and Jane's Addiction and Bill Withers has a fine record collection.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",i cant help but notice repeatedly these days how much we all today live in the world created by alan moore even if he has had his name removed from it there are so many st century shows and comic books all the ones which pose the question but what if superheroes lived in the real world that all lead directly back to the books moore was writing years ago this particular one is greatly indebted to most obviously watchmen but also to his great superhero cop series top the boys is horribly cynical crass and violent it feels the product of a generation raised on grand theft auto and emerges from the same bleak empty hollowed out void that joker and too old to die young crawled out of theres an awful depressing godshaped hole at the centre of it all with no more heroes or anything else left to believe in seeing only the worst in everyone predictably all the male superheroes are evil while all the female ones are either good or conflicted no change there of course but i keep wondering what these kinds of messages now so common in popular culture and everywhere else are doing to the glue holding civilization together anyway all this is made bearable only by the fact that it is also very clever surprising and genuinely laughoutloud funny im three episodes in and i have no idea where its going to go and i do like being surprised karl urbans accent is a thing of bewilderment and wonder dogpaddling all the way from the docks of london to auckland harbour and back often in a single sentence theres a seemingly mandatory in metoo subtext to the plot that emerges as the story goes on but i have to say its at least dealt with interestingly and intelligently without any placard waving and seems believable in the way it unfolds the script is witty and sharp with many memorable lines scattered throughout it the placement and meaning and delivery of the sentence dont you ever besmirch billy joel has so much more depth and poignance than one would have thought at all possible i also want to add even though its now a very common thing to remark the show has a firstrate soundtrack whoevers choosing the damned and janes addiction and bill withers has a fine record collection,POSITIVE

2777,2777,2.0,22 April 2021,"The first series was great. Unapologetic, ruthless and devoid of political intent. It was refreshing to see Hollywood back something like this - super hero's that displayed more realistic Human traits like jealousy and callous rage.

And then Series 2 came along and all of a sudden there were these tiresome political platitudes seeping in. It was like new writers had come in, but I'm inclined to say it was actually planned to hook us in and then feed us what we actually expect to see in a Marvel film.

Looking back, the writing was actually on the wall where ""The Boys"" slowly started to become ""The Boys and Girls"". But you may be wondering what clichés I am now talking about. No offence, but if you can't see them, then it is already too late for your tired and clumsy saturated mind that is afraid to actually express itself.

A nazi super hero at the forefront? Check.

A sickly Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez lookalike politician who is woke? Check - and of course ""The Boys and Girls"" look pathetic in her midst.

Homelander now dating the nazi superhero and now a racist himself? Check

The introduction of carefully placed symbols deliberately included to evoke feelings of justice, like Homelander's painting on the side of a barn with his cape replaced with the confederacy flag? Check. This is despite him being mates with A-Train...a black man.

Anti white racist scriptwriting? Check - here is an example of this ""I can't lash out some aging entitled maniac, that's a white mans luxury"" - what? This is said by one of the richest and powerful men in the series lol. Pathetic.

2787,2787,4.0,19 June 2022,"I think this could work better as a film or at max, 2 seasons, wrapping up then.

The first season is mostly worth watching because of the different take on superhero fiction, good casting, and there is an okay balance between light hearted/humor and dark (though progressively too much of the latter as it goes on). There also is some sense of optimism like there is a chance this can all work out. And behind all of it is a critique of the current state of the US in terms of political and social divisions, power (corporate and government), exploitative historical events, etc.

It starts getting harder to watch towards the end of the first season and basically continues like that in the next season but even more disturbing, weird, hopeless, depressing, and more focus on Homelander while also feeling monotonous.

They just reveal a bit more of the story behind everything each episode to keep you watching while the same pattern plays out repeatedly: cat and mouse chase, extremely gruesome horror-film-esque scenes particularly with Supes, character conflicts within both the 7 and the Boys, reminding us the mostly bad characters have sympathetic flaws and the good characters have bad sides and some are closer to in between, and that the Vought corporation and its founders and leaders are really the main villain (like the Palpatine character in Star Wars), though their creations sometimes go outside the limitations they try to keep them within.

Some of the easy initial comic relief elements lose their effectiveness by the end of the first season. Yes, Homelander looks and sounds funny but by the end of the first season, that goofy side doesn't balance out the insane mass murderer, bully, stalker, and abuser aspiring for world power anymore.

2883,2883,5.0,20 October 2020,"What's all this hype about ? If you're a guy with sane mediocre standards at the very least you'd either burden yourself like I did or drop it from the get-go. Season 1 was good on its own, but then everybody was talking about Season 2 and I said, alright ? Maybe give it a chance? Guess what, Kudos to Homelander for having saved this show.

This series went wrong in so many ways. I understand it wanted to take its own endeavor in the ""supe"" department but it fell flat miserably. The plot in the first season was loud and clear, it was fun and somewhat unpredictable at parts. But that's evident provided that the show did its best to sell. Second Season however, ""butchered"" every aspect. Take for instance the terrible dialogue which was already a flaw but then turned into teen chattering in the second season (I can't count how many times the word c*nt has been mentioned). So many insults it takes half the dialogue literally, and every response to any action is either blackmail full of insults or compliments full of insults.

Dialogue wasn't the only ill dog, even the character writing was so terrible. In the first season we actually cared about the main characters but in the second season it's thrown out the window, with the lens focused only on the plot which was, by the way, all over the place.

Butcher became a very annoying character written so poorly I yawned during every scene of his (He had so much potential, the casting actor did great but he's no culprit of the crime the writers have done of him).

Slowly moving towards the finale we expected something huge but well, it failed miserably. What can I say ? This hype is wrong. The only thing that saved the show is Homelander (both his character and the actor), and I kept on watching just for Homelander.

The show did get it right only a few times, countable on a hand's fingers. Sometimes they go extreme lengths to create the ""wow"" factor which is a cliché in itself. So either take the risk of watching this, perhaps you'll like it like the majority seemingly do, or be blown off with disappointment only a season later.

I am gonna give some credits to Starlight's actor, you rocked. Everything else was just uncomfortably misplaced I couldn't bear it.

Bad Humor (Cheesy, full of insults, feels like teen talk), Bad Writing (Feels so fabricated), Bad Dialogue (Written by an amateur?), Bad Plot (Going nowhere despite the potential ?), Bad Characters (Bad Character Development, Bad Character Backstory and even bad character management, except for Homelander which was their one and only trump card)

Season 1 is fine (7/10) Season 2 is a frowning 2.

This would be one of my favorite shows, except that it keeps trotting out a completely irrelevant anti-religious message that does nothing whatsoever to advance the story. There were only 8 episodes in season 1, and they wasted one of them on a ""preachy"" subplot about how Starlight used to be a Christian but now she knows that no one can really know what God is like. That was annoying from a creative perspective, because it made no sense. But then they doubled-down on it in the first episode of season 2 by apparently turning her into an atheist so that she can slip into another completely irrelevant monologue about ""Bible camp"" and how there is no God and her parents lied to her for her whole childhood. It's a really contrived loss-of-faith moment that I'm sure resolves with some kind of existential redemption later, but I had to stop watching cuz I was sick of cringing. It's almost like the writers are using this show as therapy to exorcise their baggage about Christianity. Hard to believe that in 2020 it's okay to suggest that all Christians are ultra-right hippie-cultists, assuming that none of them would be completely normal people who would watch this show.

2912,2912,5.0,24 July 2022,"Just so everyone knows, The Boys comic book is written and made by people who have openly admitted to hating superheroes, and the point of the book was to be a satire and deconstruction of the genre.

I am a hardcore superhero fan, I've been one all my life. But during my childhood, or whenever I was out in public wearing a Spider-Man shirt (or something like that) I never once felt save or secure about myself, because i was afraid of the ridicule, scorn, mockery, and bullying that regular people who do love and enjoy escapist fiction face from people who love to make people feel inferior, lonely, and like an outcast, simply because I like something.

Superheroes, (and nerd culture in general), has been portrayed in a hurtful depiction for too long, that no one feels safe to be who they are because of some angry, mean, rotten, bully who thinks their smarter, more adult, wiser, and are so progressive every time they mock you and others. That to mean is the message and intent I get from both the comic and this show.

People like to stereotype superheroes as an male adolescent power fantasy. While there is certainly nothing wrong with that. We often forget that Superheroes have evolved as a genre. Granted it took forever for a Wonder Woman movie to get made, and a lot of the respected publishers of Superhero comics don't promote their books as they should be for a general audience, but in the end it doesn't matter, so long as the product is good, and is about being a hero with powers and abilities, and willing to stand up for what is right.

We live in a world today, where violent, terrible, unrepentant people with real power, use it to commit atrocities in the name of selfishness, greed, and everything evil.

Superheroes are characters meant to boost morals, and inspire us to want to be better people. Costumes, symbols, superpowers, and escapist elements are good ways to draw inspiration from and use every day. I know the difference between fiction and fantasy, but what is so unbelievable and fictious about being a good person, or wanting to be a good person.

Then you have The Boys, taking a genre that is meant to be geared towards everyone, (especially little kids), and have it be bloody violent, with sexual assault, torture, rape, reinforcing demeaning social issues that inflict minorities.

I realize this show is trying to be a deconstruction of the superhero genre, but it's not. These are not heroes. These are supervillains, and supervillains are people with power who use it to do evil things.

The writer of this comic series, is very cynical and say, ""Come on, it's true to real life. I mean wouldn't anyone with that kind of power really want to use it to good and help people like you and man"".

Kindness, compassion, and decently are thing the world needs, and we will always need. People need to be reminded about that with things like superhero media, because superheroes are ultimately about kindness and decency and can inspire us.

What I find cathartic about the people who bullied me for liking escapist fiction is, those people probably never learn, or understand the meaning of empathetic or decent, and instead decided to lord that power as a way to make themselves feel large. And they could've be decent, kind, and compassionate, (everyone simply just wants to be noble and kind), but they weren't.

A little empathy, humility, and imagination, and people can be better then how they used to behave.

I don't have patience, or tolerance for shows like this. This show pushes the envelope into gross, edgy nonsense to try to win over people who already hate superheroes, or are bullies that already mock and bully people for liking superheroes, or are just people who behave with that whole shallow culture that is just so ugly and insecure that it just reinforces bullying and intolerance.

I don't know if we're ever going to live in a world where people are free to be who they are and be happy enjoying what they love and finding other people that like what they do. But shows like The Boys, just reinforce bullying, and instead depict superheroes as pedophiles who rape and kill anyone that want because they figure ""Who be stupid to want to fight me"", or have moronic and hate filled characters like bill the butcher who are overly cynical and are design to remind people that life just plainly sucks and there is nothing you can do about it, or do anything to make it better. This show is garbage, I don't even want to rate this show.

I watched most old and new superhero shows, cartoons, movies and etc. I was neck deep in superheroes.

Superheroes genre was once felt like it was made for superhero geeks.

Then something happened. Superhero genre exploded with cartoons live action and movies. Every corporate network and production was producing and investing in superheroes whether DC, Marvel or others. This overwhelmed me. Superheroes became dark, liberal, fan service and for the general audience.

The Boys with my 2020 vision is overwhelming because it seems cliché. I've been here before. I've seen it. It's overdone.

I don't think cliché is entirely the problem. It's forcing so many superhero products all at once where you either lose interest, can't keep up and or just don't care anymore because you already know what is going to happen.

The Boys is nothing special. It's a soap opera. A super opera. Same old super drama.

2951,2951,7.88,13 June 2023,"EDIT: I've now watched the 4th season and this is a show that has completely lost its way - I won't be watching again.

The crude attempts to shock and the weak storytelling that were starting to become an issue in the third season have completely taken over.

""The Boys"" themselves were always the weakest part of the show but their story is now so boring, and their characters so contrived, that they ruin every scene they are in (and they are in the majority of them). Turning Frenchie ""gay"" (and then straightening him out again) is the most obvious example, but there are far too many to list in this review.

Homelander is still the star of the show and his anger and desire for power remains the best part of it, with Firecracker (Valorie Curry) the strongest of the new characters.

Once again it dodges a proper ending in the season finale so they can drag it out for yet another season.

I realise I've written more about the fourth season than any of the others. Trust me, I'm barely getting started. Suffice to say it jumped the shark a while ago (probably with the Black Noir origin episode in S3), and is not worth watching any more.

ORIGINAL REVIEW (rated 8/10): I love the world The Boys inhabits.

A collision between power, ambition, race, money, religion and politics. It's dark, it's satirical, it's spectacular and it's very violent.

Far and away the best scenes involve the superheroes. Anthony Starr is outstanding as Homelander, capturing his delusion and danger perfectly. There is great support on the Vought Industries side as well - particular mentions for Elizabeth Shue, Aya Cash and Colby Minifie who always make their scenes stand out.

Unfortunately ""The Boys"" - the rag-tag group of vigilantes who want to knock the ""Supes"" from their pedestal - are the weakest part of the show. Relentlessly weary and downtrodden, you get a bit bored when they are on screen, and just end up waiting for Homelander and his crew to return.

The show suffers generally from a naive view of anything outside the United States. Karl Urban (a Kiwi) plays Billy Butcher as a Cockney with a ridiculous devotion to slang that makes him come across as a Poundland Danny Dyer. Kimiko is supposedly a Japanese woman who was kidnapped and taken to the Phillipines of all places - and is introduced as a mute, which REALLY slows down every scene she is in afterwards.

The other general issue is that sometimes the dark, satirical humour tips over into silliness, destroying the tension.

Nevertheless the first two seasons are excellent with gripping finales.

The third season starts well but then seems to lose confidence in where it is going, which results in a scarcely believable ending.

Hopefully the creators get their mojo back for the fourth season (which I'm sure is coming).","July 26, 2019 (United States)",edit ive now watched the th season and this is a show that has completely lost its way i wont be watching again the crude attempts to shock and the weak storytelling that were starting to become an issue in the third season have completely taken over the boys themselves were always the weakest part of the show but their story is now so boring and their characters so contrived that they ruin every scene they are in and they are in the majority of them turning frenchie gay and then straightening him out again is the most obvious example but there are far too many to list in this review homelander is still the star of the show and his anger and desire for power remains the best part of it with firecracker valorie curry the strongest of the new characters once again it dodges a proper ending in the season finale so they can drag it out for yet another season i realise ive written more about the fourth season than any of the others trust me im barely getting started suffice to say it jumped the shark a while ago probably with the black noir origin episode in s and is not worth watching any more original review rated i love the world the boys inhabits a collision between power ambition race money religion and politics its dark its satirical its spectacular and its very violent far and away the best scenes involve the superheroes anthony starr is outstanding as homelander capturing his delusion and danger perfectly there is great support on the vought industries side as well particular mentions for elizabeth shue aya cash and colby minifie who always make their scenes stand out unfortunately the boys the ragtag group of vigilantes who want to knock the supes from their pedestal are the weakest part of the show relentlessly weary and downtrodden you get a bit bored when they are on screen and just end up waiting for homelander and his crew to return the show suffers generally from a naive view of anything outside the united states karl urban a kiwi plays billy butcher as a cockney with a ridiculous devotion to slang that makes him come across as a poundland danny dyer kimiko is supposedly a japanese woman who was kidnapped and taken to the phillipines of all places and is introduced as a mute which really slows down every scene she is in afterwards the other general issue is that sometimes the dark satirical humour tips over into silliness destroying the tension nevertheless the first two seasons are excellent with gripping finales the third season starts well but then seems to lose confidence in where it is going which results in a scarcely believable ending hopefully the creators get their mojo back for the fourth season which im sure is coming,NEGATIVE

Superheroes are not the good guys here but is that enough to make this good? Most of it is dialogs after dialogs. There's hardly any action, which should be one of the first criterias to make a superhero show, whether the superheroes are good or bad.

The show do not progress. It is the same thing over, and over, and over again.

There are also several pretty bad actors, mainly the side-characters, that lower both the score and the overall quality.

With that said however this is still fun. This is entertaining and the show have a lot of cool and WTF moments, so I get why so many like it. This is not bad, not at all. And the show also highlight an interesting thought; what happens if a lot of sociopaths emerge as superheros and they are just as egocentric and fame-hungry as any NBC reporter? To be fair, most people developing superpowers would act like these ""heroes"" in this show. About this I am 100% sure. This is what and who people are. Sadly.

*the multitude of negative reviews on amazon's site (and some here on IMDB) with their endless whinging about how ""they don't pay for prime to have to wait for staggered releases"" and ""wake up, this is 2020, I want to binge watch the whole series"" just scream of a group of kiddults who lack any semblance of fortitude. I for one feel the weekly release is a great thing.

2985,2985,7.88,6 September 2019,"The acting is good, the visual effects are great, and the basic premise of deeply corrupt superheroes with various apparent mental disorders is still cool (as it was in Watchmen). I thoroughly enjoy the not-so-subtle parodies of the Justice League heroes, and there are plenty of fantastic scenes and moments throughout the first season.

Now, I'd probably have given The Boys a 10 back in the Reagan era, or even in the 90s, but the kind of over-the-top Anti-Americanism and Christian bashing it indulges in just feels vicious and crude to me now. Perhaps society today is dominated by completely different forces than the Moral Majority, or maybe I've simply outgrown my youthful cynicism. Either way, just like with Preacher (also based on a Garth Ennis comic), I find it incredibly stale, and it seriously detracts from what is still a good show. (And I say this as a Swede with no religious convictions.)","July 26, 2019 (United States)",the acting is good the visual effects are great and the basic premise of deeply corrupt superheroes with various apparent mental disorders is still cool as it was in watchmen i thoroughly enjoy the notsosubtle parodies of the justice league heroes and there are plenty of fantastic scenes and moments throughout the first season now id probably have given the boys a back in the reagan era or even in the s but the kind of overthetop antiamericanism and christian bashing it indulges in just feels vicious and crude to me now perhaps society today is dominated by completely different forces than the moral majority or maybe ive simply outgrown my youthful cynicism either way just like with preacher also based on a garth ennis comic i find it incredibly stale and it seriously detracts from what is still a good show and i say this as a swede with no religious convictions,POSITIVE

2989,2989,7.88,19 August 2019,"I absolutely loved The Boys plot. It's pretty unique, and fun. With that being said, I try to limit the amount of filth I watch, and unfortunately, this show seems to add it without cause. Its gratuitous nature was quite offputting. I did appreciate the fact that they did seem to darken scenes that might come off as offensive, but why even put them in there at all? At times I felt very uncomfortable watching, to the point of just turning it off. However the plot is what kept me coming back. It's unfortunate when there's such a good plot line, and great acting, but writers still feel the need to muck it up. I've seen many TV shows rated TV-14 that were excellent. The plot and acting held up the show. Adult content doesn't equal better. Let your writing and acting speak for itself. Tone it down a little, and I think you'll broaden your audience.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",i absolutely loved the boys plot its pretty unique and fun with that being said i try to limit the amount of filth i watch and unfortunately this show seems to add it without cause its gratuitous nature was quite offputting i did appreciate the fact that they did seem to darken scenes that might come off as offensive but why even put them in there at all at times i felt very uncomfortable watching to the point of just turning it off however the plot is what kept me coming back its unfortunate when theres such a good plot line and great acting but writers still feel the need to muck it up ive seen many tv shows rated tv that were excellent the plot and acting held up the show adult content doesnt equal better let your writing and acting speak for itself tone it down a little and i think youll broaden your audience,POSITIVE

However, this Superhero conglomerate somehow is impervious to public scrutiny. They used a heavy dose of dark and evil to create their characters, and I get it, but it was a bit much.

The only thing I cannot get past, as a kiwi, is Karl Urbans' accent. He sounds a mix between bad cockney (perhaps), Aussie and Kiwi. One scene he's more cockney then the Kiwi twang comes in, then it sounds Aussie. Is this meant to be? I hope not... his character could come across so differently if the accent was right, being he is described as a 'British guy' in one scene.

If the 'uccent' wasn't such an issue, would definitely give more stars 😊","July 26, 2019 (United States)",ok quite liking this series up to episode season the only thing i cannot get past as a kiwi is karl urbans accent he sounds a mix between bad cockney perhaps aussie and kiwi one scene hes more cockney then the kiwi twang comes in then it sounds aussie is this meant to be i hope not his character could come across so differently if the accent was right being he is described as a british guy in one scene if the uccent wasnt such an issue would definitely give more stars,POSITIVE

I'm sorry, but the story is just very average and a bit cheap if you ask me... It's not moving or special, it's just so predictable! The main character is just plain out boring, although the super girl is interesting. But thats it... It's violent and it's weird...

2997,2997,7.88,21 September 2020,"The Boys season 1 is a hilarious, gory and realistic look at what would happen if superheroes lived in the real world. The show follows a group of people (The Boys) who want to try and take down corrupt superheroes who abuse their superpowers. The acting is absolutely brilliant in particular, Karl Urban as 'Billy Butcher', Jack Quaid as 'Hughie Campbell' and Erin Moriarty as 'Starlight'. However, the best acting from the entire cast comes from Anthony Starr as 'Homelander', the most popular hero and the leader of 'The Seven'. He is able to go from goodie two shoes boy-scout to complete psychopath within a single scene. The plot is very entertaining with a great twist at the end. This is achieved by the immense acting, brilliant directing and exhilarating writing that goes into each episode. The show doesn't shy away from very tough themes, especially religion which is obvious with the character of Homelander. The other themes included (misogyny, capitalism and corruption) also land perfectly with each of them getting the ideal amount of time needed for them to be displayed. This show obviously takes inspiration from the characters from 'The Justice League' with their group being called 'The Seven' and every member being a blatant carbon copy of their Justice League counterpart. The best episodes were: 1:1 ('The Name of the Game'), 1:4 ('The Female of the Species'), 1:7 ('The Self-Preservation Society') and 1:8 ('You Found Me'). However, it wasn't perfect, the show does drag in places and I wish 'Black Noir' had a bigger role. Also, I wanted more of 'Queen Maeve's' backstory as I feel they are two characters that have loads of potential. Overall, I loved this first season, I can't wait for season 2 and I'm looking forward to seeing older members of 'The Seven'.","July 26, 2019 (United States)",the boys season is a hilarious gory and realistic look at what would happen if superheroes lived in the real world the show follows a group of people the boys who want to try and take down corrupt superheroes who abuse their superpowers the acting is absolutely brilliant in particular karl urban as billy butcher jack quaid as hughie campbell and erin moriarty as starlight however the best acting from the entire cast comes from anthony starr as homelander the most popular hero and the leader of the seven he is able to go from goodie two shoes boyscout to complete psychopath within a single scene the plot is very entertaining with a great twist at the end this is achieved by the immense acting brilliant directing and exhilarating writing that goes into each episode the show doesnt shy away from very tough themes especially religion which is obvious with the character of homelander the other themes included misogyny capitalism and corruption also land perfectly with each of them getting the ideal amount of time needed for them to be displayed this show obviously takes inspiration from the characters from the justice league with their group being called the seven and every member being a blatant carbon copy of their justice league counterpart the best episodes were the name of the game the female of the species the selfpreservation society and you found me however it wasnt perfect the show does drag in places and i wish black noir had a bigger role also i wanted more of queen maeves backstory as i feel they are two characters that have loads of potential overall i loved this first season i cant wait for season and im looking forward to seeing older members of the seven,POSITIVE
