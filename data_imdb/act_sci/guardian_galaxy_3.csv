1,8.0,4-May-23,"Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.

At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.

The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies. This is one of the better Post Endgame movies and a fitting end to the trilogy.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
2,9.0,3-May-23,"This. This is what I've wanted. Yeah some of the jokes are a bit too silly and the tone is a bit confusing at times. But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
3,1.0,4-May-23,"It all leads back to where we once started off as all great trilogies have indicated from the past. But GOTG surpasses expectations with what is nothing short of phenomenal performances by the cast and truly well written and does not shy away from what could only be understood from what requires a sense of maturity to understand. Rockets back story alone is on occasion dark and incredibly sad it had me in tears at a few instances during the film. Honestly I did not expect this, James Gunn yet again provides an absolutely beautiful piece of cinematography and I have to say I really hope in the future they dive back into the story of the colony . With Adam warlock finally in the MCU it's most likely there will be some cameos. But it does deliver in the traditional guardians humor but this film is meant about more for the mature audience of marvel. Trust me this is a great film.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
4,9.0,8-May-23,"Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.

While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.

The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.

Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.

""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.

5,1.0,10-May-23,"I'm not one to cry at movies often, but this one broke me. Four is merely an estimate. I spent the entire last hour of the film in and out of tears. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is an unexpected masterpiece, and a work of art that absolutely broke me.

From the soundtrack, to the writing, to the characters, to the use of flashbacks, this movie is about as close to perfection as it gets. Having already established all of the characters, it managed to be heart-wrenching all the way through. This movie leaves a bittersweet taste in your mouth, and with so much to think about. It manages to make 2 and 1/2 hours feel ten times as short. I never expected to fall in love with this movie, but it got to me in such a visceral way that I'll never forget the experience of seeing it.

The best marvel film, ever. 10/10.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
6,9.0,7-May-23,"""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.

I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.

The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.

At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

8,9.0,3-May-23,"A near perfect end to an incredible Marvel trilogy.

Guardians of the Galaxy 3 is one of the best Marvel movies ever produced, and on par if not succeeding the first installment. (I personally didn't think number 2 was good at all)

The humour is brilliant, the storyline perfectly paced, each character gets their time on screen, the world building was wonderful, the action fantastic, and the CGI far better than some of the more recent Marvel additions. As always, the music was excellent.

This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.

Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows. This is also a tear jerker of a movie, so don't be surprised if you find yourself weeping throughout several points of the film.

You won't be dissapointed with this final addition to the Guardians, but you may feel a little sad that it has now come to an end.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
9,6.0,6-May-23,"I loved the first GotG, and enjoyed Vol. 2 a lot. For me they were original, quirky, funny films with an awesome soundtrack, great action sequences and a real feel-good factor to them.

This third instalment attempts to carry some of those traits over, but it also wants to be a serious, emotional film as it works its way through Rocket's tortuous back story. These two opposing threads make for uncomfortable bedfellows, and it hits from the very start of the movie. Any anticipation I felt for the film dissipated rapidly in the first 10 very depressing minutes, and I struggled to regain much enthusiasm for it. Perhaps this was an inevitable consequence following the events of the last Avengers movie, but even so I didn't feel it was handled all that well.

This was despite a pretty engaging revenge plot and a compelling and superbly portrayed primary antagonist. Adam Warlock was a welcome if somewhat underexplored addition to the cast, and a wide variety of imaginative and frequently grizzly selection of supporting characters were generally a bonus.

In fact it was the Guardians themselves who disappointed. Rocket and Star-Lord were largely humourless throughout. The three female guardians, including - strangely - Mantis, melded into the same universally angry, shouty character. Only Drax seemed to me to add value, as he was both funny and had a nice bit of character development rolled into it.

All in all, though this wasn't a bad film, it wasn't the film I was hoping it would be.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
10,8.0,3-May-23,"Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.

Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.

Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.

I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it'd be another case of superhero burnout. It's sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them. Oh and I forgot to mention it's pretty funny.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
11,7.0,11-May-23,"The most unlikely hit of Marvel's string of hits, in retrospect, focused on the most unusual of families. With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.

Marvel's ""GOTG Vol. 3"" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket's origins and promotes animal rights.

Nevertheless, ""Guardians"" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel's invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" and to a lesser extent the ""Black Panther"" sequel. Give Gunn credit for bidding a loving farewell with both barrels blazing, even if it does close the books on this series, at least temporarily.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

13,8.0,5-Feb-24,"I've talked about this before, how expectations can mold your appreciation of a movie, so let me tell you what my mindset was coming into this one. I liked the first Guardians, although not as much as everyone else as I think Ronan is such a forgettable villain. I really didn't like the second one and thought it was a huge step down from the first one, it felt rushed and had another very weak villain. Marvel was coming off of a terrible string of movies and I even didn't like the Guardians Christmas special. I was still a fan of James Gunn though, and loved his Suicide Squad so there was that to look forward to. So, to say I wasn't expecting to like this one as much as I did is the understatement of the year. Another thing I wanted to talk about after watching this movie, was the much talked about superhero fatigue. When people mention it I think they tend to dismiss or forget that two incredible superhero movies came out this year alone (the other one being the Spiderverse movie, of course), so it just proves that if well written and well executed a superhero movie can still be really good, what people are tired is the terrible writing and lack of originality that populates most superhero movies released nowadays. Anyway, with all that out of the way, let me tell you just how much I loved this movie. It is incredibly well written, interweaving character development, emotional set pieces, comedy and action like it's nothing, with the highlight for me being the characters which are the heart of this thing. I mean, Star-Lord, Rocket, Gamora, Nebula, Drax, Mantis, Groot, even all the supporting characters like Cosmo, Kraglin or Adam Warlock, they're all so likable that you can probably ask ten different persons which one is their favorite, and you might get ten different answers. That's a testament of how good they all are! Execution wise, this is a beautiful movie, very well directed and the VFX for a change are actually good and serve to enhance the story. My only nitpick might be the villain that, although good conceptually and probably the best of this trilogy, is not as memorable as everything else, something that seems to plague all Gunn movies. Anyway, I really, really liked this movie and it is easily in my top five MCU movies. Highly recommended.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

15,8.0,3-May-23,"The ending to the guardians of the galaxy movies didn't miss action, comedy or romance. The way it played with the soundtrack was on another level. You'll notice it's filming techniques are up to date and the cgi had nothing to complain about, no goofy ahh MODOC cgi (quantumania) or scenes that looked like they were filmed on a blank green screen, it truely was a work of cinema and lacked nothing in this way. Although it was your typical villain from the past coming back for revenge, this story was probably the saddest marvel project to date and hit harder than I was expecting.

Watch this in the biggest screen you can, completely worth it.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
16,8.0,3-May-23,"This is a fun and exciting space adventure that's elevated by the great heart and humor of its characters, especially Rocket. Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.

The film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.

This is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment. While the film has a few flaws, it's still a fun and engaging, with Rocket standing out as the heart and soul of the movie.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
17,6.0,7-May-23,"I am disappointed. Although Guardians 3 is not a bad movie per se, it is definetly the worst of the three.

All the sillyness and light hearted jokes of the first two installments seemed just forced: The characters used to argue a lot in the previous movies too, but here the arguments seem more serious and sometimes the friendship actually looks damaged. Rocket gets the spotlight, but most of the background story is simply too dark. I wanted to watch the movie with my kids, but this is not a kids movie. The first two were kind of violent too, but not in this grim, dark and desperate way.

Nebula does not seem to fit in the crew, Drax does not do much at all, Groot seems strangely hallow and 'unfinished', only Starlord and Gomorra have a somewhat interesting tension. Both the adult groot and baby groot from 1 and 2 had something going on, young Groot here seems to lack any personality. The writers did not know how to use this character. The actors sometimes played as if it was the last day before summer vacation - just get it done and forget about it.

I always liked the family and friendship aspect of the first two, because it was somewhat ridiculed by the characters themselfs (""5 idiots standing in a circle"" from the first, or ""that unsaid thing"" between Gomorra and Starlord or Drax being gentle to Baby-Groot at the end of part 2), but here it's not embedded in the actions anymore. It has to be said, over and over again.

For a Grand Finale it often feels too complex, too empty and too forced. Was it a bad movie - no, probably not, but it was for sure not up there with the other two. I will probably re-watch it in a couple of years, hopefully I like it more then. (""Endgame"" also grew on me, so there is hope.)

It also sucks that there are so many fake ratings on IMDB, some even don't try to hide it.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
18,1.0,3-May-23,"I remember that I had the feeling of joy, thrill, amusement, and particular sadness watching the previous 2 installments. While the 2 previous were talking mostly about Quill's backstory and his fear of losing his beloved ones, this 3rd installment speaks about Rocket's same particular issue. And I LOVE IT.

Rocket deserved his story to be told, and I (again) experienced the same roller coaster of feeling like I had years ago (in 2014 and 2017).

Thank you James Gunn, thank you everyone involved in this movie.

This is a complete way to wrap up the trilogy, it has a lot of massive explosions and so did emotions and heart.

Guardians, galaxy still needs you but thanks for being a part of our best memories.

You all will be missed.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

20,1.0,4-May-23,"Absolutely phenomenal in my opinion. Guardians of the Galaxy 3 was not only super emotional (after Endgame I'd say the most emotional Marvel movie), the CGI and the action scenes were incredibly good as well. In some scenes it was super messed up and weird, but exactly these scenes made the movie so good.

I still don't loose hope to see more of the Guardians of the Galaxy, because they are one my favorite heroes in the MCU.

The music was also on point again, even tho it didn't reach the music from the previous parts, especially not the tracks from the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie, but all in all I loved it!","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
21,6.0,6-May-23,"Speeding up an action sequence until it is a blur doesn't make it more exciting. Louder isn't better and it doesn't add to the story or experience. The story isn't bad but it is held back with the modern Marvel Studios decisions to make every battle more 'epic' than the last. More people, faster spinning, louder noise and rinse and repeat with 10% more for each battle. Acting was alright, story was alright, soundtrack was solid enough, designs were good but sped up to blur and volume raised to pounding distracted rather than complemented. I wish I could have seen more of the details in the world but sped up to fast and it was all a blur.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

23,9.0,3-May-23,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is the third and final installment in the popular Marvel franchise, which follows the adventures of a ragtag team of cosmic heroes. It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.

The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora's (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).

""The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.""

The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she's in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.

The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn's vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast. It is also a celebration of the themes that have defined the Guardians: family, friendship, redemption, and heroism. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and dance along with these lovable misfits who have become legends in their own right.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

James Gunn really does justice to every characters in his Movie. This Movie had screentime for each and every member of the Guardians. The CGI was so clean and perfect. The introduction of Adam Warlock was one of the best Introduced Scene i have seen in cinematic history.

If you Cry and root for talking Racoon and a Talking Tree then THIS IS THE CINEMA. This has the perfect ending i have ever seen in a movie.

27,6.0,8-May-23,"This was pretty disappointing as I loved the first Guardians movie (and enjoyed the second one). It just felt like a bit of a mess, and the acting and dialogue was not as good as the earlier MCU films.

Overall it was enjoyable and the 150 minutes passed relatively quickly, but way too much CGI for me and every time I started getting into it, I found myself snapped out of it by a corny line.

One of the biggest issues with it is that the ""grown up"" Rocket was largely absent from the movie and instead the character appeared though a highly disturbing yet at the same time saccharine back story.

Even the soundtrack seemed all over the place. It includes a couple of real gems (from Faith No More and Beastie Boys in particular) but there didn't seem to be a any time period or genre which linked all the tunes together. Maybe that's the point, but it felt a bit like Quill had left his iPod on shuffle.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
28,8.0,3-Sep-23,"This packed an emotional wallop.

It had old favorites and new & equally memorable additions and was powered by an awesome sound track and the exchanges and dialogues full of fresh wit.

It had an eclectic group of friends, trying to save one of them. It had a heart- rending back story.

It had a meaner villain than almost every other Marvel studio film, since the Endgame.

It did not have a pack of super heroes confronting the next existential threat for all of mankind.

It is an almost perfect sendoff to the guardians. It is a James Gunn signature creation, with his creative imprint on the the look, feel and hear of every frame.

I had postponed seeing this until now as every other Marvel film, except the second Black Panther, seemed to be derivative of every other film with only minor tweaks.

This easily tops ALL of them, by some distance. LOVED IT.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
29,7.0,3-May-23,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a bit of a tonal mess, and quite easily my least favourite of the three. That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk. That puts it behind the original, which is hard to fault, or Vol. 2, which is a little easier to fault, but those faults don't mean too much when balanced with what works.

With Vol. 3, I think it's that imperfect balancing of the comedy, action, sentimentalism, and heartbreak that makes it stumble. The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.

There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.

But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining. It looks better and is visually more inspired than anything from Phase 4. Maybe that's not saying much, but there is creativity there. And I like how violent, out there, and heavy it can get - I just don't think it combines seamlessly with the fun stuff and the jokes.

Still, I feel it's generally a success. Maybe tugs on the heartstrings a little too aggressively, but a lot of it works. I liked how they handled all the characters, besides maybe Gamora and newcomer Adam Warlock. The storyline is otherwise sound, as are the other character arcs, and it's a pretty good end to what's been a nice trilogy.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

32,4.0,22-May-23,"This review contains no spoilers (and really there is nothing to spoil)

I loved the first two Guardians movies. Yes they had fantastic special effects. Loads of action, yes. But more importantly they were well written, well thought out, well acted, had some truly beautiful choreography. The humor was fantastic. Quirky and clever. There were some truly touching moments. They made you think a bit, but they also made you feel something. They were more than movies. They were an experience. And I had dearly hoped that this last installment would live up to my expectations, but to my deep disappointment it did not.

This movie like so many others today demands that we move past the reasonable suspension of disbelief, and into the suspension of intelligence.

The non-stop action and pretty colors didn't save it from a plot full of holes. The humor managed to produce a chuckle or two yes, but ultimately it felt trite, forced, staged. And cinema is chock full of examples showing that a talented cast cannot salvage a movie from bad writing. Honestly, every time the movie tripped on a moment that was supposed to illicit some kind of emotional response I found myself cringing and thinking the script, the dialogue, must have been cobbled together by someone so lacking in emotional depth that the best they can do is regurgitate the old tropes they've seen watching other shows. They can't create what they don't understand so the best they can manage is to mimic. It was painful.

And the fact that this movie has been given a rating of 8.3 by the viewing public tells me people have lost the ability to distinguish good from bad. I guess if Hollywood feeds people garbage long enough they stop realizing it's garbage and start thinking it's caviar.

To me it's just another ugly sign of the ongoing decay of society. We have lost an appreciation for finer things. Most people can't even recognize quality any more. The older I get (and I'm not that old, yet) the more I have to look to the past for good cinema. Or to IFC movies. Or to foreign films.

Mainstream media today is more and more....empty calories. It's bright, it's loud, it's fast....and it's it devoid or any real sustenance.

What value this movie had was only in that it convinced me that there in the long, sad decline of Marvel there is no bottom. And it's time to stop giving them my money.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
33,9.0,10-May-23,"This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.

In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.

Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame. It did everything it needed to do and more. I'm hoping this is a sign of things to come for Marvel, and is not solely due to the immense passion and talent of now studio rival James Gunn.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

Rocket truly deserved his story be told to us and this was a genuinely beautiful way of doing it. I hope Marvel keeps making stories this good in the years to come and give them the proper time to be developed instead of rushing them out of the door for the next quarterly board meeting.

Nothing more to say.

Performance was great. Story was beautifully executed. This is what happens when artists work on a piece on their own. Please get the suites to keep sitting at their chairs and let the real people do the work they were meant to do.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
35,1.0,3-May-23,"Sorry if my English is bad.

It came out in May 3rd in Japan and we were blessed with this masterpiece a bit earlier than the US.

As my review title states, perfect conclusion to the perfect trilogy. This is most definitely one of the best superhero trilogy of all time behind ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy. I honestly think they have completely different style so it is impossible to simply compare them but there is no doubt that this movie is a masterpiece in its own way.

Although I've watched every MCU movie, after ""Endgame"" they gradually became dull and boring to the point I was watching solely by a force of habit. But this movie completely changed everything. I had my hopes up high and it did not let me down.

Must watch for any Marvel fans, James gunn fan and genuinely anybody in search for a fun entertaining flick although I would reccomend you to at least watch the previous 2 movies of the trilogy.

Amazing. Thank you James Gunn.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
36,6.0,5-May-23,"Guardians 3 is not what I has hoping for; that isn't to say it's a terrible film or that some people won't love it, but I imagine that it will be somewhat divisive in how audiences take to the new direction this film goes in.

First off is it full of the social politics that Disney has become infamous for? Not really, unless you count Disney's continued quest to avoid depicting happy heterosexual relationships. Will you like it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you want something like the first two, ie a comedic film with serious moments, then you'll likely be disappointed, as this is a serious movie with comedic moments.

And make no mistakes, this is a serious movie. Not only is it the darkest Guardians movie by far, it's arguably the darkest MCU film to date. Rocket's backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers' room constantly asking, ""how can we make this more depressing?"" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.

Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it's still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it's the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.

The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it's always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.

My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.

So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.

In the end this isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. It's easily the worst Guardians film, but is still leagues better than any other phase 4/5 MCU film with the exception of 'No Way Home'. If you love the series then maybe check it out, but be warned that it's a very different beast that what you've likely come to expect.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

I'm not the biggest Marvel anymore. I didn't finish secret invasion and the only MCU movie I've seen in cinemas since No Way Home was black panther. I would have seen GOTG V3 but I watched spiderverse instead. Absolutely adore that movie and it's actually my favourite movie even though I watch a large variety and don't only indulge myself with the super hero genre. This isn't a review as much as it just me sharing how I felt but let me tell you; if you wanna watch something heartfelt yet entrancing and comedic, then this is the movie for you. I had to take a break from the movie when there was an hour left and not in particular because of the movie as such, but I cried the most I ever have in a long time. Rocket's story was so tragic yet deeply blissful. I got nervous and sad plenty in the final act thinking someone was going to die but thankfully no one did. I like it much better that way.

GotG3 starts weirdly and is super choppy throughout. On paper, the High Evolutionary storyline should've worked, but they spend far too much time away from it. The way they shoehorned Adam Warlock into the movie was almost criminal for a character that important.

There's a lot more, but I don't want to accidentally do a spoiler review.

They mix in drama and comedy masterfully and really set up the future of the franchise. There are parts that are difficult to watch if you are an animal lover.

I do think it was worth seeing on the big screen, but it wasn't as good as the first two, and it kind of felt unfinished in places. I thought rocket's story worked really well, and got me a bit tearful in places.

But Will Pouter? I liked where he started and where he ended, but the whole middle seemed to be missing. I liked that people got to see more in Drax even if he didn't see more in himself.

Despite being over 2.5 hours long, it didn't feel like it overstayed it's welcome. 1 You know, there was enough good stuff to make it worthwhile, but you did have to ignore the missing beats in a lot of the subplots.

1) The bond of the friendship. The efforts they take to save their rocket.

2) Some comic moments from Drax.

3) A fight sequence when the film about to end in 15 to 20 min, the choreography was superbly taken. It just travelled me of Avengers: Age of Ultron climax fight sequence.

It felt rushed and strained credulity (even for a movie set in space with gadgets and creatures aplenty) somehow.

The film is not nearly as good as the original, or even as good as the second. However, the closing 20 minute sequence is great, there's another nice soundtrack, and Rocket's story is the highlight of the film.

The bad: the humour really doesn't hit anymore. There was flags in GOTG 2, but it all together doesn't work here. The same is true for the writing, it's not quite the same level.

I also can't help but feel the magic is slightly gone. The original was something we loved that we didn't know we wanted, it just isn't recaptured here. It's also just quite a messy film, so much CGI of strange concept creatures and places that focus on quantity rather than quality.

58,7.0,4-May-23,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is the third Guardians of the Galaxy movie in the Marvel movie series. This film is again directed and partly written by James Gunn, who also directed the two previous films.

Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is still reeling from the loss of his beloved Gamora (Zoe Saldana). This loss causes him to still not be his old self. During a mission, Rocket (voice of Bradley Cooper) is injured by this.

In order to save him, the other Guardians must confront his creator The High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). This is a perfectionist, who is always trying to improve everything. It's probably not very familiar to leave Rocket in his hands.

With this third film, James Gunn manages to close his trilogy nicely, but he leaves it in such a way that others could continue with the film series. After this film, James Gunn will resign from Marvel and will now continue as an executive for the DC superhero films. If Marvel decides to use the Guardians of the Galaxy for new further films in their film series, this will probably come across differently compared to the vision that James Gunn had with the series and characters.

For his latest Guardians of the Galaxy film, James Gunn also takes a different direction for a change, making this film a bit darker and brutal. For example, there are different animals in the film and although these animals are not real in the film, most of them come across as realistic. When these animals are then modified by the villain of the film, who tries to make them more perfect, they show the best violent images in which this is done. These images are not really suitable for young viewers such as children under ten. Parents should take this into account if their children would like to see this film.

In addition to the animals, James Gunn, together with the people who worked on the visual effects for this film, also manages to portray the other aliens in different, creative ways. They've done this with both visual and makeup effects. It sometimes seems as if you are watching a Star Wars or Star Trek movie. Unfortunately, all explosions do not always come across as credible, because with some explosions you can see that they are played on a green screen.

The acting is also well done by the film cast. For this third film, most of them also get enough opportunities to play their well-known roles in other ways. Chris Pratt comes across as very depressed, especially in the beginning. Because this film plays on Rocket's backstory, Bradley Cooper now voices a younger version of the same character in addition to his now well-known voice as Rocket. With this third film and the events of the past Marvel films, Zoe Saldana now also gets a chance to portray Gamora's character in a different way. This version of Gamora is also a bit more brutal compared to how the character was portrayed in this way less and less in these films. With this film, she gets more of a chance to respond to the title that the character had in the comics: the deadliest woman in the whole galaxy. The rest of the returning cast also portray their characters in good manners, but not all get the chance to do something special with their characters in this new film. The well-known character from the comics Adam Warlock also finally appears in the Marvel film series. He is played by Will Poulter, but otherwise little special is done with the character. This may be a bit disappointing for fans of the character.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

The storyline is very exciting, I often found myself gripping the chair and it made my cry a few times.

There are two things that especially stood out to me: the soundtrack (ofc, one of the main reasons why I love the GOTG series so much), and the evolution of the caracters. I loved how we could really see their development, which sometimes took me by a complete surprise and I didn't feel like there was something missing from the movie.

All in all, thank you James Gunn and everyone for this masterpiece! If I had more money, I'd spend it all in the movies seeing this over and over again, because seeing it once is definitely not enough, you just wanna keep watching.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

One minute its goofy and the next we are seeing animal cruelty. Drax is easily the most entertaining character. By far. The other ones were just acting like children all of the time they weren't fighting.

First, The MVP of the movie and i will not be even exaggerating when i say the whole trilogy, Bradley Cooper as Rocket is the emotional core of this one, so much time is spent exploring his past and it leads to the most emotionally devastating moments and he absolutely brings it.

Chris Pratt is just as strong as before as Peter Quill, there's always been a sadness beneath the charming exterior but after all the previous losses its starting to come to the surface in terrific fashion as he's determined to protect his family this time around.

Chukwudi Iwuji is an amazing villain, eschewing the usual tortured past of most villains for a character who is just plain evil and larger than life, played to perfection.

Dave Bautista and Pom Klementieff remain really funny throughout but the film wisely still takes time to offer reminders of their dramatic chops as well.

Groot is just Groot that we love i will not say anything more.

I think Will Poulter's Adam Warlock was a mixed bag at best. Though I liked how seriously Poulter played the character, there weren't really enough parts in the film that let him to stand out too much Nevertheless, Im excited to see him in the future.

Cosmo is a New addition to the family and what a Great one i loved it so much can't wait for the character future because Cosmo is great in the comics. On the other hand Nebula arc is one of the best arcs in MCU history that is all I'm going to say.

John Murphy Music shares more stylistically with The Suicide Squad opposed to Tyler Bates work but it still remembers to use that iconic theme at the right moment and Awesome Mix - Vol 3 is excellent. No longer focusing on a single decade it creates something much more unique.

Finally, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 may be an uneven film at times, but it remains touching and endearing, with a fascinating study of its characters. Overall, it's a fitting and satisfying conclusion to one of Marvel's most beloved franchises.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

Villain was very good too and in my opinion the best in the guardians trilogy .The only things I can criticize was the length and one particular character. Other than that this is a brilliant film and conclusion to a trilogy.

Edit: upon watching it the 2nd time and in Imax I've changed my rating from a 9 to a 10. My previous negatives I retract, the length is actually fine because the pace and plot suit it. The development of a character that I didn't like, I was wrong about seeing as this time I understood what gunn was doing. This is also the first time I've ever watched a film again in the cinema and man was it worth it!","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
81,8.0,3-May-23,"This film had everything I've been looking for in a Marvel film for so long. The film from start to end kept me enticed , it had it all, Comedy, Action, suspense. This volume introduced a lot of new characters like the lovable badass Adam Warlock and also had large character development on people we already love and know. But I must add this film had scenes which get you pumped with adrenaline and make you think to yourself ""that was sick af"" which a lot of Marvel films have been lacking recently.

Now when it comes to graphics and CGI this film did not fall short , expect to be blown away by the amazing cinematography. All in all I'm going to give this film a 8.5 out of 10, this is a review straight out of the cinema by the way just for context.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
82,8.0,16-Sep-23,"If you're reading this you've already invested some time (and emotion) watching the first two.

As a conclusion to the original trilogy (there will be more Starlord) it does a pretty good job. The lengthy backstory and character arc for Rocket is great. Gamora's piece is good also. The evolution of Nebula continues with a new look and more sensitive outlook.

The one character I didn't enjoy was Adam. If you've read the original Genesis of this character, he was never ""half-baked"" and goofy. He was more like The Silver Surfer, a demigod. Because this version of Adam is so dumb and clumsy, there's little tension in the fight scenes he's involved in except for his first appearance where we don't see him verbally engage with other characters.

The weakness in the film is the extended second act. Nathan Fillion is always fun, but the antics in the organic space station go on too long. And as cute as it was, the freeing of all the children at the end felt contrived.

Nonetheless, recommended for all of the above and the uplifting ending to a fun story of a band of misfits.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

Since this review requires more ""characters"" I'll just add that GOTG 3 was a perfect finale to the series and I'm looking forward to the ""New Guardians"" (or whatever name they'll be referred to).

All of those positives and I *still* stand by my very unpopular opinion...the first hour and forty minutes of Guardians of the Galaxy, Volume 3 were boring as hell. It was so disappointing. I was not the only in the theatre who had a ""long blink."" The man next to me snored out loud. When his wife gave him a tap, she said, ""I'm dozing off, too...""

By far the best entry into the Guardians movies and up there with some of the best Marvel movies in general. The story isn't at all what I guessed from the trailers but as spoiler free as I can, a guardian gets injured and the rest of the guardians must band together to help save their life.

We get the backstory of Rocket and it's heartbreaking, the high evolutionary is one of the meanest we have seen in the movies. He is cruelty with no bounds, no justification just evil.

The action is great and the CG is the best it has been in a long while, the music is perfect such a perfected list that suits the movie to the ground.

Stand outs are Drax, Mantis, flashback rocket and I must say Nebulas arc in her MCU journey is great !!

The characters have become boring.

Drax is dull and uninteresting.

Nebula has evolved from her intense core to a diluted run of the mill character.

Peter Quill is Pastiche of superheros we have seen before.

Gamora becomes a running joke.

The movie makes too many self referential jokes that seem both cruel and breaks the magic of the movie.

Ridiculous endless boring battles are waged.

The whole plot revolves around a tediously boring mcguffin that sidelines one of the franchises best characters.

The outline of the plot is a rehash of the main idea from GotG II. We see trope after trope doled out that we are numb to the original shock value.

And then there is the moral hogwash were one minute some people need a second chance while others are mowed down in droves for humor value.

And then the whole christian appeal to evangelicals or whoever.

In summary all the worst elements of Marvel movies rolled into a how to movie on how to bore your audience to death.

Simply not worthy of the GotG franchise.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

The relationship between Nebula, past Gamora and Starlord is also interesting, so does the chemistry between Mantis and Drax. Groot and Cosmo also put laughter in this cute movie. However, High evolution just like Kang in Ant man 3, lack of character development, and being annoying and irritating. However, it can't stop me from loving this movie.

The best character and the best part about this movie is rocket. The flashbacks are very interesting and compelling shows his backstory shows how the villain became how he is in this movie.

There is a huge ensemble cast with several newcomers to the franchise, which have have been mostly well balanced in their introductions, although can leave a little more to be desired.

A great last hurrah to the Guardians of the Galaxy, and a definite must-watch for every single Marvel fan!

93,8.0,3-May-23,"I think it's fair to say that since Endgame Marvel's output has been littered with as many misses as hits. After the thoroughly disappointing Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantumania, Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and James Gunn well and truly delivers with Guardians Vol. 3.

This is easily the most fun I've had with a superhero film in a long time. It is funny, thrilling, and surprisingly emotional. Fans who have been following these characters for the last 10 years, get ready for such a satisfying and emotional journey.

What makes the Guardians so good is that they stand out. Superhero films are becoming far too formulaic and blending into one another, but the Guardians films somehow manage to buck this trend. Sure, the story follows the well trodden superhero film structure at its core and there are lots of familiar cliches and tropes, but the dressing around these things feels vibrant, distinct, and cared for.

The characters remain unique and interesting, with great performances behind them all. I was particularly impressed with Pom Klementieff in this film, who steals the show in my opinion with her emotion and humour. All of the performances are great though, with another shout out to Chukwudi Iwuji for a captivating performance.

The story is full of emotion, and is quite possibly the most emotional and punchy Marvel film yet. It brought me to tears and I could hear plenty of others in the theatre feeling a similar way! It's also really funny too with so many laugh out loud moments. James Gunn excelled himself with this script in every way.

Saying that, I do think some story elements feel a little bit clunky, and some characters are a little surplus to requirements, but these are minor criticisms in the grand scheme of things.

The action sequences are well done. They aren't mind blowing, but much more emphasis is put into story and character than action so this isn't necessarily a bad thing.

I will also say that despite being two and a half hours this film doesn't feel long at all. It never once drags and every scene feels needed and adds something to the whole picture.

Guardians Vol 3. Is fun, emotional, and just a joy to watch. A brilliant return to form for the MCU.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
94,1.0,3-May-23,"Just come of the cinema and I am gobsmacked! This movie hits all the notes and is a genuine rollercoaster of emotions.

The feeling, the aesthetics, the soundtrack, the humour all work in unison wonderfully, alongside a story which spends most of its time focussing mainly on Rocket's backstory as well as moving forward for our heroes. I simply cannot wait to watch it again.

I laughed, I cried (3 times) and I was blown away. The action sequences completely land (especially the scene with the Beastie Boys - No Sleep Til Brooklyn backing track).

96,9.0,6-Aug-23,"To be honest I am disappointed I did not get a chance to see this in theaters. Just finished on Disney+ Guardians 3 IS one of the best MARVEL films and IS the best MARVEL film since Endgame.

The story expands on the Guardians even more and does it without the comedy aspect overpowering the base narrative. All while carrying a steady pace between story, action, etc. Sadly a lot of the phase 4 MARVEL films and TV series went the route of comedy over narrative, and it shows. Here Guardians 3 includes the emotional aspect where it not only sticks with you but also has the factor where you can re-watch and enjoy seeing those moments again. I go back to re-watching the MCU in phase 1 through 3, but Phase 4 I have little interest in re-watching with the exception of a couple TV series. This does include some sensitive material, and may not be for everyone. Sensitive material is hard to watch, overcoming it to see where it goes I feel is a reward in itself here and Gunn delivered.

Guardians 3 feels like the MARVEL producers, higher ups did not heavily influence it and let James Gunn do his work. If you are looking to get that Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania taste gone I HIGHLY suggest watching Guardians 3.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

I love marvel I really do. And if you care about these characters I get it. But you've got to take off those rose colored glasses and understand that the billionaires controlling these movies don't care. It's obvious how shallow and insignificant everything they write for these movies is. No more in any marvel movie is there a sense of danger or achievement or anything of that regard. Not so long as the multiverse exists. And this could have been fixed probably if the producers cared enough to address it, which they don't. Shallow, synthetic, and unapologetically pulling your heart strings to distract you from the lack of substance or anything of any meaning. Even the action scenes which previously have distracted the masses from the glaring blandness and dullness are derivative and uniquely boring to watch.

Unfortunately, this feels like a swing and a miss. The chemistry between the team was gone, and not just because of the plot. The magic that we enjoyed with Starlord and Gamora was replaced with tension and disdain. Drax and Mantis provided the necessary humor and action, but Groot was almost a secondary background character. The villain was awesome, but there were many support characters that seemed to be written in when convenient, and confusing story arcs did not blend well. The main focus, Rocket, was interesting and also a little tragic. However, by not having him involved in the actual mission further took away from the chemistry. Nebula did a good job filling in gaps, but overall the movie felt labored, long, and lacking something the previous two.

The action is really good, the story is solid, the characters are still enjoyable (sometimes they drift a bit to the annoiyng side but they manage to balance it well enough so that you do not dislike anyone), the music is great, the villian is enjoyable and the ending is a nice ending of the triology.

All of the Cast put in a great performance. I quite liked Will Poulter as the new character Adam Warlock and all of the guardians are as enjoyable as they always have been.

The overall story is quite simple actually, but along the way, the story itself reveals the dark sad story about Rocket Raccoon, and boy i cried just looking at a walrus waving his hand gently.

The villain however is really dull and the new Gamora just doesn't work for me. She's not a good replacement and her constant screaming in this oddly rough voice was laughable. Although this entry in the series was a fun ride it still doesn't compare to its two predecessors.

107,5.0,27-Dec-23,"Guardians Vol. 3 delivers what many newer Marvel movies have been lacking of late. Granted, we are presented with characters which we have grown to love so that puts this film at an advantage. However, the most recent installment added to character's depth and continued on storylines created in the previous phase. For this reason, Guardians Vol. 3 stands as one of Marvel's better films. The most striking thing to me is the emotion and feeling the animators and Bradley Cooper were able to bring to a CGI character like Rocket. Honestly one of the more moving performances I've ever seen from voice acting and animation alone. The film left me satisfied as a conclusion to this three-part story. As usual with this franchise, the soundtrack was phenomenal. The comedic performances and the action sequences were all on par with the previous films as well. Some newer characters (Adam Warlock) felt underwhelming but this didn't take away from the overall story. In fact, I loved Poulter's performance and found it quite funny, but the character himself felt unnecessary in the overall story. The villain, The High Evolutionary, played by Chukwudi Iwuji, was one of my favorite villains in the MCU to date.

Overall, this film should be a delight to anyone who has grown to love the Guardians franchise. If you're not into the MCU films then this probably won't change your view.

There are some really strong moments but ultimately this film is the least funny, out of the trilogy, fails at being effectively serious, and feels more like an in-between film rather than a conclusive end to a trilogy.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 is extremely well done. Once again, James Gunn delivers a masterpiece here, Adam Warlock is finally in the MCU, and we finally get the backstory of Rocket, which was something we all were looking for.

The one thing I gotta say is, everything is so well done here, but we finally a simple villain. Lately all Marvel villains have found ways to redeem themselves, something that I really don't like at all. Thankfully we didn't get that here. Chukwudi Iwuji as the High Evolutionary should be winning an Oscar for this performance alone, his acting is off the charts in this movie. No redemption necessary, just simply evil.

Rocket's backstory is another highlight of this movie. For the past two movies he was just there. This movie, he gets a bigger role and I really love Bradley Cooper's acting here as much as Chukwudi Iwuji's.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

Gamora's character felt really awkward before in our central team so I'm really glad that her character got to shine. Speaking of which, our central gang all went through deep characterization and a perfect cap-off to their characters. I despised Drax in the 2nd film but he finally gets his rich character development we have been waiting for, Quill also improves from the pissed-off character from the last movie back to his understanding person in the 1st film. I really wanted Rocket to shine more and thankfully, he did

His seemingly upcoming death is nerve-racking aided from the wonderful flashback scenes. His backstory was only briefly mentioned in the previous film but this where Rocket was given a proper backstory. We feel bad for the poor guy, and the death of his friends is sad. This makes us have some emotional connection to Rocket. His frequent flashbacks are devastating and when he was miraculously revived, it leads to a very powerful scene that legit got me crying. When he wandered off to retreat the animals, it got me worrying for him and I didn't want to see him die. Also that one scene with Rocket's dead friends got me in tears as well

Besides the super deep characterization of Rocket, Quill, and Drax were also given great conclusions. Both of them were given some poor lines in the previous but the comedic lines in this film have such good comedic timing making nearly all of them land. Seriously, I was chuckling constantly. Drax had some charm in this and got a satisfying conclusion with the children. Quill surprisingly wasn't chasing after Gamora and finally went back home as Mantis once said. And of course, Groot is still the best thing in the universe. I'm glad that this film focused more on old characters and didn't introduce too many characters and stories. But the ones they did were definitely up to the same level

The new characters were all just as special as our central cast like the dog. Even if she did not have much screen time, the time she was was on were heartwarming and charming.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 was surprisingly a bit poetic with the writing at some parts. Like with the ""You have to learn how to swim, and not jump on pads"" thing. Of course, this was only possible due to the amazing writing it had

One thing to note is that this franchise finally has a decent villain. 1's villain was just dull and 2's was just stupid but finally we have a threatening villain. He deserves the title of a good villain because his actions are pure evil. The direct trauma he brought to Rocket, and the deaths he has caused made for an actual decent villain this franchise badly needed.

As always amazing action to expect from an MCU film but one shocking thing was, there was a lot of murder. The first 2 did have a bunch of killing as well but it is just blatantly showed numerous times here.

Overall we have an emotionally powerful, wonderful, creative, action-packed film that is the perfect conclusion to a great trilogy. Actually, my favorite of the 3 because 3 just did everything perfectly and did nothing wrong

Guardians rounds out as the strongest overall trilogy of the MCU. The ending was beautiful and poignant, capping off an amazing run for the protectors of outer space.

All your favourite Guardians are back in this third outing and there's plenty of cosmic hi-jinx and CGI action. Rocket Racoon is at the heart of the film and we get his backstory. The High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji) is introduced to the MCU and he's interestingly rendered with his fleshy face mask. He has no need for God since he's taken evolution into his own hands using technology. More Josef Mengele than Yahweh in his experiments in advancing the cerebral capacities of lower life forms, his gruesome methods may be a little much for sensitive animal lovers. The megalomaniac's greatest success turns out to be Rocket Racoon who gets revenge on his creator in the end.

There's a nice inter-species message of caring about all the life forms and a few of those heart tugging moments that are the mainstay of Marvel. Groot even gets to say something more than, 'I am Groot!'. Look, it's a good movie and I was entertained, but I just couldn't nudge it into four-star territory. I never thought I'd say it, but maybe there'll be something more compelling in DC's upcoming Flash movie, which looks like it might do something interesting with Batman in the Multiverse.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
114,7.0,3-May-23,"Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3 is a remarkable achievement in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Director James Gunn has delivered a movie that is colorful, emotional, and a feast for the senses. It is a movie that might just be some of the MCU's finest work to date.

The emotions in this film run high, and I was moved to tears at least five times during the course of the movie. The film explores the tragic backstory of Rocket Raccoon through effective use of flashbacks, which adds a layer of emotional depth to the character. This is a movie that is not afraid to be vulnerable, and it is all the better for it.

Every single character gets their moment to shine in this film, and it is a testament to James Gunn's skill as a writer and director that he manages to balance all of the characters so well. There are plenty of moments of levity and humor, but there are also moments of heartbreak and tragedy. The film manages to strike a perfect balance between these different elements, which is no mean feat.

The music in this film is as great as always, and the soundtrack is a highlight. James Gunn has a real knack for choosing the perfect songs for his movies, and the songs in this film are no exception. The visuals in this film are also stunning, and the movie is a feast for the eyes. The action sequences are expertly choreographed and thrilling to watch, and the special effects are top-notch.

I have no negative thoughts on this movie. It is a movie that had me emotionally engaged from start to finish, and it has been a long time since the MCU made me feel like this. This might just crack my personal top 5 MCU movies, and it is a movie that I will be thinking about for a long time to come.

Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3 is a colorful, emotional masterpiece that is a must-see for Marvel fans and moviegoers alike.

115,8.0,7-Jan-24,"'Guardians of the Galaxy 3' was a great conclusion for this lovable cast of characters.

The exploration of Rocket's backstory was the most intriguing part of the narrative. It was extremely emotional and quite hard to watch at points due to the tough depiction of animal abuse. I am glad we got to see this backstory depicted on screen! There is a particular narrative choice with one character that I am glad they chose to do and did not follow the cliché certain films have already done.

One action scene towards the end of the film was so well executed and extreme. It was a blast to watch! Plus, the music always works so well in these films.

However, some of the comedy did fall a little flat at points. It does not linger too much on them though and there were just as many comedy moments that did work. Guardians of the Galaxy fans need to see this film!","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
116,6.0,3-May-23,"Guardians is one of my favourite MCU sub-series (after Captain America) and this one lives up to the others.

It's a buddy movie, an action movie, a comedy and an origin movie all in one. It's quite an emotional movie and it does feel very final in terms of the guardians we know.

There's interesting development of existing characters and introduction, as is the MCU way, of yet more colourful and rich characters that comic fans will know.

There's a bit of romantic will-they-won't-they. Actually there's more than a bit.

It feels ever so slightly more grown up than the previous two guardians but above all, it's fun and it's a very good entry into the MCU.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
117,1.0,9-Jul-23,"Sensational first hour or so of footage in which the extravagant characters of the saga shine again, the hooliganism of James Gunn behind the scenes, and a very Marvel-like script. But of course, for the umpteenth time now, Disney impregnates everything good with that puerile and finicky whiff that, little by little, is smearing with sweetener what until then worked well.

A surplus of animalist sentimentality, Aryan children everywhere, and that need to tear adulterated tears from you nearing the end, simply to mark territory and confirm that everything that we were previously passionate about as shameless, mischievous, or troublemaker, is now in the cold and dead hands of Walt Disney.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
118,1.0,9-May-23,"As a big fun of Guardian franchise, I have to say this one is boring, annoying, and unnecessarily childish. I just wish to get out the theater halfway through the movie. Maybe the animal protection theme is the reason why it is rated so high. The movie can be easily made into a 90 minutes version. The constant shouting and anger serve no purpose but to annoy audiences. The comedy is at least two grades down from the previous series. To be fair, I think this one should be rated about the same as the latest Thor movie at around 6.5. But since so many people give such absurd high rating, I feel the need to balance it.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
119,8.0,3-May-23,"This emotionally charged and entertaining rollercoaster takes you through some profoundly unpleasant scenes, yet the feelings of joy and friendship seep through the gruesome moments experienced by our favorite raccoon. But also shows you many funny and wholesome moments that add to the overall experience.

Something that rarely is displayed which is heavily used in this film series is the use of music. The music in this movie does not show the average use as a enhancer for action scenes, well it does. But. It shows the importance of music as a comforting tool when we're either sad, lonely, or overwhelmed. Which is a great way to display the importance of music in our lives.

This is the first time in a long time I've seen a such a good and deserving ending to a series. It really concludes the series but also set it up for future use which I'm eager to see what's up for the guardians future.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
120,1.0,3-May-23,"This is what we get when you give a writer and director creative control. Someone who actually cares about the story of characters and it's produced a near perfect conclusion to the GOTG.

The darker tone of the movie is set early on and it instantly raises the stakes, however James Gunn doesn't forget to let us have fun along the way. I laughed a bunch and of course there was some comedy that didn't quite hit. And also, action scenes were outstanding!

Some scenes in this are certainly disturbing and make you uncomfortable but its necessary and very much adds depth to the story and characters. Rocket, you have my respect Sir. His backstory is absolutely brilliant, i wish there was more.

The movie fan in me gives this a 10/10 but if im being critical, it's a 9/10. Adam Warlock felt like a wasted opportunity and he was just THERE. I don't think they really knew what to do with him. Gamora's character has become difficult to do anything with but I appreciate what they tried here.

A near perfect conclusion to the Guardians. You'll definitely be missed.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

It's a truly stellar send off, and honestly, it's the type of movie that Marvel have been missing for a while. This is easily on a par with the best Marvel has to offer, and I thoroughly enjoyed the whole journey with this group of characters I've come to feel connected to. I'm aware that some critics have given this a luke warm reception, but they didn't appreciate the Mario movie either so what do they know? The movie has slightly darker moments than the previous two, and one F-bomb (for comedic purposes) for those who dislike bad language, it's thoroughly enjoyable and feels polished in the way that recent Marvel movies haven't. I really hope this film doesn't get ignored because of general boredom with this type of movie or the inferior quality of the past few releases, because this may be the last great hurrah from the few MCU characters left worth caring about.

Synopsis: In Marvel Studios ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" our beloved band of misfits are looking a bit different these days.

The best part was Rocket's story. And the end.

Most of film just seemed contrived, with poor pacing. Lots and lots of yelling, anger, and just didn't seem to come together like the last films.

Not sure what happened, but it just didn't seem able to ""find itself."" Sure, there were new characters, which helped, but the main cast just seemed uninterested, lacking that chemistry that made the first two so great. Heck, the Christmas episode blew this one away. Even the laughter of Drax wasn't enough to keep this afloat.

Not sure how anyone could rate this above a 7, not only as a standalone, but especially as part of such a wonderful series. It was, dare I say, boring- with the exception of Rocket and the last few minuets.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
126,7.0,27-Jul-23,"Marvel's oddball superhero team are back in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3, and this time writer-director James Gunn goes for broke with an action packed spectacular that's rich with emotional depth. It also sets in motion a reasonably satisfying finale for these fan-favourite characters who we have grown to know and love over their many appearances in the MCU. This blockbusting sequel catches up with the Guardians who have made their new HQ in the rebuilt Kowhere, a huge mining facility built inside a Celestial's skull. Unusually, the film initially quite a somber tone, as some of the Guardians are in a somewhat reflective mood. The Guardians, comprising of : Peter Quill, otherwise known as Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), an easy-going manchild obsessed by rock and pop anthems, the tough taking racoon, Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), Gamora (Zoe Saldaña) the green-skinned assassin, her cyborg sister Nebula (Karen Gillan), the lovable walking tree Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel), the humourless warrior Drax (Dave Bautista), and the empathic Mantis (Pom Klementieff) are all back for James Gunn's MCU swan song to round off the Guardians trilogy in fine style.

The melancholy is interrupted by the sudden appearance of Adam Warlock (Will Poulter , a super buff golden assassin. His brutal attack is eventually repelled by the Guardians, but not before Rocket has been fatally wounded. After discovering Rocket has a kill switch in his chest that prevents him from undergoing life saving surgery, the Guardians have no choice but to embark on a dangerous heist mission, along with The Ravagers and a reluctant Gamora, to steal a code from a biotech company. If that wasn't enough for them to contend with they will also have to confront the powerful High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Lwuji), who originally created Rocked as part of his scheme to genetically engineer a master race.

The ensemble cast are all on especially fine for throughout. Each have made their roles their own now, the team dynamic of the Guardians is a joy to watch, and the humour comes thick and fast as well. James Gunn has clearly been given free reign to do whatever he wants with Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3, there's so much crammed in its a little overwhelming at times, but the fun and spectacle of it all is truly breathtaking. It's not all interstellar high jinks though, Gunn puts Star-Lord and Rocket through the emotional wringer. Peter is pining for the loss of his soulmate Gamora who died in Avengers Infinity War, adding insult to injury, he now has to cope with the face she's been replaced by the alternative timeline version of Gamora from Endgame who doesn't love him. Meanwhile, the emotional heart of the film comes from the disturbing flashbacks exploring Rockets origins which highlight the terrible trauma and circumstances that made him into a the kick-ass raccoon we know today. Rocket's origin story is a harrowing and deeply emotional journey to witness as it unfolds, and its is this powerful underlying narrative that really drives the plot.

With its frenetic action, amazing special effects, and great soundtrack Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 is everything fans could've hoped for and then some. Sure, the plot dose't always quite hold together as well as it could've and the third act drags a little bit, but James Gunn has still managed to skilfully dodge the pitfalls of the threquill to deliver a fitting finale and entertaining intergalactic adventure on the wackier side of the MCU!","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
127,2.0,11-May-23,"While I had a great time with Guardians 1 and 2 and enjoyed the unique qualities of both of those movies, 3 kept throwing in something dumb. I felt like someone listening to drunk uncle Jimmy, giving a toast at a wedding just cringing at each hint of idiocy. Was it fun? Yes. Entertaining? For sure. And while listening to Uncle Jimmy's speech makes one laugh out loud occasionally, you still sit uncomfortably waiting for the lunacy to ruin the whole thing. That's a little bit how I felt watching this movie. The dumbness never ruined the movie however, just made it weak.

I could list those instances but it would sound like nit picking and most of them would only serve to spoil things, or seem irrelevant. They made the movie feel rushed to me. Even the editing was all over the place.

For a movie to get a 7 or above from me, it will be because it took me for a ride, or exceeded my expectations, maybe even changed how I think about things. This movie made me sit and wish for it to get better, to do something more than just stimulate my optical senses. You should never have to ""root"" for a movie or hope that it gets better, and certainly never have to look at your watch, and while I had fun (and maybe that's all that matters), I also did all those things.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

Left the theatre thinking I could of cared less if I had seen it or not. Gone is the good feeling you get watching the first two. And the ending?

This is easily the best movie from marvel since No Way Home, the way you are constantly on the edge of your seat hoping nothing bad is going to happen to your favourite characters, one minute your laughing and the next your literally fighting back tears, all done in typically beautiful James Gunn fashion.

This is a fitting end for the guardians and rounds the trilogy off beautifully, I loved every moment of this emotional rollercoaster and to be honest it was almost as good as the first instalment, I hope to see the guardians again in the future but only if James Gunn is at the helm.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

Now after having Peter's backstory earlier in the series, we shift to Rocket and while my expectations were low for whatever his 'reveal' was, they were totally exceeded by a beautiful, touching and heartbreaking tale of how Rocket came to be the angry hero we all came to know in the MCU.

It's a shame this film was released somewhat out of sync with an ideal release flow after end game. We could of done with this as a kind of 'encore' to the main story of The Avengers and not had to so sit through some of the other films released in between End Game and G3.

But Guardians 3 stays true to the original vibe of fun, ridiculous, touching, better than you expect cinema that started with the first film.

In terms of the MCU. It's done. Every film released since End Game other than this has been awful. So if like me you have gone from MCU fan to angry to now apathetic, use Guardians 3 as the send off and final instalment of what was a brilliant series of comic book stories.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

Volume 3 hasn't changed my opinion of the series - it's another loud, flashy, action-packed explosion of CGI, with a catchy soundtrack and lots of the same brand of humour that hasn't worked for me in either of the previous films, and it left me rather bored at times.

At two hours and thirty minutes, it really is way too long for this kind of popcorn nonsense: director James Gunn lets scenes go on and on and on, resulting in a movie more bloated than Starlord's face when he sucks on the vacuum of space. I reckon I would have liked the film more had they trimmed a good half-an-hour to forty-five minutes (virtually every scene could do with tightening). When Gunn is on form - most notably, the visually breathtaking Beastie Boys-backed fight scene and Rocket rescuing the baby raccoons (very touching) - the film works well, but there are too many moments that drag, often as a result of the lame comedy (Drax reclining on the sofa THREE times, Mantis repeatedly landing clumsily).

In my opinion, the best thing about the film is its soundtrack - Alice Cooper, Rainbow, Faith No More, The Beastie Boys and The Flaming Lips!

There's a bit of everything in here, from laugh out loud gags, to exciting and colorful action, to moments that make you cry.

The cast is brilliant as always, with every character playing an important role in the Guardians adventure, but it is Rocket who is finally provided with some backstory, that greatly strengthens his character, as well as the characters around him.

135,9.0,6-Aug-23,"What was fun novelty, a combination of Earth American music, wacky characters and impossible odds backed by the special effects from Marvel and a lot of cameos, now feels tired and overstretched. What was fresh and subtle now it's pouring tastelessly on your head. Everything, from the classic music hits, the gags, the action scenes, the special effects, they just come at you from all directions all the time. And it's not really fun. It is just exhausting.

I don't know what went wrong, was it the editing? Was it supposed to be a magnum opus of 4 hours or something and then it was cut to shreds? Was is James Gunn going all out with no oversight and no one to tell him he goes overboard? The characters start of as damaged and annoying, frustrated as well as frustrating, only to then change leaf whenever the story needs it to. The slow motion purposeful walking scenes with an oldie but goldie soundtrack doesn't do it anymore and not when it happens again and again and again. The villain jumps from being god-like to a silly little man. The monsters from super powerful to one shot kills. And there are so so so many characters that mean nothing to me.

There were some genuinely wonderful scenes in the film, but few and far between. I hope with fresh new ideas, not like the Guardians, James Gunn is going to resurrect Disney, but at the same time I fear its too late, that he's already spent and corrupted by a system that rewards formulaic quantity to any semblance of creative quality. I like the guy's work, but for me this film has been more miss than hit.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
136,7.0,28-Dec-23,"FILM: 8.5/10.

Embarking on my rewatch of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, I'm thrilled to report that this cosmic adventure is nothing short of an absolute blast. Director James Gunn has once again worked his magic, delivering a perfect concoction of heart, humour, and intergalactic action that defines the franchise.

From the opening scene to the final credits, the film is a wild ride that never loses momentum. Rocket, voiced by the impeccable Bradley Cooper, takes center stage with a story arc that adds surprising emotional depth to this already beloved character. Gunn explores Rocket's inner struggles, making audiences feel for this CGI raccoon more than some flesh-and-blood beings.

Visually, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a spectacle. The cosmic landscapes burst with vibrant colours, immersing the audience in a mesmerizing universe filled with strange creatures and breathtaking locales. The action sequences, whether in space or on solid ground, are a visual feast that effortlessly combines thrilling combat with the trademark humor of the Guardians.

The chemistry among the cast remains as potent as ever. The familiar faces - Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Vin Diesel, and Karen Gillan - effortlessly slide back into their roles, infusing each character with their unique charm. The introduction of new characters breathes fresh dynamics into the team, enriching the overarching narrative.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 strikes a perfect balance in storytelling, seamlessly blending lighthearted comedy with poignant character development. Themes of family, redemption, and sacrifice are expertly woven into a narrative that keeps you engaged and emotionally invested.

While some may find certain sequences, particularly those involving Rocket, a tad gratuitous given Marvel's family-friendly approach, the film remains a gripping and impactful experience. So, strap in, hold on tight, and enjoy this final interstellar joyride with the Guardians that hits all the right notes.

138,8.0,3-May-23,"When it came out in 2014, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" far exceeded most people's expectations. Don't get me wrong, it's not an earth-shattering masterpiece by any means, but its clever humor, endearing camaraderie between its quirky heroes, entertaining use of 80s music, and uniqueness compared to other Marvel films made it a breath of fresh air that many people really enjoyed. The second film was not as good as the first, but still enjoyable enough. Unfortunately, the third film is very disjointed and lacks any semblance of a compelling overarching story to really work. While devoted Marvel fans will probably enjoy it more than I did, I view the film as overall further evidence of the MCU's decline in quality since the Infinity Saga.

In this film, the Guardians have to embark on a mission to protect (an injured) Rocket Raccoon from an evil villain, the High Evolutionary. The film alternates between garden-variety CGI/action setpieces and some surprisingly dark flashbacks to Rocket Raccoon's earlier life. Some viewers will be surprised by these flashbacks and find them to be more disturbing than they would expect from a ""Guardians"" movie. I do not think these scenes push the boundaries of the PG-13 rating (""The Batman,"" for example, contains scenes far more disturbing and graphic,) but parents bringing younger children starting to watch Marvel movies should note that their children could find them upsetting. The juxtaposition between the lighter humor and fun of the Guardians and these more tragic, trauma-based moments does not exactly work very well, since the plot is not compelling enough overall to justify the continued plot progression on both ends. The film's overall story is very generic and forgettable, and significant portions of the film feel surprisingly rather pointless in contributing to the such story. These concerns are intensified by the fact that the third act is pretty weak, and the first two acts don't really build up to it much.

The writing and humor are much weaker than the previous two ""Guardians"" films, especially the first one. The comedy here feels surprisingly forced and lazy, rather than genuine and clever. Additionally, at two and a half hours (longer than both of the first two films,) the film's runtime really does overstay its welcome, especially given the relative lack of a consistently compelling plot--or even significant attempts at plot structure. The film still has some mildly entertaining set pieces and a great soundtrack, so it's not a total misfire by any means, but it's very disappointing compared to the previous two ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" films--especially considering how much less than the sum of its parts this film feels. 5.5/10

But going back to Black Widow, the ability to tell an exciting and victorious Good vs. Evil story seems to have left the building.

Guardians of the galaxy 3 is adventurous, tragic, emotional and funny at the same time. I'm happy to say, that after a lot of MCU movies from the previous 2 years that didn't work for me, that this movie is still worth watching.

Not any hate to Marvel, because I truly do love it, but the year of shows and franchise expansions has taken a rather deep toll, but I'm glad to see it back, where I belongs...","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

When I watched the trailer for the first time I didn't understand too well how they were going to show all the different part's from rocket's backstory to the alien people that Drax offends, and even to Gamora, but the movie made it summed the movie up well.

And the more adult footprint, better dialogs, better characterization, ambient. .

Kind off bored watching the last movies of Marvel, all plastic and forced situations.

Here, we go back to the ""adult simplicity"" off fun. And the hole history of Rocket, pretty nice. I sincerely preferred movies made for more specific audience. That way, you can make movies who really ""talk"" with your audience and don't try speak the same ""language"" with everyone. I think it was the best part. See ya.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
153,1.0,6-May-23,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 gives audiences much of what it has given them in the previous installments.

Once again the music is good and ties into the action sequences giving the scenes a bit more life. There are some good laughs in this film, personally the funniest was Dave Bautista. He doesn't deviate from what he has done in the previous films and I was always waiting for him to deliver his lines. There were some moments with other characters where the humor was forced but overall it felt organic.

I enjoyed how Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana were able to display their chemistry even with their dynamic relationship. The rest of the guardians were great especially when it came to the action sequences. There are a couple tag team moments that were visually pleasing.

The majority of this film focuses on Rocket and how he came to be. With the use of flashbacks his backstory is pieced together to give some emotional moments.

All of the character designs are well put together except for some of the guards in a certain scene that look like they are just humans wearing weird bubble suits. The best character design by far was the main villain played by Chukwudi Iwuji. I really enjoyed his look and his story in this movie. Personally I wanted him to be more fierce considering he was the main villain. Sean Gunn who played Kraglin was another character I wanted more from although he wasn't disappointing.

The one character that did disappoint was Will Poulter as Adam Warlock. I wouldn't blame Poulter, I felt he did what was asked of him as an actor. I put blame on the writers. Adam Warlock was an underwhelming character that only served as a very weak comic relief.

His character arc was predictable and his scene involving Chris Pratt towards the end of the film was one of the weaker moments.

Overall, I think this movie is just good. I would say it's just slightly above okay.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

Lots of jokes, light hearted and this has less of that. The jokes in this movie are dragged out and feel forced.

The high evalutionary is not a great villain, it's just a big man child. I don't think you can blaim the actor though. The same issue is there with Adam Warlock. It is a child and nothing more, there are a few nice moments but for me it felt like these two characters where just in it because the movie needed a villain, but at no point you feel the urgency or any form of threat level.

At last, the ending was real anti climactic. It felt a bit like end game in the sence it looked like they said goodbye after 20 movies. For me this was a bit drawn out.

160,9.0,5-May-23,"The best MCU film since ""No Way Home"". This film was about everything I wanted it to be. It was very emotional and deep in a much different manner then I expected. I teared up more then once while watching this film. This is without a doubt the best looking MCU film in a while. The cinematography is amazing! The CGI/green screen is excellent! I didn't detect a single flaw with what they were able to achieve in that category. The action sequences were very well executed, especially one where all the Guardians are fighting together and it looks like it's all one take. The flashbacks involving Rocket's past were very difficult to watch. Very emotional and dark. What made it work really well was not the voice acting but how they made Rocket look and how they treated him. The stakes were never higher in any other Guardians movie but this, which made the intensity and emotions all pay mush well together. The humor worked very well, which can be hard for a film that is very emotional. James Gunn's direction and style made it all work. As for flaws, I found the villian weak as I couldn't connect with him whatsoever. I just didn't care about him and found him pretty useless. Will Poulter plays Adam Warlock and he's very good. It's just that the character is extremely underutilized. I thought there would be a lot of him in this film but there's actually not and they didn't really know what they were doing with him. There's also some plot holes where exposition was required in certain scenes, which is never a good thing. Besides that, this was a really good movie that I absolutely enjoyed from start to end. It's also very fast paced. This film moves and not a single scene drags. Is it the best Guardians movie? I don't think so but it's still up there and one of the better MCU films we've had as of late.

The backstory alone is dark and incredibly sad at times, bringing tears to my eyes at several points throughout the film. James Gunn once again delivers very beautiful cinematography and I hope they delve into the history of the Colony again in the future. When Adam Warlock finally appears in the MCU, there will most likely be some cameos. It offers traditional Guardians humor, but this movie is for a more mature audience.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
162,6.0,8-Aug-23,"Aside from the usual Marvel formula of bantering camaraderie, heroic sacrifice, this movie tries to explore, both emotionally and intellectually, a basic idea of rights and worth, so far as life itself is concerned.

At one point in the movie, angered by Nebula's shoving of Drax, Mantis screams ""You have no right to push him"" before she goes off to scold her for failing to understand that the worth of a life isn't measured on a scale of intellect or utility (competence).

""It's all for a purpose""... At the beginning of the movie we see defenseless animals being tortured, killed and discarded like some lab equipment since this supposedly served a higher purpose of helping more worthy creatures to exist. There's no sugar coating here, it's what we do on a daily basis to many animals we arbitrarily decide have lesser worth thus should/could be used in service of higher life forms such as ourselves.

It should come as no surprise, but with a thick odor of hypocrisy, that we see the poor Soviet dog (Cosmo based on the real life counterpart Laika) sent to her horrible death with the perfectly acceptable excuse that it served the advancement of mankind, much like the tens of thousands of animals tortured in much worse ways in the collective west up until that day.

At the end, we see the arbitrary line of worthiness move towards much uncomfortably humanoid life forms as it has happened following the breakthrough years of the so-called enlightenment, the greater good of the selected few always being the go-to excuse of those with the power to inflict damage and destruction.

The native americans, aboriginal peoples all had to make way to the ""superior"" white man in its quest for advancement and perfection. In this sense, the emotionally charged yet superficial exploration of animal rights begs a really important question.

If we aren't to have any moral qualms over imposing our dominance over lesser beings on the grounds that they are ""less"" of what we deem worthy, what is the point of stopping at other human beings with similar characteristics for simply being classified as part of our species? There seems to be no objective line that could be crossed in this pursuit if this argument is to be accepted.

Laika was a stray dog someone strapped on to a spacecraft, primarily because they could and because they deemed it to be necessary for the advancement of Soviet civilization. In the absence of a Laika, or in the instance that human subjects are easier and more reliable, I'm sure even any western nation pretending to be for human rights and individual freedom wouldn't hesitate to come to a similar conclusion. Oh right they have, many times... Tuskagee syphilis experiments, the American nuclear guinea pigs, countless other instances of psychological abuse in the name of experimentation, the list is endless.

I hope this movie serves as a mainstream device of at least getting people to notice the very obvious link between treating animals as convenient utilities and treating humans as such. For all our pretentious moralistic grandstanding disguised in our fake self-righteous outrage, the intelligent among us realize there is no objective difference.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

164,6.0,31-Jan-24,"It is obvious that mcu has gone downhill and made a mess of things as it entered the series period after Endgame. They completely ruined the multiverse fiction that they tried to put at the center in the new phase. The accusations against the actor who played the main villain of the new phase were the last nail in the coffin of that long-running fiction structure of the mcu. What saved this movie was that it told an independent story without getting involved in all of this. And achive to make good use of one of the most interesting villains they have.

The movie looks very good visually and the actors do their part very well. That is given. They were always successful visually and in casting good actors. They handled a subject that touches the soft spot of people who sensitive about animal testing and ethics very well, with a villain in a comic book style that suits them. It's very clearly a children's movie. This is a genre and it does not mean that the movie is bad or only children should watch it.

167,1.0,20-Aug-23,"The first Guardians film is one of my favorite movies of all time. It has such an incredible ensemble of comedy, music, campiness and heart that resulted in what to me is a perfect film. Easily in my top 10 along side Empire Strikes Back and Shawshank.

Volume 2 was great as well, but began to show the limits of Gunn's follow through. It overplayed the comedy, and didn't feel like an adventure.

Volume 3 is unfortunately even more subpar for the trilogy. From the beginning scenes, it felt rushed and contrived. From there on the whole film circled around Rocket's backstory which after the whole Ego thing, seemed quite repetitive. The story really only became a ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" in the last 20mins or so, and that was really just a convenient circumstance.

Sure Rocket's backstory pulled some heartstrings, but it also left the rest of the film scrambling to make sense of it all and create a plot with it. The humor was attempted, the plot was contrived, and the characters all felt like they were just their for a ride rather than driving the story with their decisions.

Vol. 3 is a disappointing end to the trilogy. Certainly better than any recent MCU film, but by far the weakest in the trilogy. Oh well.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

171,6.0,10-Jan-24,"If someone talked about Guardians of the Galaxy in 2013, it is certain that very few people would know how to describe this group of heroes. Released in 2014, the first Guardians was the film fans needed, at the right time. Who would have thought that a tree, a raccoon, a daughter of Thanos, a looter and a vengeful father would dictate the tone of team-up films for years to come, and become part of pop culture history once and for all. Now, almost a decade after that beginning, the story of the most misfit characters in the galaxy comes to an end with a bang. Without further ado, ""Guardians of the Galaxy 3"" is a work with soul, charisma, personality and love. It's a film that closes arcs and consolidates that team as the most important after the Avengers.

Proposed as the last part of a trilogy, ""Volume 3"" comes to close the Guardians of the Galaxy Trilogy in a more than worthy way, delivering the arc closures that each of its components deserved, including Gamora from another universe (Zoe Saldana). While the film itself has its stumbles, almost all of them due to the typically Hollywood bloat of Gunn's script, it is clearly noticeable the filmmaker's affection for the characters he made popular by inserting his brand of playful humor and lots of music into the film's DNA. His (re)creations, as he tries his best to dedicate this second sequel to each of them almost equally, from Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) to Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper), through Drax (Dave Bautista), Mantis (Pom Klementieff) and Groot (Vin Diesel) and reaching Nebula (Karen Gillan) who has her participation and importance greatly expanded. Even Cosmo (Maria Bakalova), included in the ""Holiday Special"" to more directly pay homage to the dog Laika on whom the original character was based) and Kraglin Obfonteri (Sean Gunn) have great space in the film to show their value.

""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes it easy to ignore its missteps thanks to its huge setbacks. Aware of what the public expects from a group adventure, James Gunn brings back the renowned mix of superhero, science fiction and comedy with touches of nostalgia. A formula improved throughout the trilogy and which reaches its peak here. The first proof that the film hits the target is in the evolution of its characters. Unlike other Marvel heroes, who seem to regress with each film, each member of the team carries with them the growth acquired throughout the journey. A rewarding feeling that enhances the experience by valuing the background of the characters and the audience that has followed them for years. It's a relief to see the maturation of names like Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) and Nebula (Karen Gillan), who could easily go through the entire MCU following the basic characteristics of when they were introduced. The same happens to Groot (Vin Diesel), Drax (Dave Bautista) and Mantis (Pom Klementieff), who develop new characteristics without abandoning the comic relief. Even Gamora (Zoe Saldana), who has a plausible reason to regress, brings a complexity that avoids the taste for repetition.

The evolution of the characters is accompanied by the growth in the scope of the production - something that seemed unlikely considering that the Guardians' setting is literally the Galaxy. In his last round with the characters, Gunn commands each sequence with as much excitement as possible, using different tools to keep the viewer involved, dazzled and surprised. Sometimes all of this together. Not surprisingly, the director makes the bold decision to treat ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" as a true biblical epic. There is a constant feeling that the characters are dealing with things larger than life, including events that make direct parallels with Christian scriptures without sounding corny. An approach that highlights the grandeur with which the director sees the work and that makes perfect sense with the film's major conflict: the confrontation with the creator himself.

Although Gunn maintains his comedic signature, the backdrop of the third ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" film is the darkest and most sinister of all, as Rocket's past, seen in the character's memories and hallucinations, is a horror festival with extremely cruel experiments on animals at the hands of a villain obsessed with creating the perfect breed, a true space Dr. Moureau. In fact, Dr. Moureau is not enough to characterize the insane character that Iwuji embodies in a frightening way, varying between glassy eyes and complete insanity, as he is more like an animal Dr. Mengele, a monster capable of anything to, in fact, his crazy head, acting as God. If the MCU has largely always failed its villains, here Gunn sculpts an irredeemable figure, someone who anyone would be very happy to slaughter and who the script, unlike the current irritating craze, doesn't dedicate a single piece of dialogue to creating an ""explanation"". For him to be as he is. It is evil in its pure form, with no greater plans than those dictated by his horrible and perverse obsession, something that works especially well considering that the central theme of the film is, as cliché as it may sound, the love we feel for the members of our family, whether by blood or by the one we choose to belong to.

While the big villain really deserves all our anger, the variety of settings and creatures - something not exactly uncommon in the Guardians of the Galaxy films - deserves all the praise, especially as it is even greater here. Not only Knowhere, which appears only at the beginning and at the end, comes to life under the ""government"" of the Guardians, with streets, alleys and a thriving population that convinces even knowing that it is inside the basically rotting skull of a Celestial, but the other scenarios are also worth taking off your hat. There is the aforementioned space mega-laboratory that is ""built"" from living mass and, therefore, is basically just disgusting, giving a thousand opportunities to designers who opted for a bizarr* kits*h approach; there is Counter-Earth and its population of animals genetically and cybernetically altered by the High Evolutionary, with the prosthetics, makeup and practical effects team probably having to work more than 24 hours a day to create what we see on the big screen and there is, finally , the villain's ship which, despite being the typical ""bandit headquarters"", with even a color palette that doesn't allow us to forget that for a second, gains extra layers for also being a horrible laboratory prison where he carries out his experiments on living beings, basically Dr. Moreau's island or, of course, Dr. Mengele's extermination camp.

Even though it doesn't forcefully open spaces for the entry of other figures from the Marvel Universe, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" certainly takes a step towards the future. Furthermore, the threat is not a being with unimaginable powers that can decimate part of the galaxy with the snap of a finger or someone with the ability to freely move through the multiverse. In this third solo adventure of the Guardians of the Galaxy, the enemy symbolizes the barrier to be overcome for the new hero to rise to protagonism. There is a psychoanalytic aspect to this idea of a ""son"" subjugating the oppressive figure of the ""father"" in search of emancipation. Therefore, Rocket is placed against a recent trend at Marvel, that of elaborating on the emotional and psychological maturation of superheroes through fatherhood. He is the creation, the creature that needs to rebel against the purposes of the crazy replica of Dr. Frankenstein in order to step out of the shadow and take his rightful place in the sun. But, before the warrior raccoon rises up and takes up arms, we have good doses of action packed with a very special soundtrack and recurring jokes with the characters' weaknesses. Quill meets Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Nebula (Karen Gillan) seems jealous, Drax (Dave Bautista) remains clueless and Mantis (Pom Klementieff) gains deserved prominence. James Gunn's irreverent touch continues to work.

It doesn't take long to realize that Marvel's newest feature film is a watershed in the group's history. Especially in the third act, death and separation are constant elements. Still within the personality imprinted by James Gunn in a calculated universe so prone to standardization, the digital effects are well combined with the practical ones in order to not leave the feeling of a textured screen in the scenarios and fights. The action appears to offer catharsis in circumstances in which we are called upon to root for redemptions, comebacks and the unlikely victory of the misfits over the figure who claims the right to sit on the throne destined for divinities. This ""Vol. 3"" does not present anything so new, as its guiding principle is to maintain the coherence established by the two features that preceded it. Including the communist bi*ch boosted by telekinetic powers (she could be better used in the plot), the film emphasizes friendship as fundamental to the Guardians' success. Resonating something from Rocket's sad past, James Gunn defends the idea that family is what welcomes and supports us, not necessarily the other branches and roots of our family tree.

Navigating between comedy, action and even horror, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" presents its final card: emotion. Doing justice to the franchise, which is full of simple and moving moments, the final chapter is not far behind. Despite following a path that occasionally borders on the appealing in terms of suffering, the narrative builds moments of genuine emotion. A commotion that varies with the level of attachment to the characters, but that can easily bring tears. It is with this mixture that the Guardians of the Galaxy - at least this version of the team - say goodbye to the Marvel universe.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

179,9.0,3-Sep-23,"Gunn's farewell to these characters and universe accomplishes everything it aimed for amidst the mediocrity of the MCU post-Endgame. It's clear that there is passion behind this work, there is love for these characters, and there is a desire to do their stories just and set them off in the most caring way possible.

Every character gets their moment to shine and is provided a satisfying arc conclusion, you believe these relationships because Gunn has been able to guide the audience throughout his trilogy to fully care for how things might turn out for the Guardians. The action is highly kinetic and energetic, I loved how he fully utilised the IMAX scenes with incredible use of scope. The hallway scene is undeniably a highlight as well. Bright and colourful, the set design stands out as probably the most creative of the MCU by far, especially the sequence at the OrgoCorp headquarters.

The story develops in a very organic way, even if it focuses on Rocket for the majority of it, it still feels balanced despite feeling like there were too many flashbacks during the first watch. The High Evolutionary's performances was better this time too. The Counter-Earth segment is still creepy, weird stuff o look at. A bit too long, but it has to accomplish a lot, Gunn has to deal with consequences from previous instalments and other projects that affect his characters. Everything with how Gamora and Quill's relationship was really well handled and interwoven, but as for Adam Warlock, not so much.

I've grown accustomed to the regular ""Gunn-isms"" that are present in each of his films, but Vol.3 shines as an example of how important passion is, especially when making a comic book blockbuster, without it, many like the failures being released nowadays, won't stand the test of time, but this has a strong chance of doing so.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 delivers splendid action, emotional weight and great CGI. The story is incredibly cohesive, direction is strong and humor is as punchy as in the first two movies. A real space extravaganza!

Character development is great and the chemistry is there at all times. Also, I hope to see more from Adam Warlock in the MCU.

It looks at the frailties of some of the characters and develops them further without removing the fun and the action from the first installment. Whilst the focus of the first 2 films was on Peter and the relationship with Gamora, this film was focussed on anothers back story.

The music, the action, the settings did not disappoint. I would say that I'm a fan of the franchise, and whilst for some scenes, seeing the earlier films would have helped, you dont need to do this as a prerequisite.

The Rocket backstory was of course horrifying and extremely sad. Was this the first time Adam Warlock was in anything related to MCU? He just kind of shows up with no preamble or anything. The High Evolutionary was badass and psychopathic. Nathon Fillion was a fun addition, though his security suit and that whole planet or whatever seemed unnecessarily corny/eccentric, but I'm guessing that's how it looked in the comics so I can't fault them for that. All in all, the movie was okay. The juxtaposition of horrific animal abuse and slapstick humor just didn't work for me. Definitely would not call this one of the best Marvel movies.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

They tried to go bigger and better but fail miserably and there is this annoying obsession with cracking jokes in every scene even if it doesnt go with the scene. It's like they've thrown everything they had with them into the film hoping something would stick. At the end you realise there really is a ""Marvel fatigue"" and you'd want to forget there was a part 3 to the series on the plus side you'll forget the entire film after a day anyway.

I'm very disappointed as really enjoyed part 1 and 2. The plots is bad from the beginning to the end and very predictable. Was checking my watch every few minutes as couldn't wait for the end.

192,1.0,4-May-23,"All Guardians of the Galaxy movies stand out among Marvel as especially relevant in themes and adept in conveying real emotional moments. This is largely thanks to the great writing and direction by James Gunn who delivers a great finale to the trilogy that will make you feel both sadness and joy but also again delivers strongly on the themes of family, friendship, dealing with grief, moving on from it and the value of kindness, which is already a great feat given the somewhat absurd setting of an action space opera.

There are many very very well written character moments especially for Rocket but for the other characters as well that and several moments that will make you choke up and even cry for either the tragedy or beauty of the moment if you allow yourself to dive into them.

The humor is again very well timed and unlike other Marvel movies does not take away from the more serious moments or overstay its welcome like in the recent Thor installment.

I love the direction they took for the characters as well and it gives Chris Pratt a couple of moments to shine as an actors who can be more than just funny (which he still is very much).

Although in terms of humor no one holds a candle to the absolute perfect timing and intonation of Dave Bautista who I very much admire both for his performance but also his integrity around the Gunn firing and re-installment.

In closing if you enjoyed Guardians 1 and 2 this is the perfect closure for the trilogy that will make you laugh, cry and think a lot not just about animal testing but also (if you are dealing with that) might help you deal with emotions of grief and moving forward.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
193,7.0,5-Mar-24,"The last(?) Guardians of the Galaxy movie isn't perfect, but bursts with creativity as a sprawling sci-fi epic with a very well done social commentary element about animal testing involving Rocket's tragic past. Gunn wears his heart on his sleeve and his love for these characters unwaveringly shines through in an earnest way. He's also kind of a madman who came from a shock humor background, so has no qualms with disturbing content or making the audience uncomfortable at times, but being such a talented writer/director he always makes it poignant and worth it in the end. III is the messiest and least consistent of the trilogy, but is still a great Marvel superhero film, the best since Endgame, with all the heart, action, comedy, and visually stunning imagery you could want.

Guardians III begins pretty randomly with Rocket suddenly being attacked and put into a coma, jolting Peter Quill out of a drunken stupor over Gamora's absence and leading the charge to save him. The old Gamora who returned in Endgame returns, and the way her story with Quill goes is well handled and ends in a surprisingly mature note. But what follows the initial attack is a series of strange and visually creative adventure set pieces as the Guardians gradually learn about Rocket's past and must find the way to save his life. These events are interspersed with heartbreaking flashbacks to Rocket's time being experimented on and made into the conscious life form he became. The villain in the present and the flashbacks is the Grand Inquisitor, a megalomaniac obsessed with creating perfect life forms and planetary societies at terrible costs. He's easily the most despicable antagonist of any Marvel movie and well acted by Chukwudi Iwuji.

The commentary on animal testing and experimentation is conveyed pretty brilliantly in the larger context of this colorful, absurd sci-fi galaxy setting. The climax is more satisfying than the typical comic book movie fare as a result, especially the recent ones, and when our heroes prevail and win the day, it actually feels meaningful and earned because these characters have been lovingly written and brought to life by people who care for 10 years now. Gunn is highly skilled at balancing various tones and really going for emotional impact, also fearless with being unabashedly bizarre and pushing the envelope. The first two Guardians were more fluid and focused, but this final chapter still embodies all those strengths and wraps up this team's saga beautifully.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

196,1.0,18-May-23,"Marvel cinematic universe has produced more than 30 movies and new projects may not please your eye anymore. In spite of being a part of this universe, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" have always stood apart from the rest of superhero movies. It's because of the heartwarming atmosphere, amazing soundtrack, humor, ironic attitude of the characters and exciting space battles.

It is all the more surprising that the final part of the trilogy, directed by James Gann, turned out to be darker and more dramatic than expected. The film raised essential questions about the place of individuals in a huge evil world, the absurdity of the idea of an ideal society, and the importance of the life of every species as well. Even though the creators used obviously manipulative techniques to play on the emotions of the viewer, I would say that storyline of Rocket the Raccoon is the main advantage of the film and it really touches you. And I can't help saying that story wouldn't be so emotional and terrifying without an amazing voice acting cast.

However, the main theme of the third volume is definitely friendship. Star Lord is no longer the main character and Gann has focused on developing all the team characters.

The main cast, Dave Batista (Drax), Pom Klementieff (Mantis), and Karen Gillan (Nebula), got more screen time, and they performed brilliantly and look very harmonious. Above all, Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. The High Evolutionary, creating a new world inhabited by a perfect race, makes you hate him. Although he is absolutely disgusting because of his actions, he is still attractive at the same time. I could add him to the collection of the most unpleasant villains from the comics.

'Guardians' cause empathy and they sincerely please you with their appearance on the screen. The visual effects team did an amazing job bringing to life the fantastical universe. And what's more, the view of bio-structural planet was breathtaking and I felt like a child looking at the pictures in an anatomy book for the first time. The film ends very poetically with the song that opened the first film.

In my opinion, this is a very worthy conclusion to the story, the best film of the trilogy, and one of the best films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

The story is simple, the solutions to problems are simple. The world is absurd again and I think the actors are reaaly enjoying themselves. Combined with great special effects, it must be a great movie right?

It tells Rockets story which is very dark, as you would expect but worse.

It changes and opens up the characters. That took a bit to make me like their new and expanded personalities. My least favorite character is Daxx and I even liked him.

201,6.0,12-Sep-23,"Guardians of the Galaxy 3 isn't just the best Marvel movie for me, but my No 1 movie ever, dethroning Drive from that spot. The reason? Rocket...

Rocket is my favorite character ever because he is me (and also more adorable, more smart and more couragious, I'm not any of those things).

He is me though because I'm a misunderstood little man that pushes everyone away, being a jerk and a smartass to most people because i don't want to experience loosing my friends and being left alone, outcasted by everyone because I'm different, weird and unfitting as it happened on my childhood...

And what happens to Rocket in this trilogy is my ultimate fantasy. Finding people who slowly will love me so much that are able to sacrifice everything for me as i would do for them. Almost impossible in real life but having 3 movies (more if you count the Avengers movies that the guardians take part) that portrayed my fantasy it's just the recipe for the ultimate entertainment package. (Plus triple the action, the jokes and drama from the other movies).

So i have to thank with all my heart all the cast and crew (maybe James Gunn a bit more then any other) for creating something that i can rewatch a million times and hope that in a galaxy far far a way, an alternative me had experienced the love and recognition that Rockets has in this marvelous trilogy...

Thank you all...

Rocket Raccoon's story finds its completion and it is utterly beautiful, relatable and consoling. It helped me find renewed meaning in life in spite of the presence of suffering. It made me feel in such a way as I have not felt before. Rocket is a beautifully written character.

The only major strike against the movie is the High Evolutionary, who has little to do with his comic counterpart; this villain is just more of a psychopath with lots of resources. But it does lead to one of the most epic space fights I've ever seen, so I'll allow it. Well, that and the Stallone cameos.

Watching the movie was truly a phenomenal emotional experience and gave me back my childly love for Comic book characters. I laughed, and I cried. I especially want to acknowledge the greatness of the fight coordinators and the visual effect specialists that worked on this movie, as their work has left me truly speechless and amazed. Even the camera movements alone is something to admire. The writers themselves have brilliantly given us a story arc for each character to be satisfied with. The perfectly timed humor and emotional scenes, which I believe is courtesy of the brilliant director James gunn, is something that all future directors of Marvel should learn from, especially if they want to keep up the quality in the franchise (looking at you, Thor love and thunder). I truly believe that if Marvel studios learn to let go of their unnecessary desire to push a political agenda, and makes sure to keep the quality of visual effect, writing and fight choreography high just like in this movie, there just might be a chance to revive people's love and hype for this franchise.

Many films and TV wanted to indicate political correctness but did not finish their inborn missions. However, Guardians of the galaxy volume 3 did all them well. Particularly Rocket's story made me touched. I thought maybe Rocket's characterisation was the first three in marvel universe. Comparing with other elder super heroes, director Gunn used less time to portray Rocket's context. But he still accomplished this task. Other characters in the movie were also described wonderful.

Don't drink a full bottle of water at the start. The story is mostly about rocket and his abuse before he joined them. Everyone gets to talk about their feelings. A random need to find grandpa pops up for star lord. Still lots of action adventure as they fight their way through the raccoons abusers ship to get a code to help him survive a chest wound after said abusers wanted him back to learn how to make more. Sadly strange and creepy storyline. A few funny moments for comic relief. I see a possible spin off for Mantis as she had a bigger part this time around and seems to be the only one that hasn't done an interview saying goodbye and they will be happy to move on ( at least not that I've read). Things tied up ok in the end for the guardians but was basically anticlimactic.

I was seriously impressed by how good things were developing. But the movie falls off dramatically after the 1.5 hour mark. The humor, writing and overall plot becomes tedious, repetitive and boring compared to the first half of the movie. The editing is also terrible with scenes cutting off constantly to show another scene with more pointless dialogue and action. The action scenes are terrible to the point you can't see clearly what is happening on screen with very fast camera cuts and weird angles. The main villain of the movie is quite interesting with his overall ideas and motive, but his big drawback is that he isn't intimidating at all because he doesn't seem powerful enough to cause a threat to the Guardians squad, he or his soldiers.

The movie's runtime was extremely long based on it's plot and premise and should have been at least 30 min shorter. That would have helped the movie tremendously on being more tight and cohesive. Also the fight scenes and choreography needed to be a lot better. But that is a constant trend on recent MCU movies compared to the action scenes of Phases 1-3.

Marvel movies are so bad now, but this is incredibly funny (but not for dumba**es), its entertaining throughout, it's sweet and engaging, in fact it's only problem is that there is too much happening at once and you may not be able to follow.

It's the Marvel movie you expected 10 years ago, always something new, new action, new story, something that surprises you, here you go.

Funny, emotional, heart breaking and soul invigorating. Rocket is the real MVP. Congrats to the whole team, a superb ending to the trilogy.

It's been a serious while since I've seen a movie this good, and a movie that awakens all the feelings I felt only during my childhood, obsessed by super heroes. This is a real super hero movie; nothing comes easy. Sacrifice and companionship. Justice and pain. I'm so happy Guardians was the one trilogy that had this type of movie.

A nice plot but like eating a bowl of sugar, garlic, onion and cream; the sensations are intense but in primary colours.

There's scope for depth in the plot but it's not exploited through the characters and in 2½ hours, there was time to do it.

Take Groot, he looks great as a chad, so well rendered, but just not exploited. Nathan Fillion's character was more than an NPC but then gone. What was the point? Maybe this was 3½ hours cut down to 2½.

And maybe I'm old but the tunes didn't live up to the stature of previous tracks.

I've never posted before as have never felt the need too, even though I have seen a very high percentage of movies made, including every single marvel movie to date.

I have enjoyed them all and especially the incredible universe the team have created. My favourites being Guardians of the Galaxy 1, Thor: Ragnarok, Avengers: Endgame, to name a few.

But this is by far my absolute favourite by a long shot. It got it all perfectly spot on and I loved every minute of it. It ticked all the right boxes with a perfect balance of humour, action, and those moments where it tugged at those heart strings. It was intelligent, it gave back stories to to characters we've grown to love without even knowing any of this previously. It touched on so many relevant hierarchical struggles whilst also making you feel like there is hope. For me, this trilogy is my favourite and I am super excited to see where this goes next!

Watch the IMAX version on Disney+. It's 2.5 hours of pure entertainment, delivered perfectly and emotionally. Enjoy.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
227,1.0,17-May-23,"Why even make this movie if key elements of what made the first two so good aren't even it? We all know, and they go out of their way to repeat over and over again, that this isn't the same Gamora. And the movie is just not as good without her and her relationship with all the crew in general, and especially the very compelling relationship with Peter. It's bad enough to remove the two biggest stars from their biggest relationship roles in driving the franchise. They also take Rocket away from the crew for the vast majority of this movie as well. And he was the primary driver of so much of the rest of the relationships, not to mention the action and the fun. Mantis and Drax can't carry the whole movie any more than Nebula and, well, Nebula, as her character also suffers from the loss of her relationship with her sister Gamora. The Rocket backstory was interesting but it's not take up nearly half the movie with four brand new all CGI characters that pretty much only interact with each other interesting. The first act is mildly amusing and fun. The second act drags on forever. The only really good part is the final act when they are finally all back together in a way that vaguely resembles the action, fun, and spirit of the first two movies. In a way in glad this isn't doing as well at the box office as the other two because if this is the best they can do with these characters we don't need any more.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

Gotg Vol.3 is truly a fantastic experience. If you haven't seen it yet then do yourself a favor and watch the previous 2 Guardians of the Galaxy movies (Vol.1 & 2) so you can tie in what's going on in Vol.3 . You won't be disappointed.

231,6.0,8-Jul-23,"So given marvels recent few years of disappointments, endgame, Thor 4, Dr Strange 2 and Antman 3 I'm talking to you! I was as worried as most that the guardians final outing would possibly not live up to the greatness of volumes 1 & 2, especially given the delay with this last chapter due to Disney firing then rehiring James Gunn, proving once again how much of a mess they can make of things. However I am VERY happy to report, it's the BEST of the bunch! I don't really know where to start! It's got great action, the opening scene really kicks things off straight away! There's deep emotions on display particularly from Star Lord, but all get to show their fair share. And the comedy as usual is very funny and off the wall as with previous instalments. And finally as always yet again, the soundtrack rocks! James Gunn really has pulled out all the stops and gives the guardians the grand send off they all deserve. A word of warning tho to those wanting to show it to their young children, it does include marvels first f bomb, as well as some of the scenes are really quite dark which was surprising, but still great! Everyone in it gives great performances especially Adam warlock, although comic book fans may disagree with the direction of the character, I personally found him hilarious. The bad guy at times does border on the line of slightly of over acting occasionally but overall he's a good bad guy. It's bittersweet as it's the last guardians film but it is such a good final instalment, strongly confirming the guardians trilogy to be up there with some of the greats like the dark knight trilogy, Indiana jones, Star Wars etc. I've tried to keep this review as spoiler free as possible but fans of Firefly will love a few cameos! Anyway hopefully I've encouraged enough of you that you will have a good time watching this, if you don't, then watch it again just incase there's anything you may have missed! I'm very much hoping this gets released on bluray in 3D as it looks incredible in 3D also! I truly congratulate James Gunn on producing such a unique and brilliantly entertaining trilogy. It's going to be a long time until we get another trilogy that is this consistent with its quality and brilliance.

Unfortunately, this film doesn't stretch beyond it's comfort zone and feels much like the other two. Majority of Volume 3's story serves only as a vessel to setup the characters' expected mannerisms and banter with one another. The Rocket origin story pulls on dispirited kinship of cute, furry animals and emotions that are too forced feeling, with the obvious intention of drawing viewer investment into another trite save-the-galaxy storyline.

Because companies and their distributors get too afraid with ballooning movie budgets, and it creates a too many cooks in the kitchen atmosphere.

And movie studios are just too nervous to take a risk, or they just make the same crap because it's guaranteed to make money.

There is no art, there is no love or passion. It's just cold calculated money, and that's it.

There's a reason there aren't many new generation directors... and even if there are talented people... they pretty much all do television. Because of control.

This movie is BY FAR and away the best movie in the series... and the best Marvel movie... probably ever. And the reason is they just let the director do his thing. And it works... it will always work if that's what they do.

But they rarely do... and this movie is proof positive what happens if the big wigs with no talent just step back and allow the artists to create art. Like they used to... in the 70's... some 80's... and the 90's. Thank you for a trip down memory lane James Gunn... DC should be in good hands...

Film goes through each character's emotions and the actors were literally living in ther characters. The vol.3 is giving more priority to the past story of Rocket Raccoon which is not at all explored in any other parts of the MCU franchise.

Will Poulter as Adam Warlock was also another good thing i felt about the film. I'm not sure about his performance compared to comics , as i haven't read any of them , but it felt decent to me. I think the Warlock should've given more screen time or presence/impact in the story. But still , as he will be a Part of the future films , we can wait for the evaluation of his performance.

The use of free growing organic material for many different purposes is quite disgusting and very reminiscent of cancer growths. Too many details and too much dystopian cyberpunk apocalypse for my personal taste.

246,8.0,16-Aug-23,"The first GOTG was a milestone for the Marvel cinematic universe. It changed the style and trajectory of the overarching saga. This was a subtle change at first and the infinity saga was something of a 20- odd film masterpiece. Not every film (but as an overarching whole).

Thor: Love and Thunder was a great example of how far off the rails this new trajectory went... pop/ soft rock every other scene accompanied by dialogue and actions where well established characters act as if they are a pastiche of their former selves. GOTG Vol. 3 continues this trend, strangely Gunn appears to undermine his own creation (or this is how bad Vol 1 would've been had Gunn had full freedom at that point)?

Don't understand the high reviews: soft rock is definitely an over used trope here - regardless that GOTG introduced it. Far too many 'floaty' scenes added seemingly just to facilitate the soft rock tracks, CGI is OK, Nearly every character has to be 'kooky', the test lab stuff seems out of place here... strangely cruel whilst the rest of the film is 'goofy' and lacks weight.

This feels like it's truly the end for marvel. A run of homogenous multi-verse fillers where every character has to be wise-cracking or goofy and huge events have no real stakes. GOTG Vol 1's awesomeness was quite possibly the genesis of this decline and, sadly, GOTG vol. 3 May have been Marvel's last chance to rescue their ailing Universe. This pale imitation of GOTG Vol. 1 isn't going to do that.

The only negative here for me was the music, if Star-Lord had left earth in the 80's, how were there tracks from the 2000's on his player? Perhaps I'm missing something, but this jarred with me, plus the tracks used weren't as iconic as those in the previous films.

Yes, it pulls on the heartstrings with it's animal testing plot thread, but it feels out of place & doesn't actually let us into Rocket any deeper than we already were... especially given he's not in the movie very much at all.

266,9.0,8-Mar-24,"Guardians 3 looking back was an exploitative superhero space opera piece with lots of non-sense. But now, I see this movie as meaningful. But before that let's get to this.

The plot of Guardians 3 is about Rocket who gets totally injured and now the Guardians must look for a part that was connected to Rocket Raccoon's body and the only way to get it back is from his recreator High Evolution. A robot doctor who is given life and expirements on animals.

This movie is full of frequent scenes of animal creulty. When the Guardians aren't kicking but or talking about a relationship we don't care about there is Rocket's backstory of being molded into a cyborg beast along with his cyborg beast friends. This is a lot to take in since it's so dark and gritty.

Eventually High evolution finds out a more ethical way of making animals sentient and that's by Highly evolving them. Why didn't he think of that before?! It's in the name! Anyway, High Evolution and Rocket soon form a planet civilization that only Twitter Stan Furries could come up and it's an entire world of Humanoid animals living the most perfect life in the late 80's. Just like a show with ideal cartoon animals High evolution makes it real and it is rather uncanny. This says a lot about society even though his society isn't perfect. But Dr. H. E. Doesn't care about the planet.

267,1.0,11-May-23,"What a great see-off to the franchise!

There was no woke content, nothing was feeling forced and there was no holding back. There were serious moments, funny moments, fun within serious moments and a hidden seriousness within the fun moments.

There are great backstories to characters, and quick but sufficient followup to their redemption. This makes you almost forgive marvel for all the other movies they have been pushing out lately.

Even in the most serious situations, all characters stay their wit and never stop entertaining. There are no unnecessary characters either.

Go see it if you're a fan of Marvel Movies before the Endgame.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

I really liked it, even though it kinda broke my heart sometimes and usually I'm not a fan of movies that make me feel this way when it comes to animals, but this one was a good one. It still has humour like the rest of them which is important to me and the top reason I really like these movies. This is a little more depressing though than the others with a much more emotional plot in my opinion. I went from crying to laughing in a short time span, and they balanced it well.

269,1.0,16-Jul-23,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, helmed by the brilliant director James Gunn, catapults audiences on an intergalactic journey like never before.

The eclectic mix of nostalgic classics and original compositions elevates every scene, effectively enhancing the emotional beats and injecting an extra dose of energy into the Guardians' exploits.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 not only ties up loose ends from the previous films but also introduces new and compelling elements to the franchise. It successfully expands the Marvel Cinematic Universe, adding depth and complexity to its ever-growing cosmic landscape.

In conclusion, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a triumphant culmination of James Gunn's directorial prowess and the beloved Guardians' journey. It is a true testament to the power of storytelling, blending heart, humor, and spectacle into an extraordinary cinematic experience.

270,6.0,17-May-23,"I am really surprised at how many great reviews there are out here for the movie. I mean it wasn't a bad movie but it was not anywhere near the 1st two. It seems like they tried to mimic the DC comics which generally is more dark. This movie did not even come close to feeling like the first two which in of itself isn't a bad thing, but it was like couldn't decide what kind of movie they wanted so they split it down the middle. I guess I need to go back but another thing was all the swearing. I don't remember any swearing in the 1st 2 but it was predominate in 3. Also on of the more subtle things with the franchise was the sound track. They seemed to move away from that and why he had the recordings at all. I think like a lot of these kind of movies they rely on the CGI too much which this one did. The bad thing for me who was a big fan of the franchise I will not miss the fact that they will not be making #4 which is the rumor. Another thing, for me some of the characters are much better than others and they seemed like they wanted to evenly distribute the action between all of them which doesn't work for me either. They are called supporting roles for a reason. If they try to make spin off I will probably pass because I am sure none of them will be of the best characters.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

It's almost devastating that this is the final Guardiens movie. What will Marvel be without Groot, Racket, Drax, Ironman, Captain America, black widow etc. Etc.

I have my doubts, but if they'll continue delivering movies like the one I saw today, I don't think I will be disappointed.

This third installment captures some of the magic back. The funny scenes are funny and not forced. The music fits more with the action scenes. Character interactions seem more genuine, again. Despite this, and here's where Marvel just can't seem to get it right, anymore, the overall story is simply lame. Now, the origin story of Rocket is cool and very heart-warming and heart-wrenching...but you get the feeling the story was created to push ""another"" Hollywood, elite agenda. Unfortunately, with all of the agendas being pushed by Marvel it's inescapable to feel any other way. Marvel has been ruined and even a decent movie like this makes you cringe at the thought of being manipulated emotionally.

276,9.0,3-May-23,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 delivers all the humour and inventive action you expect but is at its strongest when exploring its darkest moments, offering an emotionally satisfying goodbye to the best family in the MCU as they all face the music and finally confront their trauma. It also feels like a vital piece of unchecked creativity in a cinematic universe growing increasingly stale.

The Guardians films have always stood out within the greater Marvel universe but after the hit and miss nature of phase 4 and phase 5 getting off to a terrible start with Quantumania, it's honestly kinda baffling that this beautiful, proactive and personal movie is even remotely linked to all of that.

Chris Pratt is just as strong as before as Peter Quill, there's always been a sadness beneath the charming exterior but after all the previous losses its starting to come to the surface in terrific fashion as he's determined to protect his family this time around. Zoe Saldaña's performance is a lot different to what's come before, giving this version of Gamora a fresh personality and relationship with the other Guardians.

Bradley Cooper as Rocket is the emotional core of this one, so much time is spent exploring his past and it leads to the most emotionally devastating moments and he absolutely brings it. Dave Bautista and Pom Klementieff remain really funny throughout but the film wisely still takes time to offer reminders of their dramatic chops as well.

Karen Gillan has only gotten better with each film and gets the most to do in this one. Seeing her grow from antagonist to equal has been one of the biggest and best surprises of the trilogy. Chukwudi Iwuji is an amazing villain, eschewing the usual tortured past of most villains for a character who is just plain evil and larger than life, played to perfection.

James Gunn's direction is incredible. He's clearly pushing himself creatively, technically and emotionally throughout to deliver the swansong these characters deserve and its so satisfying to watch. There's also a hallway fight done all in one take that's just one of the most thrilling things in the entirety of the MCU.

Definitely worthy of the mention is the CG, which is surprisingly good. Recently that has been on a major downward spiral for which Marvel can only blame themselves for their unreasonable deadlines and inability to plan. Which is why its so nice to see one of these where it looks good throughout, emphasising what can be achieved when these actually have a visionary with a plan.

Finally, the music by John Murphy shares more stylistically with The Suicide Squad opposed to Tyler Bates work on the previous 2 but it still remembers to use that iconic theme at the right moment and Awesome Mix - Vol 3 is excellent. No longer focusing on a single decade it creates something much more wild and unique.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

I love the other Guardians movies and James Gunn manages to wrap up their journey in a meaningfull, emotional and satisfying way! There were a lot of great and relevant themes that really made it a captivating and at times emotional watch! It is rare for a superhero movie to make you think about your life and choices quite like this one!

The movie also had its darker moments which i think suited the movie and made it a more mature experience while still making it fun and lighthearted and keeping the overall Guardians charm!

281,9.0,6-Aug-23,"I'm not a comic fan, and have never really gotten into the medium at all. I'm definitely one of those who enjoyed the MCU up to Endgame but has had major superhero fatigue for a while now. I watch most of the Marvel films because they are good cheap thrills, but... it is getting pretty stale.

Guardians 3 though, doesn't really feel like a Marvel film. The whole trilogy is clearly a part of Marvel, but it feels more like a space-opera. More like Star Wars, or Firefly, or something like that. James Gunn has done a wonderful job of building characters, storylines, and a world here, and in third film he goes even further.

One of the things I really like about this film is how it shows the consequences of past stories. Marvel has taken these characters on some major emotional rides since Infinity War, and Gunn is not afraid to show us how the characters have been affected, and how they have grown. I really like how each of the 'team' gets their own closure in their own way. Likewise, here, he delves into Rocket's backstory, which is one of the saddest things I've ever seen. This film has emotional impact far beyond a typical Marvel movie, and it is one of the best as a result.

The only critique I have is that the villain is a bit over the top. I at first would call him a Mengele, but Mengele was too banal for this. The villain here knows what he is doing and revels in it. On one hand, this is a good step away from Marvel humanizing many of its villains (even disagreeing with Thanos, for example, you can kind of see his point). Here, the villain has no redeeming qualities, but as a result is a bit too purely evil. It works, and you certainly root for Rocket to get his revenge, but it is the weak link of the film.

I don't have high hopes for where Marvel is going in terms of a broader story, and I kind of think they should have quit while ahead with Endgame. It has felt like most of the following films have been moneygrabs. But, this one stands up, and is worthwhile.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

The movie is mostly center around rocket racoon, which for the most party, i really enjoy his back story which was quite sad.

But with disney, they did the same thing that ruined thor: love and thunder. They injected a lot of cheap jokes and 1 liners that ruined the seriousness of the movie for me.

Outside of rocket racoon, i didn't really like the other characters, as most of them are really only there for comic relief.

They had a violent fight scene, which surprised me for a disney movie.

You'll notice a tonal change between this and previous instalments. This one is darker (parents may want to view by themselves before bringing along their younger Marvel fans to see if they can handle it), the jokes aren't as frequent or as funny, and there are some more mature themes front and centre right from the first scene onward.

And yet, so much of the familiar fun things you would expect are also present too. I won't say more about this for the sake of keeping this spoiler free.

I wouldn't say this is my favourite GOTG film but that is not to say it is a bad film at all; it is more a testament to how highly I think of this trilogy as a whole and the care that was put into all three films.

Disney seems to have completely lost sight of its storytelling mastery.

The film I had anticipated to be an enjoyable experience turned out to be deeply distressing, as it predominantly depicted instances of animal cruelty. I found myself shedding tears rather than having the anticipated laughter. It is incomprehensible to me why someone with a disturbed mindset would deem it acceptable to repeatedly and explicitly portray such cruelty towards innocent and adorable creatures, subjecting them to painful ordeals or transforming them into grotesque monstrosities. The entirety of the movie was simply disconcerting, and I strongly caution parents and guardians to exercise extreme care if considering allowing their children to watch it. The visuals were disgustingly graphic without any discernible purpose, the narrative lacked inspiration, and this film fails to offer any redeeming qualities. I had initially been filled with excitement about seeing the movie, as the Guardians series is typically enjoyable, but my expectations were shattered, leaving me immensely disappointed.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
286,1.0,14-May-23,"I was expecting - or, should I say, hoping - that 'Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023)' would be good, primarily because 'Guardians Of The Galaxy (2014)' is my favourite Marvel Cinematic Universe movie by quite a wide margin and 'Guardians Of The Galaxy: Vol. 2 (2017)' is also great. However, after the solid but not spectacular 'The Guardians Of The Galaxy: Holiday Special (2022)' and the general lacklustre nature of the MCU's fourth phase, I certainly had my doubts. Not that I thought this series finale would be bad, per se, just that I had tempered my expectations and didn't expect it to be something truly special.

But, boy, was I wrong. I'm glad to say that 'Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023)' puts every single one of Marvel's post-'Avengers: Endgame (2019)' efforts, even the good ones (with the possible exception of 'Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021)'), to shame. It positively blows them out of the water and, in fact, it's easily the MCU's best movie since the original 'Guardians Of The Galaxy (2014)'. James Gunn once again proves that character is king, delivering an experience that prioritises emotional growth and interpersonal dynamics over all else. His picture is surprisingly dark from the moment it begins, delving into the traumatic origins of its most interesting character in a number of genuinely upsetting sequences. I'd heard this piece packed an emotional punch and the previous two entries certainly had their tearjerker moments, but my goodness this hit hard. Be sure to bring the tissues because there are a number of moments that may just necessitate their use. It's a truly affecting experience. The excellent characters and their evolving relationships are the bedrock of the affair, which is mature and sincere throughout. Although its tone is relatively downbeat, the series' signature humour is still present. While some of it feels a little out of place, its inclusion is always appreciated. Not only is it often funny, it also signifies that the comedy is a crucial part of the character work; these people can't just turn off their personalities when the going gets tough.

Despite its inherent darkness, the feature is still a ton of fun when it needs to be and includes a number of fantastic set-pieces that put a smile on your face. The action is exciting, energetic and expert crafted. There's a one-take sequence in the third act that's absolutely phenomenal, easily one of the - if not the - best action scenes in the entire franchise. The picture also looks great, with vibrant cinematography and a solid mix of practical and visual effects. It never feels like the actors are just standing on a blue/green screen set, even though they clearly often are, and the CGI is actually really convincing, almost like the the effects houses had enough time to properly do their work. Basically, it feels like a real movie, with purposeful shot composition and considered blocking. This really is a miracle given Marvel's reputation for rushing and generally mistreating those doing the legwork in creating their fantasy worlds, which - in combination with some lacklustre cinematography - has resulted in their recent efforts being hampered by some truly awful aesthetics.

Another element that enhances Gunn's film is its enthusiastic acting, which is honestly really good across the board. There's no sleepwalking John Krasinski's here, that's for sure. The brilliant writing makes sure that pretty much everyone gets quite a bit to chew on and they all chew it exactly the right amount. Their convincing, often moving work adds believability to each and every moment, no matter how wonderfully outlandish it may. They all strike the perfect balance between humour and heart, reflecting the screenplay's own prowess in that department. This entry is arguably the most sincere in its series. Though the prior entries certainly have genuine heart to them, this one seems to wear it on its sleeve just a little more. Its occasional bluntness doesn't dampen its effect, though, because the piece never feels cheap or manipulative. It seems to honesty believe what it ultimately preaches, building upon the warmth the audience already has towards its key players to deliver a powerful finale that wraps everything up almost perfectly.

Although the plotting is a little messy, the flick flows nicely and there's never a dull moment. It's arguably slightly too long, but it makes good use of its runtime and is constantly engaging. The villain is seriously menacing, one of the best antagonists in the MCU not for the complexity of his motivation, but for the vicious single-mindedness of his cruelty. The stakes are arguably the smallest in the series, but that's kind of what makes them the most impactful; for most of the movie, they're entirely personal and focused on the survival of a single character. The narrative goes in somewhat of an unexpected direction, yet remains satisfying throughout by leaning into its unconventional elements and providing a powerful look into events previously only alluded to. It's really compelling overall.

In the end, this is an absolutely amazing film. Thanks to its unrivalled character work, effective humour, unflinching darkness, spectacular spectacle, energetic action and impressive aesthetic, it stands head and shoulders above most of the MCU and basically hammers the final nail in the coffin of movies like 'Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness (2022)' and 'Thor: Love And Thunder (2022)'. This is what happens when you hire a filmmaker and actually let them make the film they want to make. Kevin Feige really should take notes. Emotion and character are the key to good stories; it's a shame Marvel seems to have forgotten that. 'Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023)' is honestly one of the best superhero movies ever made. Given its recent disappointments, I didn't think I'd be saying that about an entry in the MCU anytime soon.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

This film dives deep into rockets backstory filling in the holes as we don't know much about him yet other than that he's a very smart raccoon, who can talk. With throwbacks to infinity war and endgame we now see how much of a family the GotG are and what lengths they'll go for one another.

Although this movie's villain isn't as interesting as Vol 2's Ego, he suits this story as he fits the Guardians' collective journey to embrace each others' worth and turn their trauma into an outward-facing tool to help others.

292,7.0,3-Jun-23,"After so many of the post ""Avengers: Endgame"" Marvel movies failing to impress, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a breath of fresh air. It definitely finds itself on the good end of the MCU power ranking. The fact that James Gunn writes and directs this entry as well helps give the trilogy a sense of cohesion that the other Marvel movies lack.

This movie can be both very funny, like the other two, but also surprisingly dark and delightfully heartwarming. Some people may think that the MCU relies on comedy too much, that having comedic relief is in some way inheritably a bad thing. But such is not the case for James Gunn. This film is able to balance the humorous moments with the deeper parts much better than ""Thor: Love and Thunder"". That being said, there were a good portion of the jokes that just weren't all that funny, or if they were, they just lasted a little too long. None of them came at a time that diminished a sincere moment, but some just did not land well.

I liked the villain's motivation and his connection with the Guardians. But the way he comes across in action is like a child throwing a temper tantrum. Every other scene he's screaming. It does help him become less likable. But trust me, this guy does not need any extra help with making him unlikable. He is absolutely despicable. He is definitely someone you have no qualms in wanting to see him fail.

I enjoy how quickly the movie gets going. The main characters get their goal presented to them fairly quickly. The movie doesn't juggle too many different plot points, it is very straight forward with a clear objective from beginning to end.

The movie does however cut to series of flashbacks. For a lot of people, they really enjoyed these scenes. I do agree that they add a lot of necessary heart and character to the present-day storyline. But with what we the audience know about the present; everyone knows exactly where this story is going. That can make the reveal a bit less passionate. I don't know, maybe I'm just heartless.

I like a good ensemble cast, that is something that has always helped the Guardians and the X-Men, they have a good cast of diverse characters to work off of. Not all the characters have a compelling arc to go through, but they try. And every one of the main cast has a moment to shine.

The soundtrack has always been an important part of the GotG franchise. Now that Starlord has a Zune, his playlist has expanded to include more contemporary music. Personally, this change didn't work for me. I am a huge fan of the oldies, and I felt that helped give the movies their identity. Not a huge thing, I just think that this soundtrack was the franchise's weakest.

There are some character decisions that don't quite add up for me. At times characters will act like killing is something that they will never do, then the same character in the next scene will be killing dozens without hesitation.

The action is well choreographed, particularly a fight scene towards the end, if you've seen the movie you know which one I'm talking about. The problem I have is that the characters never feel vulnerable. Characters will be shot, stabbed, decapitated, exploded, necks broken and will just hop up like nothing happened. One of the characters seems to be a mixture between the T-1000 and Silly Putty. That really takes out any suspense that any action scene may have when the characters seem to be invincible. Even the cool action scene, isn't a girt and grind fight. It is more of a: ""Look how cool our heroes are"" moment.

Overall, it is a good movie. There are just a few things that hold me back from saying it is a great film. Some jokes go on too long. The music doesn't hit that hard. The emotional moments are too predictable. The villain comes across more annoying than threatening. And our heroes seem to be too unstoppable to make any action scene feel important. It is still a fun time, and for me, still the best Marvel movie in quite some time. If you are a fan of the Guardians, then go ahead and Come and get your love.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

This film had two out of three, not bad but definitely not great. Which is a huge shame because the first two of the trilogy were FUNNY.

I LOVED Rockets backstory. It was sweet and the right kind of sad. The villain was perfect. The plot was brilliant, well paced, interesting.

But the team dynamic was so underwhelming. Drax and Mantis carried the humour of the entire movie. Peter was miserable throughout, it was honestly so dull and annoying. Really not sure who thought repeating Thors tired storyline was a good idea. And while Rockets story was brilliant, it did take him out of the main plot and the group dynamic.

Overall it was good but could have been a lot better.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

Thankfully my 11 year old opted to stay home for this cinema trip. It was just way too much, I'm really disappointed. What the hell Disney!?

More disturbing than some horror movies. Not suitable for kids at all.

The parts without animal abuse were ok, we laughed a few times but felt like crying more often than not.

Hopefully the true reviews shine through and Disney have a long hard look at themselves. It's a one time only watch for me unfortunately!","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

The visuals are arguably better than ever and the story is very interesting and keeps everything well balanced with the assortment of characters.

The second film was solid but a slight downgrade from the surprise original. Now this third film feels a little more and expands great upon the previous two. With a longer runtime, there is more room for growth and more screen time for secondary characters.

What is impressive is how the film incorporates different genres blending from action to adventure, comedy, drama with silly, funny then heartfelt and quite sad moments. Raccoon definitely steals the show, along with a talking dog Cosmo. Nebula and Mantis also have bigger roles which is great. Gamora was reduced noticeably. Overall very great film and better than initially expected.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

The storyline is pretty good; Peter starts of depressed, nothing like the old leader he once was until Rocket is injured and that spurs him into taking charge once again. The rest is the adventure they take part in to heal him back up.

The casting was well the old cast who are all perfect in their roles plus a new villain who definitely did a good job playing his character. Equal parts, mad, good, scientist and psychopath.

The VFX and SFX were pretty good, the CGI especially was better then the past few Marvel movies and that is something to be thankful for for sure.

Anyway overall really enjoyed the movie compared to previous marvel offerings. A solid 7/10 for me, good acting, storyline and ending plus a much better CGI then expected from Marvel nowadays.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

However, this movie is held back by some lackluster humor and a needless barrage of constant ""epic"" action moments. They had a great opportunity to really nail the Rocket backstory, but I don't think they trusted the audience to stay focused if there wasn't something constantly happening. But I think that's where Marvel has settled into in their post-Endgame world. They sacrifice good, quality story telling for cheap humor and over the top action sequences. At least this one still gave us some good story with Rocket. I'm just incredibly uninterested in MCU these days, and this movie really exemplifies it (without even being a ""bad"" movie).","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
303,5.0,11-Jul-23,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a breathtaking cinematic experience that delivers on all fronts. From its spectacular action sequences to its heartwarming emotional moments, this film is a true masterpiece. Directed with finesse and precision, the movie takes audiences on a thrilling and captivating journey from start to finish.

One of the standout aspects of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is its exceptional direction. The film showcases the director's ability to seamlessly blend action, humor, and emotion, resulting in a well-balanced and engaging narrative. Every scene feels purposeful and contributes to the overall story, making for a satisfying viewing experience.

The visual effects and graphics in this movie are truly remarkable. The attention to detail and the level of craftsmanship are evident in every frame. From the vibrant and colorful alien worlds to the awe-inspiring space battles, the VFX work reaches new heights, immersing the audience in the cosmic universe of the Guardians.

What sets Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 apart is its connection to the previous films in the series. For fans who have followed the Guardians' journey from the beginning, this installment hits differently. It effectively builds upon the established characters and storylines, providing satisfying resolutions and surprising twists. The movie rewards longtime fans while still being accessible to newcomers.

The creative use of music in the film is yet another standout aspect. Every song is carefully selected and used in a way that perfectly complements the story and enhances the emotions of the scenes. The soundtrack becomes an integral part of the overall experience, creating a sense of nostalgia and injecting energy into the movie.

The character development in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is superb. Each character, even the side characters, is given their moment to shine and is justified within the story. The chemistry between the Guardians remains as strong as ever, and their interactions provide both hilarious and heartfelt moments. The film strikes a perfect balance between comedy and drama, knowing when to be funny and when to be serious.

Personally, I had doubts about the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) after Phase 4 and the release of Ant-Man. However, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 restored my faith in the franchise. It showcases the dedication and effort put into every aspect of the film, reminding viewers why they fell in love with the MCU in the first place.

In conclusion, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is an exceptional addition to the MCU. With its thrilling action, heartfelt emotions, engaging story, and masterful direction, this film stands as a true cinematic achievement. The visual effects, creative use of music, and well-developed characters further elevate the movie's brilliance. It is a testament to the potential of the MCU, and I can only hope that future films receive the same level of care and attention. I wholeheartedly give Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 a perfect rating of ten stars. Thank you for your time, and be prepared to be captivated by this extraordinary film.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

Strong screenplay, strong acting and strong filming but costumes and make-up was a disaster. It was like children's animations or cartoons. The make-up of the Anti-Earth characters looked more like Halloween masks than the faces of a race. Compare Asgard's military uniform with that of the guardians of that fleshy planet.

The next point is that the well-known MCU races were used less And the races in the movie looked like they were created by the movie's writer and didn't belong in the MCU.

Except for these cases, it was a strong and good movie in other areas, which reminded me of the old days before the recent disaster movies of Marvel. However, I think that Marvel will not return to the golden era of the first to third phase.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

The positives of this movie kept me from going to the bathroom for the duration of its 2:30 run time. Rockets backstory was heartfelt and emotional. I really grew to love his character even more than I did. I didn't care much for Rocket before Endgame, but that movie helped to solidify his place in my heart as one of my favorites, and this movie only furthered that love for the character and I truly hope to see more of him. There was an amazing fight scene with interesting camera angles, cgi that didn't look like cgi on the big screen, and it made me go ""oooooh"" and laugh out loud a couple of times. Other than that this movie sucked. When it comes to group movies I always compare it to Ghostbusters. I know that's a high bar to hit but hear me out. Take into account the remake. Every character tried to be Bill Murray but failed horribly, and that's the problem with Marvel movies now. Every main character has to be the comic relief. They all have to have the same type of humor. Every single main character was trying to be funny and came off as dumb. They all got slimed and the theater was silent. Sure it is the best marvel movie of the year but that bar has dropped severely low recently. The last decent marvel movie was Black Panther 2. I wasn't a fan of the first one but I loved the 2nd and am very sad I missed it in theaters. I put it up against Endgame for quality. I dont expect Endgame quality everytime but atleast do all the hard work and years of build up justice. As a finale to the Guardians franchise, this was a disappointment. As a marvel movie, it hit the bar that's been set by the majority of the movies in the last few phases.

Unlike its previous installments, this Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 is the final entry, and manages to limp its way from one zany, madcap plan to another in order to save their friend Rocket from a near fatal injury inflicted by (nope no spoilers for you) early in the first act of the adventure.

Unlike previous MCU movie cross-overs there is no Thor to call upon or any of the Avengers, not even Captain Marvel, despite the Guardians' extensive involvement in Avengers Infinity War and Avengers Endgame. But apparently the entire galaxy is potentially threatened by a Star Wars derivative villain, The High Evolutionary, portrayed by Chukwudi Iwuji. Unfortunately for us, the threat is neither Galactic in scope nor excitement enough for the viewer.

What else ails this Guardians? The most basic elements that made Guardians of the Galaxy so popular in Volume 1 and Vol. 2 and have been short-shrifted in the finale. The humor, the gags, the camaraderie neither sparkles nor shines in this one. There is very little originality or fresh material as the movie moves through its paces and punches the clock.

Although the Guardians films have always had a great mix of both dark and goofy, funny moments, this one takes it on much more serious level, with themes and scenes of animal torture/mutilation/experimentation, eugenics, and genocide.

Rocket's backstory and how he became what he is today (both physically and psychologically) is absolutely heartbreaking, and is definitely the strongest parts of the story.

The High Evolutionary is probably one of the nastiest, evil villains Marvel has yet produced, making Thanos look almost benevolent. Chukwudi Iwuji plays him like a Shakespearean villain, and in successfully terrifying manner.

Despite some storylines being underdeveloped, unexplored or left out entirely, this is a welcome breath of fresh air after the utter atrocity that was Quantumania. Although it won't be enough to save the MCU from its steak of mediocre films, it's a good start.

A movie, not a product. A genuine story that has soul, you can tell that James Gunn has his heart on it. He wanted to leave the mcu with a bang and he did it.

Every character has their momen to shine, their own arc, they all feel like complete characters after everything they've gone through.

And the villain might be the best since Thanos. Sorry Kang but this villain was genuinely well written and the story manages to make you hate him for real.

The CGI is great and creative which is a rare thing for the mcu lately. The action sequences are amazinly creative.

Like all the other films it's about film and friendship, and it's jam packed full of small pieces of very human moments, both funny and horrible.

Gunn manages to do this simple trick with all his films. It's not complicated, or difficult but it's rare in Hollywood movies.

In the middle of all the FX and explosions are charming small moments. If I say ""bad dog"" anyone who's seen the film will understand. Or the panicked yelling of ""Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now."" that makes a hugely emotional moment unforgettable.

I'd heard lots of bad things about Guardians 3. Those aren't true. It's a good film. It's got a lot more traumatic moments previous 2, but that's no bad thing when you are ending the series.

80% of the movie is about a talking racoon and his so called: origins. Drax acting like a silly child. The special effects are awful.

No real background on the High Evolutionary given, unless you're a die hard Marvel comics reader. Adam Warlock's character did come across as a little ditsy.

Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3 is an epic conclusion to the adventure story of the Guardians in the universe. The parting story is quite moving and heartwarming to see their departure as Guardians.

The friendship scene between Theefs, Floor, Rocket and of course Lyla brings us a moving atmosphere and a strong feeling of friendship between them. It can be said that this third series brings a much deeper element to see the sadness of Rocket Racoon's past. Rocket's past makes us stunned by how experiments on animals are so cruel and not so good. Overall, GotG vol.3 is the conclusion of a slick and extraordinary Guardians story. The new cast, Chukwudi Iwuji and Will Poulter, become new characters who make a good impression with a slick performance. Chukwudi who played The High Revolutionary became the most memorable character as a villain. The character is just right, appears aggressively, and is able to give the impression of a villain who is really evil and threatening. Likewise with Will Poulter as Adam Warlock which for me is very perfect. The appearance is fairly new but able to bring a positive impression to fans. Of course, it is very sad to see the members of the Guardians who are starting to live their new stories and scatter each other. Meanwhile, now the Guardians have a new member to look forward to.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
337,6.0,25-Jun-23,"The Guardians of the Galaxy return for another highly entertaining and emotionally impactful adventure in Vol. 3. Reprising their roles, Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista and the rest of the cast continue to demonstrate fantastic chemistry and comedic timing, with sharp and witty dialogue throughout. The story is fast-paced yet poignant, with plenty of humor and heart. Writer and director James Gunn hits the perfect notes of fun and pathos in this conclusion to the Guardians trilogy.

At the core of Vol. 3 is the relationship between Peter Quill and the father he never knew, Ego, played with charismatic complexity by Kurt Russell. Their emotional journey of discovery, bonding and ultimately betrayal is deeply moving. We see growth in Quill as he comes to terms with the truth about his lineage and finds the strength within himself. The other Guardians also have their moments to shine, with each character arc coming to a satisfying end.

The visuals and set pieces are as thrilling as ever, from spectacular spaceship chases to battles with bizarre alien creatures. The retro 80s-inspired soundtrack also continues to be a delight. Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a perfect ending to the trilogy, telling an intimate story of family and self-discovery while still delivering blockbuster action and humor. Emotional, entertaining and deeply gratifying. I eagerly await to see where the Guardians will go next in the broader Marvel Cinematic Universe.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

I just haven't felt emotionally connected to these characters before. This has definitely changed now. I loved this one and I loved all the characters. I laughed and I cried many times watching this. I love a film that makes me emotional and this one is 10/10. I will watch this one again soon and in the future I will not skip the other ones anymore. Great job Disney and Marvel. This one is the best one since Endgame. 😊","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
339,6.0,2-Aug-23,"Theres been a few instances post Endgame that shows Marvel that they can create movies that are worthy of the title of an MCU movie. This is certainly one of them! Spider-man No Way Home/ Shang-chi are the only ones in my eyes that live up to the hype, story and all of the fantastic moments that have come before in the MCU.

Many times over i've been reading about the emotional damage that this movie brings on long-term MCU fans and it certainly packs a punch. 4 experimental beings, broken and tutored are still able to find meaning in their captivity bring the audience to tears with story that ultimately leads Rocket to finding his new family by the end of the first Guardians movie. Theres moments where a look from a Raccoon to a Blue cyborg that melt your heart as for years they were the only surviving members during the blip. All members of team have their time to shine in this movie as we trek across the galaxy.

One of the most glaring points that have come out of recent marvel movies is that the villains are sub par, even with such talented actors like Christian Bale to name one they are not able to save the villains. Could be poor writing, could be poor direction or down to the fact that many of these were worked on during covid but thats no excuse when films like the Batman are written, filmed and released during the covid years. The High Evolutionary on the other hand is one of those villains thats going to go down in the history of the MCU, deranged, calm and manic at the same time his scientific process of creating beings to just throw away steers away from the recent bunch that have to have a motive behind the actions. He's just a bad guy! Same as the Green Goblin who yet again is still a standout from 00s to Spider-man No Way Home! He rips animals apart and rebuilds them to how he sees them evolving in grotesque hybrids of metal and living tissue.

Only reason that this is not the 10 out of 10 is because of Adam Warlock, when he first crashed down to Knowhere that was the Warlock i thought we were getting throughout the movie! I know that many characters need a starting point to grow from but maybe it was a bit to far back for his start up. The thought behind him was to be closer to Visions introduction as a being who isnt able to process emotion but can work with whoever his master was. Instead we got a baby warlock, far more emotionally unstable than calculation.

Its a Trilogy that walks right up there to the top of Marvel, Antman would have been there as well if it wasnt for Quantomania. We still have Iron man, Cap and this to be thankful in a way to round off a trilogy that has been with us for nearly a decade. I wish James Gunn well on the DC front and if a triology of Superman films can come out as well as these then DC fans are going to be in for a treat.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

I have a love-hate relationship with it, but I cannot deny the excellent needle drops, signature humor, and action that we have come to expect from a Gunn film.

However, the film falls prey to the usual MCU plunders and feels stuck in a tug-of-war between Gunn and Marvel. The sheer number of characters makes it messy and difficult to find harmony in its multiple swan songs.

Despite this, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 works extremely well at its core, with a surprisingly interesting villain and a truly moving goodbye that most fans of the Guardians will love and appreciate. I will surely miss these weirdos.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

Like the talking space dog. Almost felt like a poor man's Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. In general, Marvel needs to stop.

This film was a more intense, saddening experience compared to recent MCU installments and it fits perfectly. After two years of mediocrity a Marvel film that doesn't feel rushed out finally graces the big screen once more. At long last the Disney executives gave Gunn enough time to make a good film and it shows in how the tone, CGI, and direction aren't half baked and messy compared to projects like Black Widow and Thor 4. As expected Rocket's story throughout the film was heartbreaking and the High Evolutionary is established as one of the most despicable characters in the Marvel canon. Watch this in theaters and then watch it again; this movie needs to be appreciated and it needs to make lots of money.

Some characters complete their arcs, others leave with open doors, it's nice. Narrative and tone are a little messy, but the hallway fight is cool, and the Guardians - when it's about them - fire on all cylinders. I love these people.

Where it loses me is Rocket's origin story, and Gunn pushes the animal cruelty way ( ... *way* ... ) too far. It's transparent knife-twisting and I hate it. This is a dark turn for the series, absolutely, but also unbelievably painful.

I can't.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

James Gunn tells this Guardians story exactly the way he needs too: with a lot of raw emotion. The film primarily revolves around Rocket, and new big-bad, The High Evolutionary. Quill is still dealing with the loss of Gamora (not the new Gamora) and everyone else just kind of falls into place. It still has the same quirky humor (Drax!) and there are a few cameos that you will need to pay attention to.

347,7.0,6-Aug-23,"Marvel has pretty much destroyed or abandoned each and every one of its properties or replaced them with mediocrities.

The Guardians survived the demise of Thanos and so we got a third movie that nobody really expected or necessarily wanted, considering the second one was not any good and the Guardians had been overexposed in the Avenger movies, so it rather seemed like there no longer was any purpose for one more space opera.

Thankfully, Mr Gunn decided that he needs closure before he moved on to the DC Universe, so he got to write and direct the 3rd movie, focusing on the origins of Rocket Rackoon and the famous Marvel villain known as the High Evolutionary.

And basically he nailed it.

This is in my book the best of the Guardians trilogy, even better than the first one. It is flawless. Yes, there is (as always) a lot of action but it perfectly fits the plot and this time you care, especially since every action scene becomes a plot device to move the story forward. And although in the last few scenes most of the action clichés expected in this sort of movie become prevalent, the excellent script, the very touching and humane story and the wonderfully depicted characters take precedence from the action and make Guardians an excellent scifi movie and one of the best space operas (if not the best) ever made.

This movie is Marvel's last chance to redeem itself from the catastrophic period it entered after the end of the Avengers and it should focus on these characters going forward. All its other properties seem totally irrelevant, indifferent and abused to sell politics and create social platforms.

This is the only decent movie they have released in 4 years, and they should focus on movie making. It's a real shame that the same people who can create masterpieces like Guardians 3 are wasted on artless and horrible creations such as Antman 3, Dr Strange 2 and all the pseudo-progressive tv series of the past few years.

It may be time they seriously consider bringing mr Gunn back from DC and giving him the helm. These days it seems like all Mr Feige cares about is a future career in politics.

If they don't find a way to replicate the triumph of storytelling and inspiration that Guardians 3 is, this movie may very well be Marvel's swan song.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

Acting was generally good, Iwuji really stood out as the nutty world destroying villain

CGI all very impressive everything looked on a par with the previous stories

What I didn't like

Rapidly realised this was a rehash, the easy route so many sequels and spin offs follow. Merely repackage the successful storyline and hope the dumb audience wont notice.

It's not terrible like Independance day 2 or Star Wars a'la Disney.

However, having enjoyed the previous offerings it was deeply dissappointing and worst of all mediocre.

They brought back dead characters with no explanation of umm how , just becase they wanted them there. They modified other characters just because they could - presumably to try and be different to gloss over the total lack of story originality, e.g. Nebula had a character transplant.

Brought in new characters like a Russian dog that didn't mesh

Most jarring was the animal cruelty (we all know it's cgi of course) but that was just jso arring out of the basic good versus evil, feel good genre.

By the end of the film I was hoping it would finish soon.

Was it worth price of a ticket ? No, and having paid it, I resent the cost.

Would I watch it again ? No (but I would the predecessors)

Another example of the same mistake they made ending game of thrones.

Instead of employing a writer to continue the story of our beloved characters. They thought they could do it themselves and made a film that mimics the good films that went before

I get it, animal cruelty is horrible, awful, terrible and I got that message loud and clear, but the pain just made the movie unbearable for me to watch.

However I'm going to talk about something I haven't seen the other reviews mention. This was very dark and the extent of animal cruelty is tough to watch.

Sure, the overall message is that animal cruelty is bad, and to save the animals. But, the line walked is very blurry.

There is an element of glorifying animal experimentation to create cute gimmicks or cybernetic monsters.

There are animal characters that you are given the backstory for so you feel for their plight and there are others who clearly would have gone through the same turmoil but their backstory is not explored so you are expected to switch off and simply think of them as 'baddies'.

I get it, where do you draw the line, all these movies have gratuitous violence, most of the movies kept the villains one dimensional to avoid this, others PG'd the violence. This movie went that little step further, many of the big bad's army / henchmen are clearly animal hybrid experiments, I think they thought of these ones looks scary enough or more robotic then it's okay.

There are two scenes in particular that made me deeply uncomfortable. Don't worry no spoilers! There is a cybernetic pig whose head gets ripped off, the head is then held for the next scene and I think the scene is intended to be funny, it wasn't for me.

The other scene is the big 'avengers assemble' fight scene moment. This time the baddies are again cybernetic octopuses, bears and god knows what else. However the scene right before it was tugging at your heartstrings for the animals that were experimented, and clearly these creatures were also the result of the same experiments. This scene also does not shy away from blood, guts and maiming. Sure the blood and guts is orange to make it more 'fun', but again for me a moral line was crossed.

So if you're planning to takes your kid, think about it carefully. I wouldn't take mine.

All that said. If this encourages discussion and for people to think about animal cruelty more then that is great.

Finally, great movie, should have a higher age rating imho. I just think they put a 12 on this because they want to maximise their audience and the franchise is supposed to be kid friendly.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

First class visual effects as always. Great performances by the cast while so much of the story dependent on CGI.

360,6.0,21-May-23,"So I went into this thinking it would be mind-blowing send off for the guardians that would be on par with mcu greats such as the winter soldier or infinity war. This was how everyone seemed to be pushing it online and how the darker tone of the film would be a welcome change of pace after the thor film (which shall not be named) when we last saw the guardians.

I was left pretty dissapointed by it and the more I think about it the more I have to criticise.

For the positives: -it is more serious which is a nice change (though it's often undercut by humour)

-we get really good character development for rocket who was until this film pretty unlikeable.

-the villain is good

-we get to see how much some of the guardians (especially drax, nebula and starlord) have grown over the years and we get some really nice character moments.

And the negatives: -the dark tone and the guardians humour are jarringly juxtaposing one another. They really needed to restrict the marvel humour for this one or at least leave it until less serious moments of the film. As it stands they just spoil all tension.

-the film is too long and the plot os all over the place. The whole act set in the orgocorp station and the whole section in the new earth suburban area could have very easily been taken out. It really seemed like nobody was checking Gun's creativity with some rationalism (a common theme with marvel recently).

-at times rocket's backstory is leaning on excessive.

-gamorrah really could have been left out as she did nothing at all for the film. Her and nebula just spend the whole film screaming at people which is regressive for them and it becomes annoying.

-the music! Guardians films were known for having great music and short of 2 songs this film just doesn't have it.

So overall this was definitely better than what we've come to expect from marvel post-infinity saga. But in my mind it's nowhere near the high status some fans have given it. I'd put it alongside mcu films such as age of ultron/ thor/ captain america the first avenger.

Each of the Guardians members had their own bright moments. And all of them were so unique and beautiful.. I was able to have deep connection with each one of them, and i think it was so special for a Marvel movie.

Chukwudi Iwuji portraying as High Evolutionary was extraordinary. After Peacemaker being in such this amazing production must be heaven for him, cuz he rocks in all of em.. His acting was DIABOLICAL, I'm so shocked by his acting skills and got goosebumps... He deserves every damn high praise by this role..

Now, everyone already knew Guardians 3 was going to be... good at best. We had watched the previous Marvel movies (post-Endgame, of course), and we were mostly disappointed. We went to the theater (or watched at home) with pretty neutral expectations, but James Gunn had other plans.

Guardians is probably the only Marvel movie that can be as humorous as it is and also be as depressing and emotional as you can think of. It takes everything that was possibly funny in the MCU and adds in way too many scenes that just give you the urge to tear up.

Now, recent movies released in theaters were supposed to have incredibly bad CGI, but you don't have to worry about that in this movie since it's just perfect. This movie had to use many CGI scenes, and there wasn't one issue that bugged me as someone who is usually bothered by even one frame of bad CGI is in a movie. It's definitely a great visual spectacle, as there were many scenes where the movie's cinematography was showcased. The colors of this movie, just like the previous two installments in the trilogy, were aesthetic as can be, and the overall visual scheme of the movie was also beautiful.

The plot of this movie was obviously incredible. James Gunn did an incredible job implementing the themes that this movie aims to cover, and he did it in one of the most different but gorgeous ways possible.

There were scenes where you would laugh uncontrollably, and then there were scenes when you would tear up with emotional distress. And then, there are scenes where both would happen at the same time. So, yes, this film takes you on a reckless emotional rollercoaster of joy and sadness.

Overall, in my opinion, this movie is definitely James Gunn's best (by far), and I have high hopes for the DC Cinematic Universe since he is the one who takes up the Head Position there. However, for Marvel, I don't have high hopes since the only good movies post-Endgame were this movie and Shang-Chi.

372,1.0,5-May-23,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 was one of my most anticipated movies of 2023. I liked the first two Guardians movies and I think James Gunn is a really skilled director with movies like The Suicide Squad. He is good at making really entertaining movies with a lot of heart and emotion in the mix. He is also good at delivering jokes with his dark sense of humor. Lately, Marvel movies haven't really been my thing since Avengers Endgame. I enjoyed Shang Chi and really liked Spider Man No Way Home, but the others such as She Hulk, Ant Man and the Wasp Quantumania have been mediocre in my opinion. So I was really hoping that Guardians 3 would bring back my love for Marvel. Unfortunately, and I'm a bit sad to say this, it didn't. However, it was definitely one of the better films of Phase 4-5. It was certainly better than Quantumania but with the quality of Marvel these days, it was a let down. I really wanted to love this movie but there is so much going on in the film that I thought it was quite messy and uneven at times. Especially with the first act, the pace was slow and I found it hard to get into the story. The humor was also surprisingly weak and wasn't as well delivered as the first two. With the dark tone of the film, the jokes didn't blend in as well as the first two did. In films like this, and stories like this, we need those parts of levity but the jokes didn't land most of the time and it wasn't really funny, considering that it is a film from James Gunn also written by him. Nevertheless, there were some jokes that were kind of humorous but it didn't make me laugh out loud like some of the jokes in Vol 1 and 2. It's not that I didn't like everything in the movie, there are some parts I loved about it but it definitely leans heavier on the disappointing side. The aspect of the film I liked the most was Rocket's origin story, how he was tortured and experimented on by the villain, The High Evolutionary played by Chukwudi Iwuji who I thought was excellent with his debut role in the MCU. This storyline added the weight and emotional beats to the film very well, giving stakes to the characters and a sense of urgency. The main highlight of the film for me was Bradley Cooper as Rocket. This was definitely his best performance as this character. Some of the sequences in this film were really dark and intense. It gave so much more depth to Rocket and made the film a lot more investing for me. There were some emotional scenes that really tugged at my heartstrings quite a bit. The High Evolutionary was truly a terrible person and the things he does to Rocket and his friends introduced in the film was really messed up and horrible. But that is what I wanted in a Marvel movie for a long time, a terrifying villain that you hate so much, you just want to see the heroes take him/her down in the most badass way. They don't need to have an entire backstory or motive to make a compelling villain as long as he/she is menacing and a real threat to the plot and I think Iwuji delivered it well. The scenes with him were uncomfortable and frightening and that is when you know the capability of this actor. Speaking of new characters, Lylla the Otter, one of Rocket's old friends, was a standout considering how lovable this character was with the small amount of screen time she had. Adam Warlock, played by Will Poulter, was fine. He occasionally showed up from time to time to inflict harm in the movie. The scenes with him were mostly played for laughs since this character is portrayed as having child-like traits, not knowing his purpose in this life he doesn't know much about. I thought the action sequences with Adam gave some of the more exciting parts in the film. Although he does something essential near the end of the movie, this character felt a little under utilized throughout the film. The heart of the Guardians movies rely on the characters the most, especially the main team, Peter, Gamora, Drax, Nebula, Mantis, Groot and Rocket. Besides Rocket, the standout members of the team were Peter, Drax and Nebula, played by Chris Pratt, Dave Bautista and Karen Gillan. These four actors/actresses I felt carried this movie. Through Pratt's performance, you understand Peter's desperation, having lost his mother, father and lover, to save Rocket as he cares about the Guardians of the Galaxy more than anything. Bautista brought the heart and humor the most with Drax who continues to be one of my favorite characters of the Guardians trilogy. Lastly, Gillan who plays Nebula in the film really portrayed the character's growth from the first Guardians movie well and shows how much she understands the depth of the character. It also shows how much James Gunn cares about these characters and tries his best to flesh out the Guardians as much as he possibly could. Since Gamora isn't the Gamora we knew from the first two Guardians movies but instead a new version of this character from Endgame who doesn't remember all of the events of the previous films. I found this to be a flaw because the character that has been built up until Infinity War was erased and none of that mattered in this movie. Instead, Gamora was written as an angry character who slowly gets used to being with the Guardians by the end of the film which I thought wasn't as strong as it could've been. Groot and Mantis were just fine. Not much has changed and they remain to be who they were from the previous films. The reveal in the Holiday Special that came out on Disney Plus last year about Mantis being Peter's sister did help with some of the dialogue said in the film but didn't affect the story that much. Same with Kraglin and Cosmo played by Sean Gunn and Maria Baklava were also utilized just fine in the film. They had a purpose to be in the film and nothing much has changed about them. The film started to pick up with its pacing the most in the second act all throughout to the third act which I thought was the best portion. Some of the action that takes place in the final battle were some of the best action sequences Marvel has ever put out. The ending of the film, with this being the last time this group of Guardians together, was also fine. I liked how the trailers misled me into thinking the film was going to play out in a certain way when the actual film was going to play out differently. Although I had no problems with the ending they chose to do in the final product, I wished that there were more consequences to the Guardians instead of taking a more safe approach, after seeing how dark the film turned out to be. Overall, my consensus of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 is although story wise, it was better than Vol 2 and some of the Marvel projects that have come out recently, I think the execution of it could have been handled a bit better with a more organized story instead of having to juggle and balance many characters at once. Nevertheless, I found it to be a satisfying end to the Guardians trilogy by James Gunn and I am curious to see where they take these characters in the future. 7/10.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

Themes of family, loss and redemption make it not just a fun superhero movie, but also a moving and thought-provoking one. I think the characters in the film are very well written and acted. They are funny, charismatic and sympathetic.

The most sad part was the Chris Pratt had no energy in first half of the movie. He was like just sleep walking his character. The villian was comical and did not appear genuine. The humour was weak and I missed the hilarious situation of the first two franchise.

The song selection was bad too and they should have had some popular songs from the era.

There are so many characters its hard to keep track of them and the ""villain"" is not comic or particularly villainous, apart from shouting. There is very little humour, as the first two films had. Whenever the story flags, there's a fight scene of some sort. In its favour, the computer graphics are amazing, and there's a lot of imagination in the sets and backgrounds. But that's not enough to carry a movie, even a Marvel movie. As he did in Jurassic Park: Dominion, Chris Pratt looked embarrassed at times at the absurdity of his character and lines.

382,1.0,29-May-23,"The Guardians franchise has been consistently good series of films put out by marvel studios in recent years. Much better than some of the less than stellar films and series being made by marvel nowadays.

They have had some great hits like Loki and Moon Knight, as well as the new Spider-Man films. But with all honesty I think that this Guardians film doesn't fall in that category. It's not bad, don't get me wrong. However it's not as good as the first or second instalments in the franchise. In retrospect the second guardians films is clearly the strongest of the three and I'd probably have to slot the original film in second place.

It's not like the plot of this film is bad per say, but I don't think the execution was as good as it could be. To go into Rockets Backstory was a very good idea and I really enjoyed the flashbacks sequences as alluded to in the trailer. But the High Evolutionary as a villain wasn't very good. He seemed to be a very average mad scientist with a god complex.

Compared to the two main antagonists from the previous films the High evolutionary doesn't compare. And both Ego and Ronan are different types of villains. Ronan is simple and great villain, he is a religious extremist who plans on committing genocide. Ego on the other hand is much more complex.

The High Evolutionary's goals are sort of simple but they don't feel very important. Yes, him creating and destroying new alien species & planets at will is evil. But it doesn't match up with the threats imposed by the previous antagonists.

Nevertheless I do think it's worth a watch, and I hope that the success of this film does lead to another instalment. One I hope is more inline with the other two films.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

384,9.0,4-May-23,"I will never call my Maltese Shihtzu ""Bad Dog"" again after watching the latest addition to the ""Guardians of The Galaxy"" franchise ""Volume 3"".

Little did I realise how much it affects the ""Cosmo the Space Dog's"" (Maria Bakalova) psyche, even days later when they are playing poker.

Either that or dogs need to build a bridge and get over it!

If you are a fan of the first two Guardians movies and the Xmas special on Disney Plus then it's time to face the music and watch ""Guardians of The Galaxy: Volume 3"" on the Big Screen.

My first issue with this movie is that one of the Guardians barely gets any screen time in the present, if it wasn't for origin story flashbacks I'd have been really disappointed.

Having said that this is one of the first Marvel Cinema Universe movies with AI CGI that's moved an audience to tears, so take your Kleenex with you and not for the sex scenes 'cos there are none.

Channel 9's Lego Masters ""Brickman"" will lose his stuff watching this flick, he struggles enough just saying goodbye to contestants.

Star Wars fans understand the expression ""It's A Trap"", but not Star Lord (Chris Pratt with a six pack a far cry from his slacker days on ""Parks & Recreation"").

To his earthling alter ego ""Peter Quill"" ""It's not a trap, It's a face off"".

Needless to say he walks right into one in every movie.

He's joined by all the other uncanny Guardians for one final convoluted mission (allegedly). Money talks and BS walks.

At one point they are inside an organic planet that looks like a cheap 1980's Sci-fi set complete with Nathan Fillion (""Firefly""/""Suicide Squad""/""Rookies"") in a ridiculous space suit that makes him look like an engorged caterpillar.

Director James Gunn was sacked from this project, but then he was reinstated after actors like Dave Bautista protested his dismissal louder than Gough Whitlam Labor supporters in 1975.

Still it doesn't feel like Gunn was totally on board even though his brother Sean Gunn was back as Kraglin who struggles to mind control his deadly lazer dart.

The writing by Gunn and associates wasn't as funny as previous films and felt lost in places.

I guess it was a long time between 2 & 3.

In fact, a record 6 years in the MCU.

So, when Peter Quill utters the immortal words, ""We were gone for quite a while. But no matter what happens next, the galaxy still needs its guardians."" He means it.

One of the highlights was Chukwudi Iwuji as ""The High Evolutionary"". It felt like he was auditioning for lead in ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" doing his best Tim Curry as Dr Frankenfurter mad scientist role.

When his 2IC takes over near the end felt like another nod to ""Rocky Horror"" minus the singing although this movie also features another fantastic classic soundtrack, so crank up the volume to eleven on Spotify for your drive home after your session.

Watch out for: Sylvester Stallone and ""Crazy Rich Asians"" Nico Santos and Will Poulter as Golden Anti-Hero Adam Warlock.

Stay for some massive Easter Eggs in the end credits plus lovely family photo album Kodak moments.

I don't ever cry in movies, and I sobbed through this one... and not in a good way. The film also contains troubling shots of innocent people being hurt or killed (which is sometimes implied in other films, but not typically shown in such an awful, direct manner).

Volume 3 however was a return to form for James Gunn and the band of misfits. It was a more emotional story for the group which was a good way to end the series. I'm also impressed with Gunn's writing and character development of Nebula and how far she's come since the first and how integral she became to the series.

The villain is evil and convincing, the story made me laugh a lot,and nearly made me cry several times. Even the characters who weren't my favorites (hello Mantis and Nebula) got to grow and shine in this one.

The flashbacks meshed with the story well, the pace never let up, but there was enough story that the action didn't feel forced like it does in many superhero and action and adventure movies.

The terrified face of the little boy sitting behind me will forever be imprinted in my memory. I felt so bad for him after the scene where all the caged animals get mutilated graphically. Not that the lab animals weren't demonically scary to begin with.

The film didnt take itself too seriously. It knew it was dumb and goofy. I found most of the jokes to be about the absurdity of the nature of the film.

By the third film, i think James Gunn is all too comfortable with the seriously ridiculous concept of a talking raccoon, tree, alien, man team. The ridiculousness of the whole thing isn't as embraced, instead jokes are forced out of two dimensional characters. It comes off as very cringe.

This so-called ""galactic adventure"" falls flat on its face, drowning in a sea of darkness, disturbing imagery, and excessive violence. From start to finish, it's a cacophony of despair that fails to engage the audience in any meaningful way.

The incessant yelling throughout the film quickly becomes grating and annoying. Seriously, does every character have to shout every line? It's as if the director mistook loudness for passion and forgot about subtlety altogether. As a result, any potential character development is drowned out by the noise, leaving us with a group of teammates who achieve nothing but headache-inducing chaos.

The final ten minutes, while sentimental, come across as ridiculously contrived. It's as if the filmmakers tried to inject a cheap emotional punch to salvage the wreckage they had created. Sorry, but a few touching moments cannot redeem the previous two hours of darkness and despair.

In essence, Guardians of the Galaxy, Volume 3 is a misguided attempt at storytelling. Its relentless bleakness, disturbing content, and excessive violence overshadow any potential enjoyment.

We got to know the Guardians through two independent films and in several associations with other heroes, characters were built with their own traits, virtues, faults, so this film leaned on those foundations and improved them a little more. Although it lasts relatively long, I didn't get that feeling because the story flows neatly alternating with the action. A great balance of emotions, a lot of humor, but also a lot of tragedy, and that is not easy to achieve. I can't believe that my eyes watered a little at some scenes in a Marvel movie, it sounds almost impossible, but then that's a real sign that the director succeeded in his plan.

This movie has everything a fun sf superhero movie should have, even a little more. Probably the most emotional MCU movie, but I can't forget to mention that there is still a lot of humor and great chemistry between the Guardians. I don't want to reveal anything about the plot because I didn't know anything either, so the final impression is great.

This is not a perfect movie, I won't kid myself, some characters didn't make sense to me and I wondered why they were even in the movie.

The music, as usual, on point. Its not that easy to pick the right choices as it will seem (thor: love and thunder is the example of how this can go wrong) but James Gunn totally nails it with the soundtrack once again.

For my own two pennys/cents worth:- The good- The scene in the spacesuits with the coloured buttons, the only part that lived up to the humour of films 1 and 2. Oh, and the good dog!

The bad- lazy design of organic spaceship, squidgy monsters, and the star wars like habit of having extras wear push on heads and hands to make them 'alien'. Weak soundtrack, all 6 of the guardians delivery of dialogue often below par ( probably lack of direction?), pretty lame plot using 2nd rate new characters, a villain that over acted his face off.

The ugly- sub plot of animal cruelty, a scene in which a lone alien is let out of a cell ( should have been uplifting but was actually soul crushing!). Just an overall dark, bordering on depressing film.

Will re watch 1&2 for years to come, will try to forget 3.

Therefore, the action scenes are well-done, especially the authentic and mythical design of the city of Knowhere that we saw in the Holiday Special, a little bit reminiscent of Tokyo, Japan.

Well except Rocket and that is why this movie deserves credits. Rocket lives his own life in this movie and his story is so exceptional compared to others in this movie, that other Guardians feels like can't even interact with it properly as they are almost fillers, comedic reliefs.

The villain is okay, above average, has good motivation, skills, interaction.

Another user summarized it as ""a serious movie with some comedic moments"" as opposed to the previous Guardian movies, which are light-hearted movies with some serious moments.

Parents of young children might want to screen it first, as there are bits that might be too disturbing for young kids.

Having said all that, it's good to see the gang in action again. The closeness and sense of family is strong and a key element. Each will do whatever he/she can to save any of the others, while still upholding the values of what it means to be a guardian.

James Gunn could have done the same old thing and just sent the characters out for another heroic romp thru the universe with great classic music, but he instead explored new ground. The movie centered around Rocket and his origins, but we also saw another aspect of Drax. Mantis had one of the bigger roles in the movie, and had grown from the timid character she had been in Guardians II to someone far more outspoken and confident.

The music was fine--though it didn't grab me the way that the soundtrack in G2 had. But music is subjective.

After Endgame/Infinity War, I had vowed not to see another Guardians movie, but hearing that this one was the last and that it didn't have Thor, made me change my mind. I'm glad I watched it. It gives the Guardian series closure.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

The Guardians was part of the Universe but at the same time, it felt like an outsider. Maybe because it focused in an actual theme (mom issues in the first and dad issues in the second) or because they were less restrained by the grand narrative of Thanos and the stones.

The characters also represented the same ""outside"" nature of the film - they were not exactly perfect heroes, even in some cases like Gamora and Nebula, they were the bad guys looking for something (a family, probably)

So, the final part of this trilogy. It wasn't flawless, it was too over-dramatic, the jokes didn't always land and as most blockbusters it was too long.

But I love it.

It felt like it was made by a person who had feelings and wanted to say something about them. I felt that the theme explored was ""us"" - the new generation - represented by Rocket.

Do we feel as broken as he does? I don't know.

Do we feel as angry as he does? Probably, sometimes.

Do we feel like there is no future for us? I guess we do - or at least I do.

Not implying that all superhero movies lack depth, and according to me this one didn't, but in some way the focus is on action and excitement.

Can you have a favourite character from GOTG? They all have their moments and feed off each other so well.

We all know expectations were high for Vol 3 and after having many laughs, a few heartstrings pulled and my soul gently cuddled for a couple of hours, I let out a huge sigh of satisfaction when the credits rolled.

From the way the characters were written, the performances, the costumes, the set design, and overall creativity really makes it magical for me. It really changed my view of the MCU and the superhero genre as a whole. It embraces its wackiness and so many somber moments were well put together that could really pull at your heartstrings.

As for the minor negative, I personally think it can be a tad long. And some aspects of the story would make people question the character's decisions, especially at the finale. But both of these are not really important in the grand scheme of things and shows the time needed to really flesh out such interesting characters and the future opportunities that would come based on the character's decisions.

Overall, watch this movie if you want a very raw and emotional superhero movie that understands how ridiculous it could be and at the same time could make you sad for hours after its bittersweet end.

It is definitely my favorite from the Guardians trilogy. With the ending, there could be a Guardians 4 with a new writer/director. There could be a new era of the Guardians without James Gunn.

This film is definitely one of the deeper Marvel movies. It revolves around the backstory of Rocket Raccoon and focuses around animal abuse. There's typical Guardians humor alongside the dark and emotional storyline behind Rocket. That's mainly through flashbacks but still deeply emotional.

The High Evolutionary is definitely one of the best MCU villains. He does seem like a threat and the film does a good job at making a good conflict with him at the protagonist team. As well, he is a good villain with no justifiable goals.

This growth helps sell the story and the humour, but ultimately might be too little too late for most of the characters going forward, considering how it ends. Some slapstick comedy and song choices dont fit. Its a shame Adam Warlock is wasted and seems pretty pointless throughout could have been done without him. Some stylish action that looks exactly like comic panels or storyboards. With more comedy hitting and most characters getting growth in a story that is self contained this films does well in most areas, held back by trying to do a little too much but still a recommendation from me.

What I really missed was something really new. When Part 1 took us on its journey it grabs our mind and let it flow into some really new dimension.

450,2.0,18-May-23,"I agree wholeheartedly with those reviewers who cite Vol 3 as the weakest of the GotG trilogy, which is a shame, because it could have been great.

There was much to enjoy here, but equally there were elements that left me frustrated over what were, in my view, some poor choices of tone and direction.

The main problems I had with this outing were two-fold: too much shouting (like being subjected to an episode of a cheap soap opera); and some horrendously mawkish sentimentality, which frankly made me want to vomit.

I found the principal villain to lack depth of character. I don't believe it was the fault of the actor, having seen him in other things, rather the character's motivations were largely ignored by the script and direction. There is a moment between Rocket and the Evolutionary which could have acted as a trigger of a personality change, for example, but the Evolutionary seemed just as depraved and heartless before as after. Actually, this is a common complaint I have with villains in general - if they're unremittingly cruel and horrible to everyone, why does anyone follow them?

Having laid out what I didn't like, there were some things which worked. I personally had no expectations of newer characters like the Space Dog or Adam Warlock (these are things which seem to preoccupy comic fanboys on the whole), but they were entertaining additions to the canon. The Guardian who amused me most consistently was Drax (he certainly did a lot less angry shouting than the others), and Groot was reliably entertaining. You might be forgiven for thinking that I am a person who lacks emotional depth, whereas in fact I found a lot to applaud in the way Rocket's back story was handled, but for me it got unnecessarily over-sentimental at times, and it would have been much more effective if that particular instinct had been reigned in.

On a final note, I think the 2.5h run time was in danger of outstaying its welcome, which I would never say of a film I thoroughly enjoyed. A slightly trimmer and more tightly scripted and story-boarded film would probably have served the franchise better.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

The main plot was very engaging and all the subplots were perfectly merged together. What I really liked was that all the characters had their own plot; their own character arc that all ended with great closure. The movie was a perfect ending to an amazing trilogy.

The movie fills you up with emotions. There are many scenes where you might actually cry all because of the deep connections that were built with the characters because of the amazing story telling throughout the whole journey. The movie is also hilarious! There were many scenes where the whole theatre couldn't stop laughing.

452,9.0,23-Mar-24,"As the Marvel Cinematic Universe continues its never-ending mission to bring peace to the universe, we learn to say goodbye to a motley crew of space pirates and oddballs in 'Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 3.'

The James Gunn-directed sci-fi comedy marks the conclusion of the trilogy that brought together the likes of a human rebel (Chris Pratt), a badass racoon (Bradley Cooper), a dimwitted warrior (Drax), a Thanos stepdaughter (Karen Gillan), an assassin (Zoe Saldana), a soft-hearted bug alien (Pom Klementieff) and I am Groot (Vin Diesel) as they traversed space and time to protect those who needed protecting. This unlikely bunch won the hearts of many MCU fans, as 'Guardians' struck a much more comedic, lighthearted tone than some of the other franchises within this family of superheroes.

In 'Vol. 3,' the focus shifts to the origins of Rocket and introduces his longstanding nemesis, The High Evolutionary (played connivingly by Chukwudi Iwuji). Quite honestly, this may be one of the most emotional Marvel films to date, as there are plenty of scenes that are tear-inducing. But 'Vol. 3' has a little bit of everything to offer, as there are plenty of knock-down, drag-out battles and goofiness to go around. The interpersonal drama between the crew is silly but intriguing, including Quill's attempt to rekindle a flame with the (should be dead) Gamora and the brother-sister antics between Mantis and Drax. And yes, there's a very bad dog (in the most complimentary way).

The villian is the movie for me is the best one in the gotg trilogy and very well acted. The god complex and the sudden bursts of emotons while also not showing empathy to those who help him makes him a narcissistic and unpredictable villian(on which teh make-up and special effects team also did very well for his appearance).

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3 is an emotional and satisfying swansong for James Gunn and some of the Guardians. It is hard to imagine anyone other than Gunn directing this movie, with the firing back in 2018. It would not be the same without him, almost like a void.

Marvel has yet to have a solid track record recently. There are, of course, a few golden nuggets among the pile, but Marvel hasn't been the same after Endgame, and audiences are quickly losing interest. The quality has also dropped, as it felt rushed and unfinished.

While I am still uncertain about the future of the MCU; however, I am 100% certain that James Gunn managed to deliver a solid trilogy about a bunch of misfits whose weirdness and differences only make them stronger together.

What surprised me the most was how the movie approached the themes of cruelty, especially toward animals. On top of that, someone kills, and body horror scenes push the limits of the age certificate, with the last Marvel film to do that being Doctor Strange 2. I love it.

The villain this time around, The High Evolutionary, played wonderfully by Chukwudi Iwuji, is a highbrow narcissist who likes playing the role of God. He is a villain that you hate. It's brilliant how James Gunn took the criticism/feedback he received from the first Guardians regarding the villain to deliver a villain we love to hate, all thanks to Chukwudi's performance.

Speaking of improvements, the action scenes, especially one in a hallway, were expertly shot and amazingly choreographed. They fought in sync and understood their roles in the fight without communication. It is one of the best action scenes in the MCU.

I loved seeing all the practical alien designs & makeup throughout. If I remember correctly, this movie has the World Record for the most makeup prosthetic appliances created for a single production, which is superb!

The music choices were obvious, but still, solid songs, and it was great to hear on IMAX speakers. At times, the Marvel humour did ruin a couple of moments that could have been impactful. Thankfully, it was nowhere near as awful as Thor: Love and Thunder.

What could I say about the Guardians other than I like them a lot? I enjoy their interactions and teamwork. I love how these characters care and love each other; while not being related. However, this is very much a Rocket Raccons movie. He was secretly the main character this entire time. From the start, we knew little about his past, but for this third entry, we see it, feel it, and understand him differently now. All the actors did a fantastic job in their respective roles and certified it as their own. It has been quite a journey following these characters throughout the years, where a lot has happened for both them and for me, and how the characters exist in this finale was unexpected but bittersweet.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

We all understand Actors are all paid by contract and so and need to move on for new actors but for as an old marvel fan, i just hope the characters played by the same actors stay from my heart.

464,1.0,14-May-23,"""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is a prime example of a movie that is overhyped and fails to deliver on its promises. From start to finish, this film is an unmitigated disaster that will leave you scratching your head and wondering why you wasted your time and money.

The plot is poorly constructed and lacking in coherence, making it difficult to follow and ultimately leaving viewers feeling confused and frustrated. The characters are one-dimensional and fail to evoke any real emotional investment from the audience. The humor, which is supposed to be a major selling point of the film, falls flat and is more likely to elicit groans than laughs.

The special effects are mediocre at best, with cheesy and unconvincing visuals that fail to immerse viewers in the world of the movie. The action scenes are lackluster and forgettable, failing to generate any excitement or tension.

Overall, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is a forgettable and poorly executed film that should be avoided at all costs. If you're looking for a satisfying cinematic experience, look elsewhere.""","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

The quality of the movie is excellent. The comedy is not so much hilarious as funny in places, which is good. The drama is fine, but I wouldn't say it's very original. The action and battles don't make you bored.

Maybe I don't remember how it was in previous parts, but I thought there were a lot of songs under the video sequence, but it kind of makes the movie simpler. Rarely, but it can get boring. The plot as a whole is silly in places, which can basically be said for the antagonist.

Overall, it's a good movie. It's hard to say what it's bad at, but it doesn't claim to be a masterpiece. It feels like it would be good to watch in company, but for one time. I would say that for me, this is the weakest part of the three parts.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

The story was a little dumb but not boring. I liked the way they told the story. It was messy but enjoyable.

The start was great, the middle part was a little slow, and the ending was emotional and satisfying.

Some dialogues were great but some were just silly and annoying.

The action scenes were good.

The villain was interesting enough. But he wasn't as scary as Thanos.

The music was okay.

The Guardians, you know, They were AWESOME as always.

So, it's a good movie with great characters, good story and a satisfying ending.

471,1.0,5-May-23,"I must admit, for the first hour or so of this movie, I was not very impressed. The comedy felt forced, the first action scene was uninteresting to me (perhaps because it lacked context), and reliance on cute anthropomorphic animals seemed like a cliche, empty appeal to pathos. For me, it lacked a clear direction. The second half of the film, however, radiated with all the life, character and passion that made the first Guardians so good. I might still complain that the film runs a bit too long but the quality of the second half more than makes up for the first, perhaps even redeems it, if I ever end up watching this again.

Volume 3 does really well what any piece of franchise should do for its characters. It moves them forward, introduces change, and allows them to grow. This film saw the group band together after struggling to find their footing to fight for the things they care the most about.

Of all the movies in the MCU, the Guardians trilogy stands out for me because every installment has something the others don't, and that's heart. The cast is outstanding especially Chris Pratt as Peter Quill, and Dave Batista who is just brilliant in everything I've seen him do.

This 3rd installment, as everything in the MCU, has a ridiculous story and a lot of CGI but the true story behind all that is one of friendships, which we can all relate to. It does have a killer soundtrack and lots of laughs, which always helps. Highly recommended!","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

Director James Gunn manages to combine sweetness with viciousness to create a well-rounded movie that is both exciting and emotional. Despite the film being a bit overstuffed, it still provides a refreshing break from the post-Endgame slump in the franchise.

Gunn's sadistic side is prominently featured in the movie, and it adds a layer of depth to the characters and storyline. However, the film is not without its flaws. It is a messy finale that can feel aimless at times, and the heavy themes of loss and terror can make it an odd, lumbering patchwork of a film.

Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is an excellent addition to the series and a must-watch for fans of the films.

482,9.0,3-Aug-23,"Just finished watching this work. I was left quite satisfied. I was moved as there is genuine heart in the flick. About halfway through, I suddenly realized that I was smiling. Said physical arc remained on my visage for the remainder of the runtime. There were a number of great action sequences - lots of clever human/CGI fusions. Y'know the types of visual media that grow more appreciated by one over time? This flick will surely be one for me.

I started absorbing Marvel comics (never dug D. C.) in the early 70s when I was quite young. This period of consistent Marvel repasts lasted only about eight years but my youthful love for those great comics never left me. The MCU movies through phase three were all good (well, save Iron Man 2, The Hulk and Captain Marvel) but the first Guardians movie was an outlier. Though the group was a minor entity in the comics of yore, they were re-invented as an outstanding bundle of flawed, clever, bickering, irreverent and dancing characters. The flick was just SO MUCH FUN. The team was incredibly endearing, the humor always hit, the action was top-notch and the musical selections were inspired - it was truly superb. It stood above all the other Marvel flicks in terms of quality. Now that Marvel's offerings have gone astray in terms of quality, starting with phase four, I had feared that Guardians 3 would be infected with the general suckitude virus that sadly has afflicted all other recent works (save the Spidey flick, which was fun and engaging). How relieved I am that Guardians 3 turned out to be a far outlier, in terms of quality, compared with the non-Spidey phase four and five efforts.

To whoever selected the Spacehog, The The, X and The Replacements tracks, I salute you. To all involved with the creation of Guardians 3, I bow deeply before you. Very well done!

This final installment of the trilogy focuses on saving Rocket's life and includes flashbacks to his origin story. However, like its predecessors, the film features very one-dimensional characters, with clear-cut distinctions between good and bad and no real grey areas. The dialogue and themes often come off as juvenile, much like in Volumes 1 and 2, which can make it challenging to connect with the characters and their plight during these repetitive moments. On the bright side, the music selections are fantastic-fun, always welcome, and very fitting for each scene. As for the storyline, it quickly becomes stale and fails to hold interest, leading to a sense of boredom as the film progresses, at least in the first act. At the same time, the visuals were so spectacular, I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen during the bigger climactic scenes. And it ended on a memorable, bittersweet note.

Peter finally feels like he found how to lead, Drax finds peace after his wife and daughter, Rocket stops running from his fears, Gamora finds out who she is and Groot well, he is groot.

493,1.0,5-May-23,"I'm glad that James Gunn's humor is still sharp because that is the best part of the movie. I found myself laughing out loud countless times during my viewing. For being two and a half hours long, the movie didn't have that much action. There are like 4 action scenes. The story and villain also seemed pretty thin. The villain is some dude in a power suit who wants to destroy the universe, yada yada yada how original.

The villain and Rocket's relationship is what the whole movie's about, it's the driving force of the plot. The villain wants Rocket and will stop at nothing to get him, and that is the plot for this entire TWO AND A HALF HOUR long movie. I also hate that they brought back Gamora. Like, why? Why bring her back? She really didn't add anything, and by bringing her back, you let the audience know that anyone can be brought back, which then takes away all the stakes of the movie.

This movie is best when the Guardians are together and having their typical Guardians banter between themselves. The eye-popping production design, make-up and visuals are all top notch. The big showdown at the end had potential to be great, but then went very Disney and was just kind of ""eh"".

Overall, I'd say this is the 2nd best MCU movie post-Endgame (behind Spider-Man). There is some solid emotional depth and nice closure for Rocket, but I would still put Guardians 1 and 2 a tier above this one.

He gives all of these characters such human personalities that you can't help but fall in love with every single one of these characters. The villain here is the strongest of the series by far.

My wife doesn't cry at movies but this had her sobbing. But it's also filled with cute and sweet moments which probably only add to the heartbreak but they were still lovely moments.

The main story itself has a great plot with all the guardians doing a great job but for me, I applaud Pom Klementieff. She has really brought Mantis from a background character to easily one of the funniest in the MCU who can lead scenes with strength.

Ol' Gunn... always flirting with the absolute edge. I've followed this guys career pretty closely. His early on Twitter 'charm' is on full display here. You can tell this was his last MCU movie and he pushed everything to the R limits. Can't imagine what's on the cutting room floor... actually can't believe Fiege allowed this script to see the light of day.

Sure it is still not a great one, but it does not suck the life out of you as most Marvel productions have done the past couple of years. Tone, content and movie-wise I would say this is sort of a mixture of the two previous Guardians but slightly more graphic and slightly more adult perhaps.

I will give this a 1/10 because it is directed by james Gunn. Never going to give any movie he makes any higher score. But in reality this is perhaps a 7/10.

The good is that the humour is usually on point. The characters are as great as they always been. The character really are the heart of these movies. CGi really good, music, action, and a pretty satisfying ending of the movie make it more than watchable.

Where this movie fails is mainly with the overarching story. So much in this movie that does not make much sense. There is a lot of jumping from this to that, and the movie wants us to abandon all logic every 5min. The ending, although decently satisfying, also lack patos, and where is the post credit scene for The Marvels? Would have been an obvious addition, but nah.

The music, although great, is also overused and overdone. Gunn also goes super-Gunn in directing much of this movie with overuse of slow-mo and bombastic music, which is mostly a bad thing. The movie give me a messy feeling, like its too short, or too long. There are entire events and scenes that can easily be deducted and it would only make the movie better.

All things considered, I was pretty happy. Slightly disappointed perhaps, but this was a huge step up from anything Marvel has done for a long time. I would actually say this is the best movie since Captain Marvel. Pretty much everything, both movies and TV shows since our captain has been bad or really bad. This however is good.

Yes, there's a lot of marvel cruft weighing this entire trilogy down, but it truly does rise above as a heartfelt, funny, genuine tribute to everything great about pop culture of the millennial generation - the nostalgia for the music that came before us up until the music that we grew up with. The aesthetics and the references are just perfect.

We grew up with the Spielbergian backwards looking nostalgia sure. But Gunn captures more than the myopic usian view.

The rocket has given an importance in this movie unlike other movies . The comedy and the counters were sooo hilarious and much more awaiting for groot fans. All did their role to perfect, especially rocket, chris and all others did their role to perfect. Mantis and draux were the best combo for comedy. The story cud have been better tat was my only concern. The screenplay and athe action sequences were top notch classic guardians of the galaxy style.

515,6.0,10-May-23,"I honestly don't know if my taste is just so vastly different since online I am reading a lot of rave reviews touting this entry as the best guardians movie of the three, or if this is just the hype that almost every Marvel movie initially gets.

I don't see this one on the same level as the previous two. I watched Vol 2 first, before knowing about Vol 1. I left the theater very satisfied and entertained. I laughed a lot. Then I watched Vol 1, which I saw on the same level, absolutely enjoyed it. I am not a die-hard marvel fan, but I can safely say that the Guardians was probably my favorite franchise inside the franchise, and I was looking forward to this movie. I was sure, at the very least I am gonna have a great time and lots of laughs.

Unfortunately, I was completely disappointed. It's fine that they wanted to take it in a darker direction. I don't have an issue with that. The problem for me was that it was executed badly. The few laughs we go felt forced and re-hashed. We had good laughs before about Drax finding Mantis ugly, and Drax and Quill being stupid. But now I am tired of it. There were the same old jokes and it just felt uninspired. I laughed out loud only at one scene, and that was purely because I could relate to it due to a personal situation. Most of the jokes fell flat to me. The humor felt at times even very cringy. Judging by the audience reaction, that wasn't just me. Compared to previous Guardians and other movies, there were very little laughs or audience reactions. John Wick 4 received a ton more laughs from the entire room.

Like I said, maybe they intentionally took it into a darker direction, and that's fine, but it's disappointing if you already have an established franchise and audience expectations. If it had been executed well, I wouldn't mind it, but to me, it wasn't. My partner actually fell asleep at about the half way point.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

With that being said, by far, my absolute favorite of all the movies have been the Guardians Of The Galaxy.

They are all over 2 hours long and there is NEVER a dull or lagging moment. They seem to always be over too quickly and I am always left wanting more because it just seems like it's never enough.

This isn't just a ""comic book"" movie, it's GREAT cinema and great story telling. Great characters and great action. There's comedy, there's heartfelt moments.

A great movie series to pull you out of the horrible reality that is this day and age and it submerges you into a fantastical world that you wish you could be a part of, with a group of loveable misfits you wish you were a part of.

This love letter to rocket is one of the most beautifully crafted superhero movies I have ever seen. It is perfectly balanced between having you laugh, cry and cheering. Just as a last ride with the guardians into the forever and beautiful sky should be.

While the movie does focus quite a lot on action and explosions, seemingly the kinds that no one could survive, for me the best parts of the movie are the quieter scenes, the ones where the focus is more on the characters and how they relate to each other.

We get a back-story for Rocket and how he was created. How he surprised at his natural intelligence and wisdom. And as the movie moves along Rocket's life is in danger and the Guardians have to scramble to save him.

As with the others in the series this is just a popcorn movie at its core. It is for entertainment and for that it does very well.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
521,9.0,1-Sep-23,"At this point I can't tell if I'm just tired of these films and their formula or if they're just in a quality slump. I think it's a combination of the two. I thought the first Guardians film was pretty good but did not like the second one that much. Too much heavy-handedness in the themes, too much humor that didn't really land, too many attempts at emotional resonance that fell flat. This is closer to the second than the first in pretty much all of those categories.

The best part of the film is probably Iwuji who plays a good villain. Some of the Rocket backstory is good too, if kind of heart-breaking. But most of the film suffers from having such a large number of characters that we're supposed to care about, all breaking off into small groups, spawning subplots that feel too formulaic in their own way. It all builds really obviously into a ""send-off"" that to me felt kind of forced.

There were some entertaining scenes and, again, the parts involving Rocket's backstory were good, albeit a little hard to watch. But I don't really know why everyone seems to be raving about this one so much. To me it was barely better than the second film and definitely not in the upper tier of Marvel films overall.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
522,9.0,3-Aug-23,"Just watched this cracking film and was totally surprised how good it was, I wouldn't say that it has totally restored my faith in the Marvel universe,because that is long gone, but when people like James Gunn make films, you have to watch them because he is obviously a fanboy and also, more importantly, he knows what he's doing.(.. if anybody can rescue the dysfunctional, DC universe, it would be him and I will be interested to see what he can do, having said that I I loved, Henry Cavill, superman, and Ben, Affleck and gal Gadot, as Batman, and Wonder Woman, respectively, it's a shame the second, Wonder Woman film was such a hot mess...). I am familiar with the origin of rocket raccoon in the comics, and although this was changed, it still made logical sense, and it was great to see his friend Lyla,in it, ditto, lots of other characters from the comics,(.. I chuckled when I spotted Howard, the duck in a scene,-I know his film was pilloried, but I remember I didn't think it was too bad in at all...), I was not sure about Will Poulter playing Adam warlock, but in the end I thought he did very well, as did everybody in this superb romp. My wife and I had laughter and tears in equal measure, easily the best of the three films. The first film was a breath of fresh air, the second was still fun if a little generic, but this one was a fitting climax to the trilogy, although at the end it did say ' star, Lord will return'.... Got to say, I would have to be interested in that, especially if Mr Gunn is at the Helm. Great Stuff!!!.....","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
523,8.0,21-May-23,"Maybe it's just me, but when I go to the movies, apart from hearing other people loudly chew popcorn and slurp soda, I go expecting to be transported to other realities, other stories, that either make me forget the current reality for a couple of hours, or maybe make me think about it in a particular way. I go to be entertained, and the marvel movies are generally great at that.

That didn't happen to me with GOTG3.

I think it's not a big spoiler saying that this is basically Rocket's origin story. With it, the movie becomes a strong message against animal testing, and about the power of family/friends.

As rocket is a racoon, and racoons are cute, visually difficult scenes are inevitable. And this is where it becomes a difficult movie to watch. If you love not just pets but animals in general, you should expect a few cringe-worthy scenes.

And it struck me hard, as I had lost a beloved cat just a few weeks before watching this. So I cried during the movie, I cried on the way home, I cried at home, and I'm not that kind of guy. The usual Marvel and James Gunn's humor was just not nearly enough to overcome the sad feelings I got when watching this.

Seeing other reviews, I realise I wasn't the only one, which is kind of comforting.

If you manage to pay little importance to this, or if you're just not that much into animals, then this is a fun, fast paced and enjoyable movie, but also quite predictable.

If you care about animals, I'd recommend waiting for its availability on streaming servics, so you can pause or move through the toughest parts.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

But this is not a marvel movie, this a film by James Gunn, an honest filmmaker who cares deeply about these characters and gave them a glorified ending. I can only be thankful for the only filmmaker not stuffing political ideas down our throats.

This is a story of Love, loss, friendship and family, and the lengths we would go for the ones that we love. I dont mind the tonal shift between comedy, adventure and action because they all gradually compliment the other. This is one of the best Super hero films to date. Thank you James Gunn.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
525,7.0,9-May-23,"This was easily the darkest film in the Guardians trilogy. And in that sense, it's very much different from the joyful and uplifting vibes of the first two movies. I left the theater feeling conflicted, disturbed and a little sad. With that goes a fair warning, animal abuse is explicitly portrayed and also heavily implied in multiple scenes. If you're sensitive to animal abuse and planning to see this or are taking young children to the movie I highly advise against doing so.

Now for the humor, the first two movies nailed this. Had me belt out laughing to the point of tears. A lot of the jokes in this didn't land and felt forced. I chuckled a few times, but it felt like the whole movie was trying to play on my emotions with the cute animals and children in danger. At some points this definitely worked, rocket's backstory was very moving and simultaneously gripping. This was by no means a bad movie. But by Guardians standards, a bit of a let down.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

Im starting to believe this conspiracy theory: The last marvel movies doesn't really have directors and editors. They have been replaced by AI.

Love And Thunder, felt like an incoherent fever dream.

Ant-Man Quantumania, felt like an incoherent fever dream.

Guardians of the Galaxy vol 3, felt like an incoherent fever dream.

Not completely unlike the result you get when asking ChatGPT write a story.

I loved GotG 1 and 2. And most of Gunns previous work.

Number 3 was... what the hell am I watching?

Did Gunn really do this? I know he can do better.

It's gotta be cut together with AI right?

It's either that, or Gunn has lost his passion and gotten lazy or tired of pursuing his usual quality.

It feels like watching a long trailer with no narrative weight at all.

Nothing feels important. People die and come back like nothing.

Sometimes people can survive in the vacuum of space, sometimes not, depends on what is needed of the story or if it's an important character.

No coherence. The pacing is insanely fast. Emotional scene, yes very sad. SMASH CUT! Running and shooting!

The iconic classic music does not fit at all to what happens in the movie, people even dance out of rhythm.

There are ""funny scenes"" injected here and there with no thought, even when it does not make sense. The comedy is just forced this time around.

Even acting was pretty bland. They didn't even try with the voice acting for young Rocket. At least Quill and Gamora had some chemistry.

Ugh. But really though. I think it is time for the death of superhero movies. Every creator seem to have grown tired of it and is not putting passion into the movies anymore.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

The acting in this movie was quite good. Some of the actors were terrific. Once again, a really nice change of pace.

The action is great and the CG is the best it has been in a long while, the music is perfect such a perfected list that suits the movie to the ground.

531,8.0,4-May-23,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is the third film in the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" series and the 32nd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Once again written and directed by James Gunn and starring Chris Pratt, Dave Bautista, Zoe Saldana, Karen Gillan, Pom Klementieff, and the voices of Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel, it does a serviceable job of adding something new to a waning post-Endgame MCU.

Sometime after the events of both ""Avengers: Endgame"" and ""Thor: Love and Thunder"", the Guardians of the Galaxy have each been living quietly as citizens of Knowhere. When Rocket Racoon's (voiced by Bradley Cooper) life is suddenly placed in danger, the Guardians quickly embark on a mission to help him before he is lost forever. Their mission proves difficult for most of the team's members, particularly with leader Peter Quill/Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) still feeling depressed over losing Gamora (Zoe Saldaña). The Guardians soon realise that Rocket is in more danger than they had anticipated when they learn that the powerful Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) is seeking to destroy them all.

Over the past few years, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been going through what I consider to be an ""experimental"" period. With the usual superhero film formula growing a bit stale, it seems like the producers are taking some creative risks as a means to both retain some freshness and hopefully keep audiences invested in the bigger picture. Though these risks have yielded mixed results, I have to give the higher-ups some credit for at least trying something different from what everyone is used to. On that note, the third ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" film is quite a tonal departure from what we've all come to expect from this otherwise light-hearted set of movies, which paves the way for a more downbeat look at this loveable team of heroes.

Admittedly, I was apprehensive about seeing these fun-loving characters in such a vulnerable state but by the end I came to appreciate how the film highlighted each of their important human qualities. Someone like Peter Quill, who has been through a rollercoaster of emotional journeys, has certainly needed time to rebuild himself back into the team leader he is supposed to be. He is still overcome with grief at losing Gamora, the woman he loves, and now has the difficult task of winning over her reluctant younger version from 2014. Likewise, we learn that Rocket is reflecting over the traumatic events that turned him into the wise-cracking racoon he is today. Things take a turn for the worst when he is later placed in danger of losing his life, and it is here Rocket discovers how important it is to have friends who care about his general well-being. These are just two examples of what this film chooses to focus around with its characters, and while this may prove disheartening to those expecting the usual frequent laughs, I believe it is all handled reasonably well.

For its lengthy runtime of 150 minutes, the film at least keeps things going at a brisk enough pace most of the way through. This is because James Gunn does a decent job introducing us to strange new locations populated with equally strange supporting characters to the point where it is hard for boredom to ever sink in. Despite the film taking a more serious tone, that's not to say it is completely devoid of any humour or wonder. I did find myself chuckling at some of the odd aliens the Guardians interacted with throughout the story and I liked some of the visuals that accompanied the places they visited. One place, as seen in the trailers, resembles an alternate version of Earth, except with animal-like humanoids as its main inhabitants. Though there are a handful of jokes at the expense of these creatures' ignorance, we eventually see that they are not much different from regular people in terms of personality. This is a stark contrast to the excessive use of CGI in place of a story seen in a certain ""Ant-Man"" sequel, which quickly lost my interest as the flashy effects kept piling up.

The film's biggest fault, however, is its inability to juggle three contrasting stories playing out at the same time. One features Rocket figuring out who he truly is, the second has the Guardians trying to rescue him, and the last one is the villain hunting everyone down. Without giving away spoilers, I didn't care for the way the film attempted to intertwine these three plots at various intervals, which resulted in some cluttered storytelling. It is especially problematic when you realise that each of the three stories has a completely different tone, ranging from deadly serious to cheerfully funny. If you waver a film's tone too much, it becomes hard to be invested in everything that it going on, and this does happen at certain points. Had the film picked just one of these tones to go with, then it could have made for a more streamlined finale, but instead it all came across as somewhat misguided in its overall execution.

Where the film succeeds greatly is in its depiction of the characters we've known and loved for almost nine years now. Chris Pratt's Peter Quill has matured considerably since the last time we saw him, making decisions based on rational thinking rather than emotion. As we saw in ""Avengers: Infinity War"", it was Quill's emotional outbursts that caused things to go wrong for everyone, so it is nice to see that he is in the process of learning from those mistakes. Zoe Saldaña's younger Gamora is naturally different from her deceased counterpart, given that this version of her is not the one who fell in love with Quill. Since she has no memory of ever loving Quill, we now have to watch them bond all over again from the very beginning. Karen Gillan's Nebula is also more compassionate and caring of what happens to her fellow Guardians members. I assume this is due to her spending an extended amount of time on Earth during the events of ""Avengers: Endgame"", which makes sense since it was there she was treated nicely by the rest of the Avengers.

As Mantis, I liked how Pom Klementieff shows a more assertive side to her character. In the past, Mantis has been relatively passive and reluctant to fight, but now she never backs down from a scuffle if the going gets tough. She and Dave Bautista's Drax had their fair share of funny moments, mostly as a result of the latter's lack of intelligence. Anybody who saw ""The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special"" will remember what an amusing duo Mantis and Drax were throughout, and all of that can be found here as well. That being said, Drax is still a vital member of this team in his own right, contributing not only his brawn but the occasional heartfelt voice of reason when the situation calls for it.

I won't talk too much about Rocket since most of his scenes venture into spoiler territory but I enjoyed how we learn so much more about him as the story progresses. Rocket has always been an enigmatic character, never revealing any helpful information about his past, so to see this much focus placed on him was a great creative decision. Bradley Cooper definitely shines as the voice of Rocket, injecting a lot of emotion into his performance, which is easier said than done considering he is technically a talking racoon. As for Groot, there isn't much to say except that he's still the Groot we know and love. I mean, you've got to applaud Vin Diesel for his uncanny ability to say ""I am Groot"" with such convincing inflections.

However, I think Will Poulter's Adam Warlock was a mixed bag at best. Though I liked how seriously Poulter played the character, there weren't really enough parts in the film that let him to stand out too much. Personally, I blame this on the aforementioned poor choice of having three conflicting stories happening at once but it's also possible this was done as a way to set things up for future MCU events. Regardless, I think Poulter's Warlock was fairly decent, even he didn't leave as much of an impression as I had hoped.

When considering the varying quality of post-Endgame MCU content, I would say that ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the more interesting entries in this long-running cinematic universe. It may not blow your mind with the usual superhero action nor will it make you frequently laugh with its comic relief, but it should hopefully make you care just enough about its characters to appreciate their evolution over time. With all of that in mind, this film has me cautiously optimistic that the future of the MCU can still be good, even it has seen better days.

GOTG 3 is definitely going to feel more like an origin story for Rocket and it's one of the best origin stories, it's full of laughs like Marvel has been known for but it's also going to get dark and it's probably one of the more violent MCU movies short of Deadpool.

536,9.0,7-May-23,"Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol 3 (2023)

When Guardians of the Galaxy came out in 2014, I didn't bother watching it for 1 month because honestly.... a superhero movie about a squirrel and a tree. Now it's in my MCU top 5 because of how different, fresh and funny it felt at the time thanks to James Gunn's vision. After endless failures, Guardians Vol 3 was easily the most anticipated MCU film in years and yet, while watching I simply couldn't feel as good as I did during Vol 1 and 2.

The story puts Rocket in the central focus as we get to see numerous flashbacks of his youth which are the most outstanding element of this movie. It genuinely felt like a lot of effort was put into developing his arc while creating emotion, attachment and care from the audience. Bradley Cooper nailed the voice acting and the arc came full circle with a proper payoff. Unfortunately, the unleashed version of James Gunn who wanted to have emotions, action, drama, comedy, morals and music all the same time which ended up becoming a huge mess.

One moment I was sympathizing with Rocket and the next I was holding my head from the cringe of Drax or Mantis. The same old screaming banter was inserted every other scene and because of the repetitiveness it wasn't just unfunny, but it also broke the emotional impact. Sometimes, I wonder if James Gunn is a person who thinks his jokes are way funnier than they actually are since he keeps repeating the same thing without knowing when to stop. Also, this Adam Warlock fella was so hyped but he ended up being a damp firecracker who felt weak, pointless and shoved into the story.

The main villain clearly cared about his mission and there is quite a bit to think about; however, the fact that he kept screaming the entire time made him feel like the diet version of Kang. The corridor scene was extremely well made as the music actually fit the moment and made it impactful. The best part though is that Vol 3 was a standalone adventure without any ties to the rest of the MCU which allowed it to flow according to it's own rules. Even though I was disappointed, this was the best one since No Way Home and until Fantastic 4 comes around, I bid farewell to the MCU.

If these aren't signs of his talents then I don't know what is.

Oftentimes the third entry in a trilogy is the worst, but I think it might be the opposite case here!

All of the actors give it their all, and there isn't a single weak link amongst them! And you can tell everyone on-screen was having a blast and that just adds to the experience.

The digital effects are flawless!

The movie flies by!

The action scenes are fun and sometimes brutal. There's an incredibly satisfying single-take action scene that brought my jaw to the floor!

This is some of the best directing James Gunn has given us!

There is excellent cinematography!

I have one very minor criticism: Some jokes were injected in at inappropriate moments.

It's my favorite movie of the year so far!

Go watch it!","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
541,1.0,12-Sep-23,"SO surprised by this movie. I have not watched the other ones (or any Marvel film) started them but wasn't captivated so never finished them so I didn't followed the storyline. Still I had no problem enjoying this movie on it's own. It's such an emotional film and that's what I wasn't expecting at all from a Marvel movie. I cared for the characters, in this one the storyline of Rocket is central and we follow along his journey where he came from and how it ties with the threat they (the guardians) have to face right now. As a animal lover, this hit me right in the feels. Loved the message it brought across. Also the music is so good and gives a light touch to the whole somewhat emotional ride. Loved the humor, the witty banter between the characters and I was just entertained the whole time. So even for the non Marvel or Guardians of the galaxy fans, this is such a recommendation. The rating is so deserved and I'm so glad I gave it a chance and pressed 'play'.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
542,1.0,8-May-23,"What a disappointment! The first one was great fun, the second almost as good , but this film is just a poor cousin that really struggles from a weak storyline that never really gets going. The megalomaniacal ""High Evolutionary"" (Chikwudi Iwuji) has set his sights on retrieving ""Rocket"" after having discovered that our feisty raccoon is a product of sophisticated genetic engineering - and that has enabled him to think and grow as a being; a skill that is hugely valuable to this global-scale cloner. Snag is, ""Rocket"" has been laid low after a rather violent visit from ""Warlock"" (Will Poulter) who is working with his mother to apprehend our ursine pal. ""Quill"" (Chris Pratt) and the others have determined to save him, though, and are soon on the trail of his origins and of a special pass key that could reset him and get him back to fighting fitness. Can the ""Guardians"" put aside their petty differences and unite before it's all too late? This is far too long and it also tries to involve all of the characters in such a fashion as to leave the whole thing with a rather superficial feel to it. Pratt actually features quite sparingly, and that robbed this of much of it's humour and punchiness. The visual effects are great, but that's nothing remarkable with Marvel - they are vivid and colourful but that's no substitute for a well written and characterful narrative that this film simply lacks. It does quite feature quite an engagingly eclectic soundtrack, but the rest of this is terribly unremarkable fayre that I found my self struggling to stay interested in as it meandered more into a realm of sci-fi sentimentality that ensured a minimum of jeopardy in a denouement that featured a fair degree of ham - especially from Iwuji. If this is to be the final instalment, then I fear it will not be one that I will ever bother to watch again. Pity.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
543,1.0,11-Aug-23,"I was amazed by the movie Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, a superhero movie that is the end of the trilogy of Guardians of the Galaxy. The movie is directed by James Gunn, who also made the previous two movies. The movie tells the story of the team of Guardians of the Galaxy, who have to save one of their members from a new and dangerous enemy.

The movie is very entertaining and touching. The movie has an exciting story, full of action and humor. I also got to know more about the characters in this movie, such as their background and role. The movie also has cool animation, with different styles and colors. The movie also has a surprising and touching ending, which made me curious about the next movie.

The movie is the best movie from the trilogy of Guardians of the Galaxy. I am glad that Marvel made a quality and different movie from other movies. I highly recommend you to watch this movie if you like superhero and animated movies.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
544,1.0,6-May-23,"Does it have a few cheesy moments? Yes. Are there logical issues? Absolutely. Is it predictable? Of course. Does it star a generic white guy named Chris? You got it. And yet-for the most part-this is actually very good; and I don't know if Marvel's made a better movie.

It's always best to know as little as possible about something before you watch it; at this point, there have been enough Marvel movies for you to probably know what you're getting yourself into. Compared to the others, although this one has many of the same faults (the worst being fake-out deaths with zero consequences, which seems like a requirement for Marvel at this point), it has some character and emotional depth that not a single previous Marvel flick has reached. This is almost entirely due to the way the character of Rocket is handled. If you think a CGI cartoon voiced by Bradley Cooper doing a very bad Joe Pesci impersonation can't bring you to tears, think again.

The only truly bad parts of the movie are 1) the mediocre acting and poor attempts at being funny from Chris Pratt, 2) the fake-out death elements, and 3) the predictability and paint-by-numbers approach that still inhibits and inhabits Marvel properties. Meanwhile, you have 1) emotional depth, 2) character depth, 3) new characters knocking it out of the park, 4) a truly impressive performance by Zoe Saldana of a much different version of the same character she's played for years, 5) Dave Bautista consistently out-acting everyone around him, 6) Karen Gillan doing fantastic with a mostly thankless job, 7) action set pieces that aren't amazing but are better than most of Marvel's blandness, and 8) a dog with telekinesis played by the girl from Borat 2.

The math leans in the Guardians' favor.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
545,6.0,5-May-23,The story goes on and leaves you wanting for more. A fast paced adventure where we see how the past always comes back to bite us. A movie that introduces us to several characters and brings some old ones into a new spot light before the curtains come closing down on the A-team of our favorite Guardians of the Galaxy. A space opera made with Rock and Roll! Awesome movie! You will see a roller coaster of emotional connection and how the need to save a friend makes one forget his onw problems to focus on what really matter... The living... A story of sacrifice and struggle in the endless effort to save a friend.,"May 5, 2023 (United States)"
546,1.0,8-May-23,"Firstly, I enjoyed the movie. It made me nostalgic to go back and watch the first two.

Secondly, the story was a little dark and macabre for a 12 rated movie. I was a little surprised to see some quite young children watching it, especially given the language (more than a few F-words). Personally, I would've rated it 15 given the dark nature of the story.

Generally, the film was good. It was nice to see how far the characters have progressed and see how the bonds had become closer. I liked the new character additions too. There were funny moments and moments full of heart. There were a few parts where I welled up, but for the most part, I enjoyed it. Let's just say, Rocket was the focus and in the best possible way, he got what was owed to him.

Overall, I was left feeling a bit shocked by the ""horror"" movie style, and the fact it was only PG12. But once I got over that, I appreciated the story and where it went.

The ending did make me sad, but as they say, all Good things must come to an end, although I really wish they wouldn't. They've left the door open for more to come which was nice, but I just felt like a few promises that were made in previous GOTG movies were not followed through. I also can't see how it ties into the next phases of the MCU.

Anyway, go see the film, you'll enjoy it. But I wouldn't recommend taking children younger than 12/13!","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

Drax is as annoying as ever and the cool music that made the first movie stand out is forced and overdone. Nothing about this movie makes sense and it was difficult to pay attention to front the start. There's also random usuals of unexpected foul language that's out of character.

The characters remind me of all the randoms you'd see in the Star Wars films and I think Disney just cobbled together scenes on all of the unused sets they had lying around from their mediocre Star Wars spin offs.

And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. His isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

However, was it a perfect film, no. The needle dropping broke me out of the film, as did the slomo, Groot's personality and character design, as well as the rather convoluted plot. With all those flaws, for an MCU film, I would rewatch it.

Pratt's acting was weak, he stood out to me as a guy who is getting out of his depth with these films as they grow more demanding. He is just not a very nuanced actor.

I was truly surprised at how emotional I was and connected I became to the characters - above and beyond how I felt watching any of the other Guardians films. The action/fight scenes were some of the best in any marvel series, the humor is at least in the top 2 or 3... music, acting, digital effects, the villain... all of it was just very good. As far as Marvel movies go, this is up there with all of the best of them.

Only thing I wish was different (which isn't a complaint about the movie but just an addition that could have been cool) are is that a certain character had duked it out with the main villain, which never happens. For story purposes I think it makes sense why this didn't happen though.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

The storyline follows our friends who have lost Gamora and are in the process of losing Rocket Raccoon too. The team is going to do everything possible to uncover Rocket's past and find a way to save him. In researching his past they uncover a man who acts like a god trying to create the perfect society and people... Do the Guardians stand a chance against such an adversary?

This movie is written and directed by James Gunn (The Suicide Squad) and stars Chris Pratt (Jurassic World), Dave Bautista (Blade Runner 2049), Bradley Cooper (The Hangover), Vin Diesel (The Fast and Furious), Chukwudi Iwuji (John Wick: Chapter 2), Pom Klementieff (Old Boy) and Zoe Saldana (Avatar).

This movie is a fun continuation of the Guardians of the Galaxy Universe with a great continuation of the characters we love and some entertaining new ones. The action scenes and special effects were top notch as were the backdrops. The CGI was out of this world and seeing this in 3D was incredible. The comedic content was a bit lacking, at least from Pratt. Bautista and Klementieff were awesome and their dialogue, interactions and comedy kept the film moving. Some aspects of the movie were cheesy, but the plot kept my attention as Rocket was easy to root for and the addition of the Adam Warlock storyline was mysterious and fun to watch unfold. The ending was very rewarding and gave hope for some worthwhile spinoffs.

This volume was funny. It felt like that was the best the movie had to offer overall. Just a lot of fun rich jokes. It was strange if you think about how much it cost in special effects to make this movie and they made a movie where a lot of funny talking is happening. They gave James Gunn a lot of freedom to do some character development to the Guardians. Did we really need that? I'll just say I now see why Dave Bautista was like he did not want to be known as Drax the Destroyer for his overall acting career.

The movie did have a lot of really good action scenes spread through the entire film. On one side, this film was all about the Guardians bonding, but despite how intimate that was met to be the movie felt big. Not the biggest Marvel movie I've seen but their efforts were worth seeing on the big screen.

And give it up for the High Evolutionary. Don't know much about the character so I can't speak on accuracy but he was evil. I'm glad the Marvel Cinematic universe is getting better with the villains.

My only real complaint was the soundtrack. Great songs overall but it did not fit into the story being told like with the other volumes.

Overall, it was a good movie as far as movies go, as part of the MCU like other movies (like Ant-Man 3 which came out earlier this year) I feel the magic winding down, but so far this was the best offering for Marvel studios for 2023.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

Anyway, on with the review!

This was a fantastic movie, and the positive reviews reflect this. It had everything you could want from a ""Guardians"" movie - Heart & soul, comedy, catchy tunes, fantastic action and visually stunning. It was a thrilling ride from start to finish and it was beautiful in IMAX 3D.

One thing to add, though, is that it has more profanity than you'd usually expect in an MCU movie, which doesn't bother me but parents might want to be aware before taking their kids if this is an issue for them.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

Star Lord is the least interesting of all the Guardians, but he's played by the biggest star so he has to be given a lot of screen time.

Celebrity cameos and wisecracks could also have been cut to add some urgency to this bloated snooze fest.

The film rolls from one special effect to the next without a feeling that anything of significance has happened, since the characters attitudes barely change. There's the usual super hero lack of consequences as characters seemingly take huge blows and they're right as rain in the next sequence.

The villain is wasted amidst all this. He never seems like a huge threat to our invincible, quipping heroes.

563,9.0,7-Jul-23,"Of the entire catalogue of Marvel superhero movies thus far, I have to admit that the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" movies have been among some of the better for me, as they are the most colorful and have the most interesting characters.

While I am not much of a superhero fan in general, I do sit down to watch these Marvel movies because they are rather nicely made. Thus, I also opted to sit down and watch the 2023 movie ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"". And I have to admit that I am very glad that I did, because ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" turned out to be really enjoyable. And it was without a doubt, the best of the three movies in the franchise.

The storyline in ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"", as written by writer and director James Gunn, just felt very wholesome, and it brought a lot of nice details to the various characters. I especially enjoyed the entire focus point on Rocket and his backstory; that one really added so many layers to the character and it was rather nicely written.

Running at 150 minutes, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" doesn't feel like a long movie, because director James Gunn manages to keep the pacing going at full throttle throughout the entire movie. Thumbs up on that accomplishment.

It is always nice to see returning cast on the screen reprising their characters, and that was definitely the issue in ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"". A good cast ensemble returned to the screen, and that was applicable to both the main cast, but also for support cast in small roles. That adds a good sense of continuity to the storyline.

Visually, then you know that Marvel goes all in, guns blazing. And they also did that in ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"", oh boy did they ever! The CGI effects in the movie are through the roof, and that adds a lot of feel and flavor to bringing the universe in which the movie takes place to life. Lots of attention to detail. The props, wardrobe and make-up departments also worked very nicely here.

If you enjoy Marvel movies, then ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a movie that is well-worth sitting down and spending 150 minutes on watching.

Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3 is an awesome superhero film that is a perfect end to the trilogy with action, emotions, and a great direction arc that concludes to the characters we love.

The plot is great. It involves a bit of a backstory to rocket raccoon. And how he came to be. And a story involving the High Evolutionary played by Chukwudi Iwuji who is the villain. The film is big, fast paced, and action packed. It is filled with a bit of a emotional story which can be dark and concluding characters arcs. James Gunn script and direction does know how to handle the pacing, action and emotional story.

The visual effects are amazing. The music score and soundtrack is great. Great cast ensemble. Plus new additions like Will Poulter and Chukwudi Iwuji which they deliver. The action sequences are big and exciting.

Expect old faces and rivalries as we proceed through stunning plot twists blending humour alongside thrilling action scenes but perhaps comparatively less comedic moments than before; all characters have ample opportunity for growth, especially Rocket, whose backstory steals the show. Gunn cleverly honours past films with throwbacks to memorable music, inside jokes, and themes that made these movies resonate with fans.

The film's cutting-edge visual effects and beautifully crafted soundtrack complete this satisfying finale experience. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 takes audiences on another wild and wacky ride back to space - but does it soar as high as its predecessors? While many enjoyable moments and heartwarming character beats are scattered throughout this movie, its lengthy runtime can sometimes feel like treading water more than swimming forward. Additionally, despite being teased as a formidable foe, the main villain ultimately comes across as forgettable with flimsy motivations that never make sense. Although there are some clever nods to past entries in this cinematic universe present here these references may intimidate newer viewers by relying on their existing knowledge instead of establishing connections organically.

And while everything wraps up by the end credits roll, it concludes too easily without enough weight given to certain plot threads.

Jaime isn't necessarily into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but Guardians of the Galaxy is a series she liked before me.

For this, we are picking up where the last events of Guardians of the Galaxy: Christmas Special as well as Avengers: Endgame. We know that Gamora (Zoe Saldana) is alive but doesn't remember anything of her time with the Guardians. This bums out Peter Quill aka Star-Lord (Chris Pratt). I should say that the Guardians' current line-up is Rocket (Bradley Cooper), Mantis (Pom Klementieff), Drax (Dave Bautista), Nebula (Karen Gillan), Groot (Vin Diesel) and Peter.

This movie explores the history of Rocket. He was created by The High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji) and his group. There is a heartbreaking story as Rocket gains awareness and makes friends with other similar creatures. When he learns that he is to be disposed of, Rocket decides to free his friends and himself. The problem is that The High Evolutionary anticipated that. This partially explains why Rocket is as bitter with life as he is.

We also get to meet another interesting character of Adam Warlock (Will Poulter). He's the son of Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki). He is there to take Rocket back to The High Evolutionary. Things don't go as planned though and we see how ruthless our new villain is.

That is where I'm going to stop with my recap as this has a lot going on in it. This runs two and half hours, clocking in as one of the longer non-Avengers films in the MCU. I understand why. This movie is fun while also pulling at the heartstrings. There might be a few times that I legit had tears. It is surprising to do for a movie like this. I'm not sure that's happened since watching Endgame so kudos there. There are also major shake-ups here for this group going forward so it needed to be longer as well.

Let me then go over to the filmmaking. This is as you would expect, a CGI fest. This has Disney money though so it looks good. We get epic battle scenes. That's one thing James Gunn can do. They use slow-motion quite a bit. I could have used less there. While watching it, I get why though. There are so many members of the group that is the best way to showcase them. I'm glad what they do here to bridge the gap to the next film. Another key aspect to these movies is the soundtrack. This probably has the weakest of the scores, but that is still better than 90% of the movies in the MCU. I might even be undercutting my number there as well.

What I'll say is if you're a fan of the Guardians of the Galaxy, see this movie. If you follow the MCU, see this movie. I'd even recommend it to non-fans of the series. This is just a great movie in my opinion. The best I've seen since Endgame for sure.

My Rating: 8.5 out of 10.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
579,2.0,7-Jul-23,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3 - I finally got around to watching the movie and am so happy I did! The opening scene is excellent and shows all of the characters, the music is cool and relaxing which helps tell the story of ""this place is slow and steady"". As a warning, there are depictions of animal cruelty but things don't get too graphic, it's needed to tell the story of Rocket and his origins, and some parts were heartwarming and also heartbreaking. On another note, the thing I like most about the Guardian movies is the world-building that it has, because the story is set in space there are countless worlds that can be brought in with new characters. Also, the action scenes are engaging and fun, easy to follow along, and not overwhelming, it also fits the plot and shows that they're not just fighting for the fun of it.

Additionally, the ending scene (and post-credit scene) was very heartwarming to watch. I somehow went months without seeing a spoiler for this movie and it was great because I went into the movie without knowing anything which made me love every single minute.

580,1.0,5-May-23,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 was a beautiful farewell to the GotG trilogy. It was a proper Marvel movie we got to see in recent years. The movie had more emotional tone and all the characters had more depth in this concluding part. Rocket's backstory was also good and emotional and it moves you. The songs prevent the story from becoming boring. The story was engaging and even after having long runtime and uneven pacing, the story doesn't fail to entertain you. The climax was also nice and it makes you emotional as it feels like end of something beautiful. Overall, James Gunn delivered a beautiful Marvel movie.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
581,1.0,8-May-23,"In James Gunn's final farewell from Marvel, we have Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. The Guardians now in possession of Knowhere are in the process of rebuilding the Colney following Thanos's attack. Quill's still mourning the loss of Gamora and failing to impress the variety picked up in Endgame. Matters only get worse when all of a sudden Adam Warlock(Will Poulter) shows up to destroy the guardian and in the process, Rocket is mortally wounded and is put on Life support. So now the Guardians have to set out and the means to save him all wrapped in the possession of the mysterious High Evolutionary. In many ways, Guardians 3 set out what it tends to do in what's meant to be a farewell to not only the director but also these characters that we've gotten to know over several films. While there's still humor and charm to be found in this film It stands out from past several films going for a more serious tone. The first half of the film is far slower paced it's more dialogue-driven as imposes actions and in many ways, it works, and in many ways, it doesn't. With subplots that don't overall mean much to moments that do feel like bloat that just expands the film's runtime. This is understandable given they wanted everybody to get their fair amount of screen time, but some moments could have been trimmed down in favor of giving more focus to other things such as Starlord and Gamora. Overall the theme of family, loss, and moving on emotional investment in the relation of the team. The cast as a whole for the most part a great all the guardians are delivered well the humor is rather mixed in this film when it does happen not every joke don't hits as in previous films. Most of the funny lines are Delivered by Drax. Whereas many from Mantis just come off as forced. Groot is Groot he's fine, but the design they give him just looks terrible compared to how he looks in the first. Star lord they set up a subplot with him, but their address in small moments then never addressed again. Him being a Celestial his blunder with Thanos in the first half he just acts like a jerk and halfway through he;'s more the character we knew in the other films. As for the relationship between him and Gamora with little she has to do with the Story Zoe Saldana does give a great delivery, but when it comes to the overall situation between her and Quill. Rocket, of course, is the center point of the story the drive to push all of them to show their love and admiration for each other as sort of the defauctonional family they are. Most of his scenes are done through flashbacks and overall I enjoyed them. Rocket was always the member we knew the least about and had just hinted to go off. It's here that finally shows the answers and where the more serious aspect of the film derives from. It's darker, depressing, and violent. The High Evolutionary sells all of these points. It was quite shocking that they were able to make this villain work the way they did. He's a welcome addition to what's been missing past Endgame. He's a villain a Fanatic geneticist who's obsessed with making the perfect lifeform. Doesn't care about any of his creations, or any of the despicable actions he commits. He's not misunderstood, he wasn't wronged in his past He was just psycho with a God Complex, and the movie does well in making you hate him. The worst aspect starts with Adam Warlock. It's been stated numerous times that it's too late to bring this character into these films. Set up at the end of the second film and did nothing with him for infinity war and Endgame where everybody stated he should have been with Thanos. Now we're finally giving him in the film and he sucks. He's reduced to nothing more than a puppet and is a dumb mama's boy who connects to overall nothing in the grand scheme of things. The second is the soundtrack. The soundtrack in these films has always been some of the best highlights. Whereas a lot of films rely on Licensed songs just for cheap grabs. The songs in guardians' films always fit setting the tone and pace of the action. They all for the most part fitted with the scenes they were assigned to. Here personally I don't remember a single song from this. It just felt like Gunn was just going all out same with the camera shots and spins. The songs are just thrown in everywhere just for the sake of noise. Overall while the film does feel bloated and some things don't add up the movie does serve as a sent-off to these character ad a good farewell.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

584,7.0,5-May-23,"This third chapter in the Guardians series feels like it has a new style of its own while keeping the essence of the previous ones. It's a much more serious tone which I really enjoyed.

Like with the last two MCU movies, they dial back the comedy and do a better job of placing it strategically. The jokes feel organic as opposed to the ""insert joke here"" style. And they never take away from a serious moment. And man are there some serious moments.

This movie is emotionally powerful. I felt such a range of emotions and they all hit hard. They take their time with the scenes and allow you to simmer in that moment. And the beautiful music magnifies all of this.

The arguments between characters are all compelling. I like the added focus on Mantis after seeing Pom's performance in the Holiday Special. And I'm so glad they pushed the PG-13 rating pretty far. I would love to continue seeing darker elements explored without holding back as much.

I've never been part of the MCU fatigue crowd because I don't fatigue from fun entertainment. But I was a little nervous after two of the last three movies were near the bottom of my rankings (Thor 4 and Ant-Man 3). But with Guardians 3, hope is restored that they can bounce back if they falter.

And it seems like they're listening to feedback. This feels more like giving the reigns to the director and allowing him to put his own stamp on it. It feels like its own movie rather than another template movie. And they fixed the comedy. This is how comedy should be incorporated into the movie, the exact opposite example of Thor 4.

585,1.0,7-Jul-23,"An entertainer all the way. The plot focuses on the backstory of Rocket and has more than enough scenes for you to tear up. I just wish there were more superhero stories where characters didn't have to die for a protagonist to find a purpose.

The scenes with Rocket's friends almost seem like a Disney movie hidden within a Marvel movie.

As expected, there's the usual childish comedy between the members of the Guardians which is funny at times. Gamora seems to have forgotten Quill - something about the events in Infinity War and End Game where half the human race was wiped out and then unwiped. So Quill is stuck on that and tries to convince (?!?) Gamora that they are meant to be together.

The High Evolutionary is an over-the-top villain who doesn't seem menacing at all. I don't know if it's the acting or the character itself. Seemed more like a character from Dexter's Laboratory.

Two characters that made this movie enjoyable for me were Cosmo the Spacedog and Mantis. Cosmo pleading with Kraglin to take back something he said is my type of hilarity. And Mantis is wholesomely cute. They both have exotic accents. Hmm, I'm noticing a pattern.

The heart-tugging scenes in the film seemed like they were included on purpose and did not gel with the action and silly humor. That's why I give this only 7 stars.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
586,6.0,15-May-23,"Guardians of the Galaxy isn't really about a gang. It's Peter Quill's story. He's the only one of them who isn't a cartoon. We're emotionally invested in Peter from the moment our trilogy takes off.

In this movie, Peter takes a back seat to Rocket, a character whose best attribute is that he was used just sparingly enough that he didn't ruin the first movie. He was only ever comic relief. The tone of this character was clownish on the moment we meet him. It was an absolutely ridiculous mistake to the side to try to use him as the emotional centerpiece of this story.

He was an adequately CGI'd cartoon. Most of us tolerated him as a character, ask the necessary baggage required to bring a children's comic book to life. Whoever wrote this movie apparently thought that they could leverage a hatred of animal cruelty into some sort of emotional connection with a character that has not an ounce of believability.

The Russian space dog had more depth than rocket.

The movie we came here to see was the continuation of Quill's story. He has a second chance at love. We wanted to see that happen. Even a plot arc where we see Quill and Nebula find love would have been something compelling.

Or what about the next chapter in his evolution? We know now that he's half God... Does he still have some access to the extraordinary powers he tapped into in the last volume? Powers that he could use to... Oh I don't know... Guard the Galaxy?

No. Instead we get an incredibly boring story about Rocket, a character I can't even force myself to care about.

And of course, this movie suffers from an incredibly boring villain. Once again we are introduced to a villain who is so obscenely evil that he feels totally flat and unbelievable. Animal cruelty? Xenocide? Not a single personality trait beyond megalomania, narcissism, and psychopathy. *Yawn""

On the end of the day we're left with a movie that has no emotional weight at all. And it doesn't even have the decency to be fun or funny.

You empathize with the characters and feel that every member of the group is important. The quality of the action is high, but this is not the main part - action just supports the storytelling and characters. Good work, James Gunn. Best actor nominee may sound strangely but I'd like to give it to the Rocket.

Funny sayings and incidents accompany all the activities as is the trademark of the Guardians.

Peter was for once, not in focus, but that particular narrative justice is wholly justified within the plot. I have to put myself in a position to disagree with critics against the villain and his inherent evilness. There is but one criteria at play in the context of the Guardians. Healthy duality of crazy and defeatable. That's it, really.

A good soundtrack that fits great with the scenes displayed. All of the characters had arch's throughout the trilogy and it feels final.

This movie made me feel sad, happy and angry at the same time, which is rare with Marvel, but I think they realized they had to focus more on the characters and story for people to still love their show.

I want to make a review without spoilers, so I'm not going to write about any details about what could've been done in other ways. You can pick on small things which people often do, but I'm rating the movie as a whole, and as an experience for 20$. It's a 10/10 for me!

The movie suffers from generic marvel humor. Some bad dialogue also. The guy playing High evolutionary gave a decent performance. The organic space station was ridiculous and cringy.

It definitely achieved the goal. This movie jumps right into the story and sucks you in, we return to the galaxy and immediately it starts to pull on your heartstrings, and then the action begins. The performances are all fantastic as they always were, maybe even Chris Pratt's best performance of his career. The chemistry with the team is the most natural it has been. The negative is something I personally always did not care for with Gunn is sometimes the humor timing is off and the jokes aren't always as strong. There are times throughout the movie where a joke comes in and they nail it and there are quite a few times where it does ruin moments and also the joke is a bit cringe and it does not stop it keeps going on in the scene. All in all, it is a solid installment, it works perfectly as a 'book-end' to a trilogy while still leaving the door open to what the MCU wants to do going forward.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
594,6.0,11-May-23,"Finally after more than 4 years, I'm very delighted to see one @marvel movie beat Avengers Endgame in terms of story, screenplay and direction! That's like the headline of my honest and unbiased review. Well, I'm talking about the final film in the @guardiansofthegalaxy franchise.

Detailed review (Without spoilers only) :

Guys, I will put it this way - You are just worthless to exist in this galaxy without watching GOTG Vol 3. This is definitely NOT an exaggeration!

@jamesgunn sir, what a frickinn' masterpiece that was. You are just a brilliant director.

Starlord (@prattprattpratt), Drax The Destroyer (@davebautista) and Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper) have always been my favourites in this super-crazy team and all these three superheroes played their roles perfectly. The intelligence and bravery of Starlord, the technical genius abilities of Rocket and the physical strength of Drax have always been like the three batteries of the Guardians for ages.

The only female character who did a good job was the blue daughter of Thanos. You know whom I'm talking about. Nebula (@karengillan) finally changed her mentality and started to show more empathy towards other living beings in the galaxy when compared to her egoistic green sister, Gamora (@zoesaldana).

Coming to the supporting cast, Kraglin (@thejudgegunn) finally stepped up and took his fighting abilities to the next level which reminded us of the great Ravager leader, Yondu Udonta (Michael Rooker).

Though Yondu wasn't Starlord's biological father, he sure was Starlord's daddy. You already might know the reason for that and I still miss him a lot after he had sacrificed himself to save Peter's life in GOTG Vol 2. Groot (@vindiesel), who has always been Rocket's sidekick for a very long time, clearly stands out as the second-best supporting character for me in this awesome film.

The High Evolutionary (@chukwudi_iwuji ) was just another classic live-action appearance of one of Marvel comics' iconic villains. Damn, he was scary and sadistic!

Watch out for the insanely powerful Adam Warlock too. (@willpoulter absolutely nailed that role!) So, that's it guys! I'm damn sure that this movie will be one of the top 10 Marvel movies of all time. Marvel never fails to impress me with its amazing characters and fascinating stories.

596,7.0,13-Aug-23,"Guardians of the Galaxy 3 was an absolute trainwreck of a film. From start to finish, it was a chaotic mess that left me questioning what on earth the filmmakers were thinking. The plot was convoluted and lacked any coherent direction, jumping from one random scene to another without any rhyme or reason. It felt like they were trying to cram in as many explosions and flashy visuals as possible to distract from the fact that there was no substance to the story.

And let's talk about Chris Pratt's performance - or lack thereof. It's clear that he phoned it in this time around. His once-charming portrayal of Star-Lord felt tired and uninspired, as if he couldn't be bothered to put any real effort into his role. It's disappointing to see such a decline in his commitment to the character that made him a star.

But the real low point was Will Poulter's character. What were they thinking with that bizarre and off-putting portrayal? His presence was jarring and completely disconnected from the rest of the movie. It's like they plucked him from a different film and dropped him into the Guardians universe without any consideration for how he would fit in.

Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy 3 was a mess that failed to capture the magic of its predecessors. The lack of a coherent plot, Chris Pratt's lackluster performance, and the oddity of Will Poulter's character all contributed to a disappointing and disjointed viewing experience. It's a shame to see a once-promising franchise go down such a disappointing path.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

It wont disappoint you.

Oh my God! Its been years that l enjoyed a movie in theatre last time. May be last movie was spidermen: No way home. After a long time gap an mcu movie feels like an mcu movie. It was funny, emotional, colorful and very connected to each and every character.

Every joke was perfect . James Gunn did a great job. In every other of movies of phase 4 felt like this is a reboot story . Characterwise connection was lost in those movies But vol.3 was great in this department.

Vol.3 especially focused on one of the best character of mcu Rocket Raccoon.

If you are fan of retro music. This mòvie is perfect for you. The way james Gunn used the songs was fabulous.

599,1.0,7-Jun-23,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a fitting finale to a remarkable trilogy, showcasing the undeniable genius of director James Gunn. This film made me realize just how much Gunn will be missed in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as the franchise has lost one of its most talented filmmakers. It's a perfect conclusion that had us laughing, crying, and experiencing a plethora of emotions.

Gunn's direction is nothing short of spectacular, bringing his unique vision to life with flair and creativity. The storytelling is fabulous, particularly in exploring the captivating backstory of the cinema's most famous raccoon. The film strikes a perfect balance between heartfelt moments and thrilling action, keeping audiences on the edge of their seats throughout.

The performances of the ensemble cast are outstanding, with each actor delivering their A-game. The chemistry and camaraderie between the Guardians are palpable, adding depth and authenticity to their relationships. The humor is spot-on, injecting levity into even the most intense moments.

As a fan, it's bittersweet to bid farewell to this beloved trilogy.

600,1.0,14-May-23,"This is a hard movie to judge objectively. I could go on about writing pros and cons, acting choices and visual effects, among other things, but they almost don't matter.

The elevator pitch is that a Guardian is critically injured and the rest of the team need to work together to find a way to save them. And that's basically the plot. But, as I stated previously, it almost doesn't matter. This is largely a movie about beginning and endings. James Gunn had a huge task in pulling together all of the threads he's laid out. Which is always a daunting task with the third movie of a trilogy. Especially one that still has to leave some doors open.

In that sense, I think the movie succeeds far more than it fails. The directing and acting are on point, the visual effects are the strongest of recent Marvel fare and the soundtrack is perfect.

So why 8 stars instead of 10? The film struggles with too many characters and giving them each something worthwhile to do. There are also times during action scenes when the cuts are too fast and hard to follow. Especially on a big screen. And while the High Evolutionary is a serious threat he's also a bit 2 dimensional (which is usually the case in Marvel movies).

So, in conclusion, if you're looking for a fairly emotional Rollercoaster ride, this is highly recommended. Just don't expect it to break the Marvel mold.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

The high evolutionary played a firghtening antagonist whos anger fuelled him to create a perfect society. Seeing Rocket's backstory gave great character insight and helped the audience to understand who Rocket is and what made him that. Adam Warlock wasn't necessarily a true villain, however it helped us understand the high evolutionary and his place in the galaxy. The song choices in this film were absolutely perfect with songs expanding further than the 80s like in previous films. Many questions from End Game were answered such as what happened to Gamora? And where did the guardians end up? This movie allows us to see different sides of every one of the characters we've seen before and though it especially tackles Rocket, we're able to get an insight into who the Guardians are as individuals rather than who they are in the team which is very fitting considering the movies themes. Although many of the scenes about the home go evolutionary had a degree if creepiness to them and often gave an uneasy feeling, they too helped to develop why the High Evolutionary does what he does. In all this was a fantastic movie giving us a different side of Marvel and it's Guardians.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

If I am proven wrong in this regard, I shall reconsider my rating, but as things stand right now I am left feeling sort of underwhelmed after watching the third movie.

By no means is Volume 3 a bad movie in any way, but as the title of my review says, it feels sort of like filler. We learn a great deal about Rocket's backstory and it is all handled very well, though I feel like there isn't any real conclusion to any arc as would be expected from a 3rd movie in a series.

The humor works well, the action scenes are fun. The movie is a good time, though if I omit the parts of the backstory, the rest of the plot happening in the ""present"" is ultimately pretty forgetable.

The Villain doesn't feel threatening, even though he does perform a lot of evil acts in the movie, it is all undercut by his childish outbursts of anger which feel immature and weak. Sort of like when Kylo Ren in SW7 bashes an instrument pannel in anger.

The music that was original and fun in the first movie, and managed to still be OK in the second movie feels like a compulsory gimmick in this one.

At the end of the day, it is a good movie, and certainly the best that has come out of the MCU post Endgame (except for Spiderman, nothing beats that), BUT given the 3 movies, this one is certainly my least favourite.

I fell in love with these characters and their development throughout their run in the Marvel universe, and I continue to watch them in theaters with my wife even without our kids.

I really loved the show of fight these characters have along with their overwhelming acceptance of each other, even through their own personal struggles to accept each other.

The story told here of Rocket's creation is so powerful that it really did bring me to tears a couple of times. Yet the overwhelming story centers around the family that this team has become. Overall, this movie is super comical, sad, and very exciting. Everything you could really ask for in a movie, let alone a superhero movie.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
609,2.0,1-Nov-23,"IN A NUTSHELL: I'm a HUGE fan of the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise, so I've been looking forward to this grand finale. It pains me to even acknowledge that this is the last film in this series. Say it isn't so, James Gunn! He wrote and directed the film. At the beginning of the film, we see the lights turn off in Quill's bedroom, illustrating that James Gunn is putting this trilogy to bed. But surely, Marvel won't really retire this hugely successful part of the MCU, right???

Here's how the studio describes this final installment: In Marvel Studios ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" our beloved band of misfits are looking a bit different these days. Peter Quill, still reeling from the loss of Gamora, must rally his team around him to defend the universe along with protecting one of their own. A mission that, if not completed successfully, could quite possibly lead to the end of the Guardians as we know them.

THINGS I LIKED: The fantastic cast includes our fan favorites: Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Karen Gillan, Pom Kementieff, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, Sean Gunn, Chukwudi Iwuji, Will Poulter, Sylvester Stallone, Elizabeth Debicki, and more!

The beginning of the movie starts on a sad, serious note, something I wasn't expecting.

Lots of creative set pieces.

Gunn does a great job blending tense action scenes with humor and heart.

We get to find out Rocket Raccoon's origin story. Awwww... It is said that many of the songs in the film are diegetic, which means the characters can hear the music.

The song that opens and closes the trilogy is ""Come and Get Your Love"" by Redbone. Sweet.

Keep watching during the rolling credits at the end of the movie for another cute scene that references Kevin Bacon.

As always, the soundtrack is terrific. The rest of the music by John Murphy was excellent.

The story is extremely emotional. You WILL cry.

We get a few short cameo performances from a few past characters. Yay! No spoilers!

I always love the slow-motion action sequences. So entertaining.

THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE: The movie definitely assumes that you already know and love the characters, and understand how the Guardians' universe works. If you haven't seen any of the Guardians movies, you should absolutely not start with this one. Start from the beginning.

Too many of the costumes and sets look like costumes and sets: more design than magic. In fact, this movie sets a new record for the most prosthetics (23,000) used on over 1000 actors.

I wish the voice of Cosmo, the Spacedog, were different. It sounds too much like Mantis' character. The female voice by Maria Bakalova was used to pay tribute to Laika, the Russian dog who was one of the first animals in space.

There are way too many characters to keep track of in this final installment.

So much yelling.

The movie is messy with tonal changes.

There are a lot of flashbacks that might confuse the timeline for some viewers.

Ultimately, I wanted more. Because I'm such a fan of the franchise, I really wanted to be blown away but wasn't. Were you? I need to see it again.

TIPS FOR PARENTS: Some profanity and crude conversations, including an F-bomb Violence People and creatures die Lots of destruction.

610,9.0,8-May-23,"James Gunn saves Marvel phase 5! This emotional, hilarious and stunning movie is everything you want and expect from a Marvel movie. Action packed from start to finish, with one of the best single shot action scenes I have ever seen in a Marvel movie. At times it feels like it can overstay it's welcome but the next scene is always worth the wait. Some of the transitions didn't quite work or felt rushed, however there are a lot of stories going on in this movie so I would say overall a good job well done. This is probably some of the best Marvel visuals and effects to date. With another brilliant Guardians soundtrack, unbelievably good! The humour as we would expect from a Guardians movie had the cinema laughing throughout. I want to emphasise the strong emotional story behind this movie, i have never felt such strong emotions toward a Marvel project like this since Spider-Man: No Way Home. I didn't enjoy much of Phase 4 Marvel and the start of Phase 5 felt like it would be a continuation. However Guardians feels like a fresh start, which makes me really excited to see what Marvel's future projects hold for us. A return to the beloved Marvel movies from Phase 1-3.

So the whole movie i was expecting someone to come out of the shadows and say Im the real villain. I cant believe that did not happen. This purple guy is the actual villain in this movie?

Rocket is smart? What? Umm...since when? Always you say.. So him and Peter bickering like children he was a super genius then too?

I did not know he was smart in the comics. I did not know he was an actual racoon from earth. I did not know he had a bionic brain and a metal skeleton. I thought he was a talking Racoon-like alien. And I did not know he was smarter than Tony Stark...the smartest thing in the universe apparently since in 6 seconds he was able to solve something the purple guy seemed to struggle with forever.

Purple guy screams and bickers just like Rocket did so maybe annoying bickering has always been a sign of super intelligence in the marvel universe.

The rest of the storyline is like, general decent Marvel fun and adventure and heart. But I absolutely lost it during the Rocket flashbacks. At first I was unsure about them going down this path, but they did him justice. Sooo enjoy and be ready for some emotions. Unless you don't have a heart.

613,9.0,19-Aug-23,"The final part of this trilogy finally is a well written and relaxed movie, nothing of the subtle comedy feels forced like it was in the second GOTG.

Though there were some slight issues with the script. The entire time it's just hopping from scene to scene saying 'Lets save our friend Rocket'. And not that its irritating or like it doesn't fit in the script, it is noticable. Besides this, the scenes itself are very vibrant like every other movie of this franchise but i feel like they've overdone it a little bit. But that's just my opinion.

Also a relief, the MCU ditched the poor looking CGI (wich we've seen in Doctor Strange and She Hulk) and came up with a orgy for the eyes. This ensures a good watchability and pleasant sit for 2.5 hours.

All in all a nice, fun movie to watch with a rollercoaster of emotions.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

This one is, again, fantastic, and an amazing culmination to the trilogy (i'd say the 2nd GotG movie is inferior), and was another great surprise, considering the overall quality of recent MCU projects.

Loved it.

It's funny, visually beautiful, great action scenes, a lot of heart (some - actually A LOT - of the scenes hit me like i wasn't expecting them to), amazing soundtrack. It's a perfect send off to the characters and most of the storylines, and i'll surely miss a lot of it going forward, even with some new characters thrown in.

617,9.0,9-May-23,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3 is a new addition to the top tier MCU collection and cements the Guardians films as the best trilogy in the MCU!

First off I want to start with Rockets origin story which is so dark, heartbreaking and powerful. There's a moment where something awful happens and Rockets reaction just breaks me man. I'm 23 and since I was 5 I've had cats so seeing what he and his go through really got me.

That leads me onto the High Evolutionally, who is played brilliantly by Chukwudi Iwuji. He's a despicable person and I absolutely hated him. For me he's up there with some of best MCU villains.

As for the rest of the cast, they all shined of course and I felt the majority of them gave their best performances yet as these characters. I do wanna shout out Bradley Cooper tho, he was the MVP for me - smashed it!

The Awesome Mix Vol.3 is just as banging as the first 2 alongside John Murphys score. The Guardians humour we've all come to expect is spot on, I laughed a lot. The VFX are spotless and the standard that all future MCU flicks need to be at. I also really appreciated the film having such character-driven steaks instead of world/universe or multiverse ending steaks.

All the Guardians were able to shine & have their moment as well as their arcs coming full circle and feeling complete. I'm really going to miss this group of A-Holes but I'm so happy they got an excellent send off with Vol.3.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

The dialogue, the scenarios, even the characters only serve this purpose, they do not stand alone as much as they have their own ""lives"" in that universe... And Marvel certainly didn't want to just push this message, but it bought the idea and created a masterpiece out of a blockbuster: not in terms of cinematography or acting, but in terms of narrative and film experience.

623,1.0,8-May-23,"What's difficult about ending a trilogy is how to depict a new journey without derailing from the given context, while having it distinct and memorable from the previous - The Russo brothers had done so in Civil War, Nolan too in Batman Rises, and James Gunn in Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3.

Traversing their groundbreaking assemble in the first movie and the intergalactic flamboyance in the second, the Guardians finally arrived at their last ride together. Perhaps because it is his ultimate play in the MCU, James approached the film with a waywardly creative and almost selfishly stylish artistry, whether the greasy meatball planet, the earthly furry neighborhood, or the f-bomb-dropping dialogues. Despite its cartoonish settings, GoG3 is still unquestionably the best Marvel movie since Stage 4 due to its fascinating action sequences and poignant stories. With three major battles larger and larger of scale and intensity, the most mesmerizing combat has to be the hallway infiltration. Flawless choreography and one-take technique for starter, the scene fully showcases not only each Guardians' distinct abilities, but their fluent combos which takes me back to the airport showdown in Civil War. Moreover, the drone-like cinematography captures all aspects of the fight to their totality in swift and ingenious movements, even travelling through a penetrated wound. Jointing these battles are often joking interactions native to the GoG franchise, including out-of-context punchlines and dark humor. In juxtaposition to the laughter is Rocket's recollection, which thoroughly elicits the traumatic backstory of our adored mascot, making him one of my favorite Marvel characters once again. My only complaint for Gunn's peculiarly impeccable directing is the music: indeed, the success of Come And Get Your Love and Mr. Blue Sky is in the gene of GoG, but it doesn't mean that an entire film should be loaded with vintage tunes, and I would still like to have the Guardians' theme as the most prominent part of the music.

(Spoilers Ahead!)

For its curtain-falling purpose, the movie provides each Guardians with their spotlight moments: Warlock's childly curiosity contrasting his overwhelming prowess, Nebula's self-sacrificial resolve when protecting her family, Mantis' empathetic insight into those around her, Drax's heartwarming fatherhood towards the trapped children, Gamora's arc from inattentive to firmly abiding justice, and Peter's development from infatuated with one's past to pursuing himself... And yet, none of these could amount to James' obvious favorite, Rocket Raccoon. With his private storyline, Rocket's vanity, insecurity, and self-doubt are all reasoned as his tragedy gradually unravels: he habitually thieves and mechanizes because these two skills emancipated him from the most repulsive of hellholes, the place where his hopes were demolished twice (to live in High Evolutionary's utopian society and then to escape with his friends) and heart was impaled thrice (death of Lylla, Teefs, Floor). Bearing physical experiment harsher than Thanos' punishment to his daughter, Rocket could not bear to relive the pain of bereavement, which is why he treats those around him with vitriol and cynicism, pretending to sever oneself from genuine bonds. Another character worthy of discussion is the villain, High Evolutionary, a rare Marvel antagonist since Stage 4 that you can irredeemably hate. With little to none background given, the maniacal scientist was obsessed with inhumane bio-engineering to satiate his sense of godly accomplishment, which, when provoked by his own creation's excellence, sought to demonstrate dominion with the most personal assault. However, he was once again defeated by the animal, disfigured in specific, a near-rated-R, literal face-off. Instead of feeling traumatized, High Evolutionary went the other extreme, becoming even more deranged and motivated, just to ""perfect"" his life's failure. Again, an uncommon antagonist who's meant to be the center of abhorrence, and definitely a better villain to whatever variant of Kang it was in Quantumania.

No other Marvel trilogy is as unique, complete, and unforgettable as the Guardians of the Galaxy, and I do not take objections for my statement. Honestly, I'm surprised by James Gunn's creative indefatigability especially in a downhill era for superhero movies, and I'm rather hopeful for his agenda concerning the DCU. For GoG3 in particular, it has been a long time since I felt the lingering taste of a movie upon exiting the theater: the throbbing of heart when rewinding a fight scene, the nasal acidity when sympathizing with a character, and the long exhale of relief after the credits roll when all the original Guardians rest aside each other. Thank you for the ride.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
624,6.0,29-May-23,"Guardians of the Galaxy approaches Vol. 3 with a similar structure to the first two instalments; epic actions supplemented with daft humour and lovable characters, following an emotional plot exploring the backstory for a lead.

Delving into the origin story of Rocket, flashbacks are used to guide the storyline and add gravitas at the right moments. Emotionally manipulating and with a presumably intentional moral relating to animal testing, the context is sad without pushing it to the brink of devastating. The hope generated is not at a level which feels like a gut punch when the inevitable/predictable outcome is reached. Still, it forces there to be no ambiguity over the villain.

With such a large cast of characters, some naturally fall into the background, whereas the likes of Quill remain front and foremost. The reintroduction of Warlock does therefore feel a little like a side addition, and although a great and undoubtedly popular character, his future in the MCU didn't appear to be solidified.

The laughs from the previous films are still there, the likes of Drax and Mantis maintaining their quirks and breaking the tension when called upon. There are a few fairly gruesome moments which are interesting to see in a MCU/Disney film, but this gives greater impact, and the use of profanity is perfectly placed for comic effect. The soundtrack, always famous within GOTG, is great again and perfectly suits each scene.

The ability for a character to defy death is stretched to it's limits, as even in a universe of superheroes, there does seem to be a case for everyone to hang onto life until they are rescued at the final millisecond.

All in all, Vol. 3 rounds off one of the MCU's best trilogies, sticking to what made it popular in the first place: outlandish characters, daft laughs, all-out action, and a great playlist.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

636,6.0,8-May-23,"Most of the MARVEL movies post Avengers: Endgame have always lacked a bit of familiarity. A lot of factors like the introduction of new characters, concepts and new world building have contributed to the same. In the midst of all these chaos, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3 brings a back that feeling of MARVEL which we were always hooked on to (see what I did there ;-))

This movie was surrounded by controversies before its release due to the firing and rehiring of the franchise's mastermind director James Gunn. While James Gunn was working on it he was also parallely working on DC projects and he also took up a major role in DC recently. This has had me worried along with some of the MARVEL fans about his commitment towards the project. The way the Guardians get paired with Thor at the end of Avengers: Endgame I expected them to be a major part of the movie Thor Love and Thunder, but that wasn't the case. Even the Guardians' portrayal in that film kind of had us worrying on whether the MARVEL had lost that portrayal. But as soon as I saw the first trailer of GoTG Vol 3, I breathed a sigh of relief. The movie does exactly what it's promised in its trailer, that is, delivering on the emotional quotient along with a high octane fun ride.

As seen in the trailer this story majorly involves around Rocket while also diving deep into the inner purpose of the individual characters. Even though the movie is almost 2h and 30 min long it doesn't seem too chaotic or also diverting anywhere from the main plot. There are some emotional flashback episodes which are very endearing to watch but I felt that they could have been placed more effectively. The action and action set pieces are on point and not a pain to watch unlike some of the recent MARVEL ventures. The movie excels in its production design department as always with a great play around colours. The music and background score for GoTG franchise has always been on point and this movie is no different.

In case you haven't observed, one of James Gunn's strengths is his characters in movies. He has a very strong backstory to his main characters and for some of his side characters he provides cool, wacky and memorable moments. One can see the shades of Peacemaker and his Suicide Squad reboot in some of the characters' design in this movie. As highlighted before, this story majorly revolves around Rocket and we get to experience some great emotions through Rocket's POV in this film. Kudos to Bradley Cooper yet again for delivering a special performance. This makes you almost forget that the Rocket is voiced by a human, such is the integration. Chris Pratt's role as Starlord kind of starts shakily in this movie but picks up later to and gets a satisfying arc. Drax, Nebula and Mantis' roles are also quote high on emotions. While Groot has some cool moments in the movie, we don't really get to see the innocent fun which we had seen in the first 2 parts. Special mention to Sean Gunn's Kraglin role and performance, especially in the climax (I am not gonna reveal anything but I almost teared up in one of those scenes). I believe there has been a bit of talk about Adam Warlock's portrayal about how that character hasn't been utilized as per the comics. While I feel that role could have been written better, I also understand the restrictions in expanding that role because of movie's length. Zoe Saldana as the 'new Nebula' brings a different perspective and chemistry with the Guardians in this movie. Chukwudi Iwuji's antagonist character as The High Evolutionary is intense and fearsome but somehow misses the charm of a good MARVEL villain.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3 is definitely one of MARVEL's very few best post the Avengers: Endgame. I personally liked it better than the Spiderman: No Way Home. It is a great nostalgic treat to the MARVEL fans.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
637,1.0,2-Aug-23,"I hate to be the guy that says this since I usually I am not but this movie, is okay, however is not even close to the good old Guardians of the Galaxy...

Truly I didn't get the same feeling watching this last installment of the trilogy as I did watching both the Guardians of the Galaxy previous films as well as other Avenger movies where they have been. The most obvious change is the tone, while it always had a bit of darkness, Guardians of the Galaxy was an overall light and touching type of movie with a set of characters that had the right balance of humor and dramatic moments.

This time around James Gunn went for a sadder dark movie, specially with the experiments on animals and the weird creatures, I didn't like the change at all, it lost part of its magic. I really loved what James did with the 2 previous movies specially the first is probably one of the best in the MCU, but since he also turned to DC, feels like its approach changed, contrary to most people I really, really didn't like his Suicide Squad, it was a terrible film, and the reason why I am bringing this up is because on this last Guardians of the Galaxy I see some of the dark elements and some of the creatures almost inspired by his DC work and I personally feel its bad.

The villain and the themes felt unnecessarily cruel, its unclear why such approach was taken, if it was a new MCU story I would be fine but I didn't get the approach.

It felt nostalgic however, of course, I liked how the film ended it is a fair and nice send off to the characters (although you never know which ones will be ruined by a MCU comeback), so in that regard it was enjoyable, but as a movie I think it was underwhelming, it was an okay story, an interesting and smart approach to dig into one of the characters past but I don't see this as the ultimate GOTG movie that people are claiming to be.

It was a nice run, some of the best MCU work was with these characters and the first movie will always give me happy memories, so I am glad for that.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

This bummer component takes the fun down a notch, but there's still a lot of humor and action, and the series is still able to keep the characters believable among the nonsense, which makes up for storytelling that sometimes ignores the fine points of telling us what's going on.

This is very much an end-of-an-era film, and GOG3 does a good job at wrapping things up in a satisfying fashion. I have seen many movies spend a tedious 20 minutes of gauzy nostalgia for characters I don't care about, but this movie keeps it short and fun, giving each character a good send off without getting maudlin.

I feel like the characters/actors were forcing their lines and the camera work was not as precise as in the other films. I think Covid has maybe caused a bit of this downfall.

The storyline was ok, if not a little underwhelming.

The main bad guy was ok but could have been a little more menacing.

All in all, it's a good(ish) film but not what the trilogy deserves.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
647,1.0,12-May-23,"A journey of laughter, tears, and inspiration. In my personal opinion, it is the best movie since Endgame. The actors and actresses did a great job to tell a touching story about friendship, standing up for what you believe in, and much more beyond.

It inspires you to think about life, death, who you are, and what really matters. It brings comfort and strength. During the difficult times that we are living in, we need faith to not get lost and a state of mind believing that there is a way out of the unfortunate situations.

If you feel you are trapped or almost lose hope of seeing goodness in daily life, this movie helps you find light.

Thanks for being there, Marvel.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

Peter Quill/Starlord (Chris Pratt) roams the universe with his galaxy defending companions, still reeling from the death of his beloved Gamora at the hands of her father. However, he and the gang are thrust back in to action when Rocket (Bradley Cooper), the feisty raccoon, is mortally wounded, and they desperately need to find a cure. They are put on a collision course with The High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji), an intergalactic being who wants to wipe out humanity and start a new world. Along the way, shocking revelations thrust him into a battle with destiny.

Well, my golly gosh, out of nowhere, a third (and apparently final) GOTG movie has crept up on us. I had no awareness of it's pre-production or any sort of publicity surrounding its release, other than a poster outside a cinema. With a six year gap between the release of the last one, and nearly ten years since the release of the original, the series seemingly got sucked up in the MCU orbit, with the Avengers series of films, and the relevance of a third film seems somewhat deflated. And the film itself feels like a reduced copy of what's gone before.

The formula from the first two films is there, and writer/director James Gunn's style and approach is evident at various points throughout, with some funny moments and quite a funky soundtrack. Yet somehow, it also all feels like a more heavy and solemn affair, without the carefree spark and joy of the first two. The story feels a little piecemeal, and at an indulgent two and a half hours, it can feel like a bit of a strain. The usual gang, including Pratt, Cooper and Dave Bautista as Drax, have developed their own chemistry over time which rolls on here, however, Iwuji is overly hammy and theatrical as the villain (in spite of Starlord's humorous observation of his resemblance to Robocop), whilst Will Pointer's role seems kind of pointless.

This is what average Guardians looks like, I guess. Three's always a charm, and maybe there was an inevitability about its arrival, and while it has some charm and fun, it's inferiority to the first two is pretty clear to see. ***","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

Speaking particularly about the third trilogy, it is very well written with perfect mosaic of all emotions, action, adventure, and drama. VFX seems good and on point.

It detracts from the main points the screenplay and script are trying to achieve. The action CGI is very much blatant. It is also highly overused and at times seems to be forced. There seem to be far too many ""oh, look we can now do this with CGI"" moments which stand in the way of the really moving or funny parts as simple filler.

I'd far prefer a really coherent story which doesn't need the ""wow"" moments. The story in itself stands alone very well and its good. The whole CGI thing really did detract me from loving this film.

During and after the release of Avengers: Infinity War James Gunn was fired as writer/director for this movie until Disney rehired him before the release of Avengers: Endgame! Let's start with the positives; the standouts of this film were Star-Lord, Mantis and Rocket! It's very funny and I thought Nebula was better than Gamora which is what I didn't like in this movie along with the song choices they weren't as good as Vol 1 & 2! Let's talk about the LEGO sets; I was surprised at how accurate they were to the film There are; Guardians of the Galaxy HQ (which is what I'll get at some point), the new Guardians' Ship that's called The Bowie (named after David Bowie since the Milano was named after Alyssa Milano & the Benatar was named after Pat Benatar) and Rocket's Ship! Overall this was James Gunn's swan song for Marvel since he's now started his DCU by Directing Superman Legacy & the 2 post-credit scenes do set up the future of the MCU and quite possibly Kang Dynasty & Secret Wars!

659,5.0,4-Jun-23,"""Guardians of the Galaxy 3: A Galactic Misfire & Disaster. Don't waste your money (June 4, 2023 -- A critical review by actual verified independent viewer, Phoenix Thottam)

In a galaxy far, far away, there was a franchise that captured the hearts of audiences with its irreverent humor and eclectic cast of misfits. However, the third installment of the Guardians of the Galaxy series, sadly, fails to live up to its predecessors. Director James Gunn's attempt to recapture the magic falls short, resulting in a lackluster and disappointing cinematic experience. Such an incredible formulaic disappointment. Did an AI write this script? Ridiculous plot and just a string of special effects. Don't believe the hype. Very disappointed in GofG #3. Don't waste your money.

*Plot and Pacing*: Guardians of the Galaxy 3 suffers from a convoluted and disjointed narrative. The plot meanders aimlessly, attempting to juggle numerous subplots and character arcs, but ultimately fails to deliver a cohesive story. The pacing is haphazard, with sudden shifts from intense action to sluggish exposition, leaving viewers confused and unengaged. It's as if the film lost its way amidst a cosmic abyss, desperately grasping for coherence but failing at every turn.

*Character Development*: One of the strengths of the previous films was the depth and growth of the Guardians themselves. However, in this installment, the characters feel like mere caricatures of their former selves. They lack the emotional depth and chemistry that made them so endearing in the first place. Their interactions are forced, and the humor often falls flat, betraying the genuine charm that once made this franchise stand out. It's disheartening to witness the Guardians reduced to one-dimensional shells of their former glory.

*Villain and Conflict*: The antagonist in Guardians of the Galaxy 3 is an unimaginative and forgettable presence. The conflict lacks the stakes and tension that characterized the previous films. The once-dreaded Guardians find themselves facing a tepid and uninspiring foe who fails to evoke any sense of danger or urgency. This lack of a compelling villain leaves the film devoid of the necessary dramatic tension, resulting in a lackluster climax that leaves viewers underwhelmed.

*Visual Effects and Cinematography*: While the Guardians of the Galaxy series has always been visually stunning, this third installment disappoints on that front as well. The CGI is inconsistent, ranging from breathtakingly beautiful to distractingly artificial. The action sequences lack the visual finesse and creative choreography that made the previous films so memorable. The cinematography feels lackluster, failing to capture the grandeur and cosmic wonder that this franchise once exuded.

*Conclusion*: Wasted money and time seeing this. Guardians of the Galaxy 3 is a total and complete disappointment on multiple fronts. It squanders the potential of its beloved characters, fails to deliver a cohesive and engaging narrative, and lacks the visual prowess that defined its predecessors. The charm and wit that once made this franchise shine have been replaced by a sense of fatigue and creative bankruptcy. This third installment feels like a mere cash grab, tarnishing the legacy of the Guardians of the Galaxy. It's a cosmic misfire that leaves fans yearning for the glory days of this once-promising franchise.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

It was a great experience watching it - made me honestly cry at a particular scene and laugh at so many more A great end to a great trilogy All I can say is this is how it is done - a clear winner in my eyes. It brings a very smooth end to an epic journey ( talking about Marvel in general ). You don't just replace the actors that made the roles famous ( looking at you DC ) - instead you introduce a very organic end.

Bravo, Marvel, Bravo!

Too bad it will take this long until the next Marvel movie. I already can not wait to see what is to follow.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
664,6.0,8-Jul-23,"This film stands out as one of the better entries in the recent years of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but it unfortunately falls into familiar territory.

I thoroughly enjoyed this film, thanks to its well-crafted plotline and satisfying conclusion. However, it doesn't offer anything particularly new. This is a recurring theme in Marvel movies and shows; the stakes just don't resonate as strongly anymore. Sure, there's a villain to defeat, but there's a lack of deeper elements that prevent me from fully connecting with Marvel's content.

My biggest gripe lies with Chris Pratt's performance, as I found his portrayal somewhat annoying throughout the film. On the other hand, the remaining cast delivered exceptional performances. Rocket's character arc was beautifully written, and the use of flashbacks kept me engaged and even moved me to tears in a few scenes. Drax, Gamora, and Nebula also shine in this film.

From a visual standpoint, the film is undeniably impressive, with James Gunn showcasing his talent. The action scenes are particularly remarkable and surpass anything Marvel has released in recent years.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
665,1.0,15-May-23,"This trilogy is one of the most surprising one in cinema history imo. A space fantasy combined with heist action flick under the banner of Marvel with the possibility to be eclipsed by the likes of Iron Man, Capt. America, and Thor. But it ultimately shaped MCU to be how it is. Fun, campy, and with heartfelt story.

I'm not really fond of MCU in general. It feels too formulaic, but somehow, Gotg gave a breath of a new air, although it still have that formula.

And the third installment is by far the best out of three. It makes time with the backstory and does not give in to the temptation to exposition. Somehow you get to relate to a damn racoon, a walrus, a rabbit, and an otter.

The action is spectacular as well. The coreo is, again, the best out of the three films. And acted all so well by Pratt, Cooper, Zoe, Karen, Bautista, and so on.

On the other hand however, the pacing felt a little missplaced sometimes, and the writing can get a bit lazy. Some small plottwist scattered throughout the movies felt bland and forced, hence the lazy writing.

The CGI was pretty bad as well. Perhaps the shortage of time and staff to work on certain parts of the movies may caused that problem. Some scene however makes you feel like you watch a nolan film about the same sub genre.

Overall, this movie exceeded the expectation created by the marketing through those badass trailers and teasers. Definetely worth a second watch at the theatre.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
666,7.0,26-Jan-24,"Not as bad as Thor - Love and Thunder. Parts were great, parts were annoying to the point where I had to hit pause to do something else.

The problem I've had with Guardians all along was how practically all the characters were changed from the source material. Marvel likes to inject too much comedy and buffoonery. And then children.

I admit I was watching it thinking what this will mean for Superman Legacy. I'm not a big James Gunn fan just yet. His Suicide Squad was technically better than David Ayers, but Ayers did a better job with the characters.

Guardians is the same way - they all act like a sitcom. But more like The Conners than Young Sheldon.

I love super-hero movies, but this is another one that I've watched that I most likely will avoid watching again.

I'm also not crazy about the lack of time making the movie stand by itself. The cross-referencing drove the people I watched the movie with crazy and they drove me crazy asking questions during the movie.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

The story, performances of the cast, especially the one of Cooper, emotional weight, actions sequences, comedic scenes, direction, screenplay, soundtrack, cinematography, production value, visual and sound effects, and ending, are all perfect and have nothing to be said against them.

The movie was so good to the extent that I felt that the 150 minutes runtime was like 15 minutes, or maybe less even.

Regarding the flaws, the only flaw that I found in the movie was its little, if not no, connection to the current MCU story (Kang and the multiverse). Other than that, everything else was excellent. That is why when it comes to the score, I gladly give Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 9 out of 10.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
668,7.0,17-Jul-23,"Compared to the previous ones. This is an idiotic jumbled mess that cannot decide what it wants to be. Emo-drama, action-comedy, torture-horror? It ends up being a big nothing. The plot is moronic and inconsistent. No original ideas combined with recycled characters. The movie feels like a standalone productions and not really a part of the MCU.

Adam Warlock and the High Evolutionary are idiots or bad jokes. The later is not threatening at all just like Kang. At least Thanos was a legit psycho. The relationship of Gamora and Quill was handled pretty badly. The runtime is too long filled with unnecessary CGI. Nebula looks very weird and the design of Groot is also questionable.

it's almost as if 2 (or more...) writers were responsible for this 1 intelligent good capable writer and another just for the filler

Although the movie can be messy and tone deaf, it does not have a cringey agenda and is centered around a sub plot that has a lot of heart.

That said, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 was one of the better chapters since Endgame. At least this one still has a stellar cast, wonderful characters, an always improving soundtrack and sooo hilarious at times. Plus, it did get progressively better. Thank goodness - that first half was just okay.

I am Groot. Yeah, I know. It's all about Fam. This outing has to do with saving your loved ones and being a good dog.

I did think the end was abrupt and hardly meshed the overall story. Felt really tacked on and didn't really leave me on any kind of high note.

And it's not a movie I'll be racing to see again - it was OVERLY long and so much could've been cut, but I'm glad I saw it this one time.

Each Guardian movie has outgrown the last one in different ways, giving us the reason to visit cinemas each time. James Gunn's directing is top-notch, and the transitions between scenes are smooth. The fact that each character is important to the story makes them so likeable - however Rocket will be in limelight for this one!

Highlights of the movie for me: 1. I love how consistently they pick up good soundtracks! - Kudos to Tyler Bate 2. Rocket's story will melt your heart. It was a roller coaster ride of emotions for me!

3. Best MCU sitcom.

688,1.0,23-May-23,"Marvel, take notes. It´s been a bit of a dry spell for Marvel lately. The bad to mid movie has been released after another but I think we all put our faith in James Gunn to deliver and that he did. I hear a lot of people calling this movie their favorite and I totally get it, it´s not mine personally, but this movie delivers exactly what you expect and much more. Maybe the high ratings are here to let Marvel know what we want, or maybe Gunn really touched some hearts, nevertheless, this movie is good.

On Knowhere the guardians are still rebuilding and recovering. After Adam Warlock attacks Knowhere, Rocket is put into a dying state, relieving his past. The guardians have a new mission, find the passcode to save Rocket.

This movie oozes creativity from start to finish. Gunn clearly got free range over the project and made exactly what he wanted. This leads to an organic planet, a lot of animal hybrids and so many cool and odd designs for worlds and characters. From people in flesh suits to animal robot hybrids, this movie is strange but oh so creative in the best way possible. The effects have even taken a step up from recent Marvel movies and actually look good and creative. The mix of effects and prosthetics really makes the movie blend much better and makes everything that little more believable.

This movie wants to do a lot of things, maybe a bit too many things. It wants every character to have their time to shine and by now that's a lot. The balance between the different characters focus is done well but there are so many plot threads that seem half done like Quill´s recovery and acceptance. Although this is the case it´s still amazing to see these characters again and they are at their best here. Every actor really gives it their all and the performances are amazing. Chris Pratt as Star Lord and Karen Gillan as Nebula really gets to show their emotions in this movie, same with Pom Klementieff who also get´s to flex her comedic side. Dave Bautista as Drax really has incredible comedic timing and is so well done here. The villain is also delightfully over the top. Chukwudi Iwuji really get´s to play this campy villain that works great for the movie. While there still is some floatyness to Rockets voice as it can seem like he is a voice recording, which he is, Bradley Cooper gives an emotionally strong performance as Rocket here. His crying, together with Pratts are probably the best moments of this movie. I also really liked the side characters and Cosmo is no doubt a highlight for me.

Together with the incredibly sad tail of Rockets past is what binds this movie together, the acting and the characters. We get to see what happened to Rocket and his cute and adorable friends, Lylla, Teefs and Floor. These scenes are so well done and horrible to watch on so many levels.

There was some bad editing at times though. Especially in the beginning fight. I don't know if it was just the cinema, I sat in but the audio was also way to screechy and loud. I think this was a cinema problem though.

The action is fun and creative here. It´s used sparingly and when it´s used it´s well thought out. The ""No sleep till Brooklyn"" scene is so well done and definitely a highlight of the movie. Same with Peter and Groots fight scene.

The humor is good if not a bit inserted at times. In general, it works great but there are a few moments where the humor seemed tagged on.

The soundtrack is as always incredible and well used, but I think this is the Guardians movie that uses it´s music least affective. It feels like songs are just thrown in there for good measure without much thought at times. There are incredible and memorable uses though, such as the before mentioned ""No Sleep till Brooklyn"" scene, the ""Creep"" acoustic version in the opening, ""Dog days are over"" used towards the end and the return of ""come and get your love"".

The theme is very good here. I think that what's makes me not just think this movie is mediocre. The theme of ""it´s our flaws that makes us"" is a touching one especially for this group. Guardians has always been the more chaotic group in Marvel and this movie highlights their flaws and how to use them to be the better versions of themselves. The villain tries to create these perfect beings that don't make mistakes and do anything wrong, but he himself doesn't like to be outsmarted or look imperfect. He is a walking contradiction and the same could be said about our main characters that won´t realize they barely fit together and have so much trauma laying underneath. But it´s these imperfections that makes them, them, and without our negative sides and experiences, we will never be real. The villain is searching for a robotic and sterile race, but that will never exist.

After all of this is said, this movie swings for the fences and misses here and there but overall delivers a fun and entertaining experience. It´s highs are incredible and overall, it´s a fun action/comedy. I think the movie plays itself a bit too safe, but safe can also be good. The strong themes and strong scenes are worth watching.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
689,1.0,10-Jul-23,"While watching the film I kept wondering, are you serious? Were they serious?

It's a truism that the average IQ of the American population is plummeting, I think their IQ scores have dropped 15 points on average, with the exception of at most immigrant Koreans and possibly some Chinese ethnicities. This trend is exemplified by their current president, Joe Biden (the previous president was not a 100, but this one? Huh...! ).

So, with this in mind, I was philosophizing during the movie that okay, stupid people in America, we should produce more and more movies to suit their intellectual level. But this film doesn't stop there. This movie was specifically - on purpose - made to cause serious, mass neuronal death in even the more intelligent viewers!!! Not even a massive burnt concentrated alcohol treatment for 3 years can destroy the brain at this level! Because the liver gives in sooner...! But this film 2 and a half hours ago brings this result...! In other words, this film tries to drag down to the bottom of the frog - as far as the intellectual level is concerned - those who are far above it!

I don't know what's going on in Hollywood, what devastating new drug has appeared among the creators, but let's put Guardians of the Galaxy 1 and this 3rd part side by side. The difference is horrible!

Characters are all great per usual, and their is so much depth to them as well which is insane to say considering we've seen these characters in several movies already.

696,9.0,4-May-23,"The first Guardians of the Galaxy movie was a surprise for the audience who were bored with the Marvel formula. It was fresh, it was fun, it was silly (in a good way). It was shocking.

The chemistry among the characters was amazing, and we should be honest, that chemistry among did much of the heavy lifting in the second film, from which I do not remember much.

With phase four, I was shocked how bad the writing was in each and every project - except for Spider-Man No Way Home. The rest was trash. That mentality left me concerned for the Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3. I was afraid to see our beloved characters disrespected. Happily, I was wrong.

There are plot holes, yes, but everything considered, it is fun to watch. Each and every character is given enough screen time for character development, which was non-existent in MCU phase 4. The flashbacks - a stale way to tell a story though it may be- work in the movie: we see the story of Rocket, and his origins. Is it a bit clisché? Yes, but it works.

Nebula, I think, is amazing, too. They finally do justice with her in this film.

You may not like the ending, they play a bit safe, but at least we leave the cinema with some optimism for each character in their own individual journeys.

And yes, I think I am going to watch it again.

698,4.0,19-May-23,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is fitting and strong finale for a trilogy that managed to steal my heart. Putting on GoTG on a whim one day spiraled me into the next, and accompanying essential viewing namely Avengers Infinity war and Endgame. But none of them viewed on the big screen, until today, to top off the journey. This is adventure filled, funny and at times emotional and dark movie. There's something for everyone here. And I dare say it's even watchable for someone who hasn't seen a single marvel movie, because there are some short tit bits of info drops to either remind if you forgot, or to get you up to speed.

Directing was fantastic. If I can describe it with one word it's: Dynamic. Maybe at times to a fault, with being to chaotic. I suffered only in one action scene from that but others complained a bit more. Personal taste. But there's so much creativity, not afraid to play with angles. One of the final fights (one take scene) is a joy to watch both in choreography and directing. I do have some gripes, I felt that the music and action scenes felt stronger in previous movies, not by much but it carried the music for longer and made the scene so much more fun. Here they tend to cut the music quickly. And moments just end a little too fast and don't get time to breathe.

Story and characters, this isn't a useless trilogy, there's again real expansion on backstory and character progression. I love that the characters get a purpose, or find it. And we leave satisfied. The new side-villain teased in Vol.2 is alright, some good moments. But ultimately didn't live up that much to expectations. The main villain though, firstly, really well acted and a good villain overall. Also driven by his own madness, not just ''I want to take over the world'. No huge plot, but a plot that involved a important character. All characters are fantastic I just have no complaints really. Star Lord puts in the work, Drax is fun, Rocket is amazing. Groot is groot. The finale reminded me of Return of the Jedi, just how celebratory it was. It's a great way to really end a movie experience.

Logic and stuff, well it's a fantasy movie so 99% of the unrealistic things I let slide. But if you are picky about that stuff you will notice. Personally I wasn't bothered.

Music was great once again, another strong role in making this movie work and the trilogy. All good picks. Though as I said I felt like it was cut short sometimes. Whereas in previous movies it would really carry a scene for much longer.

World design, production design. They went all out, from comedic designs to stunning interiors and areas. One of the reasons I love the GoTG trilogy so much is it's world. It feels classic, that kinda weird in-between of man with blue skin, woman with green skin. And full-on cgi monsters and weirdness. It also has that element of Star Wars and Star Trek in it. It just feels so good to watch a sci-fi world that is so creatively designed on a big screen.

Whats next, who knows, the credits do tell us but I think it will be a while, or a different movie entirely. All I know is this trilogy was great. I enjoyed it a ton. The grade is mainly for nailing a trilogy. I'd say all 3 are very close together, with Vol.2 being a personal favorite for now.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

Movie becomes a bit draggy in runtime. The best parts are often undercut with needless comedy in typical Marvel fashion. The cgi-environments designs are quite interesting and perhaps the best part of the movie to watch on the big screen. There is a glorious fight scene which some people might love.

I had given up on Marvel completely. Even in the future I have no hope that anything they churn out will be worth our time as an audience. With 20+ movies and 10+ shows to keep up with, its not worth the effort. But just this once, with GOTG 3, James Gunn has done the improbable and made an excellent ending to the Guardians Trilogy. Satisfactory in every manner possible, from action to emotions, from comedy to VFX everything is top notch.

The film is a perfect Guardians adventure. It does not stick to one location or premise for too long. For me, the second film got stuck in one location and sort of died out. This one, keeps moving and is equal parts hilarious, entertaining and exhilarating at the same time. That's a perfect GOTG adventure in my book. Having played the game as well, this sort of has a similar tone and feel to that somehow and the game too was an awesome ride.

So, coming back to the film, this movie deals with the fallout of Gamora not quite being the Gamora as the person we knew is dead and this one is a past version with less experience and more trauma to deal with. Peter's reaction to her presence is a film in and of itself. Its not boring, but a silly rom com sort of treatment littered throughout the film. The main plot line is about one of the major Guardian's past and is poignant and tragic.

Its difficult to go into any sort of details about the film without going into spoiler territory. So lets just say, if you liked the first Guardians film and know of their story so far, then this is a must watch film.

Good movies often have short reviews, but there is nothing more to say than, its an amazing film, do go and support it so that Marvel knows what sells and what doesn't.

Rating : 9.5/10. This is as good as or even better than the first one. So do not miss it...

702,8.0,3-May-23,"This movie blew me away, as not only is it the best movie in the 'Guardians of the Galaxy' franchise, but it is one of the best MARVEL movies ever made.

Every aspect in it works so well and it all culminated in a fantastic event.

All of the Guardians are at their best here. Rocket delivers a heart-wrenching backstory which was kept at the perfect length where it was not shown too much or too little. Star-Lord gets a chance for closure with Gamora. The rest are at their funniest, particularly Drax and Mantis.

The story expands upon the backstory, and ends up becoming pretty sad and heavy, helped in huge amount by the film's villain, the High Evolutionary, played by Chukwudi Iwuji. His actions related to the animals are pretty disturbing and depressing.

The music in this movie is also on-point. It ranges across the decades and features lots of variety compared to the first two volumes.

There is a lot more I could talk about, (I did not even mention Adam Warlock), but I'll stop and encourage everyone to go see the movie. I have enjoyed lots of MARVEL's movies, but none to a degree as this one in a long while.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

I enjoyed the first Guardians of the Galaxy, can't remember the second one though I do recall not caring for it any more than I cared for this which I probably will not remember shortly either. I did enjoy Dave Bautista and Will Poulter was an unusual addition and Groot is always a fun character. I have no idea what this was about. These things are always about the good guys trying to defeat evil beings and and/or empires. There's nothing offensive about this, though I was disappointed in the special effects.

706,8.0,22-Jul-23,"This swan song for this lineup of the Guardians was absolute perfection, and a satisfying, fun, and fulfilling way to end the Guardians story.

This final Guardians movie takes a slightly darker tone than the previous two, though there are plenty of laugh-out-loud moments (including one that involves the MCU's very first F-Bomb). This time around everyone's favorite misfit family of heroes go on a desperate mission to rescue Rocket Raccoon after he is gravely injured, bringing all of the Guardians face to face with Rocket's creator, the High Evolutionary, a man with a God complex who is hell bent on creating a perfect utopian society, by experimenting on others and crushing anyone and anything he seems as a mistake. Much of Rocket's origins and backstory are explored in this movie, as he is the heart and soul of the whole team.

Much emphasis in the film is placed on the importance of family, love, and self worth, as well as overcoming loss; though there are moments that will make you laugh out loud one minute and cry the next, but director James Gunn's script and direction makes it all work perfectly.

The soundtrack is also perfect; the film features songs from Alice Cooper, Radiohead, The Mowgli's, Beastie Boys, Florence and The Machine, Heart, and more!

This film also contains the most joyous and euphoric, satisfying, and happy ending I've ever seen in any of the MCU movies so far, and it will make you laugh, cry, and celebrate at the same time!

I will say, not getting to see my favorite Guardian much (except in flashback) was the biggest detractor for me. But the backstory was done believably and engagingly. And the villain was pretty darn perfect.

I was disappointed with the introduction of Adam Warlock. While it made sense in the context of the film, and I understand that this movie was not supposed to be focused on him by any means, I still would have liked to see a bit more of him as an actual Guardian.

It also goes into the back story of Rocket, a character we all want to know more about.

The biggest FAIL... IS THE SOUNDTRACK. The previous two Guardians movies gave us Fantastic Soundtracks with Classic HITS. Hits everyone knew and loved. Hits we knew as soon as the music started. Songs that crossed not just music types and style but iines that crossed generational like.

This one gives us songs thst were only partially know, were not real hits and did not cross the music boundaries of all. These songs were tied in with a background soundtrack that did not seem to match the scenes well snd did not transition well with songs of the Guardians theme.

Although all the action scenes are superb & I am tired of appreciating MCU 's extravagant cgi , All i am going to focus is Peter Quill. Starlord really abandoned that annoying child side & it feels good to have a normal matured empathetic protagonist for real. Everything else? Everything else is actually downright average. Yes. It actually is.

Before criticism Should I remind everyone that mcu never actually portrays death as a significant stop of life? Them suddenly realising *oooh oooh those children who grew up watching superheroes in literally everything never have seen an emotional scene , how about we kill a character & emphasize on it heavily??

From Sam Raimi's Spiderman to Avengers Endgame, many characters have died. Some of them were killed of in a mocking manner like maximum charcters from Thor 1 to casualties happened during Avengers 1 & Age of Ultron. Then again some scenes still haunt my dreams like Spiderman 's uncle Ben dying in Raimi's Spiderman.

So what is the big issue here?

An arrogant pirate of a raccoon who never behaves properly lost someone dearly. Which us , humans generally deal with our entire lives. Is that supposed to make this movie best MCU movie ?

He works his magic of combining amazing acfion thrills, hilarious comedy and incredibly heart-wrenching drama. This is a very satisfying end to this version of the Guardians. It's not without fault though. Again, my common criticism is it's too long. There's also the issue of having 30+ movies and however many TV shows and specials as backstory/continuity. Gunn caters to those who aren't MCU devotees as best he can with a lot of exposition to fill in some gaps. For those of us who HAVE seen it all, these scenes can feel a little like a weight around the movie's neck. And finally, I'd say for little kids, the film is just too traumatic. The scenes of animal cruelty could be very upsetting so take heed if you have sensitive little ones. But overall, a triumph. Better than Vol.2 if not quite in the same league as Vol.1.

An attack on Nowhere by Sovereign weapon Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) leaves Rocket (Bradley Cooper) fighting for his life. Desperate to save their friend, the other Guardian's try and track down the lab where his body was experimented on, which ultimately leads them to The High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji) an unfeeling genetic scientist hell bent on creating the perfect society and desperate for the chance to dissect the brain of Rocket, his most successful experiment. To access his facilities, Nebula (Karen Gillen) reaches out to Gamora (Zoe Saldana) for specialist help.

Yes, I cried at the end. Not at any one particular aspect of the finish particularly, but more a sort of low-level emotional moments that tie up what feels like the end of a large section of the MCU, that ebbed and flowed as the perfect song was chosen, or the perfect reunion happens. There are two big levels of pain that GOTG3 is tasked with dealing with. Rockets trauma and survivors' guilt about the time he was experimented on, and Quill's inability to accept that his Gamora has gone, and the one still walking about doesn't love him. There were funny moments too, I should say, it's not one long cavalcade of misery.

What it also is, is phenomenally good looking. I know that Feige has said that they're going to refocus on fewer/better films and one area where they can look to improve is the special effects, but for whatever reason this film, with several all-CGI characters, has entirely avoided that issue. I don't know if it's that Gunn is a stronger minded director than others, and refused the compromises, but it's certainly worth it.

It's not, perhaps quite at the level of ""Infinity War"" or ""No Way Home"". It doesn't have fan servicing ability that either of those have - but it's a surprisingly dark and mature film and I enjoyed it a lot.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

This is not a family movie; it is for people who think animal cruelty and caged children can be entertaining. Likewise, ""There is no God, that's why I stepped in"" whether a believer or not, intense nihilistic self-loathing and hatred seems out of place. I do not see this one on the same level as the previous two. Guardians are for clever humor, amazing characters, good plot, and a loser's insufferable noisy soundtrack. The same cast acting was amateur, everyone yelling nonsensical lines which are supposed to be funny.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

What have you done James Gunn? I can't be same again. I never thought I would cry again after Endgame but then this came. Beautiful ending to an amazing series. But I wish to see more and thank you James for giving my favourite MCU character a main lead.

It has some good scenes, here and there, the action is mostly entertaining and well choreographed and at some points it manages to be funny. To me it fell short by trying to be too emotional; it's really hard to connect with this characters: raccoon backstory is clicheic, you've clearly seen this type of story, and throughout the 2 hours I don't think that someone will not expect how the story unfolds. This is why it really gets boring as you watch it; if you know the outcome, what's really the point to finish it?

Also, the villain seems like it was written by an AI, or they got really bored while writing the entire thing, judging by how uni-dimensional it is.

Anyway, if you wanna hear Vin Diesel say ""i am groot"" 20 times and wonder why they don't cast somewhat a decent actor or wanna see a Stalone cameo for 10 seconds i guess its worth it, who am i to say?","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

Here's hoping the other directors and producers of the upcoming MCU projects take note and bring Marvel back from the detour of mediocrity it's been on as of late.

Visually the movie is stunning as well as the music continues its trend with the 70s-80s style rock which I really like. The scenery is quite amazing with incredibly clever ideas for biomes. For example early in the movie we are introduced to the HQ of the Guardians of the Galaxy which is inside the skull of a celestial. Which is pretty cool and visually impressive.

However we get no movie integrity (there is no smooth transition between start-middle-finish), poor-written dialogue (more like childish in some cases) and a confusing story. I really liked the throwbacks of Rocket Racoon's origin but the way the movie presented it, it was rather rough and unpolished. Another problem is the multiple themes that the movie tries to portray leading to plot holes and unnecessary actions by the heroes such as animal experimentation, depression, companionship and the pain of a broken heart. The final blow for this low rated review came from the plot holes. There are just so many details that when you start noticing them they make the experience even worse.

Overall great and smart use of the CGI technology but unacceptably bad dialogue, many plot holes and shattered movie integrity.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
735,9.0,12-Jul-23,"In the eerie silence of Knowhere, the whispers of the past echoed, whispers of lost comrades and a love painfully extinguished. Peter Quill, the Star-Lord, stood alone, a figure carved from the stone of his own despair. Each breath he drew was a reminder of Gamora's last breath, stolen away in the cold vacuum of space. A profound sense of emptiness clouded his spirit, and it seemed his soul had become a barren planet devoid of light.

Yet, time, in its unrelenting march, cared not for his anguish. A sudden calamity struck, a friend, a beacon amidst the dark, laid low. It was then that Peter, weighed down by the chains of grief, felt an ember stir within. It sparked a revelation - the mantle of a Guardian was not worn in fair weather alone.

With each step, he felt the heaviness of his loss, yet also the beginnings of a resolute determination. He looked around at the remnants of his team, their faces reflecting his own pain, but also their unspoken support. The third venture, they said, bore charm. A charm, he hoped, potent enough to eclipse the shadows of their past.

The universe loomed ominously ahead, harboring a force so malevolent that even the gallant Guardians were filled with trepidation. Their enemy was not just a being, but the embodiment of a dark past that gnawed relentlessly at their spirits.

And yet, as they embarked on their perilous journey, there was a tangible sense of unity, an unyielding resolve. Can they do it? Can they save the universe one more time? Their mission had turned into a battle not just for the universe, but for their own redemption. Amidst the stars and against all odds, the Guardians would face their demons, together, for it was in unity that their true power lay.

No matter the outcome, this was a testament to their indomitable spirit, to their collective will that transcended their own despair. This was the song of the Guardians of the Galaxy, a harmony of resilience, camaraderie, and unwavering hope echoing through the vast expanse of the cosmos.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

And while a few women coming of age films have crossed my path none have been as good as Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret. Most movies studios are run by men and even when a woman manages to get the top spot she does nothing to shake up the kinds of fare put out there. So congrats to Lionsgate for bankrolling the adaptation of this book.

What makes the picture stand out is it's dealing with preteen girls and their sexual confusion, not just about boys but about their own bodies. I can think of few films to actually deal with getting your period. The pics that even address it usually bring it up as a source of gross out humor. I'm also hard pressed to think of the last film I saw where a young woman had to deal with getting a bra for the first time. This is stuff every young woman must go through but it's seldom seen in cinema. Or at the very least, in most flicks I've seen. And I see a lot of them.

The whole issue of her religion and what she should believe in is also handled excellently. This is a dynamite script but it would be nowhere without the performers. Everyone puts in a fantastic performance, most especially the lead, Abby Ryder Fortson.

The direction is also crisp and to the point. If I have any issues at all it's that I think the character of the father is under used but I guess this is really Margaret and her mom's story. Which, you know, fair enough.

I hope everyone with a preteen daughter see's this. In a sane country it would be shown in schools but the book it's self is banned in some districts so that's not going to happen. Which really is to our nations shame.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

All the character share the screen without overshadowing one another It deliver a proper closure for this trilogy (even if you would like for it to continue)

And that would be my only problem this as pretty much everything in the marvel universe has been closed and the hype around the shared universe has fallen since every thread has been ended either by proper send off like this one or by killing any love for the serie (thor , hulk ect ect).

738,9.0,7-Jul-23,"One of the problems with Marvel Phase 4 onwards movies have been. The cookie cutter approach.

It will open with a flashback. There will be an offbeat pop or rock song. This opens with Creep by Radiohead.

Each sequel will have a longer run time. This is 2 hours and 30 minutes. 45 minutes could have easily been chopped off.

The good thing about GOTG 3, there is no big supervillain. It is all about Rocket Racoon his backstory and his future.

It is also a goodbye to its director James Gunn who has gones off to DC movies. It also marks the end of this incarnation of GOTG.

Rocket Racoon was created by a mad scientist called the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji.) He experimented on animals in order to create a new utopia. Now he wants wants Rocket Racoon's brain and has sent someone to retrieve him.

Rocket Racoon has been fatally injured in the attack and the Guardians need to save him. They travel to Orgocorp's headquarters to find the override code in the kill switch embedded on him.

It starts off brightly, it is a small scale film with an emphasis on action and humour.

As it goes on, it just gets more interminable by the minute. There are too many characters and they have little to do. A good example is Nebula who just shouts and screams, at one point at little kids for no good reason.

In short, IMHO it's by far the weakest of the three though still better than anything Marvel has put out since the last Spiderman (which was actually a Sony movie).

The first portion of the movie seemed forced and didn't flow very well. The dialog was pretty weak, the jokes didn't land particularly well, and it jumps all over the place. I was bored and wondered what all the fuss was about. After that, the pace picks up and I started enjoying it.

Good news. Disney's woke BS is minimal, and very subtle when it does rear its head. The acting is first rate across the board, though I think Gunn could've been a bit more convincing than he was. The antagonist nails it.

The bad news--it's definitely longer than it needs to be. Standard for today's Hollywood which seems to have forgotten the beauty of brevity. And it didn't know when to end, which should've been right after the final confrontation. But of course, the MCU has to try and set up characters for spin-offs. Stupid mouse.

In the end, it's definitely far more somber in tone than the previous two, and if you're easily upset by animal cruelty, you might want to skip it.

There's no YMMV; the 1st GotG is one or my favourite films, and the 2nd and 3rd, while not quite on the same level as the first film, are close.

It turns out Pratt can act. Will Poulter's Adam Warlock in particular is hilarious, but everyone was funny.

James Gunn does not miss. Except maybe Scooby-Doo 2.

The 3D was good, but oddly not quite as spectacular as the first 2 films (which both had fantastic 3D).

It's also kind of crazy that this had the exact same budget as Ant Man 3 (AM&TWQ) but looks miles more professional (recently rewatched AM&TWQ on Disney+, wow some of the green screen / The Volume usage was really poorly done and lighting mismatched there) but every frame of every GotG looks professional.

Going to miss Gunn's touch in the MCU, but looking forward to see if he can revitalize the DCU.

A/A- can't figure out how rewatchable it is, I need to see it again, but around 9/10.

3D: 8.5/10 shocking not as crisp and deep as the 3D from the 1st 2 films, but I also feel like the focus was more about the heart, rather than the polish this time.

YMMV: if you go expecting a fun lighthearted film like the first 2, you'll be slightly disappointed. Also, Multiverse of Madness was the closest the MCU came to gore. Well, GotG3 almost gets to an R rating. Not as gory as ""The Boys"" but gorier than Deadpool.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

This time Rocket is in trouble and the Guardians' new mission is to save him while digging through the brutal past of Rocket and have a solid face off with his tormenter. From Knowhere to Counter Earth, this is one battle one cannot miss.

James Gunn has blended the emotions well with the humor and there is no holding back. He tug on those strings showcasing Rocket's past and his friends while the rest of the Guardians have their own moments. This clearly meant to be Gunn's swan song. Surely it does drag a bit in the third act but it doesn't hamper the final outcome. The finale does go bonkers, Gunn's style and somehow it fits to the Marvel content.

It's a testament to the fact that when the directors and creative team stay true to the original Marvel formula, the results are nothing short of spectacular. From start to finish, the movie keeps you thoroughly entertained, with not a single dull moment to be found.

One of the remarkable aspects of this film is its broad appeal to audiences of all ages. As I mentioned, I was able to watch it with my entire family without any concerns about its appropriateness for kids. In 2023 it's a rarity to find a movie that can engage and entertain such a wide range of ages, but this Marvel installment accomplishes that effortlessly. The humor, action, and storytelling strike a perfect balance that keeps both younger and older viewers thoroughly engaged throughout.

Furthermore, the movie succeeds in rekindling the nostalgic charm of Marvel's early days. It takes us back to a time when the superhero genre was still fresh and unexplored, reminding us of the sense of wonder and excitement we felt when we first witnessed these extraordinary characters come to life on the big screen. By evoking that originality and spirit, this film taps into a collective fondness for Marvel's roots, making it an even more enjoyable experience for long-time fans.

The superb direction, combined with a stellar cast of actors who effortlessly inhabit their roles, brings the story to life in a way that truly captures the essence of the characters. The chemistry between the actors is palpable, and their performances elevate the already engaging script. Whether it's the emotional depth of the dramatic scenes or the lighthearted banter between heroes, every moment feels genuine and authentic.

In conclusion, this Marvel film is a triumph that showcases the brilliance of the franchise when it stays true to its original formula. It offers a thrilling and entertaining experience for audiences of all ages, reminding us why we fell in love with these characters in the first place. This is a movie that brings families together, sparks laughter, and reignites the passion for Marvel's unique brand of storytelling.

The special effects are superb with every scene filled with odd characters, colourful settings and weird alien-ness and the action scenes are fast paced, frequent and involving. Some scenes do go on a bit long and it does feel a bit like a music video at times due to the heavy use of music, but none of the scenes felt unnecessary and the music was great.

This story can get in your feels at moments, but on the other hand the reasons for why things happen remain in shadows. The psychology behind the Bad Guy's actions is not a point of focus. And that doesn't make him mysterious. It makes him shallow and uninteresting: The only thing he seems to be capable of is being angry.

You could say, just sit and watch the wild ride and enjoy. But the action itself is somewhat generic and the story rather straightforward. And this time the music and the jokes do not bring this movie to a higher level. The music sometimes felt out of place. The jokes were crammed in because a certain number of jokes had to be in the movie, or so I guess.

For a two and a half hour movie the story is simply not well developed enough to the point of being superficial. The interaction between the characters, the dialogue, it wasn't fresh. It didn't sparkle. More of the same. And what about those captive children? That looked so eery. And yet, it added virtually nothing to the story, because nothing was done with this fact. So you see the dark backstory gets flushed out by all the action scenes, making it almost a bit childish. The emotional moments were only there for effect.... No, this is not Star Wars where a perfect balance between fun & serious and dark & light was created.

It's not a bad movie though. The visuals are outstanding, There's a lot of action. It has its moments. It' the Guardians with a twist, but that twist makes it less funny and entertaining than the previous movies. And it does not compensate for that in depth.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

A great addition to the MCU and should be reveired as one of it's top contributions. The film doesn't play into the Multiverse Saga but it is not needed, as it saves the story for the Guardians. The take on Adam Warlock is much different than expected but worked in execution. Not every joke was perfect but we laughed and we cried, oh boy did we cry. This film rips at the heart strings.

I thoroughly enjoyed it with just a few caveats: Lot's of music in a film dates it forever. Also music is very personal and if you play music that not everyone likes, it's going to spoil the film for a lot of people. There's far too much loud and raucous music that does not add to the film nor explain anything. I don't even know why it's there. I mean...Beastie Boys?

Also throughout the film there is furious raging from the characters at each other. Not just a dispute, but loud, aggressive voices raging in anger. It's very off-putting and takes the edge off their camaraderie.

Once you get past the cringy exposition the magic of the other Guardian films returns.

There is humour and action and great effects and a story which, although quite straight-forward, is serviceable and coherent.

This is a long film and you do feel it but not in a bad way.

If I was ever to find myself bored on a rainy Sunday afternoon, I would not hesitate to put either of the first two films on to cheer myself up - a little less so this one.

This movie is fun and entertaining but there is a lot of darkness to it - the first two movies had themes of death and rejection and genocide and enslavement but here the ratio of dark to light is much higher.

Don't get me wrong it all works and I think it is a great movie for it - but it demands an emotional toll that makes this film less accessible for its genre.

This is also very much a farewell film making it clear that the Guardians (as we know them) are done - which makes it a little melancholy.

I would say I enjoy this movie more than the second, but not as much as the first. It still looks great, with some amazing action set pieces, and a great soundtrack. It made me feel old when the movie ended with a song from the 2000s.

It's certainly the darkest of the movies when it comes to Rocket and his backstory. This is essentially his movie. The darker tone is both a strength and weakness of this film. The darker tone makes much of the humorous scenes feel more out of place. I had this problem in the last film, but here it's more apparent in some places. Drax is still made to be a joke character, like in the second film. I get why Batista doesn't want to play the character anymore. It's also longer than it needed to be, especially during the climax. This easily could have been the same length as the first film.

The villain of this is better than he had any right to be, and that's all due to the actor. The character himself is your typical one-dimensional MCU villain bent on ruling the universe. However, the actor gave such an over-the-top performance that it elevated the material to being more enjoyable than it would have been otherwise.

I also like what they did with Gamora. I was afraid they were just going to pretend Infinity War never happened and the Gamora of their time never died because her alternate self would fill her shoes. But that wasn't the case. This Gamora is a very different character and introduced a new dynamic and tension to the team.

Overall, if you're a GOTG fan this is a solid final entry. There are parts of the film that are amazing. I would say that GOTG is probably the best trilogy in the MCU after Captain America, although the bar is not set that high in that regard.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
769,1.0,6-Jun-23,"If you coming to watch the 3rd expecting it to be like the first 2 guardians, you are in for an extremely gross surprise. This movie made me sick to my stomach before it ended. The mutation experiments were twisted, the bio organism planet was disgusting to say the least, overall this is not the guardians of the Galaxy we saw in the past. It's not the fun adventure based comedic movies we have seen before. Please save your the money and time and STAY AWAY from this atrocious film. It's really sad, because Rockets story was very compelling and they couldn't done it in a way where it wasn't so dark. They could have portrayed the movie much better than they did.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
770,8.0,23-May-23,"From a filmmaking standpoint there's a lot that's not quite right with this film. There's just far too much going on at times. Some cuts are really abrupt & sometimes the humor is completely out of place. There are too many important characters. The entire adam warlock arc was far too rushed, which is a shame because the actor did a great job.

Ultimately all this doesn't really matter though because the things this film gets right, it executes amazingly well. It has the most heart out of any marvel film to date. It manages to be really funny and incredibly emotional at the same time. It does this better than thor 4 or even thor Ragnarok ever could. It's downright dark at times and gives even more emotional depth to the protagonists than the previous films. Where countless franchises have failed before it, GOG actually manages to finish a trilogy in incredibly satisfying fashion. All the characters are given an amazing send off and while it's the weakest of the 3 films technically speaking, it's grander, more emotional and serves as an amazing finale to a thoroughly enjoyable space journey.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
771,1.0,8-May-23,"Guardians of the Galaxy 3 review (2023): This is an overview with no spoilers

Upsides -Peter Quill's new look was amazing with the wavy hair and beard -The new comic-accurate suits looked great -The cinematography was good -A great plot with 'high evolutionary' as the villain and he did a better job as a villain than Marvel's next big bad, Kang the Conqueror.

-The acting from brad pitt and Chris Pratt was great -Like the other Guardian films, it was hilarious -The ending was great

Downsides -There were quite a few crude jokes -I would've liked to see Peter with his helmet on -Adam Warlock was wasted potential and they went from having him as a cool post-credit scene in GOTG. 2 to making him a grown-up superhero Eustace -The soundtrack was alright, nothing too memorable, unfortunately.

Overall I thought it was a very emotional film and not what I expected when I watched the trailer.

Unlike a lot of Marvel films recently, the cgi was actually good, although there were a few shots which looked a bit strange, especially with Gamora's robotics and it's the best film of the trilogy and possibly the best film since Avengers Endgame.

773,1.0,8-Jul-23,"I went into with some seriously low expectations. So far, I've been feeling a bit tired MCU movies, Phase 4 was really boring and bad. But this suprised me, GOTG Vol. 3 was really great! I can't contain my excitement when I think about how much I enjoyed this movie. Out of all the films in Phase 4, this is what I'm looking for. It truly stood out for me.

It had some great highlights that made me laugh and even shed a tear or two. The humor and gags were still top-notch, and that hallway scene was easily one of my favorite. The entire sequence in Orgosphere was amazing. Didn't see that F-Bomb coming, and it caught me off guard in a good way. The song choices were fantastic and added to the overall experience. Also, i did not expecting it to get that dark, it really took me by surprise, especially when it came to exploring Rocket Racoon's backstory. It was a total gut punch, heartbreaking to watch. It really hit me right in the feels with that one.

The characters were absolutely fantastic. It still the good ol' 'Guardians of the Galaxy' that we all know and love. Rocket Racoon was the real MVP of this movie. Mantis is really good in this one. Cosmo the Dog! She's adorable and hilarious. Adam Warlock was somewhat disappointing. I was seriously hyped when he was teased in Vol. 2, but they took him in a different direction, turning him into more of a comedic character, which felt like a missed opportunity. I feel like they underused him in this movie. However, his humor did add some laughs to the movie, and that's totally fine with me. The main villain, High Revolutionary was straight up the most vile villain since Thanos. The level of terror and ruthlessness he brought to the table was impressive, way more better villain than Kang. He was scary, ruthless, and gave me chills. Chukwudi Iwuji did an incredible job.

James Gunn is really impressive. I absolutely love his creativity. He has a knack for bringing these cosmic misfits to life in such a unique and entertaining way. All I can really say is a big, heartfelt thank you to him. He delivered a wonderful trilogy that will go down in MCU history. This might be his last ride with the Guardians, but I have no doubt he left his mark. And that's how you end a trilogy.

Guardians of the Galaxy have carved out a special place in the hearts of fans, their final journey was bittersweet, but it was handled with such finesse and emotion that left me amazed. The characters, the humor, the epic moments and the emotional depth-it all comes together in a way that just feels right. From the first movie to the last, this trilogy has consistently delivered the perfect blend of action, heart and adventure. It's a testament to the incredible storytelling and the unique charm that the Guardians bring to the MCU.

Undoubtedly, this was the best one since Endgame. It brought back that magic and excitement I thought was fading away.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

Are we never going to see the Avengers again, or will we have to wait for Disney to recast all of the lead roles with the opposite gender for Dinsey to move forward.

I don't understand why it's so hard to make a good film in this genre. So many of these titles have a long history of excellent stories but Hollywood types take them and try to put their own spin on them and ruin them. A good film requires more than a good sound track.

If you made a list of every MCU movie that has followed ""End Game"" and asked me which one I was most unlikely to watch, I almost certainly would have replied, ""Guardians 3."" The first Guardians was profoundly overrated, and the second one was a moronic, rambling mess. Perhaps worse: almost all of the films' humor fell flat. I noticed that they were only funny to me when the Russo brothers were writing their dialogue.

But as I watched Guardians 3, I laughed hysterically even late into the movie, and the comedy was amazing-- i.e.: ""The Soviets put me on a rocket knowing full well that I would die in a fiery crash.... but the one thing they never did was CALL ME A BAD DOG."" In fact, it seemed like the Russo brothers might have served as ghost writers for James Gunn sometimes--which is fine. As the film critics stated (and it's the reason why I even took a chance on the film), Gunn took a chance on an actual narrative instead of relying on Marvel's recent stale, formulaic and gimmicky approach of nostalgia combined with setups for subsequent films.

It has a couple of minor flaws: Rocket's backstory with his fellow caged talking animals was extremely predictable and manipulative, but I was willing to overlook it because for the most part I liked it. Also, it's much too long. I knew exactly which scenes I would have edited to reduce its length to two hours.

It's well worth watching, though.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

Dave Bautista's character in the film is exceptionally funny, and I am glad he was given the opportunity to showcase his comedic talent. However, I have some concerns about Nebula. Did she enhance her abilities? How was she able to repair herself in the heat of battle? In Endgame, she shot her future self, yet she inexplicably managed to heal herself and generate weapons. I guess lots have changed during the years.

The Guardians are everyone's beloved misfits. The goofy little brother who is all the more endearing for his imperfections and good intentions.

Adam Warlock's character was a good balance between bad-ass and a bit goofy, and the main bad guy did a great job of being 'unhinged' and scary.

799,8.0,6-May-23,"It goes to show what kind of pull James Gunn has, when he got Disney to greenlight a movie, where there's a gory closeup of someone's skinned, bleeding face, after their face was just torn off. There's also a lot of animal torture and other really grim stuff.

Most of the violence remains inconsequential, especially the many teased or hinted deaths of main characters, complete with sad music as they are beaten half to death, frozen, shot through the heart or decapitated, only to be fine again a moment later.

And so, without any real consequences or emotional stakes, the cruelty on screen is little more than torture porn.

On one hand, I would generally applaud Disney for their audacity, if the violence and misery served a purpose. It doesn't. The emotional payoffs aren't there, and the film leaves you feeling manipulated and cheated. Where Rian Johnson attempts to subvert audience's expecations, Gunn subverts their emotions. Neither seem to regard their audiences as anything other than lab rats.

However, Gunn isn't without talent, and there are several beautiful shot compositions, some clever writing and a few instances of well used music. Gunn even at his worst and most self-indulgent is still more interesting than the usual MCU conveyer belt slop. Any 5 minutes of GotG3 has more humor and heart than the entirety of Thor Love and Thunder or Eternals.

It's a shame. James Gunn is undoubtedly talented, but he is too full of himself to temper himself when story demands it, and there's something really misanthropic and sadistic about him, that just seeps into his movies. He trivializes suffering and cruelty in a way that is indicative of a psychopathic mind, like someone who would watch Schindler's List and make scat jokes about the boys hiding in the toilet.

I can separate the artist from the art, however, and maintain that the first GotG1 is one of the best MCU movies to date (if not the best). This third one, however, left me feeling dirty, like after that Terrifier movie.

If you liked the Saw or Hostel movies, chances are you'll like this. Everyone else may want to skip this latest death throe of the MCU.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

But in this film's case, the story was dragged out with long and mostly unnecessary scenes. Much of the film was too much filler and not enough substance, and to make matters worse, most of that filler was overboard sappiness and cheesy dialogue with more misses than hits on the humor. It's like Gunn asked a bunch of fifth-graders to come up with the humor. That said, there were a few hits, but the infantile humor misses overshadowed the comedic moments that hit. Plus I felt the story wasn't as engaging as the first two instalments. Nevertheless, the S/VFX was outstanding, in abundance, and impressive, and the main reason for my generous 8/10, for a story and missed comedy that would've only deserved a 6/10.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
802,7.0,14-Aug-23,"Rocket is badly injured and the Guardians must save him.

The plot focuses on a tragic backstory for the character Rocket and for me it is one of the strongest aspect of the movie. Who would think that an animated raccoon and other talking animals with soulful eyes in space could generate so much emotion and trauma?

The main adventure unfolds as an entertaining assault on the senses that includes a lot of typical James Gunn comedy. As with all Guardians movies I find this slightly hit and miss. Some jokes work very well, others miss the mark (one character in the toilet) and others feel too drawn out. I appreciate that humour is in the eye of the beholder so everyone will feel different about this.

I like the continuing theme of togetherness and the surrogate family role of the main protagonists. As the film draws to its final showdown you pretty much cheer them on against the baddies and in particular the very nasty Dr Moreau tribute, played with great Shakespearean intensity by Chukwudi Iwuji.

Not all characters for me are fully effective. Adam Warlock has a bizarre introduction to the MCU and feels possibly forced into the action as a marketing ploy for later films. He adds to a somewhat cluttered feel to the screen time allotted to various individuals. Personally, I think the film would have been better without him.

Visually it is an incredibly exciting, colourful and inventively designed experience. However, as with all Marvel products it slightly overdoes the violent action spectacle. There is only so much clanging of metal, crashing spaceships and dispatching of various creatures I can take in one sitting without numbing to the experience.

While the film presents it's goofy humor we all grown to love with the previous film, it does have a dark side story that is the darkest in the MCU also they really push the limits in the brutality of the actions scenes. The dialogue is very raunchy with lots of swears and even has the F Bomb.

Overall the story is great, the humor is as well, and the action sequences is as wonderful to expect from James Gunn. While this is one of the darkest PG-13 you can watch overall, it brings a great viewing experience that makes the 2 hour and 20 min film seem short as you are kept entertained or horrified.

Unlike all of the MCU's other films up to that point therse were characters that most audiences weren't familiar with. And some people thought that the idea of a film starring a sentient tree and a talking raccoon travelling in space to save the universe just sounded bizare. Plus it was being directed and written by James Gunn, whose biggest creddits up to that point were Dawn of the Dead and the Scooby-Doo live action films. But cut to less than a decade later, the Guardians are now some of the MCU's most beloved characters and James Gunn is now one of Hollywood's most in demand filmmakers.

From the start, Vol. 3 takes a more melancholy approach to the previous installements. It opens with Radiohead's Creep playing as Rocket (Bradley Cooper) tours their headquarters on Knowhere. He and the team are trying to function and continue with their lives, but it's clear the loss of Gamora (Zoe Saldana) has taken its toll on their morale. But all the Guardians are forced back into action once again after the artificially created superbeing Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) flies in and singlehandedly pummels all of the Guardians. They are able to force Warlock to retreat, but Rocket is left in a state of near death. Unable to heal him themselves, the Guardians must fly out on a mission to discover more about Rocket's origins so they can stop themselves from losing another friend.

This will lead them to collide against the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji), a cruel scientist who has been experimenting on animals in an attempt to create a ""utopia"". He's another villain with a god complex, but one who is defined by such cruel actions that will make any animal lover demand his execution by the end of the film. His character is also an interesting contradiction. On the one hand he will regularly murder or torture experiments that do not meet his high expectations. But then when an experiment like Rocket does succeed, he becomes so enraged towards them due to their ability to potentially surpass his own intelligence. This unjustified cruelty ends up making him feel somewhere between a vengeful god and a child throwing around his toys in rage.

Alongside this Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) remains depressed over Gamora's (Zoe Saldana) death from Infinity War. Plus almost to twist the knife, their mission puts makes Peter work with the alternate timeline version of Gamora who returned from Endgame. She shares none of his memories of their time together and appears almost like an after image further trapping Peter with his grief to remind him of what he has lost. Since this film is primarily Rocket's story, this is treated as more of a side plot and doesn't really get quite enough time. But the chemistry is still strong and they do still use the opportunity to take their relationship in an interesting direction.

As for the rest of the Guardians, Karen Gillan's Gamora spreads out into a new role filling the void left by Gamora and shows some impressive character growth from when we saw her in the first Guardians of the Galaxy. Dave Bautista and Pom Klementieff continue to regularly steal scenes and deliver on some of the funniest moments of the film. Gunn still has a lot of fun experimenting with Groots different abilities, my personal favourite being ""Kaiju mode"". Kraglin (Sean Gunn) has a fun little side plot with Cosmo (a telekenetic dog played by Maria Makalova) learning to use his sonic arrow. Will Poulter is also a great new addition as Adam Warlock, though he is underused in a way that makes me hope we see him better utilised in future films. As with any stacked cast some characters do feel like they aren't given anything to do, such as Elizabeth Debecki and Sylvester Stallone. But for the most part Gunn does a great job at giving characters memorable moments even if they do have limited screen time.

The film does lose some of it's emotional momentum towards the final third where most of the story beats are already dealt with or pushed to one side as it focuses on the usual final battle to stop the bad guy. But Gunn still does deliver on enough of his signature style to keep the action entertaining. He also may top Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness with some of the most messed up visuals included in a Marvel movie. And overall it's a strong end to both the Guardians trilogy and a good note for Gunn to finish his involvement in the franchise. It contains some increiblde cast chemistry, great visuals and a tone that's able to alternate between both great comedic beats and emotional gut punches.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

Director James Gunn is in my opinion a remarkable filmmaker in terms of telling a superhero based story, with it's witty and hilarious jokes, well written characters and villains and high action-oriented CGI makes GOTG vol 3 a beautiful way to end the franchise. The pacing of its is considerably moderate but it's dialogues just steals the show. The 80s to 00s music thrown is what makes it memorable as it creates a nostolgic and gives the youth the rock feeling.

The villain is fine, played by Chudwudi Iwuji with his motive being want to change this he doesn't like.

Movie wise, there are it's moments, but most of the movie doesn't even feel like guardians of the galaxy. You never really feel a tenseness in regards to the plot. Missed opportunity with real character development. All character changes just feel forced and thrown onto you, like you have to accept who they are now without agreeing with why they are that way. It feels like the characters are just put into the events and come out different, but you never see emotional development in voice, word and thought. Just a bunch of upset space teens in a terribly written script. Destroyed Peter in love and thunder and made him even WORSE HERE. The reviews saying this is the best marvel movie of 2023, your bar and expectations must be so low, because true marvel fans know this is A FLOP. This got RATED HIGHER THAN THE FIRST ONE!!! This was miles off from the first one. Should be a 4/10 on a good day, but in comparison to Marvel pre end game, this is a 2/10. Only reason it gets that high is the occasional laugh.

Rocket stands out despite his lack of screen time and they dealt with Peter and Gamora well. Any other marvel movie would have retconned her death and continued like nothing happened.

813,9.0,7-May-23,"This is by far the best movie since the multiversal saga begins, along with Shang-chi and Spiderman 3. I was really disappointed with MoM which is super confusing and inconsistent with the storyline and power level, with Thor LoT which is extremely corny and no funny with jokes that are just all over the place and inappropriate timing with a rather forgettable action sequence and storyline, with Antman Quantum which is again very messy and very predictable storyline and draggy, with to a lesser extent Eternal.

Guardian 3 is truly a fun, exciting, thrilling, gripping and above all, emotional with a solid story. You don't find it draggy, you are immersed into this world, you care for the character, you worry for their survival. The jokes were so funny too. Guardian 3 is also a lot more intense than the previous 2 films, and for the better. You also feel the chemistry between characters really flourish and evolve. The villain is also cool and cynical, of course, there is still element of predictable but this is the same for many other movies so it's not a big deal. And, the fights are beautiful. The action sequence is so well made, and not anticlimatic at all. You get the fight you want, you get to see all these cool moves, and sequence with such a coordination between characters.

I really recommend you watch this movie. James Gunn did it again but this will be his last saving grace for the MCU because it is falling apart. And I hope he can save the DCEU too, and I think DCEU is lucky to have him.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

Meanwhile, the unconscious Rocket looks back on how he was created by the vile High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji) who it seems is now after Rocket no matter the cost.

The third and seemingly final film to feature the Guardians continues the franchise trend of being exciting, touching (and indeed this time more dark and dramatic) and sometimes funny, largely due again to the presence of Drax / Dave Baustista. It is certainly the most spectacular of the three and with a budget of $250m it should be. I thought the opening 30 minutes was rather untidy and quite whether it needed every spectacular scene in its two and a half hour running time, each one bigger than the last, is debatable, but overall it's an impressive cinema sci-fi spectacular with much to enjoy.

816,3.0,19-May-23,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 was a film I was nervous to watch especially after the recent slate Marvel had presented. But I must say it had exceeded my expectations but not to the level I would have hoped. The one thing I can admit to is that James Gunn knows how to balance comedy and emotional tones in a film as seen in past work and in this film. It did have a great performance out of the full cast, had great cgi scenes that didn't look outrageous or unwatchable, and Drax by far stole the show when it comes to jokes. My issue is that I was expecting this to be a strictly serious film considering the story that was announced focusing on Rocket and with them implementing so much comedy it took away from that sometimes and led to scenes I felt were too much. Another issue I had was with Adam Warlock, was introduced with a great scene and then was left in the background for the rest of the film being downgraded from Villain, to Side Character to then Extra. I was disappointed in this as we had waited since the end of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2(2017) and then got so little of his character as a whole to provide for a good character arc. Lastly I know that James Gunn had no say in the Gamora and Quill issue after infinity war, but their interactions/chemistry I must say I disliked that the most in this film. It felt like another bad breakup film instead of the full focus on Rockets story. Thankfully it did end with a good send off for all characters and conclude the journey this team has embarked on, just was not how I think anyone expected.

Overall all I will say that this was one of the better films to come out since No Way Home, but in my opinion this sits at a 7-7.5/10 or 3.5/5 for the time being.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

Arguments that just seem a little too intense to be funny.

Inconsistencies like, one second Quill has problems driving a car, saying it's a long time since he was on Earth. Minutes later, Drax takes off on a motorcycle, presumably having never seen one in his life, and drives away without issue ...

Quill is escaping an exploding building and for some reason there's a cutaway to Drax telling him he's running out of time... for why? Isn't that obvious? Way to break up the action and kill the pace ... Gunn seriously needs an editor.

Quite who the antagonist is and why he behaves the way he does is never really explained, he just follows one McGuffin after another, to keep things going.

As the movie progresses we are presented with a stream of his creations which just seem to be there to up the ante. No explanation, no real depth or establishing who/what they are...

819,1.0,7-May-23,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3"" is, no doubt, a quality film. From the subdued and subtle opening to the more bombastic and high-octane action set-pieces, writer and director James Gunn knows how to put his own unique stamp on the tired genre of super hero films - so much so that ""Guardians 3"" doesn't even feel like a super hero movie, and that's a good thing. More of a somber drama than the whimsical space-adventure of the previous two films, this third, and seemingly final, entry plays things very straight, telling an emotional story that may have you fighting back tears. Gunn has a clear care for both the source material and the story he's trying to tell, and it's evident; this is, without a doubt, a James Gunn movie through and through. The problem with that, for me, is that - and I mean this with the utmost respect - James Gunn is a fan of the bizarre and macabre, and I feel as if ""Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3"" was just a bit too bizarre and macabre for my taste.

I saw this movie twice in order to best solidify my thoughts on it because, after my first viewing, I honestly left the theatre confused; and honestly, even after second viewing I still find myself conflicted. On one hand, the movie works as a fitting conclusion to the trilogy, filled with emotion and beautiful characterization, with themes of family and friendship ringing true throughout the entire running time. Additionally, the action, the CGI, it all looks stunning, all of it elevated by the story's dramatic heft; not since Endgame has an MCU film been this emotionally resonant. I also don't even need to mention the soundtrack, because you already know it's going to be amazing, and it is - I was tapping my foot constantly throughout the film. On the other hand, however, despite all of the good this movie contains, I'd be lying if I said I enjoyed watching it because, well, I really didn't.

While ""Guardians 3"" stands out from the MCU pack, it does so to the detriment of my personal viewing experience. To put it frankly, I found this movie disturbing. Without specific spoilers, the movie deals heavily with animal cruelty, a theme that I didn't necessarily realize I had a problem with until I watched this movie and was privy to Frankenstein-esque animals that look more like something out of a horror film than they do a kids super hero movie. And it's not so much their appearance that's the problem, but rather the mental images that will flicker in your mind as you imagine what said animals had to go through to look the way they do. The film is surprisingly graphic, and I can imagine many children leaving the theatre traumatized based on this aspect alone - hell, I'm an adult, and I found myself feeling queasy and disgusted, with the images sticking with me long after the credits rolled.

So, it'll be up to you if the pros outweigh the cons when it comes to ""Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3."" Maybe you'll find yourself uplifted by the undeniable positivity the movie does have, or maybe the tone is a fitting change of pace for you when compared to recent super hero films. While I am looking forward to seeing this film again strictly for its soundtrack (it really is that good), ultimately the depictions of animal cruelty proved to be too disturbing for me to fully enjoy the film.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

The much anticipated third installment leaves fans with a greater understanding of Rockets story, the true meaning of being a Guardian, and where this leaves our group moving forward. A film filled with the same comedic moments that we all grew to love while also pulling our heartstrings and really making us uncomfortable when it comes to The High Evolutionary' and his new world. This film does a great job at introducing us to our villain played by Chukwudi Iwuji, and it doesn't take long for the hate to grow from the viewer. What this man does to different species is unimaginable and is really hard to watch at times. Thankfully we have our faithful heroes played by returning cast members Chris Pratt, Bradley Cooper, Karen Gillan, Dave Bautista, Pom Klementieff, and Vin Diesel. We also are introduced to a slew of new characters that will greatly impact where the Guardians are heading moving forward. While this isn't the end of the Guardians, this is the end of the James Gunn trilogy as he moves to DC to focus on rebuilding their comic cinematic universe. I think we all need to applaud the work that Gunn has done for the Guardians trilogy as he brought it with every film and did an impeccable job connecting the audience with these characters and allowing us to grow with them. What's next for the Guardians? Well, you'll have to tune in to find out.

After Credit Scenes? Yes, there are 2 after credit scenes so make sure to stay until the absolute very end of the credits.

Rating: 4.5/5 (9/10) Outside a one or two moments this was a near perfect movie.

835,2.0,12-Nov-23,"This film is interesting for a number of reasons. First, it is part of a huge film series. If you saw ""Avengers: ENDGAME"" and skipped ""Thor: Love and Thunder"", you didn't lose much and won't have trouble catching up. Second, it has two stories to tell simultaneously. It focuses, obviously, on the titular ""Guardians"" team, and deals with a dark past catching up to one of them. The heroes dealing with that dark past right now is one story. The dark past itself, told through flashbacks, is another. Both do their job well and are successfully combined into one motion picture. Third, despite dealing with traumatic experiences, it does have decent jokes, and they are not exactly out of place. Not every movie can combine two things that tend to oppose one another. But here, it's done, and it does work. Fourth, the visuals and the sounds mean business here. This is good for the big screen, of course. Fifth, the drama, and this requires a special comment.

In stories, characters are supposed to go through things, deal with obstacles, and by the end of the story, they either become a different person, or stay true to themselves no matter how hard the story tries to break them. The first way is common and simple, say, an egoist becomes selfless and helps someone in a way that could get them killed, or a liar becomes honest, or a fool becomes intelligent and so on. In this movie, we have something. Dave Bautista's Drax has trouble dealing with humor and thinks dancing is for idiots. Take a look at what he's doing in the end. Why is he doing it? Is there a reason for him to have changed? Yes, there is, but no spoilers here. Bradley Cooper's Rocket doesn't like to be called ""raccoon"", but by the end not only does he accept it, he's proud of what he is. Also, he's not running from the things that once put him through so much misery. Chris Pratt's Star Lord is dealing with a recent personal loss. His way of dealing with it is drinking. Look at what he goes through and where he is in the end, but no spoilers here. And another example, possibly the most interesting one, is one of the bad guys. He has huge strength and he's young. Where he comes from ties him to one specific way of life and does not leave much room for personal freedom, apparently. And you know, choosing between a cage of gold with every basic need satisfied and a regular living tree in the real world, a bird will probably choose the latter. Will the things Will Poulter's Adam Warlock goes through change him? Watch and see.

Of course certain things could have been done better. The music was good, the visual effects were good, but the cinematography could have been more careful. The main villain is a threat to be reckoned with but what he is and does may lead you to rightfully question whether or not the movie goes a little too far. ""Superhero movies"", especially such as this ""space fun"", usually avoid violence, but this one may shock you. Finally, again, this is a superhero movie, and superheroes are good survivors, hard to kill, but some of the dangers our heroes go through could have been a bit less implausible.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

Gunn is such a remarkable storyteller; he knows how to keep the characters grounded even when they have superlative abilities. The banter between this band of misfits continues to be laugh-out-loud humourous, even when the plot keeps transitioning between Rocket's past and the Guardians' present. To think Gunn was able to make us teary-eyed over the sudden demise of some adorable CGI animals - I mean, that explains his mastery over emotions in storytelling. Each of the Guardians also gets his/her moments of impact, adding to its highs.

While this is possibly the breeziest 2.5 hours you'll experience in an MCU film (in whatever phase this is), the edits in some sections come across as jarring. The scenes set in Counter Earth stand out for being visually icky, but Gunn quickly bounces back with an epic final act and heartwarming climax. Music continues to be an integral component in these films, and Gunn's tastes have always been welcomed with open arms. The Beastie Boys needle-drop coupled with a wonderfully crafted indoor set-piece was indeed my whoaaaaa moment.

When I watched the first one I couldn't get over how rushed it was with cuts every few seconds. It was obnoxious and I couldn't enjoy it. I really liked the second one and it's one of my favorite new superhero movies. I think this one is the worst one story wise and theme wise. It's just a silly mess. The Christmas special with the same characters was pretty mediocre with terrible acting. This is just more of the same with gags every few seconds. Luckily this actually has a story and good special effects with plenty of weird characters and events. I still think it's a letdown at the end because it's a significant step down in quality from other Marvel movies and those better stories even though it's not bad as such.

While the CGI is awesome the fast cuts often distract you from it even though it's not terrible here. So it is quite a curious movie with plenty to look at which does engage. But unlike the first 2 it overuses the gags. Every scene is like 5 gags in a row and basically nothing else. There are a few heartfelt scenes that are cringe and a ton of shouting scenes that feel fully fake and out of place, but besides this all is gags and action with gags. So while we are in a magical world with great effects much of it is not fully sold. James Gunn basically wanted to remake his quite extraordinary movie, The Suicide Squad (2021). It was a masterpiece in visual CGI elements and looked unlike any movie I have ever seen. It looked like the most expensive movie ever made by far. All scenes looked gigantic and flashy. But in The Suicide Squad there were quite a few grounded scenes with characters being in danger and the gags were only used to add something to it. Here everything is just silliness with no joke landing in a way where it's actually funny in any way. Many gags are not terrible, yet it's just too much. We never get to feel like it's a real world with real characters.

I also have to note the acting. Most of the leads are again fine. Yet the screaming is way overdone and perplexing. It ruins quite a few scenes. There are plenty of good side characters too like the golden guy and the red lady. Those 2 characters were also not nasty in any way unlike most of the CGI characters. And they never needed to scream to get their point across. The main bad guy being a horrible screaming fool is the worst thing about the movie. It could have been a clear story yet all his scenes consist of terrible acting. He is also supposed to be this evil mastermind. One of the biggest geniuses in the universe who can create his own species and society yet he is never calm and rational. And of course the screaming acting is quite horrid. It's a great shame. A proper bad guy can make a mediocre superhero movie significantly better. Here he ruins the plot. I can care for the good guys when they are not screaming or doing over the top silly stuff, but I could never care for any of this main plot stuff. It was never sold. And while the side characters could have explained it and presented the evil plan in a clear way the main villain doing boring exposition never worked. Ant Man 3 created a similar CGI world with weird aliens. It worked amazingly well and is by far the best Ant Man movie. Here it's a step back and a step into a movie universe.

So while this is engaging and interesting enough at many points it feels endlessly forgettable and pointless. The endless flashbacks, at times horrible acting, and various quite nasty characters make it a movie that I won't want to rewatch.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
843,9.0,2-Jun-23,I enjoyed this film. I marked it down for how long it was and the tone was darker. Idk it didn't have that music touch like the first 2. But I like how it didn't give me by the books story beets on star lord and other characters. Def recommend to see in theaters. Fun experience and great characters like the rest of the series has provided us. Warning if you get triggered by animal abuse and disfigurement. The first two I took my younger kids to it. This one was a bit more mature I would read up before taking a younger kid to see it. I thought it was a good story and a good book end to the journey we witnessed of these characters that no one really know anything about until James Gunn brought them to life.,"May 5, 2023 (United States)"

845,1.0,27-Apr-24,"Rewatched it after seeing it last in the theater and it doesn't disappoint. We meet the guardians following the events of Endgame. A broken Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), still refusing to accept Gamora's fate, must rally his team once more for a mission that will determine the fate of the galaxy. This time light is brought upon another beloved character's origin story, and while some character arcs are coming to an end, others are just getting started.

This film to me is the embodiment of bittersweet. While still having the humoristic attributes that the Guardians films master, this one is grimmer, darker and grayer. I loved seeing these characters have their serious moments, their own way of grieving and their way of dealing with loss. Unlike the first two films, where each character had his own thing and stuck to it, here everyone has a diverse variety of moods and emotions that blend wonderfully and feel refreshing.

James Gunn absolutely crushed it. From the very first film he nurtured these characters that we now cherish with love and passion. The wide range of music revealed in this film allows the audience to groove and set out on an adventure with the characters, leaving us wanting more, and as soon as possible.

Here lies my love for Marvel, for this genre. A film that allows me to connect with my inner child, and also be able to enjoy watching as an adult. I hope to see more of these films. Because when done correctly, little to nothing can overcome the viewing experience.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

Act 3: The remaining Guardians return to Earth (for some reason), and face High Evolutionary, Adam Warlock, the Sovereign and Rocket and his cloned friends. I guess the Ravagers are there, too. Rocket explains the truth about Drax to Peter (via a very moving flashback, where we see Drax give his life for Rocket for some reason).

848,8.0,6-May-23,"James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 brings the trilogy to an electrifying ending. The film follows Peter Quill, Star-Lord, as he assembles the Guardians of the Galaxy on an important mission. Its cast includes Chris Pratt, Bradley Cooper, Dave Bautista, Zoe Saldaña, Karen Gillan, and Chukwudi Iwuji.

Back in 2018, James Gunn was fired by Disney when a series of very offensive tweets resurfaced. Almost immediately, DC Comics swooped in, hiring Gunn as a director, giving him complete control on any DC project of his choice. This led to 2021's The Suicide Squad, an excellent film, which likely led to Gunn being appointed as DC's CEO in 2022. Before this, following a public apology, Disney rehired Gunn to direct the final installment of the Guardians franchise, his final Marvel film.

The strongest aspect of this film was the characters. The core Guardians members are portrayed as a dysfunctional family, which greatly benefits the film's comedic scenes, with each member bickering with each other. A standout in this aspect is Pom Klementieff's Mantis and Dave Bautista's Drax arguing with Karen Gillan's Nebula. The three have great chemistry and comedic timing. The comedy in this film is very well placed, serving not only as a way to further the characters but also as a palate cleanser after the darker scenes.

Surprisingly, this film had a great amount of emotional depth. The film really gets audience members to become invested in these characters' stories, particularly Bradley Cooper's Rocket. Cooper delivers a heartbreaking voice performance that greatly elevates the film's dramatic scenes. Many of these scenes don't even include live actors, but instead realistically animated animals. Chukwudi Iwuji, who plays the antagonist, gives a great performance during these emotional scenes that will get audience members, especially animal lovers, to absolutely despise his character. Even though these emotional beats are somewhat predictable, they still hit you like a brick.

Gunn masterfully uses action to reinforce the film's emotional beats by providing viscerally violent action, justified by the film's main message of empathy. During the more fun action scenes, Gunn utilizes dynamic cinematography and a killer soundtrack blended with fantastic special effects, immersing viewers and allowing each member of the Guardians a chance to shine, leading to the conclusion of their character arcs by the end of the film.

Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is a stark departure from recent Marvel projects, taking the franchise to darker places. In my opinion, the more mature themes tackled in this film project the franchise forward, allowing the characters and universe as a whole to grow. As much as I'd love to see these characters down the line, this film serves as a definitive end to their stories, and Disney should respect that.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

Actors that are returning include: Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper and Dave Bautista. Also joining the cast is Shawn Gun from the Suicide Squad, and Chukwudi Iwuji from Peacemaker, John Wick chapter 2, and designated Survivor.

The Guardians return for their final solo mission. After Rocket gets shot, the other Guardians have to learn more about where he came from to try and save him. Will Rocket Survive?

Gun integrates a little of everything: action, teamwork, humor, and heart. Between all the fights and the Guardians trying to escape from danger, there was action all throughout the film.

In previous Guardians of the Galaxy films only certain people got to save the day. Here however they all got a moment to shine. Groot is older now and has earned the right to have guns in his branches which makes him look like a killing machine. Drax spoke to kids in their native language. Rocket stands up to the people who made him. Nebula, Drax, and Mantis return to rescue Star Lord and Groot from the high evolutionaries ship.

Just like all the other Guardian film's there is humor infused into the characters. Not as funny as the second one but it is dealing with more serious stakes. Rocket's backstory is not one any animal should have to endure.

At the heart of all three Guardian movies are themes of family and fitting in. All the Guardians are outcasts and don't really have a family, until they all meet in the first film. They all have different strengths and with combining those strengths and working together they have become a family and can achieve whatever comes there way.

One of the most ironic problems with the superhero genre is that the action tends to be boring, even a little bit tedious. We've all seen fight scenes with 2000 CGI people battling, and we've all seen two invincible people punch each other until the writer determines someone won. The Guardians movies have always been good at setting themselves apart in that respect, and this one is no exception. The one hallway shot should have made me roll my eyes, instead I was impressed.

Chukwudi Iwuji was great as The High Evolutionary, which was refreshing after they botched Kang in Ant-Man, but would it have killed them to make his face red? One of my biggest issues with the Marvel franchise is they commit about 80% to the comic book look and then randomly abandon it for no good reason. I hope The High Evolutionary comes back, he's a great character, a powerful character, and Iwuji played him well.

I personally would have cut maybe 10-15 minutes of sentiment and pop music, otherwise this was an extremely entertaining watch. I look forward to watching it again when it hits streaming.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

As for the action sequences, the best way to describe them is ""cool"". While they're not particularly engaging or in any way realistic, the cinematography and camera positioning are so well thought-out that you never lose interest and they maintain the quick flow of the movie.

But the area where the good production value and planning really shines is the visual effects. There are hundreds of really expensive shots here, and almost every single one of them is top-notch.

The movie is not fair from its roots, the characters (and the few filler ones) act as before, having the same chemistry as before. What I didn't like about the movie is that they stick back to helping someone who is personally attached with the enemy,just like the older movies .

The emotional bar was set high on the back of guardians 2 so the film almost takes a cheaper route by injecting excessive animal cruelty for Racoons back story, which do pull on the heart strings and which are granted, difficult to watch at times but ultimately lack any further depth. And unfortunately the usual worn out marvel formula is still at play here: excessive forced humour and innuendos. I personally was extremely disappointed with the treatment of Adam Warlock, a powerful marvel character but who unfortunately, has been boiled down to a slapstick supporting character here. As an action sci fi film this is a good entry, but to a marvel fan, with knowledge of characters and plot this leaves something to be desired and although better than the latest outputs, can't do much to change the downward trajectory that marvel and Disney are on.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

And in this aspect the film mostly delivers with a great antagonist to match. However, this film is messy and has plenty of problems. For one the film is too long, it certainly has pacing issues and by the end i was ready to leave. James Gunn has overindulged in the zany elements here again. Too many times this film indulges in weird off-putting scenes, characters, or jokes which can really take away from the darker tone this film pursues. The action itself is serviceable with only one outstanding action sequence. Finally the music here is terrible, instead of the tasteful additions in the first film.

Acting is notably better here than the first two movies with characters delivering more impactful performances, especially newcomer to the series Chukwudi Iwudj, whose performance as High Evolved leaves an impression that few other superhero villains do.

Pacing is mostly great throughout with some faultering in late act 1 early act 2. Soundtrack is as usual near perfectly picked for the scenes with music.

869,1.0,7-May-23,"We've all been feeling super hero fatigue lately and since a lot of Marvel's more recent projects have been half baked CGI nightmares with little to say, Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is a breath of fresh air.

First, the good. Rocket's backstory is extremely well done. It maintains a somber tone throughout and is never undermined by quippy Marvel jokes. You can feel the fear and tension in those scenes and they are really great to watch. The humor was pretty good, especially Dave Bautista's Drax. His comedic timing was near perfect. There were also a lot of visual gags and slapstick that really made me chuckle to myself in the theater. There was still the Marvel quippy humor, as Guardians is really the origin of that meme, but it wasn't near as tone deaf as what we saw in Thor: Love and Thunder. The movie lets it's more heavy hitting moments with Rocket lie, which I really appreciated coming from a Marvel film. Gamora's interactions with the Guardians were also handled very well, which honestly surprised me. The movie took a surprisingly mature approach to broken relationships and had a good arc for Star Lord regarding his relationships with others. However, the highlight of the movie is definitely the action and the set pieces. There's a beautifully choreographed hallway scene where all the Guardians get to show off with an awesome fish eye lens POV slow motion continuous shot. It was easily the highlight of the film for me.

Now, for the bad, or at least the mediocre. The Grand Evolutionary was pretty lackluster as a villain. He was barely in the movie and at the end the battle with him is pretty much one sided. Since he was more of a practical obstacle, than a necessary part of the themes the story was exploring, this was fine. However, it could have been better if there was a more focused villain, or perhaps one that challenged the way the Guardians think instead of thematic conflict being between only the Guardians themselves. My only gripe with the Rocket backstory is that we don't see a lot of him dealing with his past in the present, which is honestly a real shame. Adam Warlock definitely won't be everyone's piece of cake, since he was sidelined for most of the movie. However, I didn't mind this as much, because the parts that he was in, he did well. A few of the running jokes didn't quite land for me, but a lot of them did, so that's forgiven. On a more general note, my largest criticism is that the movie is a bit unfocused, since it is juggling so many characters at once. A few arcs had to be played off as gags because there wasn't enough time to really fill them out. A lot of character resolutions were structured as them ""realizing"" something and saying it out loud to a group of guardians. However, this wasn't super atrocious. If anything, the movie could have benefitted from being longer or from having cut a few characters out. It was pretty good, but it had the capacity to be very good or even great. I still had a great time though.

All in all, the movie was pretty good, which honestly surprised me given Marvel's recent track record. It's a solid 8/10 from me. In my opinion, it is Marvel's best since Endgame.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

This is coming after some very crushing emotional journeys. It's an inflection point where this series needs to build itself back up. There are going to be some changes. Some are known to be leaving. This sequel still has its brand of humor, but the serious stuff is just more sad and more serious. I would like to throw a few more jokes especially with the Peter and Gamora story.

877,1.0,18-May-23,"If you've been eagerly awaiting a revisit to the ragtag band of galaxy savers in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, prepare for a bumpy ride through a nebula of disjointed narratives and characters that may just send you spiraling into an existential crisis.

The film endeavors to spread its narrative galaxy-wide, focusing on each of our beloved guardians simultaneously. Unfortunately, it feels a bit like trying to watch multiple TV screens at once - great if you enjoy a galactic case of whiplash, but far less so if you prefer your movies to have a clear protagonist.

The creators took a bold step into the narrative unknown, choosing to spotlight every Guardian's story simultaneously, much like Avatar 2. Sadly, the result is a filmic dish whose individual ingredients are delectable, yet when combined, induce a sense of cosmic indigestion. Rocket's story orbits at the center, yet it feels like an anecdote in a tale that's meant to be about everyone and no one in particular. Immersion takes a back seat as we, the audience, are left floating in a zero-gravity void of emotional disconnect.

On the emotional side, this galactic opus comes across like an organ grinder cranking the handle of sentimentality, using every trick in the book to elicit feeling but leaving the audience as cold as Pluto.

The Guardians' third outing resembles nothing less than a cinematic Frankenstein's monster. It stumbles between tones, veering from near-horror to slapstick childishness with the grace of a one-legged Celestial. It's akin to an ill-conceived roller-coaster ride that can't decide whether to scare you or make you laugh.

Moreover, our galactic heroines, Nebula, Gamora, and Mantis (though Mantis less so), seem to be embroiled in their own version of ""The Red Bull Chronicles."" Their overly caffeinated, confrontational behaviors paint them as one-dimensional space rednecks, sidelining their previously established character depth. It's a sad sight as they devolve into irksome caricatures of themselves.

Perhaps the biggest blow comes from the stark departure from the first two films. Our familiar guardians have been replaced by alien (and not in a good way) versions of themselves, creating a disconnection that has all the subtlety of a supernova.

Despite its stumbles, the film does manage to mine some gold from the asteroid field. Drax delivers his usual razor-sharp humor, Mantis shows a glimmer of depth, and the cameo adds an unexpected twist to the cosmic soup.

In summary, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 might appeal to those with a taste for narrative chaos and character disarray. However, for this viewer, it was a leap too far into the galactic unknown, leaving behind the charm and balance of its predecessors. The score? One star for Drax and one for the cameo, but overall, this is one sequel that fails to launch.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" brings a fitting conclusion to the beloved cosmic superhero saga with its signature blend of humor, heart, and epic space adventures. The movie dives deeper into the characters' backstories, unraveling emotional arcs that tug at the heartstrings. The engaging plot tackles themes of family, redemption, and sacrifice, while maintaining the series' irreverent tone. The stellar ensemble cast delivers exceptional performances, breathing life into their beloved characters. Director James Gunn's visionary direction brings stunning visuals and imaginative worlds to life, complemented by a stellar soundtrack that perfectly captures the film's essence. It's an entertaining and emotionally satisfying finale that leaves fans satisfied and nostalgic for more cosmic adventures.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
879,7.0,15-May-23,"Going into Guardians Vol 3 I did not expect to leave the theater feeling at complete peace. I went into this movie expecting a solid Marvel film but once I walked out realized I had witnessed close to perfection.

James Gunn did what I did not think was possible. He created the perfecting ending to a franchise that I thought had no clear ending. Everything in Vol 3 was near perfection. The soundtrack, the acting, the story and the emotion.

I cried happy and sad tears. I laughed and smiled at special moments but most of all I was in awe at what was achieved with these characters. Gunn made Rocket quite arguably the best Marvel character to date. After this film I can easily say Guardians of the Galaxy is the best trilogy to ever be made.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
880,1.0,3-May-23,"Man...not only was worth the wait, but the movie is one of MCU's best to date and I'm not exaggerating even a bit. The Guardians are back in a whopping two-and-a-half hours long movie and thankfully, every minute is used with purpose, and nothing goes to waste.

Every character in ""Vol.3"" is perfectly incorporated and woven into its complex narrative tapestry.

Chris Pratt's Star-Lord might have been the lead of the last two films, but Bradley Cooper's Rocket Raccoon takes center stage this time around. Needless to say, the narrative work done for the character is amongst some of the best in the MCU.

It also provides some deeply emotional and disturbing moments as audiences learn the circumstances that created everyone's favorite trash panda...don't say that infront of him.

While Rocket was already one of the strongest characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, ""GOTG Vol.3"" elevates him even further.

This newfound focus on Rocket, however, doesn't ever take the attention away from the rest of the movie's sprawling cast. At no point does it feel like any character or plot point suffers due to the narrative focus clearly landing on Cooper's Raccoon.

When it comes to Pratt's Star-Lord, he's having a hard time dealing with the death, and subsequent revival, of his dead lover. Despite the complex emotional situation Quill finds himself in. The character's classic comedic chops are still very much present, as is the case for the humor throughout the film. This time around, the balance between laughs and heavy drama is pitch-perfect.

There are three specific characters who all could have had better characterizations and development in the franchise's prior installments - Gamora, Drax, and Mantis. All three are handled superbly, and in many ways, the development they receive here almost makes up for any shortcomings in the past.

This new Variant of Gamora feels far more aligned with her moniker of the Deadliest Woman in the Galaxy. Zoe Saldana gives her best performance to date as the character. Drax actually gets to competently fight while also making time to explore his softer side. And Mantis's powers are put to use in unique and clever ways, while she also gains more agency than just simply being a supporting punchline to Drax's many jokes.

As for Nebula, her story in ""Infinity War"" and ""Endgame"" gives the former villain a great foundation for ""Vol.3"" to build on. It feels like she's always been a member of the team, and despite her continued elevated anger, that's no longer her singular trait.

While previous iterations of the Groot may have come off as gimmicky for many, the version seen in ""Vol. 3"" feels like the most fully realized and elevated form of the character yet.

As for the newcomers, the obvious first person to mention would be Will Poulter's Adam Warlock. Teased at the end of ""Vol. 2"" five years ago, the character finally makes his proper entrance. Adam's story is not one that would seem like an organic fit alongside the rest of the narrative. However, Gunn does an incredible job of giving the character just the right amount of screen time without allowing anything to feel forced, unearned, or undercooked. He feels like a nebown child and kinda reminding you Vision in ""Age of Ultron"".

Needless to say, the wait for the Russian telepathic dog's arrival is worth the wait. While the role of Cosno in the film isn't much, it's just enough to feel satisfying and really makes audiences excited to see more of Maria Bakalova' s work with the character down the road.

Let's talk about the villain...Chukwudi Iwuji's High Evolutionary is one of Marvel's best antagonists, and he gives his all for every second of his screen time. Iwuji's performance perfectly encapsulates the terrifying, maddened evil genius to a tee. He's also impressively brutal at points in the story. While the character is notably changed from his source material, the core aspects of what makes the villain unique are all there. Like all of the best villains, the story makes his motives very clear and skillfully creates his twisted logic behind it all.

Not only is the High Evolutionary the best villain in any of the ""GOTG"" trilogy movies, but he belongs in the running for one of the best MCU baddies in general.

When it comes to the overall production design of ""Vol.3"" it's just as strong as always. The High Evolutionary's base of operations sports a unique and eye-catching aesthetic, while another space station made entirely of organic matter may be quick to make some squeamish.

As for the costumes, the core team's new matching outfits are fantastic. They are wonderfully comic-accurate, and many fans are no doubt thrilled to see Gunn put them on screen before his Marvel departure.

Then there's the VFX work, which, for the most part, is astounding. The high quality can easily be noticed during any sequence with a CGI animal-notably any and all of Rocket's backstory.

When it comes to this entry's mixtape, the musical selection is just as wonderfully chosen and curated as any of the previous Volumes before.

Not only did James Gunn successfully stick the landing for his era-ending story, but he's also gone and created one of the very best movies in Marvel Studios history.

It is everything you probably wanted to be and beyond. It is funny, action packed and extremely emotional. You gonna' need tissues for you and your friends and if you has loved all these characters through the years, then the emotions will caught you off guard for sure. This for me is probably the best MCU trilogy, beating the Cap's one for the prize.

There are two credit scenes, not five this time...but it will be hard to leave the theatre anyway, so you gonna check them.

The film as a whole has some issues but I enjoyed it very much and want to see it again. What we see of Adam Warlock was entertaining and I can't comment on what others have said as I've not read any of the comics, but in the context of the film I thought he was fine. The villain is arguably the most crazed evil villain of all, played to perfection.

The ending gave me mixed emotions but I understand why they did it that way. I appreciate the acting and emotional scenes of this film and thought it was well-done with MUCH less clunky dialogue than Thor: Love & Thunder.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

885,9.0,5-May-23,"With a long time coming F-bomb, multiple scenes that are likely to make the kidlets (and more than its fair share of adults) cry and a direct reference to meth, Guardians of the Galaxy is most definitely back for one more team adventure delivered under the watchful eye of new DC cinematic universe maestro James Gunn who ensures that this Marvel series with a difference is able to go out on its own terms in this current format and in turn save the MCU from a string of dire to forgettable outings that have plagued the company since their Avenger's saga concluded with Endgame.

Never more desperate for a feature that critics, audiences and box office results all were in favor for in unison since the dawn of the whole operation with 2008's Iron Man, the MCU should be thankful they allowed Gunn back behind the helm after showing him the door due to past misdemeanor's as Gunn and his cast clearly love working with one other and ensure that their shared love for their characters and the world they are a part of is one show here once more with Volume 3 of the Guardian's universe likely to please all that have enjoyed the prior two outings that have surprised all with their public affection and money making abilities.

Arguably more serious minded in many respects, with Gunn not afraid to enter into some seriously dark and twisted territory across Volume 3's two and half hour runtime, it's nice to once more watch a MCU feature that feels entirely removed in most instances from previous events or trying to set up future mash-ups, team-up's or potential threats and in staying focused on itself Gunn is able to juggle the films heavy, light and playful tones to good effect, making this epic adventure one that never stays down for too long as we are carried across various set pieces and emotional undertakings.

Using his same oddball charm and keen eye for visuals that have worked for him in the past both here and with his underappreciated Suicide Squad from the Covid-19 landscape, Gunn gives Marvel some of its best bang for buck moments in many a moon.

Often backed by another rip-roaring soundtrack full of old school and more modern day jams, if audience's have paid the ticket price wanting to be entertained by spectacle and inventiveness they will get it here, while others wanting heart too go along with it all will be equally pleased (with Rocket's key backstory and arc playing a major role here), as will those more refined folk that perhaps just wanted to see a telekinetic dog or a brash golden boy in the form of Will Poulter's Adam Warlock cause some havoc along the way.

Uninterested in messing with the formula or Marvel DNA like it arguably did with its first outing in 2014, Volume 3 leaves the series on a high note if many of the cast and crew decide to stick to their word and move on from what they started those many moons ago, succeeding against the odds and if this is indeed the last time we see this particular group of misfits, miscreants and outcasts on screen in this way, there's solid evidence to suggest that Gunn's three Marvel films are the most consistent of all of Marvel's properties in the cinematic cannon.

Final Say -

Rollicking along at a good pace across its substantial runtime and combining heart, laughter and spectacle together with a cast that are all seasoned and energetic professionals, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a (seemingly) fitting swansong to this ragtag crew that the world has understandably fallen in love with.

887,8.0,5-Jun-23,"Alright I will be bucking the trend here but as someone who loves films I want to honestly share my views on here. I am surprised by the high reviews and ratings on here. I was left somewhat disappointed with this film. It felt all over the place. The strong points was Rocket's origin story and the somewhat dark and serious nature of the film. But a lot of the film was unnecessary noise that added little to no value. The main villain and their motivation is poorly explained and illustrated. You needed to say more and explain 'why' he is doing what he's doing. We had a whole bunch of children randomly feature in the film and Gamora has returned after being killed off in the Avengers film but with little to no explanation as to how and why she's different. Also despite being a darker film, a key feature of Marvel films has been its great humour. This film has very small doses of it that do not help balance the film and sustain it.

Sadly Volume 3 is a far cry from its two predecessors. What made Guardians of the Galaxy great was its quirky nature, over the top characters, humour and great soundtrack. The soundtrack featured forgettable and B side 80s tracks. It's a shame the send off for the Guardians was not on a high note.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

In the movie I also like who the characters have changed throughout all the movies and how it is realistic.

This movie can be a tough watch for animal lovers. It's funny but also emotional at the same time I wish I could give this 100 or eveb 1000 stars. The film features plenty of action and explosions. The Villain was very good too and in my opinion the best in the guardians trilogy so far. He is so obsessed with Rocket lol.

The movie also had its darker moments which i think suited the movie and made it a more mature experience while still making it fun and lighthearted and keeping the overall Guardians charm!

Kevin Feige, I hope this film wakes you up. Is it so difficult to understand when a product works and also is loved by all the audience?

Also, I would like to highlight the fact of having a film that is not constantly giving us references or reminding us that it belongs to a universe called MCU.

The antagonist is amazing. It's a guy who's evil by the sole reason of being evil. Nothing to do with 'el niño sin amor' hahaha. Also, this character is much better thant the poor introduction of 'Kang El Decepcionador'.

The third installment, although fun and filled with plenty of great acting, seemed fragmented and that Gunn was trying to hard to fit in more than was needed. The story of Rocket is what kept the film alive, and worth watching, but 20% of the film felt forced. It seemed some of the acting felt forced as well, almost as if the actors knew it.

The special effects were spectacular, as would be expected, but the music was not nearly as well assembled as the first two films. It was good music, but not great music tracks.

895,1.0,6-Jun-23,"If you are looking for some cheap entertainment and a few laughs then you will enjoy this , however, unfortunately this is almost all this is.

The first two movies had some genuine heartfelt moments and made you care about the characters. In this movie I couldn't care less about what happens to them. The movie did attempt to have some emotional moments but however (for me at least) it was undermined by the messiness and randomness of the script. The tone shifts all over the place .

The villain had the potential to be interesting , and deal with complex themes like the search for perfection but instead becomes just another marvel screamy villain I will forget about.

Overall the movie felt like a parody of the first two . Doing stuff that had success such as dancing and jokes and music but in a way that feel out of place and heartless. Also the cgi didn't feel so good. And many moments felt like they were happening just for the sake of happens instead of acctually having a meaning to the plot or characters , just out of nowhere and random

It's not a bad film overall , it is enjoyable but forgettable.

It is definitely better then the movies marvel puts out lately , but I dont consider that an argument to justify that it's good. It would be like saying ""you are the smartest stupid person I've ever met"" maybe it is a bit smarter and better , but still pretty stupid and meh.

It wasn't the epic send off to the guardians I was hoping for , nor the atrocity I was dreading.

There are some surprises, and some things that you may see coming but will cheer for when they arrive anyway.

If you're a fan of the MCU and the Guardians in particular, you should try to see this movie on the big screen because it looks gorgeous and some of the set design and FX stand-out as better than anything yet seen in a Marvel movie.

Story is great. Acting is great. Direction is great.

The biggest eye opener with this movie is that there's some really solid emotional moments in it. Kinda caught me by surprise but welcome nonetheless.

Not just the best GOTG movie but maybe the best fictional entertainment of the last few years. It really is that good.

The narrative can seem a bit misguided at times but then it comes together again. It runs true though to the type of chaos that happens in the GOTG universe and in retrospect even these minor imperfections seem perfect once all is said and done.

899,1.0,13-May-23,"The third volume of the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise focuses on Rocket's origin story, which can be very difficult to watch if you're an animal lover. The theme of the movie is very dark yet balanced with enough humor and heart. The third installment shows how much James Gunn loves the franchise. Gunn earmarked his viewers to understand the monstrosities of being unmade and converted, imposing a story of empathy and heart that only few Marvel movies have accomplished and making every bit of natural humor to lighten its heavy theme. Gunn masterfully explored a new team dynamic.

The last great Marvel movie was Spiderman: No Way Home, and after that, everything turned out chaotic and disinteresting. Volume 3 is a perfect send-off for the GOTG franchise, a perfect film to conclude an incredible Marvel trilogy. What I love about this movie is how every character is well-realized. We get to see each character go to emotional places that they haven't gone to before. Every character is well utilized and even the side characters have their time to shine.

Chris Pratt, as always, showed charm and humor that is true to his character, which works every time. The chemistry between Nebula, Drax, and Mantis is well delivered; we discovered new things from these characters. Zoe Saldana as the new Gamora was also great and I appreciate how they did not compromise her character. Instead, they demonstrated that the new Gamora was different from the Gamora that we loved. And Rocket is the heart of GOTG Volume 3, everything about Rocket is the core of this film. One subtle thing that I also love is the ending, when Groot said, ""I love you guys,"" this means that, as an audience, we finally understand Groot after all the ""I am Groot,"" this supports how Gamora finally understands Groot in the end. These subtle details make this film a perfect conclusion to the whole franchise.

The only problem I have with this film is how wasted Adam Warlock's character is. Adam Warlock was introduced as this strong creature during the first half of the movie, and I even thought that his character will become pivotal to the movie, but they kinda wasted it. Some choices made to his character along the way were neglected, which resulted in his character looking like an immature creature, with no direction or proven power. This is not even Will Poulter's fault; his character was just not given enough recognition when it comes to the script.

When Layla said, ""You were right, the sky was beautiful,"" I cried so hard because my dog just died last week, and it gives me assurance how happy he is now that he was in the sky. Despite its dark and heavy theme, it is still a very funny and entertaining movie to watch. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3 is, by far, one of the strongest entries in the post-Endgame epoch. Classic MCU film made with a lot of heart that makes the most out of its core characters.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

That being said, a good bit of the movie was incredibly hard to watch. The scenes regarding rocket's backstory were ones I would have skipped through if I had been at home. I'm a sensitive person and an animal lover, and for me personally it went too far with the darkness regarding the animals. I understand that's a personal opinion and others will not be so disturbed-just a kind heads up for others who are similar to myself.

It's a very emotional movie for sure. I think they did a beautiful job wrapping it up. Looking back on how far the characters have come is really wonderful.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
901,1.0,5-May-23,"Did I just witness a miracle? Did the impossible just happen? Or am I dreaming? *pinches self* nope I'm definitely awake.

For the first time since Avengers Endgame and Spider-Man No Way Home we finally have a worth while MCU film. I had very low to mid expectations but I am very pleased to report this is one of the best Marvel films in a long time.

James Gunn just does what he does best here. Almost everything in this film is at it's best. Great story, great acting, great writing, great music, and for the first time in a long time good cgi I didn't know Marvel was still capable of that.

But what this film does is what Marvel has desperately needed for a long time which is tone. It has great tone being able to get serious while not sacrificing the comedic moments and for PG13 managing to get kinda dark, for a Marvel movie that's surprising. There's tremendous amount of heart and emotion, I teared up multiple times throughout. Also finally, finally! Having a well written villain someone who was truly a terrible, awful person. No redeemable quality about him he was an absolute monster and was quite menacing.

The biggest issue with this film and what stops it from getting that perfect score is the first act was rather weak, it really had me concerned as it felt like the film was jumping from scene to scene with no narrative structure but thankfully it found its traction in the second and third acts.

The run time is up there at two and a half hours but I wouldn't take points for that as the film was entertaining and enjoyable. This film also still suffers from some of Marvel's issues of late but most of it is contained in that first act. I will commend James Gunn on being able to juggle corporate needs while also making a satisfying Marvel film for the fans.

Lastly this film is just chock full of characters with big personalities but Gunn still managed to give every character their due and each one had a unique moment, some better than others but still every character was fantastically handled with great care and devotion.

The Guardians of the Galaxy seemed to have become the Guardians of the MCU here's hoping Marvel can carry this momentum in future projects. I very much look forward to my second viewing later today.

Thank you James Gunn and company for probably single handedly restoring some of my faith in the MCU.

It also looks a lot worse than the other films and I guess that is intentional or something but it really makes it feel like James Gunn has gotten tired of cranking these out.

The whole story line with the Counter Earth was so silly that I could not take it seriously in any way, really detracting from the emotional core of the story.

Some things I like is that the movie dares to show the consequences of violence in a way that no other marvel movies(except maybe DP or Logan) do and that is to be commended.

The writing was probably done by the studio's accountants - they have a formula that makes money, and they're sticking to it.

Really everyone had a good exit story but somehow I still just didn't totally click with the movie. Fun call backs to earlier characters and touching scenes galore but something was missing for me. I really wanted to like it more and I did like it better than the first two. Maybe it's just the Marvel burnout.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

913,1.0,7-May-23,"The movie is really good, however, based on the language and frightening images, it may not be suitable for younger viewers. There is foul language, which includes the use of the F word within the movie. This movie was as borderline before being rated R as it can be. That being said, the movie was fantastic in all aspects of the world. I, hope, with the overall limited use of warlock in the movie that we will see him more and movies to come.

There are things that are never explained. There are moments that are emotional without context. But worst of all there's feeling with characters you don't expect to have. Strong feelings.

This is the worst of the three, and it is clear that they think so too relying on devices from the first movie heavily.

I was compelled to see the third movie, because I was a huge fan of the first one but in this case, if you have a choice, I recommend passing. It is a chaotic collection of simpleton thinking. It is a comic and diminutive copy of an original..

In addition, the best thing about the series has been the music. But again in this case, they fall short with their song selection.

The movie focuses on rocket in such an emotional way that it does not make sense. And the character is greatly diminished by that. I don't know who gets paid to make this kind of movie, but it's way too much I'm sure.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

Fakeouts, emotions, comedy, characters were almost upgraded versions of themselves when it comes to character development and the action scenes were amazing as always.

The story and focus on the individual characters were very nicely done and it didn't feel like anyone was left out so to say. Even someone like Cosmos (the dog) and Karrigan got quite a bit of attention. Drax was hilarious as usual, but when isn't he? Raccoon was extra interesting this volume around, both him and Groot.

919,6.0,8-Jul-23,"Had the potential to be one of the best MCU movie of all time but fell short due to a messy 3rd act. But it does manage to do what EXTREMELY FEW MCU movies have been able to, make you care for the characters. MCU movies have been feeling AI made to me for quite sometime. Aside from NWH I cant remember the last time I was invested or ever cared about whats happening on screen. These movies have become so much of a throwaway popcorn flicks that it is impossible to finish them without multitasking.

But VOL3 had my full attention, I was invested in the characters. The characters all had their moment, you cant dislike any of them. Obviously Rocket was the centre of attention but none of them felt sidelined. Sure there are wasted potential here and there, especially whatever on earth Adam Warlock was. The plot was paper thin, the movie structure kept going back and forth from past to present. But you wont find a movie that made you care for characters you barely know, the JAMES GUNN THE SUICIDE SQUAD influence was very noticeable for some reason. Which is not a bad thing since that is my favorite DCEU movie afterall. I dont want to spoil why exactly it was heartwarming, gutwrenching and sad at times but do know that its there. The villain was fairly decent, which by MCU standard means EPIC. The 2.5hr runtime never felt long, there was always something going on to keep your attention. Even the CGI looked fairly ok, which has been horrible in the MCU for quite a while. The soundtrack often felt forced and could be something wrong with the digital print I watched but the aspect ratio was weird.

Paperthin plot with gallons of emotion. And since I'm a very emotional guy esp when it comes to animals, it was definitely a win for me. Could've been better sure but I'd say the perfect sendoff to the GOTG. Also Rocket is the best, hope you folks finally believe me.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
920,8.0,15-Jul-23,"The GOTG series (as nobody is calling it) has always relied a a certain charm to win us over. The original film was full of wit and charm as well as great effects, characters and a compelling story. GOTG3 replaces a lot of this wit and charm with a much darker edge. Many of the scenes in Rocket's back story are actually quite disturbing. Drax gets much of the comedic material and it's delivered well. The CGI is a case of more is not better as it becomes a bit overwhelming and threatens to swamp the actors talking of which, Chris Pratt seems distracted and largely uninvolved. One of odd thing is that all the actors seem 30kg heavier than the last movie (except for Zoe Saldana who is as lovely as ever) All in all it's a film with a lot of flaws but it's still and enjoyable ride.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
921,1.0,11-Jun-23,"The mere mention of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 was akin to a clarion call for me, and I found myself racing to the theater to catch this much-awaited installment. What awaited me was a tapestry of storytelling woven with meaningful symbols that beautifully connected the narrative from the opening scenes right through to the climactic finale. The characters' names themselves felt intrinsically linked to the motifs and arches, exhibiting a level of depth and thoughtfulness in the script.

The storytelling was nothing short of stellar; it was a roller coaster of emotions that had me both laughing and crying in equal measure. The seamless blending of humor with poignant moments exemplifies the charm and soul of the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise, and this installment effortlessly carried that torch.

Moreover, the soundtrack deserves its own standing ovation. With a vibrant and eclectic mix of tunes, it enhanced the mood and resonated with the narrative, lending another layer of brilliance to the film.

In summation, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is an absolute must-watch.

If you haven't seen Vol. 1 and/or Vol. 2, then you won't understand some of the references - but it will still be an enjoyable movie. If you have seen either or both of them, then you really need to see this one - and it'll be better on the big screen, IMO.

As the story unfolds, many questions some of us might not have even thought of are answered, and Rocket's backstory is delved into fairly deeply - but not to the exclusion of completing all the other main characters' stories.

Movies are an art form as much as music and paintings and all the rest - and this one lives up to that description. Heart strings are tugged on many times and the movie does not rely on CGI or special effects to sell itself, which is not to say that they aren't there. As opposed to most superhero movies these days, they don't get in the way of the story.

I highly recommend this movie with a trigger warning for strong language and animals wounded in battle. If you're ready for that coming up, it shouldn't be a deterrent to enjoying the entire movie. Enjoy!","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
924,9.0,9-Jul-23,"Grab your tissue boys and girls because the floodgates will open.

The story turns its focus to our favourite rabbit, Rocket Raccoon. You will see a side of him never seen before. Not spoiling too much, its the reason why he avoids talking about his past, that part we already know. And extending from this we are introduced to the main villian Mr High Evolutionary, also the centre figure of Rocket's past.

The story turns its focus to the supporting crew as well. Mantis, Drax and Nebula get more screentime and focus to develop their character. Gamora is not the Gamora we know, but still hella a sassy badass. In this show we see alot of the main characters finding their place in the universe.

But for how strong the emotional aspects are, the film does let down on the action side. High Evolutionary, basically a mad scientist that sorta rules over his own civilization, has incredible telekinetic powers that could even disable Adam Warlock, but there was no epic showdown, he kinda just hurled people around until he couldnt. Pretty easily taken down too. Felt alot like a bunch of ants just ran over Kang.

Adam Warlock, I dont know much about him but he is supposed to be really powerful, was kinda reduced to comic relief. I think he was too goofy. And with the trilogy ending we wont see more of him any time soon.

You get one fan-service action sequence near the end to see the full Guardians team in action, but nothing as solid as Vol 1 and 2 had. So yes to me, Vol 3 delivered on dialogue, story, character development, and emotion, but not on the action. Hence the 7/10.

GotG are the MCU's ragtag misfits that somehow end up constantly saving the universe. I still want to see more, but if I had to rank in terms of entertainment as a superhero action movie, 1 and 2 were the best. 3 is good.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

930,9.0,14-May-23,"Today I watched Galaxy Guardian, the third one

Really liked this one honestly, probably my favorite James Gunn superhero flick. It still has the cliche Marvel formula but it takes some creative risks and shows a real James Gunn feel. Its not that the marvel formula is a bad thing, its just that it can be very stale if there isnt an interesting way the formula checkboxes are hit. Luckily, on this one, his imprint is marked all over this thing.

For starters, this movie flies by, I didn't even feel the run time in the slightest. Maybe some scenes could have been chopped out, but I wouldn't know which one to choose. Sometimes the film can be a bit confusing, but I feel like thats just because the movie is really chalked full of stuff.

Loved the action, some very fun cinematography. There were some VERY fun long takes that looked incredibly well choreographed. Boring soundtrack, kinda exactly what you would expect tbh. It was standard Marvel and standard guardians of the galaxy soundtrack. Radiohead's creep is the most overrated radiohead song.

Thought that some of the performances could have been a bit better. Mantis occasionally made me cringe but was overall fine, Chris Pratt kinda the same. There was a scene with Rocket where he was talking at a higher octave and it sounded like an adult trying to imitate a child's voice and it was abhorrent. Usually Bradley Cooper does fine, but honestly he felt like he kinda phoned it in on this one through the whole movie. Cgi was mostly awesome, but there was a scene when they were in space suits that looked oddly gummy. Like their suits were very weirdly stretching around and being funky. Looked like a computer

Really why this movie works is the combination of high stakes intensely well made action, coherent story telling and relatively funny jokes. The film also does a good job at tugging at your heartstrings... Pretty tightly I may add. This is definitely the most intense emotional driven Marvel movie since infinity war imo, there are some heart wrenching scenes in this one and seriously great character growth through the film.

Overall, even though this is a bit formulated, its my favorite Guardians movie and my favorite Marvel movie since Infinity war. I love the direction James Gunn went here and I'm glad to see him have a bit more creative freedom on this one. A lot of the falling flat here is so menial it barely effects the movie. The formula is still here, but its bended splendidly. Would definitely recommend, also a good dad movie.

936,1.0,16-May-23,"The MCU lately has definitely had its ups and downs. Since the release of Endgame there has been a lot talk about whether the MCU is good anymore. I myself believe that as a whole the franchise has take a downturn but I still think it's good. Certain projects I think are great such as NWH, Shang-Chi, Loki, werewolf by night, but I also think they're are quite a few duds such as she hulk, Thor love and thunder, Quantumania, Eternals. To me the biggest issue is them trying to force in too much which causes a lot of character issues as well as rushed plots and resolutions. Even the films that and shows that said were great were brought down a notch because of those issues. But here we have Guardians 3, made by James Gunn who is one the only filmmakers that Kevin Feige and the rest of the studio for the most part can't influence and that is why This film is above everything released since Endgame.

This film is the perfect conclusion to the trilogy, it raps up storylines for each character all while delivering an emotional roller coaster packed with comedy, action, and all around great storytelling.

The performances are some of the absolute best in the MCU including Chris Pratt who definitely stepped it up for this film. The Villain played by Chukwudi Iwuji is top notch and I would consider him to be the best in the trilogy.

This to me is the best film in the trilogy and I hold Guardians 1 very highly. But this film elevates in every way and makes for one of the best films in the franchise.

My only gripe is one that I am guessing may not have been James Gunns choice. Adam Warlock was bad, I mean really bad. He was used for nothing but comedy and most of it wasn't that good. He didn't have any real impact except for at the beginning and he didn't have an impact again until a certain spot towards the end but other then that he felt very much like a characters that did not need to be there.

But overall this is an excellent film and I hope that one day we will at least see these characters return in another film.

941,1.0,19-Jun-23,"The whole Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy is a fun adventure from start to finish. We've come to know and love our growing list of guardians in the strange worlds they've visited throughout the last 9 years. Some regard this one as the best. I disagree. In my opinion, the original from 2014 was the best, but that doesn't discount the sequels. All 3 are terrific motion pictures with plenty of emotion & humor, nostalgia and comradery.

This one begins with the adorable yet feisty Rocket Raccoon being greviously wounded and while he remains in respite, his past is slowly revealed in a series of flashbacks. At the same time, the perverse mind behind his surgeries and mechanical augmentations is looking to create a new world, a perfect utopia which he has no reservations about violently and heartlessly ruining the lives of innocent animals to obtain. At the same time, Gamora returns but cannot remember her past with the guardians, and Star-Lord is questioning whether he should return to Earth after many years in space.

Being a stone hearted person, movies rarely make me shed tears. This one did. Volume 1 was fun all the way through, Volume 2 darn near cracked me in the end, but volume 3 of this series finally drew tears when Rocket Raccoon's dark, abhorrent rage in the first two movies is finally explained, stemming from when he was nothing more than a science experiment along with a small group of other animals.

Because of this, When the movie came out, Some people on the internet demanded a trigger warning be included in the beginning of the film, warning of the subject matter of animal abuse. So far no such disclaimer exists and I doubt it will. Animal abuse exists in real life and real life never comes with a trigger warning.

For the final piece of the trilogy, Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is a fair end to what has been a fun series of films. We may never get to hang out with the team again for a long while, but if you stayed put in the theatre to watch to the end credits, Star-Lord isn't through yet.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
942,2.0,9-May-23,"In fact, not just evenly blended but almost perfectly blended in this sealing episode of the Guardians trilogy. (Who knows, there might be a few more installments waiting to be made).

I won't say much about the humor, apart from mentioning the fact that many of the jokes are purely visual gags that might pass overhead of many viewers (like a brilliant reference to Michelangelo's Creation of Adam in which Adam Warlock plays god). There're also many throwbacks to the 60s and 70s (and even 80s) that add to the overall joyful effect.

I'll say even less about the action, it's often over the top, but it works. The real point I wish to make refers to the soul or heart this movie has aplenty, which for me is the main reason it's standing out among many other action/superhero movies. - Most of them have great character writing for the leads combined with lazy character writing for most of the other figures appearing on screen. James Gunn doesn't allow a single character appearing on screen to be an incomplete creation. They all get the full treatment, even the cameos. See Daniela Melchior as Ura or Linda Cardellini who does wonders in the role of Lylla. These wonderfully written roles allow each and every member of the cast to give a stellar performance, with the ""second tier"" characters like Mentis, Drax and Nebula practically stealing the show. James Gunn has already showed his knack for great character writing in his installment of Suicide Squad, but he's even better this time. For me, this is where the difference lies. This is what's making this movie something worth your time even if you're not an ardent fun.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

This film is hands down the best animal welfare movie ever created. A marvel of animal rights and care. This will probably be the last Marvel film I watch in the theatre as the rest of the universe is going down in virtue signal flames.

This film was a wonderful ending to the original team and a wonderful stand alone movie on its own, regardless of comic heroes or The Avengers. I will miss James Gunns Marvel movies.

The acting is really good for the most part and while the movie is a tad too long, Rocket's backstory is devastating. They really went all out on the special effects budget for animating Rocket and his friends from his childhood, but it's clear that some of the other special effects are just big guys and rubber suits. It is a very good conclusion to the franchise, but I feel that it might not be the end because the movie was much more successful than other recent Marvel films. I think that Marvel, in Disney, need to learn that people are not going to go watch a movie just because of the character you also need a good story behind it, a good reason for it to exist. I think it's okay if a movie is not conventionally good as long as it is interesting, for example like Thor love and Thunder. It's a crazy movie. But the latest Ant-Man film it's not interesting it's not crazy, there's no reason for it to exist. So I'm glad that Guardians of the Galaxy can end with a good film.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

We also got a chance to see Rocket have an expanded part with lots of time in the plot. The other characters Drax, Mantis, Peter, Groot, and Nebula also got a chance to stretch out their characters.

The soundtrack, while loaded with good songs, fails to deliver any emotional payoff. The humour consists of a few chuckles. Too many characters scream at each other. And the film just goes on and on.

He leaves Marvel in great memory and gives Marvel Studio the chance to get more out of some aspects and characters for future projects. There is still so much potential and stories to tell to curtain characters like Adam Warlock, Peter Quill, Mantis & Groot.

The movie was insane and absolutely brilliant. We have a villain here like nowhere else, we have background story to a character we always wondered about. CGI was top, music was class as usual, cool costume designs, nice special effects, heartwarming scenes and dramatic scenes. This is the movie that will move all Marvel fans crazy and make them thinking about the movie for long period of time. A remarkable movie !","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
957,8.0,5-May-23,"LIKES:

The Plot -A movie loaded with so much expectations has a lot to handle by Volume 3, and Guardians did not seem to be the movie to improve.

-I was wrong. The plot is loaded with so much goodness it's hard to pick apart much of anything.

-Strong underlying ties pick apart most characters, and help address and develop them to a classy, but fun way that had me hooked.

-It wrapped itself up in comedy and other quirks, but never lost sight of the goals or focus of a character plot and it was amazing to see that happen.

-And then to have a fantastic set of climaxes, to utilize old and new and handle it with such grace and yet crude fun, almost unheard of in these days.

--And to keep things mixed up and constantly engaging... Gunn nailed it with the direction and writing to tie so much into a rather strong narrative that did not get lost in culture or political agendas. Wow.

The Music -Holy crap was this fun as ever. Guardians is always known for music and again they succeeded in picking a track list to fill the movie with.

-The movie is of course homage to some of the most recognizable and daring songs, with variety that works to keep things dynamic and fun.

-But yet, the movie again uses the music to so many levels. Comedy, a buzz vibe with action, and that perfect montage/image idea that feels like a PR shot of the characters -Such combinations and balance, I absolutely loved its use and had a wonderful time with the selection and its use again just being that grade A pick.

The Special Effects -It's an investment in things that show how realistic you can make these make believe worlds come to life and look so polished and good.

-Guardians takes this wonderful blend of real life tricks of the trade with computers and giving you the best of both worlds.

'It's beautiful and adds that balance that will help age the movie well, and I feel that this just made so much come to life.

-Those on animation blended things incredibly, capturing anatomy and physiology to a degree and helping add more to the shimmer of the movies -And then comes the action moments that are gorgeous and capture to the point of getting the whole shot in the best light and not losing too much in the chaos camera as I call it.

-It was so much fun, and unlike others, did not get lost too much in the over CGI that it became cheesy to separate the lines between reality and fake.

The Heart -It's been a long time since I've been moved by a movie and even longer since a Marvel movie did it for me, but GOTG 3 did it well.

-I did not cry, but man did I feel it so hard in watching things unfold and the relative plots come to life with my characters.

-This film hits a lot of deep topics but never to the point of losing the pace and adventure aspect, timing it to make the most opportune moments to share, and then bringing it to the full moment b putting the resolution in the story.

-So much depth and the fact comedy is there to help relieve things without ever losing touch of that core character, you just don't get that quality of balance in a lot of movies.

-Perhaps one of the best stories to come out of the MCU...ever.

The Character Usage -And this isn't a movie that is gauged to just one character like they often try to do.

-No, GOTG for me uses the characters extraordinarily well, and balancing them all to give the means of inclusion in the movie.

-Star Lord has an Arc, Gamora, Drax, and Rocket all have these deep stories that dive further into the characters than we have seen, each story not fighting for time, but rather finding the right amounts of time to share.

-But then they don't bleed into one another, but mix into such a blend that you got the full effects and did not miss anything. It allowed just about everyone to play and I loved just how connected EVERY aspect was.

-Even the tertiary characters had good inclusion and chemistry and it all worked so well to continue this gradual evolution of the weird family.

The Acting -Is this the Oscars? Nope, not even close. And does it touch the performances of some of the DC and Marvel crew? No, it doesn't hit those that some hold to.

-What it does do well though... is bring these performances that again make the comic book crew come to life and continuing to make me invest into the characters for another go.

-The conveyance of hurt, the delivery of lines, the mannerisms and the swag that comes with these characters and it really made me think of this being op acting skill in the Marvel group, or at least one of them.

Iwuji is a fantastic villain that is arrogant, boastful, brash, and theatrics to make you hate him, or depending on your morals love him, and make this very binding villain.

-Pratt does his job well and gives Quill some bite, charm, and a wonderful balance that is fun and still his character, but not overwhelming.

-But Cooper... man does Cooper give one of the best hits for me. Touching, but fun,, deep and yet not overdramatic, and I just loved how well he brought everything to the mix. What a performance.

-It works everything together and gives you such dynamic chemistry that I don't have enough room to keep it going.

The Comedy -It's Guardians, it has to be funny. Again, the mission is accomplished and in a manner that was very balanced for me.

-I said it earlier, but when you put comedy in tune with the story, pacing, and mood, you find me very impressed with it being added as a device.

-Then you bring in the timing that is so well, and you find these ridiculous surprises hitting you at the right moments.

-Add the nearly R rated moments that come into play, and Gunn's attitude with a leash really accomplished a lot in use, necessity, and fun.

-It was all done quite amazing to the point it was nearly perfect for me, and kept me laughing the whole time at the dynamic spread that we got.

The Pace -Was incredible, an entertaining bout of everything at a pace that was balanced and respectful to the story and adventure.

-Fast to keep things moving and getting to the end, yet slow enough to stay on the story and give the buildup and emotion the full effect it needs.

-I loved the depth of it all and not once did I feel bored or the movie too bloated as I was timing the pace of the movie.

The Surprises -The movie has lots of predictable things, but the movie throws in some intergalactic tricks to really keep you on your toes.

-Changes in the plot are some of the biggest lines crossed and surprised, whilst the levels Gunn goes to convey the danger of this man are quite a shocker.

-You'll find that the movie really has some things to mix up the formula and make a Marvel movie feel fun and exciting again.

DISLIKES:

Sometimes A Tad Too much Comedy -It's rare, but this is a comedy central series so you can expect Gunn to cross the lines a few times.

-The idiotic moments are some of the stale moments, while other times it's a running joke that has run too far for my liking.

-Caution to those with younger people who don't want cursing, heavy insults, and some demoralizing moments as they are present in this film.

Some More Graphic Stuff -This movie also is a bit more mature than you might expect and not in the indirect way that they used to do.

-The third installment of the movie does overstep some things and hit a more mature feel that you might not expect. It's violence alone will cause some to turn away, while the graphic nature and design feel like only a censor shy of belonging to HBOMax.

-And some moments with the animal cruelty and darker moments were a bit harder to watch and excessive, but the story component helps blunt that a bit.

A Little More Action Early On -The movie actually works well to build up action and give it some gusto, but I won't lie that I found it again geared towards comedy and not the action fest the trailers promised.

-A little more of the end game's battle, (which was amazing) in a few earlier battles would have perfected this and given me just the right balance in this category.

-Fortunately, there is so much other things that even this is a smaller dislike, though again there are still moments I would have done to help maximize the potential.

The VERDICT: Guardians of the Galaxy was Gunn's love letter to the series and he did it super well for me in showing that comic book movies still have some potential. It took so much pressure and made a diamond, a star amidst most of the modern that was an adventure I was hoping for. It's fun, funny, exciting and just full of the comic book feel I come to the movies for and escaping the madness of the modern day. But that doesn't mean it has lost the real factor that comes with the MCU and that makes for a deeper film that respected the characters built, the stories made, and further dives into them to make such a spectacle. I loved so much of the balance in it and the way they got the Galaxy running again. Sure, it is going to be debatable on the violence, graphicness, and darker tones and there is some fine tuning that could be done. But in the current state of Marvel, it shined for me and is worth a trip to the theater definitely. My scores are:

Action/Adventure/Comedy: 9.0-9.5 Movie Overall: 8.5-9.0.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
958,1.0,6-May-23,"With every flaws that the movie have, the emotional weight that the movie carry, the chemistry, the performance, the action, the characters, the hero, and the villain, all works so well, making it one of the deepest superhero movie i've watch, The High Evolutionary was simply one of the best MCU villain, he is possibly second to Thanos in terms of menacing, not even Kang The Conqueror at least so far, and of course we need to talk about Rocket, James Gunn as not only the man that direct the film but also the man behind the writing's room, he deserve a major credit for the heart and soul his pouring writing basically the whole story but specifically Rocket's backstory, a depressing and sad backstory that simply broke our hearts but it solid and perfect, and really because of that i think everybody will looking at Rocket's character differently from now on, the rest of the crew is still who they are, and though Adam Warlock did have a cool badass scene, i did wish to see him do something more in the film, a little bit too long, but overall Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 was another proof of Gunn's ability to not lose focus on the characters especially in this third movie, something that Taika Waititi has messed on Thor, Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 was another solid installment in the trilogy, second best after the first one and definitely better than Vol. 2, by the way, the movie also almost making me cry 4 times, the fourth being the unexpected twist that are just perfect, it's a true emotional rollercoaster.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
959,1.0,10-May-23,"No pun(s) intended - and one of two things I was thinking of after I watched the movie. The other one will be my closing line on this review. This being the closing chapter (or volume as James Gunn likes to repeatedly tell us), everything is possible, right? So you will be watching this and have certain expectations ... maybe those will be fulfilled - but maybe not. And that is not just about finality - but also about resolving and resolutions.

But let's get back to the beginning - actually we really go to the beginning. The beginning of Rocket - we will see him before he became the character we love now. I assume the story about his ... becoming/being made/born is being told in the comics too. I am quite certain there is a game where the story is being told. And while I knew about it (remembered most of it), it still stayed as emotional as people were saying all the time.

The timeline - the way James Gunn edited the movie, is really fine. You may wonder if there even can be a Guardians movie without him at the helm ... the future will show us. The movie has it all - it plants and it sows. It has the humor you have been expecting it to have - and the characters are true to themselves. There are throwaway characters that get their moment to shine (looking at you carrot face), you have good boys and bad boys (and good boys being called bad boy - well you'll know when you watch the movie) ... and many other things. Oh and we get a lot of cameos - one I almost confused with Stan Lee. They are allowed to use his image now - but it was Lloyd Kaufman. Good for him and Gunn to have him in this. Also Howard the Duck and so many other people/characters, that you probably will spot - especially if you are into the comics.

The movie I expected nothing from grew on me - and if you have no emotions at all after watching this - someone has to check your pulse. Kidding aside, this is a love letter to Science Fiction, to comedy - and it has the very first ""f""-word of the MCU ... one would expect it to come from Samuel L. Jackson .. but we get surprised (not just by this fact) ... and Chris Pratt is the one to utter it. And the great thing is, you may not even notice it - because it is just so fitting - the way it is delivered ... it just rolls of the tongue and the scene warrants it - it would have worked without it ... but I am not complaining they included it.

Visual effects are good - something that many did complain about (rightfully mostly I reckon) in the previous movies. But it is the story that holds this together and makes us fall in love with everyone. Or to quote someone and bring my review to an end: I love you guys - another one you may not entirely notice, but a big moment! I am ... satisfied! To say the least.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
960,9.0,5-May-23,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is the perfect end to this Marvel trilogy. It's an emotional journey, and, for me, a bit of a tearjerker - bring some tissues. I connected strongly with the characters and throughout the movie deeply cared about them. I also love this movie because of the strong messages, astonishing CGI and the ""marvelous"" acting.

This movie switches between Rocket's (Bradley Cooper) backstory and the mission to save Rocket embarked on by Star Lord/Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), Groot (Vin Diesel), Nebula (Karen Gillan), Drax (Dace Bautista), and Mantis' (Pom Klementieff). The new Gamora (Zoe Saldaña) also joins them, but she isn't the same Gamora we knew. Can the Guardians save Rocket and the galaxy in time? Watch to find out! As always, make sure to stay until the end of the credits!

Guardians of the Galaxy is one of my favorite franchises within the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe), and director James Gunn and the actors are the biggest reasons why. Gunn has made these movies unique and distinct from the other Marvel movies. Although it's still funny, this movie resonates emotionally with the audience more than the first two Guardians. You can feel the pain and traumatic experiences of the characters. Star Lord as Chris Pratt is perfect. I've never seen a role as good as this one for Pratt, and for me he will always be Peter Quill. Even though Rocket is completely CGI, Bradley Cooper's voice performance makes me believe he is real. My favorite character is Drax (David Bautista) because he is very sweet and funny, and whenever he's on screen, I enjoy it immensely.

The message of this movie is that friendship and teamwork are the most powerful forces in the galaxy. This movie contains some profanity, violence, and some gross scenes.

I give Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 4 out of 5 stars, and I recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. Marvel and Guardians of the Galaxy fans will definitely enjoy this movie. It comes out in theaters on May 5, 2023. By Katherine S., KIDS FIRST!","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

In certainly one of Marvels best films of the year without a doubt, volume 3 sets out as one of the most emotional, yet still fun and adventurous endings to a trilogy. What was exceptionally well done was the origin of Rocket's well being. Equally the introduction of Warlock was far better then Ant Man.

964,1.0,22-May-23,"This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.

In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.

Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame. It did everything it needed to do and more. I'm hoping this is a sign of things to come for Marvel.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
965,1.0,5-May-23,"I'm not really convinced anyone other than James Gunn could've pulled it the tonal juggling act that Guardians of The Galaxy Vol. 3 turned out to be. I was shocked at how graphic, and in some cases straight up disturbing, this movie turned out to be but I think it works really well.

I liked the fact that Gunn made this a decidedly darker movie than the last 2. It makes the stakes feel more real and makes the more emotional moments hit harder. It's all that while still being hilarious (Dave Bautista is definitely the scene stealer here) and it's just as wholesome as I would want a finale for these characters to be.

It's definitely overstuffed, I liked Will Poulter as Adam Warlock but at the end of the day I just didn't think the character added that much beyond just a random threat the Guardians have to face. There's also an extended flashback subplot that sort of wore out it's welcome for me and I thought The High Evolutionary was just fine as a villain, he started out intriguing but he just devolves into an over the top volatile presence with very little motivation.

We've known for a while this was going to be the last time we see most of the cast and you get that sense from almost the very beginning and I was really happy with where all the characters ended. There's more than a few wholesome and tearjerking moments and it made me really sad this was the last time we'll see most of these character. This film felt like it had real stakes, which I can't say for a lot of MCU movies, and I can't admire James Gunn enough for balancing all the different tones the script presents.

I wouldn't put Guardians 3 on the same level as Endgame, nowhere near really, but it did give me that same feeling of finality and closure that I did walking out of that film for the first time.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
966,9.0,5-Jul-23,,"May 5, 2023 (United States)"
967,1.0,16-May-23,"If there were literally any doubts in my mind as to whether the MCU had inadvertently ended after the events of 2019's box office juggernaut ""Avengers: Endgame"", 2023's latest hit ""Guardians of The Galaxy: Volume 3"" resolutely dispelled the remaining hesitation I may have potentially harboured (in regards to that uncertainty), clearly performing as a beautiful (tonally, far more distinct) final chapter to the cinematic universe in a movie which acts as the narrative equivalent to party-goers sentimentally bidding adieu to each other in a warm, savoury embrace (tearful their time's drawn to an eventual close, yet fond & happy they even had it together in the first place, however fleeting) after one of the best nights of their life; the music perhaps might still be playing afterwards, once they've departed (if those in charge of the speaker system wish to prolong the experience) - but that's what the sound has transformed in to from this point on - not a home for those seeking memories, friendships & family (originally drawing them in like moths to a flame - they've all left) etc. Just noise. Therefore, I'd argue with a fair degree of confidence it's officially over now & those who remain, continue to linger for the sheer sake of it.

I say this because James Gunn's evidently moved on, creatively; here, he carefully gives each & every character within the ensemble as much closure as it's humanly possible to provide within the confines of an increasingly corporate franchise & basically says everything that can theoretically be said. Sure, you could plausibly add to it (& unconvincingly tack on obligatory, increasingly diluted extras)... But why would you - when the story is already rewardingly completed?

As for V3 (in & of itself, not worrying about what it possibly represents within the grand scheme of the production companies' future plans for blockbuster comic book adaptations), I've got to admit I was genuinely shocked (this is not one you should take your kids to see unless you intentionally wish to traumatise them) at the provocative content featured, enhancing the impressiveness of the sci-fi's quality; hauntingly Orwellian, yet poignant - possessing one vital ingredient I've often bemoaned other (Marvel) installments for lacking (heartfelt sincerity) & also, a refreshing, palpable maturity; as Peter, Gamora, Rocket, Drax, Nebula etc. Have grown in their own right, so has the creator of the trilogy developed too as a writer. Ergo, he delves in to truly DARK subject matter & consequently, his progression allows him to intimately explore more meaningful themes of identity & morality, challenging every member of the team personally (seriously, the stakes have never been so personal) until they reach the crux of their destined emotional journeys (satisfyingly paying off established arcs, a decade in the making) - & using the lessons learned from those profound moments to artistically reflect ourselves back at us (the viewers), purposefully reaffirming how our species is ultimately flawed, doomed to chase an abstract concept which is never achievable; perfection - refuting that futile endeavour (despite the acknowledgement many shall never relinquish the fruitless pursuit) & authentically embracing the charm of bizarre quirks (humanity shining like much needed beacons of glimmering bright light, endearingly symbolising hope & optimism against the grim, oppressive bleakness) in one of the best, soulful, most macabre & notably dystopian works of fiction I've seen put to the screen in ages.

Lastly, I'd argue that's an apt description, considering the phenomenally effective utilisation of the bitter-sweet genre, undoubtedly melancholic in nature, but evocative (not too dissimilar to classic works of literature like ""1984"", ""The Hunger Games"", ""Logan's Run"", ""Brave New World"", ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" etc. & I'm paying the highest of compliments, making those comparisons) - constructed to analyse the inspiring perseverance of our unique spirit, surviving against all odds within the inhospitable environment of an erected tyrannical system, hostile to the slightest semblance of unconventionality (here, The High Evolutionary's ominous eugenicist conception of sickening paradise) - is precisely where James Gunn thrives, lovingly celebrating the endearing flaws of the titular unit he's built alongside the talented cast (a renegade assortment of rebellious misfits & underdogs, in a last hurrah), showcasing - once & for all - how the defining traits, previously perceived as weaknesses, are the greatest assets at the team's disposal (attributes responsible for making them who they are; remarkably heroic & special), re-contextualising their personalities & championing their personable faults, poetically responsible for the initial formation of ""The Guardians of The Galaxy"" - gifting the our protagonists with the acceptance & solace they've always desperately sought, fighting for values we adore them for upholding.

Joyous.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
968,1.0,8-May-23,"I had very high expectations for this movie. The reviews that I had heard said it is the best out of the trilogy and the best marvel movie since Endgame. I highly disagree with both opinions. Some of the effects were not nearly as ""realistic"" looking as previous titles and the plot line was sadistic and disturbing. Regardless of the animals in the movie being animatronics and/or CGI, the animal cruelty and torture was extremely hard for me to watch.

The only appreciation I have for the film is it being Rocket's origin story, making it captivating and heart wrenching. You definitely leave loving Rocket more than you did before watching the film.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

970,9.0,4-May-23,"I found it super refreshing compared to the last few pieces that were released by Marvel. It felt like a proper send off to the Guardians of the Galaxy and it included a more deep and emotional level of context behind Rocket's story. It was a good combination of laughing, crying and anticipation of every next scene. James Gunn picks up right where he left off in his past projects and keeps this atmosphere of heartfelt emotions going around, touching on the themes of family, perseverance and friendship. There was not a single dull moment throughout the whole movie and I can't wait to see what the future holds for some of those characters.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
971,8.0,6-May-23,"Out of all the series in the MCU, Guardians of the Galaxy is one of my favorites. I love James Gunn's style and sense of direction. His anarchistic humor and sense of sensitivity for this group of misfits always worked for me. This film balances out the comedy, drama, and action probably the best out of its trilogy. I love how in each installment, these characters really grow and have their own arcs. Nothing really returns to the status quo for these guys and no more is that ever evident then in this movie.

The action is the best it's ever been, aside from one scene that I'll get to later. I love the found family dynamic at play here, even more so now that the gang are all very much familiar with each other. The chemistry is stellar owing in part because of the stellar cast.

I will say though, despite the fact that the villain is an interesting play on the classic mad scientist archetype, he isn't all that interesting. Still one of the MCU's better villains, but that's honestly not saying much. The final battle with him honestly was disappointing to me, though it did give plenty of catharsis for our heroes so it evens out a guess. Well at least the effects departments got really creative with his creations.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a fantastic summer blockbuster! One of the best MCU movies yet! It may not be perfect, but it's a movie that knows what it wants to be. To me you can't get any more perfect than that.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

When did a lack of compassion become trendy? There is a serious #fail of values being exhibited here and it is not something you expect to see in a big budget, global release film. I definitely would not take kids to see it and I certainly would not recommend it to any teens who like animals or care about animals.

The humour hits home.

Lots of action.

Full of sentimental, near tear jerking stuff.

The bits with the animals is really quite harrowing, and probably upsetting for younger viewers.

The story is compelling, if a little flawed (but hey - realism is not a thing here).

The soundtrack is outstanding and sets the scene perfectly many times.

In jokes abound, but its generally all a lot easier on the brain than the general Marvel/Avengers stuff to understand.

If I had a criticism it would be that 2.5 hours is a long time to sit still in a theatre. I can't think of anything that could easily be cut out, but 2.5 hours is too long and even the comfiest of seats start to make things go number after 2 hours.

I think crucially what sets this movie apart from many other Marvel movies is that all the central characters are likeable and though different from each other are all a pleasure to watch, and their interactions with each other can be hilarious.

Because so many people praised it on the Internet, expectations were extremely high. Although not as good as I had hoped, I am pleased. I'm at a loss for words to express my feelings about Marvel, probably because I was so hurt when seeing Avenger 4 and all other movies came out afterwards and it appears that nothing can be said... 10 years is a long time for me, and this series is also important to me because it spans my elementary school years through college; I don't want it to end so quickly.

The trailer had me filled with such anxiety that I was laser focused on the story line and perhaps missed some funny parts. But when they hit, they were perfectly timed. Toward the end of the movie, I realized I was feeling jostled around with ups and downs, visually and emotionally, similar to the ride at Disneyland. This is a great thing! It is solidly entertaining and visually stunning. The violence in it was triggering for me personally. If you are an animal lover or are triggered by aspca commercials, you'll find discomfort here. I'm a wimp but I do appreciate the message it was sending. It has people angry about the horrors treating animals poorly and that's important. At times the violence with all the characters was shocking; with more blood it would have been R, no question. But Gunn walked the line. I think it's too much for younger kids.

James Gunn pulled it off. Without revealing anything, nothing seemed forced and everything felt very natural, the universe was consistent (that was my biggest issue with the last few movies) and I feel like everyone got a well-deserved ending.

On the other side of the coin, not only have there been some really bad content but there's just too much of it since Endgame and it's going to cost them. Empire comes to an end regardless but Disney is speeding up the process.

Having said all that, Guardians was finally a movie going back to what made the MCU so good for a decade. This movie is fantastic in its own right because it's tough to beat the first or second. I'm going to miss Gunn because he really grasped how to run a franchise and he's proof of what works. This installment had its action and humor but it felt a little more darker with Rocket's backstory.

While I don't appreciate too much humour in MCU films, the jokes here worked in most aspects. And on the other hand, Gunn focussed on giving us a darker story that is also fun-filled at the same time.

Chukwudi Iwuji and Will Poulter nailed their respective roles in their MCU debut and the galaxy has been saved once again by these lovely characters that James Gunn brought to life on the big screen with an incredible cast and and powerful storylines.

The animal cruelty is not that much, considering they show it in a thoughtful way.

The movie also takes out Rocket's tragic childhood from a jar and puts it in front of us.

To be honest, Rocket is the star of the show this time.

The villains are handled VERY well, they really show their TRUE nature, like High Evolutionary destroying a whole planet, just because it's not perfect and Adam Warlock changing himself because of Groot.

The addition of Gamora returning but not the same as the previous one, makes us feel like what Quill does.

James Gunn a name that will become even more known after going to produce basically all of DC new movies, just did everything nearly perfect! First of all the soundtrack.

A clip 3 hours long with a cartoon villian who's ""evil because he's evil"" and a lot of new toys. Most of the characters were stripped off understandable inner conflicts and have no development whatsoever. I can't get rid of a feeling that while the first two movies were made for adult audiences this third one can't decide if it is another Disney's cartoonish cash grab or actually the third chapter of somewhat hooligan comedy (for Marvel the Guardians were always a bit less PC than the other superheros).

User Rephrase and correct the grammar, Indeed this is one of the best Marvel movies after a long time. I was thinking that Marvel has lost its creativity but I was wrong. I watched it in 3D no doubt it was worth it. I like how they crave stories around Rocket. It has action and emotion. Gamora no longer remembers Quill more interesting, again we got a new love story. This movie reflects the life of Rocket how he transforms and shows the pain of these creatures. It is just like the painful emotional arrow on the heart. Which shows the dark side of experiments. It's relevant in real life also how they conduct experiments on these speechless creatures. Overall this is my first review so I cannot say much just go and feel, you will love it.

ChatGPT This is indeed one of the best Marvel movies in a long time. I used to think that Marvel had lost its creativity, but I was proven wrong after watching it in 3D.

It was interesting to see how Gamora no longer remembers Quill, leading to a new love story. This movie accurately portrays Rocket's life transformation and the pain experienced by such creatures.

1009,9.0,24-May-23,"The way that this film handles Rocket's character is very touching and mostly well done. However, aside from that and a handful of other character moments, this film is a string of contrivances and conveniences.

One of the largest plot problems is the sidelining of Mantis' powers. There are quite a few roadblocks in this film that the Guardians have to scramble to overcome, which could have been entirely avoided had Mantis used her powers.

Much of the antagonists' failures are due to their own lack of foresight or lack of muscle, despite both enemy factions having essentially limitless recourses and competence at their disposal.

The plot is strung along via convenience and contrivance, where the Guardians either luck out entirely or the situations are simply shoehorned together.

Gamorrah's behavior and introduction into the film feel especially contrived considering what we know of her characterization from pre-2014 Guardians and rolling into that film, where she was arguably the most altruistic of the group.

The humor works in some places, but it suffers from an extreme over-reliance on ""Drax dumb"" based jokes, which were already wearing thin by Infinity War.

Perhaps the most frustrating part of this film was the use of humor to interrupt serious moments of peril or drama. The first two films balanced humor with drama much better. Due to the driving motive for the Guardians being so desperate and personal in this outing, the humor more often than not feels wholly out of place.

There are numerous other issues characterization and world building.

On a subjective level, the camera work was often distracting. There is a large amount of close up shots, sometimes coming in before any establishing shots, which makes much of the first act feel claustrophobic in a bad way. There is also what feels like random use of slow motion at times. There was also a lot of spinning. A distracting amount of spinning.

The sense of space generally felt off due to editing and shot compositions, as well as a large reliance on large scope computer generated rooms or environments enveloping the characters. This was a shock since Gunn's other works tend to be very cohesive and pleasant to watch.

The score was forgettable, not sure I remember any of it, aside from the one time the Guardians' theme was used.

Aside from some poignant exceptions, the soundtrack felt more obligatory than like the film needed ALL of the twenty something songs which play at every other scene. A far cry from their careful use in the first film.

The performances were all stellar, especially the villain and Rocket.

This film had a great core story to tell, but it got bungled. I am very saddened by this, as the Guardians had been mostly sublime to this point.

Third best Marvel project since Infinity War, just behind the Spider-Man films.

I was on the verge of tears from sadness, and the movie actually brought me the tears with its laugh out loud funny comedy at times. I will really miss this group of ragtag heroes, especially Batista as Drax the Destroyer. I really don't want to say too much more about the movie other than that you will laugh, you will most likely cry, and you will have such a blast. The villain is possibly the most evil villain I have ever seen in a marvel movie, he has no remorse, no morals it seems, and has a god complex. Everybody acts their hearts out and plays their characters to perfection. I hope there will be some Guardians of the Galaxy spin-offs.

The introduction of Adam warlock feels a bit strange considering vision was kind of like who he was supposed to be. That's really the only thing that felt off, but the casting was great and the character was pretty cool and has some standout moments. There are some cute moments with some of the side characters and creatures, and I really had fun with this movie, so did my family. Take this review for what you will, I just can't expend the energy explaining how much I enjoyed the movie, but take my word for it, it's great! It's the best movie in this phase 4 of the MCU thus far.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
1013,8.0,20-May-23,"As the last film of the Guardians trilogy GotG3 is the farewell that the team of crazy and equally loveable super heroes deserves. Zoe Saldana and Dave Bautista stated they are done with the MCU now, so the movie is also a farewell to them, especially Bautistas Drax is at his best in the trilogy. Even more prominently is the departure of director James Gunn from Marvel. If this were sports, his transfer to DC would be called a blockbuster deal because he is responsible for much of the best super hero content recently: The suicide squad, Peacemaker and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, that is an impressive track record in a struggling genre.

And GotG3 really is a very good movie, imo the best MCU-entry post Endgame. The Guardians always were the funny movies and unlike so many other Marvel movies that really struggle due to the need of shoving a quippy remark in every line, it works for the Guardians. Granted there are still one or two moments I wish would have been played out longer before the comic relief but overall that is not a huge deal. And the movie manages to combine good comedy with surprising darkness and emotionality. There is certainly no lack of that especially in Rocket's back story, which plays a significant role and is so well done. Despite being predictable at times it really got me. It says a lot about the MCU that the movie with the music-addict, the walking tree and the talking racoon is the one that finally works on the emotional level again. The characters are handled very well and get nice developments. I already mentioned Drax and Rocket who is really the heart of the movie but it is also true for the others, Groot and Mantis especially. Star-Lord almost feels like playing second fiddle after being the focus of the previous movies but he and most others still end up making a journey we did not know we wanted but needed.

On the villain side we have Adam Warlock who feels a bit tacked on tbh. His introduction is very strong but after that it at times seems like he is only in it because they teased him in GotG2. It does not really bother me but he is not the movie's strong suit either especially when compared to the other villain. Because the high evolutionary is amazing. His utopian motivation is not revolutionary for a movie-villain but that doesn't make it bad. He is so despicable, has just the right amount of power and is beautifully played by Chukwudi Iwuji. Kick the dog is a classic writing advice and means to let the villain do something that will immediately make everyone in the audience dislike him and this technique works here, you just hate this guy, without it turning completely ridiculous and unreasonable. The best MCU villain since Thanos.

Aside from that the CGI looks good and the soundtrack once again is a big strength of the Guardians movies. The story is not particularly intricate, McGuffin quests play a significant role but they set the ground for the interactions between and development of the characters, which works and mostly carries the movie. The length is not a problem, I am fully on board with seeing those flawed but loveable characters interact for 150 minutes, it never felt stretched for me. The film largely stands on its own and is not occupied with setting up dozens of storylines for the MCU at large, which helps the individual movie a lot. Lastly I want to say that the movie is helped by the fact that it is the last of the trilogy, so the characters could die, making several scenes a lot more tense.

Overall a really strong movie that serves as a reminder of better MCU-times. The question is whether it signals a return to strength for Marvel or whether it will prove to be a final and wonderful goodbye for the MCUs golden era.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
1014,9.0,19-Jun-23,"At their base of Knowhere, the Guardians of the Galaxy consisting of Peter Qull/Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Drax (Dave Bautista), Nebula (Karen Gillan), Peter's half-sister Mantis (Pom Klementieff), Groot (Vin Diesel) and Rocket (Bradley Cooper) continue their operations as ragtag adventurers and defenders as Peter still struggles with depression and alcoholism as he struggles to accept the Gamora (Zoe Saldana) loved is gone while the one who exists is an entirely different person who no longer loves him. When artificial being Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) attacks nowhere and sets his sights on Rocket, the Guardians barely manage to hold him off but in the end win but not before Rocket suffers heavy injuries. In their attempt to revive Rocket they discover a killswitch has been installed along with all the augmentations that have been done to him, and in order to save Rocket they must find an override key for the Killswitch which leads the group through Rocket's tortured past at the hands of the cruel High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji) who seeks to create the ""perfect"" being through horrific experiments.

The Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is the long awaited and in development third entry in the James Gunn helmed series of MCU films. It's certainly been a long road to this follow-up as its been 10 years since the last Standalone Guardians film even though the Guardians themselves have been continually present in the MCU (for better or worse). There was even doubt that the third entry would even be made as Gunn found himself fired by Disney due to commentators circulating old twitter jokes from Gunn's timeline on Twitter which prompted a visceral reaction from fans and creatives in the industry and lead to Gun being hired by Warner Bros. For The Suicide Squad and Disney to humble themselves and ask Gunn to come back for what will be his final step in the MCU as he takes control of Warner Bros.' DCEU (good luck with that, you're gonna need it). While I still maintain my favorite entry in the series is the second one, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 scores the same genuine heart and soul we saw in the prior entries, even if it is burdened by some plot cleanup of MCU plot points.

Much like prior entries, the soundtrack does a great job of setting the mood and tone for the story, but in this case in a decidedly different way. Unlike Vol. 1 or 2 where they were more upbeat songs set to action beats, Vol.3 opens with a haunting acoustic cover of Creep by Radiohead as we follow Rocket who is the primary focus this time around with Peter Quill more of a supporting element this time around. While Rocket's tortured past had been hinted at in the prior installments, this is where those little hints come full circle as we dive deep into Rocket's backstory and dive into the lingering trauma that has haunted Rocket but he's hidden behind a cynical and snarky demeanor. There's been some energized discussion over the ""experiment"" scenes in the film and while they aren't as explicitly shown as certain other films that cover this material, the flashbacks detailing Rocket's story and the makeshift family he had with other experiments like himself is low key disturbing in its implications especially in how most of the worst parts are implied or off screen with a particularly haunting moment where Rocket's first word is revealed to be ""hurts"". The scenes in these flashbacks work twofold because not only does it give massive insight to Rocket's character and play for heartbreaking tragedy, but it also gives us a fantastically despicable villain in Chukwudi Iwuji's High Evolutionary. The High Evolutionary is probably the best villain we've seen in this series eclipsing the still very impressive Kurt Russell portrayed Ego, but where Ego you could see had some level of affinity for Peter (even if it was revealed to be narcissistic in nature with horrifying undertones) there is no such pretense of that here as the High Evolutionary shows himself to be a twisted and casually cruel with no empathy, remorse, or shame as he mutilates and exterminates living things in search of the nebulously defined ""perfection"" that he seeks to find. His relationship with Rocket is beautifully done the High Evolutionary considers Rocket a failed experiment, and yet it was one the managed to outsmart him and became a source of obsession for the High Evolutionary because he can't get around the fact that something he created was able to best him and it really makes you want to see his downfall as a villain.

Of course Rocket's story is only part of the film with the secondary plot covering Peter Quill overcoming his depression and alcoholism as he's still reeling from the loss of Gamora during Infinity War. This is where I feel Gunn was given a bit of a ""when life gives you lemons situation"" because prior to Infinity War the Guardians movies were relatively self-contained in the MCU and when time came to bring Thanos center stage the Guardians were moved more towards the center for event films and cameos where you could tell they weren't written by Gunn and we got several factors like Peter dooming the universe or Gamora's death and her coming back as a hardened version of herself who was barely away from Thanos and effectively made the character as we knew her no longer exist. Here and to a lesser extent the Christmas special, it feels like Gunn is trying to pull away from the MCU a little bit and bring these characters back to where they were and this even comes down to the fact there's no mention of their very brief association with Thor (the less said about that the better). While Gunn does use the pieces he's been given quite well in terms of where Peter and Gamora now stand with Peter still loving someone who no longer exists and Gamora now considerably hardened with little idea who Peter is and even less desire to care, this is one of those elements that is weighted down by the fact Gamora is now so heavily tied in with major events in the MCU that it hampers the standalone appeal to a degree. But in spite of this (and the requisite MCU threads and teases) Gunn does a good job coalescing all these elements into a story about trauma and overcoming it and there is a solid note of finality established so we and Gunn feel like we're saying goodbye to these characters. While I sincerely doubt this is the last we'll see of the Guardians, this is for all intents and purposes the final chapter on Gunn's Guardians.

While Vol.3 isn't the best of the series due to its weighty ties to MCU lore, it's a solid culmination of everything we've been through with the Guardians and a harrowing story with a strong emotional core and a truly despicable villain. There's also a solid feeling of saying goodbye to these characters and it'll be a satisfying sendoff for those who've followed this crew.

Note: While the animal abuse isn't massively explicit in terms of what is shown, it is heavily implied. In terms of severity: Think less Bambi and more Plague Dogs or Watership Down.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
1015,9.0,2-Jun-23,"Wow. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 came at the perfect time. Just when I, and many others, had lost faith in the MCU, James Gunn and his merry band of misfits come back to remind us why so many of us fell in love with the franchise in the first place.

It's the characters, stupid. The Guardians of the Galaxy feel like the most fleshed out, genuine, complicated super hero team in existence; the interpersonal relations between the members, their personal struggles, quirks, perspectives and so on are so well developed, I can imagine fan fiction for these people for years to come. In contrast, even with comparatively good Marvel films of late (like Black Panther or Dr. Strange) I can't genuinely tell you anything about most of the characters in those films. Not with the Guardians.

Every character gets amazing moments and I felt, goes in a sensible direction. I can easily write and essay on each one of them, what motivates them, why they act the way they do, what they mean to the team; it's not a flex on my part, it's the quality of the writing and performances.

Speaking of which, there are some truly great ones here and from places I didn't expect. Chukwudi Iwuji as the High Evolutionary was FANTASTIC. I love that we didn't get a sympathetic villain or one the film insists we ""understand."" No, he's just maniacally evil and selfish, and it's nice when a movie gives you a villain who seems powerful and you really want to see get defeated.

This movie reminds you why Chris Pratt is a beloved movie star; he exudes the confidence and swagger of action heroes from the past, which was refreshing. Dave Bautista and Pom Klementieff's Drax and Mantis continue with their incredible chemistry and of course, as a result of excellent make up and costuming, literally disappear into their characters. Karen Gillan's accent was a bit wonky to start, but I felt she gave a truly fantastic performance with this one. Nebula is such a cool and lovable character. Bradley Cooper gets very emotional as Rocket in this one (whom the film basically centres around) and I'm happy he did such an amazing job. Even Zoe Saldana's return as Gomorrah (which I didn't really like the idea of initially, since it continues the trend of death meaning nothing in the MCU), was handled brilliantly. I loved her performance and what they ultimately did with her character vis a vis the team and Peter Quill in particular.

In terms of action, GOTG 3 is surprisingly sparse with it and despite the long 2 1/2 hr run time, it didn't really bother me. The film is so well paced, there's so much going on, that I barely noticed. But when the action scenes happen, oh man, are they incredible. There's one extended fight sequence towards the end that was honestly the best I've seen from the MCU in a long time and so freakin fun and well shot. Another point; this movie doesn't feel like a Disney film, unlike so many other MCU instalments. There's blood, there's death. This movie gets really dark and violent at times and it adds to the stakes.

But the best thing about this movie is how delightfully weird and off kilter it is. This movie gives us an organic space ship, golden super powered people, a counter Earth with anthropomorphized animals, weird seedy animal experimentation, a telekinetic Russian space dog...you get the feeling watching this movie that Gunn had a lot of creative control and wasn't afraid to just go weird with it.

If I had any issues, I'd say the editing is a little bizarre at times and there's one scene towards the end that just felt jarring and poorly cut, but it's a minor issue throughout the whole movie. I also loved Will Poulter as Adam Warlock, and what they did with the character (making him an uber powerful, lovable doofus), but I wished he had more screen time and bigger role in the plot.

Aside from that, I could keep gushing about this movie. From the music to the set design to the incredibly dark, emotional flashbacks that had more than a few fully grown people tearing up in my cinema to the beautiful theme of broken people finding salvation with kindness and love, this is just an excellent movie. So long Guardians, it's be great.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

The story line was ok but still not enough for me to give this movie a higher rating.

Normally, I would tell people to wait for the movie to be shown on Disney+ or Netflix or wherever if I think the movie is not worth watching in theaters.

GOTG3 brought back all the things that made it a game changer for the MCU. Music, actually good humor that isn't forced, and lots of color. The story was mostly good but the villain left something to be desired. Unlike Thanos, this villain's antics and motivators were weakly supported.

The runtime of 150 minutes was a bit long top, but hey we got to see the backstory of Rocket, and damn that was emotional on many occasions.

The finale of one of the most loved group of funny, misfit heroes in Marvel Universe bids a perfect farewell to it's audience and James Gunn left no stone unturned to make sure that Vol 3 was full of action, comedy and humour. Gunn has built up all kinds of profound interpersonal connections between this sizable ensemble over three movies, and in Vol. 3, he delights in indulging them, digging into all of the ways of this family making a farewell not only for the audience but also for its characters.

And also they don't use that nanotech bullcr**p that Marvel always uses for the past couple of century, and they're the one that started it. I definitely think that that is a conscious decision by James Gunn from listening to the fan on what doesn't work and what does.

Another thing that I hate is that apparently this movie is a continuation of the Christmas special, I didn't watch it so I was kinda left behind for the first few minutes, but then after that I just learn to accept it without asking too many questions.

The animation and action scenes were really nicely done. Ok, I will say this, there is a one shot scene which makes it better. Every character is clearly portrayed.

I questioned my status as a GotG fan and asked myself several times why I have to go through this ""movie"". Come on. Nothing made even slightly sense and the characters get weirder and worse. It just felt like a Disney movie the whole time but like a Disney movie where Walt Disney smoked crack and got blackout drunk before he wrote the script. It was even worse than Multiverse of Madness and Thor Love & Thunder and I thought thats's impossible.

1026,9.0,23-Jun-23,"Most definitely one of the top 10 saddest movies EVER (if you're into Marvel and and Guardians of the Galaxy)!! My caption isn't a spoiler since most Marvel cap out at 3, but it's upsetting nonetheless.

I love how Rocket is the main focus but because of the antics the guardians get up to, it's forgettable, and yet it's still carried on throughout the entire movie, even after certain events take place.

The end was absolutely devastating. I can say with confidence this movie is predictable and absolutely not all at once. I think a big factor of the sadness this movie gives me is knowing that it's the end. Not the end of the guardians, but the end of an era of the guardians of the Galaxy.

No, they're not gone, and we will surely see them in our movies, as it always is with Marvel movies. That said, it is still absolutely abhorrently sorrowful and I still feel like crying a day later.

100% recommend, but it's not all goofs like the rest of the movies. I saw a lot of people complaining about the fact that it's not funny, but what's funny is the fact that it wasn't meant to be. This movie touched on some of the deeper, edgier, and overall more depressing topics; and I think that's what this series so to speak needed. This movie saved marvel, 2023.

Dave Bautista ( Drax) he played excellent, especially as a dad !

Peter as always good very charismatic funny and excellent play.

Nebula was excellent you can understand how much she needed a family and how much she was fit for a family

The story is well written and well paced and is overflowing with humour, heart and emotions. The characters are well written and have great arcs. Rocket was the shining star. Bradley Cooper did a great job and his arc is one of the best in the MCU.

The action sequences are mostly well choreographed though much of the work was put into the story and the characters which is a great thing tbh.

Also the movie is visually stunning with bright and bold color choices and the CGI is much better than a lot of the recent Marvel releases.

A sensorial overload of colour, space tecnology, crazy fighting sequences and mind-boggling set pieces. A visual wonder of course and perhaps the most pleasing movie to watch out of the trilogy.

If there's someone who knows what their doing it is James Gunn. It's a shame that the big Marvel corporate is losing one of its brightest minds. To take a bunch of crazy, stupid and fun dark horses and turn them into the face of one of the biggest franchises on earth it's truly a remarkable achievement. I only see a big light in front of James Gunn career.

You can argue that it drags for a bit, that it takes a lot of paths that the previous movies did and that some characters might feel a little left behind, but I find it really hard for you to not give credit to this man for making movies that feel so personal and detached from the formulaic crap that we've been recieving for quite some years now. The guardians have their great emotional farewell and nobody feels like it's just another side character.

And yes, maybe the real message behind all of this crazy space trilogy is that what matters at the end of the day is that you have your friends around you and that you respect the animals, but what's the matter with that really?

But of all the things this movie did well, the most significant to me was the pure emotion, the depth of feeling. It has been some time since I have seen a movie of any genre so accurately tap into and display the range of human emotion that this did. The pain, the relief, the loss, the exuberant joy - all portrayed so well I could not help but feel it too. This movie entertained me, yes. But it made me feel human.

The premise without much complexity is common to hero movies, including good hero movies, as were volumes 1 and 2 of this series, and as is this Volume 3. The trilogy, since its inception, has highlighted the right mix between action and comedy, with a thin dose of drama to not make a fantasy involving a talking raccoon too silly. It was working very well. But the frustration with the hero movies of recent years - mainly the result of too many releases and little creativity in scripts underestimating the intelligence and patience of the public - ended up causing apprehension about Guardians 3. In the end, the action scenes seem more of the same - not many, to a remarkable extent. Negative points are also the initial 30min a little dragged and a poorly worked transformation that the ""new"" Gamora goes through. All this, however, becomes less important in the face of the best of the film, which comes from the unexpected: Rocket's touching origin, the foundation of the plot. Yes, it's the exciting scenes in the story of a raccoon that make Guardians 3 more than a good action movie: in addition to the already expected good comic footprint, there's a great drama, which gave a surprisingly positive density to this farewell... although the post-credits scenes may suggest what they suggest.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

We all know james gunn always trying something new whether it's a character or it's relatable to the story. But this time he had chose the back story of rocket which is just way beyond hard hitting.

We all left a bit traumatized, to be honest.

Also, Gamora's storyline was kind of pointless. The scenes she was in just ended up being a frustrating waste of time.

This is the third and final installment of the Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy, written and directed by James Gunn, and it is a spectacular conclusion to the story of the lovable misfits who save the galaxy.

The film picks up after the events of Avengers: Endgame and Thor: Love and Thunder, with the Guardians still coping with the loss of Gamora and trying to find their place in a post-Thanos universe. They are also faced with a new threat: Adam Warlock, a powerful being created by the Sovereign to destroy them. Meanwhile, Rocket's past comes back to haunt him when he learns that he is not the only one of his kind, and that his creator, the High Evolutionary, has sinister plans for him and his fellow experiments.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a thrilling, hilarious, emotional, and satisfying film that delivers on all fronts. The action sequences are stunning and inventive, the humor is sharp and witty, the characters are well-developed and relatable, and the themes are resonant and meaningful. The film also pays homage to the previous films in the series and ties up all the loose ends in a satisfying way. The cast is phenomenal, with Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Karen Gillan, Pom Klementieff, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, Will Poulter, Sean Gunn, Chukwudi Iwuji, Linda Cardellini, Nathan Fillion, and Sylvester Stallone all giving memorable performances. The film also features some surprising cameos and references that will delight fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a must-see film for anyone who loves sci-fi, comedy, adventure, or just good cinema. It is one of the best films of 2023 and one of the best films in the MCU. It is a fitting farewell to the Guardians of the Galaxy and a testament to James Gunn's vision and talent. I highly recommend it to everyone who wants to have a blast at the movies.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

Definitely not what I was expecting at all, and in a good way! Marvel movies get repetitive and kinda boring, but this movie was something so unexpected and so enjoyable. It has some really heartbreaking scenes and an overall sad theme but I love how it all comes together in the end. The sound track was awesome, thoroughly enjoyed it. Not sure if there will be a fourth one with this ending, but I'm always down to watch the Guardians of the Galaxy! Hoping that Gamora will join the Guardians again!","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

Actually we saw both sides of story. Inside the GOTG and how important and hard was the problem, at some moments it was really stressful combined with emotional witch is rare but essential.

This movie proved that the third sequel can be the best one.

Actors played excellent and dialogues were meaningful performed in right times.

1042,9.0,7-May-23,"I am so glad James Gunn was given the chance to make the GOTG trilogy because he made me love the guardians when I first thought it was ""stupid"" of Marvel to make a movie involving a talking raccoon and tree. My 14 year old self thought it had no shot at being successful. I was wrong.

Guardians of The Galaxy 3 is a beautiful and perfect ending to the trilogy. Each and every character has their arc completed in an amazing way. The film is truly unique and surprising pretty dark at times, something Marvel rarely does. The CGI is great and a joy to watch. Watching in IMAX was great and I want to see it again to experience it all over.

This is one of Marvel's best films and definitely has its own vibe and differs itself from all the other marvel movies, even the other Guardian movies. It's dark and sad at times but still finds perfect moments to input that comedy we all know and love from the GOTG.

Take notes Marvel.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

Easily this film is darkest and most discombobulated story in the franchise. There were so many times that I wanted to walk out but I didn't because of how much money we had spent to go to this garbage film.

There's only two things I would change about the movie but neither of them are worth changing, only reason it's not a perfect 10 for me, definitely a 9.8/10. One is where a certain pg-13 line goes in the film and I feel like it would've been funnier elsewhere! The other is the lack of a certain character's presence in the film but that's the point of the whole movie lol.

Go see it if you haven't. It's leagues away from the last phase of the MCU in the best way possible, proving that people aren't experiencing superhero fatigue - Marvel-Disney have just been force feeding us crappy films for the sake of it.

The soundtrack is top tier, second only to Guardians 1.

1045,1.0,3-Jun-23,"Guardians of the Galaxy 3 is a film that is the conclusion of one of the most vivid and memorable Marvel franchises. Director James Gunn not only retains his recognizable own style, which we love, but also reveals new facets of the world that he created back in 2014, showing the world his first creation for Marvel.

In the film, we see how Peter Quill and his team face new challenges and obstacles that force them to rethink their relationship with each other. If the last two parts of the franchise focused mainly on the team leader Peter, then the third story perfectly shows the arc of the formation of the Rocket. The character has become the soul of this film, constant flashbacks reveal the Rocket to the viewer from a new side. Gunn tells us after the fact why we know the hero the way he is. And it turns out that the Rocket has a rich and difficult past. The director's skillful moves make us rethink this character, empathize with him in a completely different way, understand why he became the person we saw him in the first two pictures of the series. It is perfectly clear that for the creators and Gunn in particular, the raccoon is not just part of a heroic team. Rocket is one of the key heroes for all of them, about whose difficult fate the guys wanted to tell so much. Scenes from the past are imbued with sincerity and beauty, sadness and warmth. The rocket is the decoration of the third film, the central character. However, this does not mean that the rest of the characters are ignored. The creators are ready to tell about them, completing the arches of each hero properly. We see how they prioritize and choose their paths, and the viewer is full of understanding that we will never forget these heroes and their adventures.

The picture is full of storylines, sometimes it seems that a couple of them does not make sense at all. In my opinion, the appearance of Adam Warlock here is not particularly conditioned by anything. The character was little revealed, in the plot I would not say that he played an important role. I liked the villain the Supreme Evolutionist performed by Chukudi Iwuji. The Guards' opponent turned out to be strong and motivated. He was much better suited for the plot and was more convincing than the recently available Kang from Ant-Man 3.

And of course, ""Guardians of the Galaxy 3"" would not be the Guardians that the viewer loves and waits for without outstanding action on the screen. The picture, as always with James Gunn, is rich, bright, sometimes funny, and sometimes sad. But it's still the same recognizable Gunn at the helm of the ship, which for the last time for Marvel demonstrates its full potential, sending viewers on an unprecedented adventure across the Galaxy.

The actors are on top again. Chris Pratt, Karen Gillan, Pom Klementieff, Dave Batista, Zoe Saldana, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, Sean Gunn - thank you for your work.

Guardians of the Galaxy 3 is a movie that cannot be missed. This is a bright, memorable and touching film. The picture not only completes one of the most interesting Marvel franchises, but also shows how important it is to preserve your style and uniqueness in cinema. And the heroes will forever remain in our hearts, memorable, unique and so beloved.

1046,9.0,3-Jun-23,"The entire movie is the example of perfection. From the start to the end evry scene is full of emotion, be it happiness, sadness, or a wholesome moment. I had tears in my eyes throughout the movie, i had a smile on my face and i was cheering every 10 secs. This marvelous piece of motion picture is one of the bestest marvel has ever produced, this is how you end a trilogy, a movie filled with emotions. Every second had a meaning of its own, no moment is present except that it contributes to the greatness of this mindblowing work.

The action sequences have a significance of their own, the camera work, the action choreography, the scene itself and the acting all top teir.

The story makes sense, every event makes sense, all the chafacters make sense, the charcter devolopement is great, the ending is meaningful. Thats 10/10 writing adn directing for ya.

This movie is the example of top tier marvel and a proof that marvel is still alive, the movies and their writing just need a bit of thought and you end up with a masterpiece like this.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
1047,9.0,8-May-23,"The story plays out following the events of the previous GOTG movie appearances where Peter Quill now continues to wallow in pity following the loss of Gamora. He only shakes away from this to take on a mission to save his friend Rocket following a near fatal attack from a newcomer looking to abduct Rocket.

This is a well acted visually incredible movie with brilliant action, set pieces, hits both many humorous and emotional notes over and over again but somehow falls a little flat.

I did enjoy this movie very much but I think the premise of the story just did not sit quite right (with previous knowledge of the MCU). In this movie we are shown (through flashbacks) that Rocket is a creature of immense intellect and intellect that goes beyond genius (almost a superpower), which maybe I'm wrong but I do not remember being a thing in any of the previous movies. Intelligent, capable, street smart, wise cracking yes, but genius, not sure. But it's this premise that the entire story sits upon.

Likewise in this movie we are introduced to the Warlock who feels superfluous to the story and most probably has only been shoehorned in for future instalments or alternative MCU movies.

Whilst the movie feels more 'epic' than volumes 1 and 2 it is not as good and does not have a soundtrack anywhere near as good. It's definitely one of the better post Thanos MCU offerings and probably sits just in the upper half of all the MCU but I don't think it's one of the hits.

In summary it's a good entry to the MCU and a solid 3rd outing for GOTG but isn't one of the greats.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
1048,1.0,13-Jun-23,"Rating: 8.0 Overall, a good end to the trilogy that has become a staple in the MCU as James Gunn uses tone/writing/visual effects to build off his previous comedic movies while also creating what might be the saddest/most touching Marvel movie (mainly through the backstory/writing of Rocket), but the movie does fall under the trap many Marvel movies follow as it is a bit too restricted by the predictable MCU boilerplate to be more profound that it is capable of being.

Very Good Direction (This movie really shows how comfortable Gunn is at guiding ensemble casts through super hero epics as he pulls from experience to drive the story forward; Gunn also really shows his ability to tell a heartbreaking story by weaving past elements to fuel the present), Pretty Good to Good Acting (Good from Chris Pratt (Really builds off his experience as the leader of the group as he has his signature charm while showcasing more of his dramatic chops), Pretty Good to Good from Zoe Saldana (Her character is more restricted/rigged this time so she can't really show too much emotion, but she does a good job with what she was given), Pretty Good to Good from Dave Bautista, Pretty Good to Good from Karen Gillan, Good from Pom Klementieff, Good from Vin Diesel, Great from Bradley Cooper (Really shows a range of emotions through this vocal performance and displays why he is the real protagonist of the movie), Pretty Good from Sean Gunn, Decent to Pretty Good from Chukwudi Iwuji (His performance was a bit too over-the-top for me but he definitely shows some good moments (its just he went from 0 to 100 way too often); I also think his character was pretty shallowly written as his backstory/motive is not really addressed that well), Decent to Pretty Good from Will Poulter (He was fine with the role he was given, its just I do not think his character was written that well), Good from Sylvester Stallone (That's because he's Sly Stallone, the man), Pretty Good from the rest of the cast), Good Story (Does a great job at concluding the trilogy by closing up the lose-ends of many of the characters; the overall plot was well written and entertaining to watch (though it could have been cut just a little bit); the Rocket backstory was incredibly touching and really showed the trauma Rocket had to go through throughout his whole life (even though it could be argued it is a bit simple and relies on the cute animal trope (something I am able to move past given how moving it is)); the character writing for the villains was not the best because it really does not go into their backstory (so it makes it harder to believe their plight); the movie still does follow a lot of the same marvel trope that hold it back a bit), Good Screenplay (The dialog feels very similar to other movies in the trilogy as it is witty, funny, and touching; the symbolism of the movie is incredibly profound as it really looks into the effects friendships and family have on people (especially with how rigid Rocket is to opening up, the importance of family for Quill, and why Quill is trying to get Gamora back); the foreshadowing was kind a setback in the movie as it is just pretty predictable overall in how safe they go about the movie (I would have liked it to be a bit more depressing/dark to be more profound); still has very Marvel elements to the screenplay that restrict if from going above and beyond), Good Score/Very Good Soundtrack (while there wasn't a consistent theme as in the other movies, I still liked the song selection (like Creep and Dog Days Are Over)), Very Good Cinematography (Really enjoyed the 360/wide-angle style cinematography in the fight scenes (especially the hallway scene)), Very Good Sound, Very Good Editing, Great Visual Effects (Used CGI very well to help tell the story and make the fights entertaining), Good Production Design, Very Good Makeup, Very Good Costumes, Plot Structure was good for the most part as all the major points were laid out nicely (but there was a bit too much plot that was not that necessary (like 10-15 minutes could have been cut)); the narrative style of weaving between the past and the present was well done as it helped make Rocket a more multidimensional character, Pacing was good for the most part as it stayed a steady pace for most of the movie up until the end (the ending felt incredibly rushed at how abrupt it was (which kinda hurt considering it was meant to wrap up all the storylines for the Guardians)), Climax was entertaining and fun to watch but still showed many signs of following the Marvel formula (though there was some James Gunn touches on it that made it feel somewhat unique), Tone was established very well throughout the movie as it blends the sadder/dramatic parts very well with the more traditional lighthearted/funny moments to show how this installment continues where the previous installments left off while still being unique in its own-right; there still was some signs of it following the Marvel tone, The movie does a good job in helping provide more context to some of the the characters in the previous films (like Rocket) as the backstory presented shows why some of the characters acted in the way they did in the first two installments; this by far was the saddest MCU movie (mainly because of the character writing/backstory of Rocket)","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

1056,9.0,27-May-23,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3, and to some extent the whole trilogy, shows what a Marvel movie can be when it's allowed to be it's own thing and not beholden to furthering other projects. It has its flaws but the focus on character and satisfying resolutions make this one of the MCU's best efforts in years. In fact, one of its best ever.

The film begins with an attack on The Guardians by Adam Warlock, teased at the end of volume 2 and played brilliantly by Will Poulter as a gold dusted himbo, leading to Rocket being critically injured. This leaves the rest of the team in a race against time to track down a cure and brings them into conflict with the racoon's creator, The High Evolutionary.

They say that if you want the audience to hate a character just show the character kicking a puppy. By that metric The High Evolutionary will go down as one of the most despised villians in cinematic history. He's a full on animal abuser who's frustrations with life's imperfections give him no regard for the suffering of others and have him creating and genociding entire species on a whim. Played with an air of Shakesperian grandeur by Chukwudi Iwuji, The High Evolutionary makes a case for being the MCU's best villian to date.

Pretty much all the cast get time to shine and develope. Quill and the new (or is it old since she came form the past?) Gamora re develope their relationship but maybe not in the way you would expect, the change in Nebula over the course of three films is visable and believable, returning the favour from Volume 2 Mantis helps the others see Drax's worth and Kraglin gets his chance to live up to his old boss Yondu. The only one who doesn't see much development is Groot, who is curiously on the periphery of preceedings while his closest companion is in mortal danger. While Rocket is in many ways the main protagonist of the film he mostly appears in flashbacks as a very different character than the smart mouthed rodent we have come to know and his banter with the rest of the team is missed.

Making the stakes more personal rather than more epic for the conclusion of the trilogy is an unusual move in a genre that tends to favour spectacle but its a fitting send off for a series that has always placed the emphasise on its characters. That's not to say there isn't plenty of bang for your buck, with action scenes aplenty and the traditional drawn out MCU final act that makes the movie longer than it needs to be. It's also, like it's predecessors, actually funny and packs in some of the best gags Marvel has to offer, even if it could be accused of going lowest common denominator a couple of times too often. Its not all laughs though, throwaway jokes and humour filled chats are mixed with some truly dark events.

Is it too dark? No, but if you have young kids I'd check this out on your own before deciding if they can handle it. James Gunn is a filmmaker who has never been afraid of playing away from the light and on his final hurrah for the mouse house he doesn't hold back. There are multiple scenes of cute things in distress and some visual grotesquery that reminds you that the director of Slither is behind the camera. One shot in particular (you'll know it when you see it) stretches the level of gore you can get away with in a family film to the absolute limit.

Volume 3 isn't perfectly paced and it may give you tonal whiplash but character and heart make Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 a fitting end to the most unique of Marvel trilogies.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

However, this was still the first time I have ever walked out on a Marvel film.

I walked out because I am particularly sensitive to animal cruelty and, unfortunately, the plot of the film revolves around intergalactic animal torture.

The film does not pull any punches when it comes to tugging at one's heartstrings in this respect, as other Guardians Volumes have. What I expected to be a fun romp with a familiar crew, left me feeling only disturbed and sad.

1065,4.0,6-May-23,"Easily the best MCU movie post Endgame. I was kind of nervous going into it as I really didnt like The Holiday Special, but I think he hit the right tone with it still being funny yet serious. Even the ending was perfectly bittersweet. Incredibly touching and poignant. I definitely cried more than once. The film deals with themes of eugenics and animal cruelty and while it definitely be hard to watch at times, I think James Gunn did a good job with it.

Things I specifically liked - Rocket. Easily the heart and soul of the film. He doesnt have much action in this film. Most of his scenes are flashbacks. But completely integral to the plot and adding dimension to his character. He'll break your heart for sure. The High Evolutionary was honestly one of the best villains we have got so far. Has to be one of the most evil, most heartless villains. Nebula was great as well. I loved how far her character has come and how much she has grown. Despite being mostly robotic at this point, she is the most human here. I also really did like Will Poulter as Adam Warlock, though he doesnt get much to do in this film. I dont think he was necessary to this specific film so it feels kind of wasted. Though Im excited to see what else they can do with him, if they decide to bring him back.

Speaking of things being a waste, the f bomb. I had heard before going into the movie that this would be the MCU's first f bomb, and so when I heard it in the movie, I was like ""This is the moment you used it on?"". Could of have been cooler and more significant. But I mean, thats such a small thing to gripe about. Even though I did love getting more of Rocket's backstory, I did think a lot of the interactions with Lila, Teefs and Floor were cheesy and a little too on the nose. I also dont think Gamora was really needed in this movie either. I mean...she was kind of integral in a way to help Peter move on and accept his loss - but as a character herself she didnt really add anything and I was a bit disappointed with that. I didnt find the Nathan Fillion cameo all that funny either.

But other than that, I really loved the film and again...I think probably the best MCU film post Endgame. (Although I did also really love Shang Chi so I would maybe have to re-watch that).","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

The anti-heroes also appeared normally, especially Adam Warlock, who is probably more of a hidden villain, although this way of James Gunn is understandable. All the characters seem like protagonists. None of them are over/under rated and all are at the right place at the right time.

Music has always been a large part of the Guardians of the Galaxy since day one. So this outing is no different and employs each song with great effect. Evoking emotions both from my own personal experiences with the track and how it relates to what is happening onscreen.

The elements of story, humour and dark moments are so well balanced that while you are preoccupied with the retelling of past events in the history of one of the main characters. You will feel the emotion from the dark moments and then get blindsided by the wacky humour the next. Very well done!

The special effects are so well done that it makes everything onscreen feel alot more authentic. Of course they are not completely perfect. But close enough and it makes the action so much more fun!","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
1069,9.0,5-May-23,"This is the best MCU movie. It has the perfect amount of action, emotion, comedy, the pacing is great and the vibe is amazing. It truly was the best way to close the trilogy.

It's crazy how when infinity war / end game dropped most of us thought peak marvel was over, even pushing it to nhw, but nope, I guess it's still possible to create masterpieces - and this is one of them.

After the new antman this was really refreshing, the last couple mcu movies have been painfully average.

It's really sad that gotg is over, but the ending does give hope that we can continue to see some of the characters in the future.

And lastly, that hallway fight scene, is probably the best fight scene since end game.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

1071,1.0,30-Jun-23,"I put this movie on hold, and although I really like Guardians of the Galaxy, I just wanted to let the hype surrounding it settle down before watching it. This outing for the franchise is perfect and serves as a spectacular reminder of how good Marvel movies can be when there is enough clarity, subtlety, and heart put into the story. It focuses more on the characters' journey, allowing the audience to connect with them on a deeper level and find elements that make them special. This movie evokes strong emotions and can be challenging to watch at times, mainly due to the incredible Rocket story that finally reveals the depths of what this beloved character has endured. This Marvel film stands out as one of the most emotionally engaging ones that I can remember, and I will always be grateful for that. The performances from the entire cast are exactly what you would expect-dynamic and enjoyable. It has been quite some time since we had such a formidable main villain that you can't help but root for their demise. The High Evolutionary reigns supreme with his narcissistic and evil demeanor. Both James Gunn's writing and Chukwudi Iwuji's acting seamlessly come together in an impressive fashion.

Another fantastic element of this film is that you can see the group of heroes is somewhat weary and worn out, as if they have reached the end of their rope. However, it is precisely their teamwork and camaraderie that make them resilient and unparalleled when it comes to protecting the universe. Their collective strength shines through, emphasizing the power of their bond. The fact that these characters have gone through significant challenges and personal growth throughout their journeys makes them even more endearing and relatable to audiences. While there may be a few minor negatives that one can point out, ultimately, they don't significantly detract from the overall experience. Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 stands out as one of the best Marvel comic book movies of all time. It carries a remarkable sense of gravitas and showcases incredible filmmaking throughout. There are different perspectives regarding the future of the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise. Some might hope that this film marks the end of their journey, believing it's a fitting conclusion. Others may see it as an intriguing starting point for a new team that could embark on further dangerous adventures. However, one thing is certain: regardless of the franchise's direction, it's important to express gratitude to James Gunn and the entire crew for their efforts in creating this movie. Their contributions have played a significant role in shaping the Guardians of the Galaxy and providing audiences with memorable cinematic experiences.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

1073,9.0,16-May-23,"My Review- Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) My Rating 7.5 /10

I'll admit Cartoon Super heroes are really not my specialty and a little out of my comfort zone however I was entertained and enjoyed the escapades of Star Lord Peter Quill played by Chris Pratt as well as my favourite character Rocky Racoon sorry Rocket Racoon voice supplied by Bradley Cooper ,Drax the warrior played by Dave Bautista ,Nebula the adopted sister of Gamora played by Karen Gillan and my 2nd favourite character Groot a member of the Guardians who is a tree-like humanoid and the accomplice of Rocket .

I mean it as a compliment that Groot Played by Vin Diesel gave a very wooden performance in a role that gave him plenty of opportunity to branch out .

I enjoyed the light comedy touches in Galaxy 3 and the chemistry that the comrades in arms had together it gives the story a human touch .

Although saying that the humans or humanoids are few and far between ,especially on Counter Earth a planet created by the villain of the movie titled The High Evolutionary a scientist played by Chukwudi Iwuji . This Classic mad scientist has populated Counter Earth with his created anthropomorphic animal creatures that mimic the everyday lives of our planet Earth which has destroyed itself with corruption and War.

The movie opens on a planet or place called Nowhere which reminded me very much of the seedy Cantina bar scene in Star Wars where we're introduced to characters just as strange and just as seedy.

The action begins with an attack from a warrior Adam Warlock who critically wounds Rocket which sets the action when the Guardians are unable to tend to Rockets wounds prompting Peter Quill to sets off find the combination of the kill switch embedded in the beloved raccoons head to save his life .

It's a fun and exciting romp of a movie reminding me of the Saturday matinee movies I grew up watching .

Whether it's Our Gang, The Three Musketeers, Harry Potter and his Gryffindors or The Magnificent Seven buddy movies have audience appeal so I suspect this is the case with The Guardians.

Where todays Saturday matinee movies differ of course is due to the technology as they are certainly more spectacular of course .

They are far more innovative as they would be with a Production budget that any treasurer would be envious of .

""Guardians of the Galaxy 3"" cost $250 million to produce and roughly $100 million to promote fortunately for Disney its a huge box office hit already with a $528.8 million in global sales in its second weekend in theatres.

There's fortunes to be made for all in The Guardians of the Galaxy movie franchise including it's star Chris Pratt . His father in law Arnold Schwarzenegger put his full support behind his son in law and was very proud of the result.

Chris Pratt's estimated net worth to date is $80 million not bad since his first Galaxy movie was filmed only nine years ago.

I imagine Disney were pleased to welcome Director and screenwriter James Gunn back to the fold after his dismissal in 2018 his contribution is obviously crucial to the box office success of Guardians of the Galaxy.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
1074,1.0,15-May-23,As a fan of both Is marvel and the guardians of the galaxy Wow all I can say is well this was the entire triology And it's no secret why it's doing very well at the Box office. And I personally thought That this Film Very emotional and serious but also funny and It's what you'd expect from a guardian of the Galaxy Film And the interaction Of Adam warlock in this film was very good but and this film perfectly sets up another sequel with rocket As The leader and Adam warlock joins the team which I can't wait for and I also can't wait for whatevor movie or TV show.

It's a great move for them to continue the story through rocket. His story is so sad I cried so much that I can't tell you. The songs and visual effect were so great. James Gunn needs to make more movies. They finished Guardians of the galaxy in the best way, The perfect ending. All the characters were very well written, very nice.

Instead of a continued story arc from previous adventures in space, this conclusion focuses on one of its leading characters 'Rocket Racoon' but dont worry, spoiler free!

I saw it in 3d 4DX and felt more like a roller coaster that had me all over the place with its fast pace action seqeuences throughout the movie!

Story was great, set pieces were brilliant and story was a mixture of warmth, tears and lots of humour - Action for me was brilliant!

Directed by 'James Gunn' a great finish to the trilogy!","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
1077,9.0,10-May-23,"I'm a big fan of GOTG 1+2 and thought this film would be an exciting experience but almost half of our group all agreed it was a flop of a disaster.

The length of 2.5 hours was way too long for this bizarre Raccoon Rocket origin story that towards the end got so demented with the animal cruelty and Noah's arc analogy that it makes one wonder if James Gunn was smoking peyote or on some Amazonian Ayahuasca trip while writing it during Covid.

It's a basic story that really lacks continuity and good storytelling and feels like a variety of music videos of best characters of GOTG tossed in with simple plot to save Rocket life - but instead it feels like a comical rescue relief that is endlessly pathetic - and the final ending kumbayah hugging fest says it all - and the only one that sees the entire film as a flop disaster is our green character Zoraya.

What was James Gunn smoking ?

We all felt like the villain crew that turned and mutinied against their stretched black faced villain leader - which is a good reference to how we all feel towards James Gunn destroying a great series with such a pathetic distorted story. Mutiny should have stopped this piece of garbage at the Marvel studio.

Oh and most of the cgi is terrible unless you like Honey I shrunk the kids type of cgi - and the sound track was 50/50 missing it's mark compared to the last 2 films that were master pieces compared to this mangled motley of cringing sentimental garbage.

Kudos to the space dog and please do not continue with any more.

Looking forward to new films from James Gunn

Ps o idea how anyone can give this film a 9/10 score

4 stars and that is being generous.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
1078,9.0,22-May-23,"I'm one of the few that finds the MCU movie franchise to be a tired product and for me it happened really early on. Iron Man 1 was fresh and exciting and I loved it at the time. But since then it seemed like every subsequent film just tried to copy that formula with diminishing results. By the time the first Avengers movie came out, I was pretty much done and never saw any other Marvel film in theatres again.

But there have been 3 exceptions, that being all three Guardians films. The first film I went with a friend with zero expectations and I loved everything about it. To me it was not a Marvel film it was just a great sci fi action film that worked on its own. It was exciting, had a great soundtrack and most of all it had heart which I can't say any other Marvel movies have. Each of the 4 main characters is well defined and a common trait among them is that they are all dealing with trauma which I think is the main reason people are so attached to these characters. We root for them to succeed when we ourselves know what it means to be at your lowest point in life.

Guardians 3 takes the trauma to a whole new level and I would not recommend any children watch this as even for adults it has content that is incredibly difficult to watch. Thanos may have been the big bad guy but in my opinion The High Revolutionary is so evil and twisted that his actions leave a sick feeling in your stomach, easily the best written Marvel villain to date. What happens to Rocket is so incredibly sad and definitely tugs on the heart strings of people who love animals. While there is serious content in this, there is well balanced humor which is more subtle than Vol 2 which had a lot of overplayed jokes that didn't land. The action is also more subtle compared to other Marvel films but the way it's shot feels a lot more exhilarating and like there are real stakes in it. While Rocket is the main focus, all the characters get their due having built them up over prior films and without spoilers I'll just say that the ending is incredibly satisfying.

I'm actually a bit sad that this is it for most of these characters but if it is the end it was a fantastic send off for them. I'm happy to have taken the journey with them cause that's what it has felt like.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

I'm glad I convinced my mom to see this wild ride with me, (we saw the first two together) and she cried towards the end mainly cause she was moved by the great soundtrack, and she also said afterward it's the most action-packed movie she's ever seen; true it does have a LOT of action. This was magnificent and fun entertainment throughout. I wanted to see it when it first was released, and we finally went tonight (even though I had only around 4 hours of sleep) yet Guardians Volume 3 still hit the spot! I love this gem of trilogies James Gunn has so well crafted together! With a genius soundtrack, packed with great comedic moments, great acting, and emotions that hit all the feels and deserve awards - overall a very satisfying action flick!","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
1080,1.0,6-May-23,"James Gunn, you are the person that will be missed the most at Marvel and I can already say that DC will be perfect with you in charge, because you, my good man, only make MASTERWORKS!

Guardians of the Galaxy 3 is one of the best MCU movies, I just watched it and I'd say it's already in my TOP 3 of best hero movies, the movie conveys different feelings from laughing to crying. The soundtrack remains perfect, fulfilling the ""tradition"" of guardians' films being perfect in terms of music.

The closure of these arcs and characters in the MCU was incredible and exciting to see, I already feel that the Marvel universe is going to change completely without some of the most charismatic people present in it.

Dave Bautista and Chris Pratt you are my heroes for those brilliant performances!

Well, i'm going to miss you in these movies, james gunn. Good luck commanding your ship wherever you go besides Marvel. Thank you for this incredible trilogy of these Guardians of the Galaxy.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

At the scene, I saw everyone laughing together, sobbing together, applauding together, and everyone felt immersed in joy. It let us return to the happiness we used to enjoy watching Marvel .

You can feel the creator's respect and love for the characters in the story, feel the sincerity of their creations, so these characters can be so full. I hope they are family forever , farewell is for a better meeting again.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
1082,1.0,6-May-23,"The previous Guardians movies have centred around charming but goofy captain Peter Quill but the creative team made a conscious choice to shift the focus to wise-cracking and temperamental Rocket Racoon. I really liked this choice, Rocket's backstory has a lot of substance and the flashbacks to how he was moulded into who he became were some of my favourite scenes in the movie. They could have been manipulative or saccharine but I found them heartbreaking and very well done. But aside from that, all the Guardians get something to do. Quill is grieving for his version of Gamora, Mantis is trying to get some respect from the rest of the group, Nebula is trying to deal with her babyface turn (her move to the lighter side of the character scale) and Drax is trying to help but is coming to terms with his spot in the team. This is a lot to juggle (more on that later) but it also helps they sculpt an appropriately savage villain for the Guardians to bounce off of in The High Evolutionary. Add in Adam Warlock (a hugely powerful but less than intelligent alien who has it out for the Guardians) and you've got quite an assembly. They know how to get you to identify and feel for these characters and Volume 3 delivers in expanding on their motivations and relationships without being too manipulative.

It's so cool to see how the Guardians cast's careers have evolved since 2014. Some of the lustre has worn off of Chris Pratt's meteoric rise but they tone down the sarcastic and unfeeling nature of the character and that was the best thing to do. Pratt is more genuine and emotional here and Volume 3 benefits. I liked sarcastic Starlord but the character needed to evolve and Peter did so appropriately. Dave Bautista is still hilarious as Drax, his strong rapport with Pom Klementieff and Chris Pratt is still present and his deadpan style works so well. Karen Gillan played a great antagonist in the first entry and she handles the switch well. Her snarky and angry nature meshes so well for the character, it's too bad because I would have liked to see her in more movies as this character. Pom is still great, they needed to expand on her character too and Volume 3 accomplishes that as well. She amplifies Mantis' sweet but courageous nature and she's turned into an integral member of the team. Sean Gunn is still fun in his supporting part as Kraglin, he's got good comic timing and he's always been funny. I liked Maria Balakova as Cosmo, it's only voice work but she gives the character some personality. I enjoyed Will Poulter as Adam Warlock, his take on the character was different from what I expected but he's effortlessly funny and yet threatening as the character that's huge on power but weak on maturity and charisma. Zoe Saldana and Vin Diesel return as Gamora and Groot respectively. It's a nice change to see Saldana playing a more ruthless version of Gamora and Vin is still distinctive and dependable in voicework as the stoic but memorable Groot. The most underrated performance came from Chukwudi Iwudi as The High Evolutionary. A common criticism of Marvel's movies is that the villains are lacklustre but Chukwudi was fantastic. His scenes with the CGI Rocket have so much emotion and through his work, they cultivate a feud between him and Rocket that goes beyond hero vs. V=villain. His character's rationale is simple but brutal and he's appropriately operatic to amp up the fated clash between him and the Guardians.

While we're used to Marvel grabbing glowingly effusive reviews (for the most part anyway), I'm a little surprised the buzz on this one has been so mixed. I do have a couple of notes however. I enjoyed that all the main players were given something to do but the movie did feel a little overstuffed. It didn't really bother me but some of the fat could have been trimmed off for a leaner film. Also, there's some concessions made towards James Gunn's more typical style in this for better or worse. In some aspects like the action and the new character designs, Volume 3 becomes more distinct. But there is a fair amount of gross stuff which gives the movie some distinctive style but I was left cringing at some of the ""juicier"" bits.

The Guardians franchise has always been special to me ever since Starlord danced his way across that first cave in 2014. Between the heart wrenching opening and the unique flavour of the immediately following heist, I knew I was in for something awesome. Volume 3 is dark and dramatic but it proves how invested you are in these characters. I almost teared up a couple of times in this movie and I laughed a bunch. The action is tight and provides what you want spending $15 on a 3D ticket. I'm not sure this will turn the rising tide against the genre but I really enjoyed this movie and I'm happy my memories of the previous entries weren't tainted by an unnecessary and lacklustre sequel. No matter what you think of Gunn's personal comedic styling, he's a great writer/director and he's engine that makes this franchise roar. I'd wholly recommend Volume 3 if you liked any of the previous movies, as a fan it was almost everything I ever hoped for in a finale.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

The action is confused and there's nothing to invest in. In trying to expand the minor characters it reveals they have no interest. It loses focus on Peter and Gamora and in the process is a bore.

Lately the directors of the current movies have really been flopping and the shows have been even worse with and exception to moonknight, though it's my personal opinion even though the CGI was horrible I felt it had a good story.

I think entire trilogy is perfect filled with emotions and drama with some fun action and amazing humour.. It will be right to say that this film is about Rocket Racoon in same way last one was about Peter Quill and first one was about Gamora. I never thought I would love this misfits this much a very very big thanks to James Gunn for making these characters so relatable that we actually feel what is happening to them in this universe.. I won't lie I cried many times throughout the movie because how beautiful this is.. It also has some amazing humour and jokes which lightens up our mood after any heavy moment.. Action is amazing as last 2 films, it has some really good jokes and comedy and a sense of end with these character's journey which was really beautiful.. Rocket Racoon and Nebula got most of the character development throughout this trilogy and the way they end Drax's story made me really cry.. There are some cute animals too like every other Gunn movie whoam you'll love, Will Poulter was also good as Adam Warlock and he has a long road ahead of him in MCU..Chukwudi Iwuji played main villain High Evolutionaty here and he will become one of the most hated villains in entire MCU I'm sure he has his own sense of twisted morality which'll give you hard time to watch just wished they ended him in some another way instead of any other average MCU villain but anyway he is great in his performance, rest of cast is also great in their role especially Zoe Saldana as Gamora.. GOTG trilogy is not just some space action adventure comedy but also an heartfelt drama which teaches us about importance of friends, family and life itself... I never thought I would love these misfit bands of Superhero so much that it'll make me cry... Thank you Marvel Studios and James Gunn from bringing Guardians of the galaxy into our life...After Avengers Endgame this is best MCU movie alsongside Spider Man No Way Home... Hopefully we'll see this iteration of Guardians again in future.....

The movie had a lot of action, comedy, and heart, and it focused on Rocket's tragic backstory, which was the most compelling part. Bradley Cooper gave a stellar performance as Rocket, and made me feel for him. The High Evolutionary was a scary and ruthless villain, and Chukwudi Iwuji nailed his role. The other actors were also good, especially Zoe Saldana as Gamora and Will Poulter as Adam Warlock. The movie had some issues, like the excessive use of flashbacks and the low stakes in the present, but they didn't spoil the overall enjoyment. The visual effects were amazing, and the soundtrack was catchy as always.

1089,9.0,13-May-23,"Guardians of the Galaxy was one of the best and most surprising things to come out of the MCU. They were an unknown group with heroes that were even more unknown than Iron Man (at the time). However, thanks to director James Gunn, he made them one of the most popular Marvel characters and team. I loved the first one and it is still up there in one of my favourite Marvel films. The second one is a great movie but not as good as the first one. There is a joke that the 3rd movie is always the worst which did occur with Ant-Man recently. Does Guardians of the Galaxy fall into this or does it deliver an epic trilogy?

One of the core themes in the Guardian of the Galaxy movies is family and loss. This is still prevalent here and still as powerful. We see the Guardians feel closer as a family than ever but also argue a lot like family too. In terms of character arcs, Peter is still reeling from the loss of Gamora, Yondu and even his mother which is making him go to the bottles. His struggles stem from self-blame for those losses and becoming more protective of his current family, The Guardians. He has conflicts with alternate Gamora who he still sees as his Gamora which she is having none of. Nebula is also a stand-out character this time with her being a member of the Guardians and not an antagonist. She has great interactions with everyone and her character arc is a great one. The character that is the major focus of GotG3 is Rocket. We finally get his backstory which is so dark and heartbreaking that it genuinely brought a tear to my eye. Mantis and Drax are still the idiot duo but they get some emotional moments and even cool scenes where they shine. Likewise, Groot, Kraglin and talking dog Cosmo are mostly just there but they get moments to shine too.

On that note, the return actors continue to do a great job in the role. They all get to flex more of their emotions due to this more emotional entry. Special praise to Bradley Cooper as Rocket who gives a stunning voice performance. Additionally, I must praise Chukwudi Iwuji's performance as the villain High Evolutionary. He gives a full-on narcissistic, zealous and unhinged performance that makes him so hateable. Another standout element from this series is the music and its incorporation of non-mainstream pop songs. James continues to use great songs such as ""In the Meantime"" by Spacehog and he uses them in great ways that benefit the movie. One difference this time is the use of some more popular songs such as ""Creep"" by Radiohead and ""Dog Days Are Over"" by Florence and the Machines. Nevertheless, they are used satisfyingly that I don't mind their use.

There are a couple of awesome action scenes. The ones that come to mind are the fight against Adam Warlock where we get to see the guardians struggle against a powerful foe. Moreover, there is a phenomenal one-shot-looking action scene that illustrates all the Guardian's fighting prowess and it was so cool. The costumes and set design are well-designed. I love how creative the world is with the unique-looking planets and different alien species. Most of the aliens are done using prosthetics and they look great! The story itself is quite basic as it is mostly a fetch quest but the emotional payoff to all the characters' arcs is extremely satisfying. We get what feels like a proper ending to the original Guardians team that I wouldn't be angry if this is the last we see of these characters.

However, I do have some minor gripes with the movie. Adam Warlock who was teased since Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 is finally here but he doesn't feel that meaningful to the plot. He is just there to be a nuisance rather than a significant antagonist. Him having the mindset of a child just makes him slightly lame. One common superhero movie issue is the vague villain powers which are also here. The High Evolutionary seems to be able to use telekinesis or emit giant energy blasts but never seems to do it against the Guardians when he should. Alternate Gamora was one of the biggest challenges as it was a Gamora with none of the character development from the first 2 films. In this film, she comes off as way too cold and aggressive than the Gamora of previous films which makes her not that likeable. Although, you could argue that was the whole point as she isn't the same Gamora, plus she does have her character arc. There is also a weird Nebula and Peter subplot that is hinted at but never amounts to anything.

Overall, what an amazing end to the trilogy! With MCU projects lately being kind of subpar, it was great to finally have an entry that delivers. We now have another entry in great MCU trilogies with Captain America, Tom Holland's Spiderman and now Guardians of the Galaxy. I don't know what is going to happen with the Guardians of the Galaxy movies now that James Gunn is done and moving to DC. Nevertheless, I am looking forward to what James does as head of DC and I can't wait to see what new direction the Guardians go in.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
1090,8.0,15-May-23,"Written & directed by James Gunn, the story follows Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) must rally his team around him to save Rocket (Bradley Cooper) after being attacked along with a mission, if not completed successfully, could possibly lead to the end of the Guardians once and for all.

This is the third and final installment of James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy and boy did he closes on the highest note possible and gave a proper goodbye to our beloved guardians, this guy just doesn't miss. You could say that this is one of the darkest MCU films since it centers on Rocket's harrowing past which depicts animal cruelty. Some villains in superhero movies who played God are seemed unstoppable and lacking at the same time because they already have almost god-level power. Not for The High Evolutionary although he is equipped with high-level tech, but what makes him the most wicked of them all is that he's just a human and mad scientist who seeks perfection in evolution to make the perfect society by experimenting with a living being. He is portrayed by Chukwudi Iwuji who I think gave the best performance for a villain in MCU to date, he owns the scene every time he's in it.

From the heartfelt moment to comedy, and action, Guardians of the Galaxy has everything. (it was my first time actually crying while watching a Marvel movie). Looking back to the first time the team met, I just realized that they have the same sort of bitter past and complete each other hence making them stronger by doing the opposite of what they made or told to do. I honestly couldn't think of a better ending, this is what happened if the writer/director understands the characters deeply and treats them with love and passion, that man is James Gunn.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

For what?

THIS??

GotG vol. 3 is NOT a good movie. It's unfocused, there's not really a story. Nebula who had an awesome arc in Infinity War and Endgame didn't do much here but scream and yell at people.

The plot is so deep and so heartfelt that it will take you to the edge. I think this episode was the most emotional from the guardians of the galaxy. But i do think the marvel will move to another level because recently all the marvel movies were saying bye to some of their main characters. Just think of thor, ironman, walanda and now the closing chapter of the guardians??? Im super curious what will come next but i would kind of hope theyll show rockef from time to time bec he is super cool.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

Rocket is the soul of the movie. Not a spoiler but it was based on the backdrop of the rocket and it so emotional you can definately tears in your eyes. Thus far i got tears for the three times entire movie. MCU made a cult piece. Disney is the most trustable production house ( strictly personal opinion)

1096,8.0,8-Jul-23,"In a galaxy far, far away, the ragtag band of misfits known as the Guardians of the Galaxy returns for their epic and emotionally charged finale in ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3."" Brace yourself for a cosmic adventure that will have you laughing, crying, and dancing in your seat.

From the very first frame, it's clear that James Gunn, the mastermind behind this beloved franchise, has poured his heart and soul into this film. He skillfully blends humor, heart, and a touch of madness to create a unique concoction that is unmistakably Guardians.

This third installment doesn't hold back. It's a beautifully crafted farewell that hits all the right notes, even if it occasionally strays into the realm of silliness. But hey, who doesn't love a bit of quirkiness from our favorite galaxy-saving heroes?

The storyline is a perfect balance of thrills and emotions. Gunn takes his time to delve into the personal journeys of each Guardian, giving them the depth and growth they deserve. While the movie may feel a tad lengthy at times, it's difficult to imagine what could have been cut without sacrificing the rich character development.

The cast delivers stellar performances, with Chris Pratt shining as Peter Quill. He brings a new level of vulnerability and charm to the character, reminding us why we fell in love with him in the first place. But it's Rocket, voiced by Bradley Cooper, who truly steals the show. His evolution throughout the trilogy is nothing short of remarkable, and Cooper's voice acting is a testament to his talent.

Of course, no Guardians film would be complete without the signature humor, and this one delivers in spades. The witty banter, hilarious one-liners, and unexpected gags will have you chuckling throughout. Just be prepared for some explosive yelling matches during the climactic battle, which, while emotionally charged, might leave you longing for a moment of silence.

Visually, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a feast for the eyes. The vibrant colors, stunning CGI, and imaginative designs bring the cosmic world to life in a way that only Marvel can. The cinematography is dynamic, capturing the action with flair, and the music, as always, is an absolute delight. Get ready to groove to the Guardians' awesome soundtrack once again.

While the film wraps up most character arcs beautifully, there are a few odd choices that may leave fans scratching their heads. The treatment of Adam Warlock, for instance, feels somewhat lacking, and the High Evolutionary's backstory remains a mystery. But these minor bumps in the space-time continuum don't overshadow the overall brilliance of the film.

""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a 9/10 cosmic masterpiece that pays tribute to the weird, wonderful, and quirky heroes who stole our hearts. It's a perfect send-off, filled with laughter, tears, and a whole lot of heart. As we bid farewell to this beloved franchise, we can't help but feel a tinge of sadness, but also a deep appreciation for the impact it has had on the superhero genre.

So fasten your seat belts, grab your favorite mixtape, and prepare for a cosmic ride like no other. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a fitting conclusion to an epic trilogy, a testament to the power of found families and the enduring spirit of these unforgettable characters. Get ready to blast off into a universe where humor, heart, and a touch of madness reign supreme.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
1097,1.0,5-May-23,"I didn't think I'd miss fictional characters that show real emotion and humor as if they were in real life. Honestly the whole emotional ride I took with my dad felt amazing and disheartening in most places.

With Peter trying to be lovey dovey with 2014 gamora, to seeing rockets past being shown in a very messed up but also sweet in some places. But then we half drax being goofy but also showing more surprises along the way, nebula finally being happy, then groot and mantis being the heart in this family James help put together. Adam will probably take some time to get used to but for now he's ok. The High Evolutionary, is probably the scariest villain but also the best villain in an mcu film, heck even close to thanos.

I wish these characters wouldn't leave and be separated but the journey is over, everyone did their preformances as well, even had the first f word in there(shown in the clips). This definitely the greatest mcu team like the avengers, probably even better.

1098,1.0,16-May-23,"I still can't think about this movie without getting upset. And it's a Marvel movie -- I'm a huge Marvel fan. I never would have imagined I'd walk out of a Marvel title, especially GOTG, but I did after I couldn't take watching animals kept in cages in dark dungeons, surrounded by their own waste -- that's how the movie begins. It escalates from there. At one point during a traumatic scene, I just closed my eyes. Then I left. I feel sorry for parents who take their children -- Disney got its way ending up with a PG-13 rating. It should be rated R simply for being so disturbing, apart from the F-bomb and other adult moments. So disappointed. I'm hoping The Marvels and The Thunderbolts are at least fun -- I don't even care if they lack substance at this point. I just want to NOT feel like I felt watching this movie. I realize I'm sensitive to animal cruelty, but I'm honestly amazed at how many people had no problem watching this.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
1099,9.0,30-May-23,"The final installment of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" has made a lot of positive impressions on me. Here we still have an unforgettable adventure, despite the huge redundancy of superhero movies nowadays. The movie manages to immerse you in the world of these character for the third time and does this job just as well as it did before. To some extent, I would describe the final part of the guardians as ""an emotional swing"", because the scene change between humor and sadness is always happening too fast, but these ""swings"" made me fall in love with the Guardians again.

The storyline of Rocket the Raccoon is the highlight of the movie. It was somewhat predictable, but it has still touched my soul. Drax, Mantis and Groot got some development as well.

Nebula has already become a completely different character. In this part, she, as always, is responsible for the unique perspective and adds a new interesting dynamic between the guardians.

The romantic plot line between Gamora and Star-Lord has ended very logically and believably, as it should have been. And for this the movie deserves even more praise.

To sum up, this is by far the best Marvel movie in the last 5 years, after Avengers: Endgame.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
1100,9.0,5-May-23,"Guardians of the Galaxy impressed me to no end back in 2014. Not only did I love that film, but it was just nice to see something so fresh in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I continued enjoying these characters in their subsequent film and all of their appearances in films like Avengers: Infinity War or their recent Holiday Special. If you couldn't already tell, of course, I was going to check out Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 when it hit theatres. Well, after viewing it, I'm happy to say that this trilogy has concluded in a satisfying way. I have a couple of complaints, but this film is overall just well-made.

Picking up after the events of Avengers: Endgame and The Holiday Special, we catch up with the Guardians and how they have been handling themselves. The film doesn't waste any time in putting Rocket Raccoon front and centre as the heart of the film, as the premise of this particular movie wouldn't exist without him. We learn about his tragic past throughout the film and how it relates to the new villain they have to face, the high evolutionary. This story unfolds while each of the Guardians continues to learn, adapt, and evolve as characters. I would say, even though he's far from the focus of the film here, Drax to me showed the most character development (aside from the obvious Rocket storyline). At the end of the day, all of these characters are likeable, and since James Gunn is back at the helm as writer and director again, I expected nothing less than to have him take care of these characters in a nice way.

James Gunn has understood these characters from the very beginning, so it was only fitting that he send them off in his way. Yes, this film does conclude this group's storyline and I felt very satisfied with how it's done. This leads me to my biggest problem with the movie as a whole though. Being a huge fan of how the Marvel films all intersect with each other, since Avengers: Endgame, I must admit that it hasn't been as seamless as it's been in the past. Gamora gets the short end of the stick here since she doesn't know this crew anymore. Throughout the entire film, I found myself wondering why James Gunn had to even include her in the film. It almost seemed like he couldn't not have here there because of the fact that it's a Guardians of the Galaxy film. There were a few scenes where I thought her character bogged down the plot of this film, but I otherwise had a blast.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is one of the most emotional films in the MCU to date and I didn't expect certain things to make me tear up, but I was wrong. Subtle, simple things that happen throughout the film had me tearing up out of both sadness and joy at the same time. It took a bit to get moving for me, but by the time the film reaches its second and third acts, it sings. It benefits once again from a solid soundtrack, great performances across the board, stellar writing and directing by Gunn, and a visual style that MCU has otherwise not had outside of these films. This is a great trilogy, I just wish the Gamora storyline from Avengers: Infinity War hadn't impacted her presence here. If you're a fan of these characters, I think you will appreciate how it all concludes, so I definitely recommend it.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

1102,9.0,6-May-23,"Welcome back, MCU, we missed you.

With GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY, VOLUME 3, the MCU has returned to the top ranks of movie-making, creating a thrilling, character-driven action/adventure that is emotionally charged and satisfying.

Directed and Written by James Gunn (as he has done with the first 2 Guardians films), Guardians 3 ties off the trilogy of this ragtag group of heroes in an appropriate, fun way by focusing on something that recent MCU films failed to do - it focuses on the characters and their relationships and how the out-of-this-world adventure that they are on will, ultimately, grow and enrich these characters and relationships.

Chris Pratt (Star-Lord), Zoe Saldana (Gamora), Dave Bautista (Drax), Pom Klementieff (Mantis) and the voice of Vin Diesel (Groot) are all back and they all slip, comfortably, into their roles and relationships and it feels good to have them back together again.

Karen Gillan (Nebula) and, especially, Bradley Cooper (the voice of Rocket Racoon) shine above the rest as the script calls for their characters to grow in smart, fulfilling ways and both actors shine in these circumstances.

This film also has something that the previous few films - especially the latest Ant-Man film - were lacking...a terrific villain. Chukwudi Iwuji is terribly scary as THE HIGH EVOLUTIONARY who is so single-minded in his mission that living beings - and planets - are expendable. It is a terrific performance (and the 2nd straight strong one from Iwuji in a comic book vehicle, following his work in the HBO-MAX DCU TV Series Peacemaker). He is a talent to keep an eye on.

Of course, credit to all of this goes to James Gunn who, after some controversy, returned to helm the end of the Guardians trilogy (at least the Guardians of the Galaxy with THESE characters) and he hits the mark, finding the right blend of action and character that makes the audience care very much what happens to this group. It is a strong exit film from the MCU for Gunn and the DCU is very lucky/smart to hire him as their artistic director going forward.

A very rewarding end to the Guardians trilogy - and a return to form (at least for 1 film) for the MCU.

1103,8.0,10-May-23,"What a way to finish up James Gunn's run at the helm of the Guardians franchise. He has crafted a fitting finale for his iteration of guardians with the usual bickering, action and laughs while weaving in a moving backstory of Rocket's origins which hit home in a very real-world way.

By now the main cast have gotten all the kinks worked and and their easy chemistry keeps even the quieter moments humming along. Even at 2 and a half hours, this cracks along where Vol. 2 got bogged down.

This for me also has the best soundtrack of the three and really tops and tails the film with two absolute bangers for what it's worth.

This was always going to be a better iteration of the marvel machine over some of the latest entry's as it was always a home run with this cast and crew.

It's sad that Gunn is moving on to overseeing the DC universe but hopefully he will be able to meld his darker tones and humour into the more serious material that DC have to offer.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

This world is full of characters both weird and genius. The CGI is pretty good. Love the animal work in the movie. The action scenes are also pretty good. Overall, it feels like a feel good story at the end where you'll definitely be thinking about your family and the loved ones.

1108,1.0,11-May-23,"James Gunn has always loved all these characters. The way he has realised every one of these characters is just very admirable. And that's how he's able to make an emotional script with these characters. This can be said again for the 3rd movie. Once again all these characters are very well realised, and there's just something funny, adorable and family-like about their interactions. But I don't like how the second half concluded this movie.

The visual effects are brilliant once again, and it feels a lot more cleaner and colorful this time around. The soundtrack is different in this movie from the previous ones. And that's because the tone too is a lot more serious and emotional this time around.

But my favourite part about this movie was how these characters interacted. Most of the time they just argued with each other and that's what made their bonds so precious and genuine. I loved how Nebula's and Mantis' characters were realised.

And I love how James Gunn handled the character of Rocket. I know he gets a lot of the spotlight in this movie, but even in the previous movies, James Gunn used to build his character up in a very subtle way. As if it was all leading up to this moment.

I did say though that I didn't like how they wrapped up the movie.

I think a lot of potential was wasted, which is why I wasn't that impacted with how this movie concluded. I personally would have loved for this story to be split up into 2 parts. I would've loved to see so many things explored in depth. Because there's a lot going on in this movie. Along with handling all these characters individually, this movie also tries to build many conflicts and bonds between them, while trying to fit in some new characters at the same time. So after setting up everything brilliantly in the first half. The second half just wraps up those plotlines, just like that. And it just didn't have that impact on me even if it was directed brilliantly.

Overall I think it's a good movie but I would have loved to see 2 parts of it. I think it's on par with volume 2, but I still love the first more.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

I'll still keep this short but GOTG3 was everything I could have ever asked for or wanted from a super hero movie.

Terrible story line, poorly timed bad (and not ""good bad"") jokes and don't even get me started on Adam Warlock. His character was so lame. Some of the costume choices are beyond bad. The movie as a whole was just bad. I don't want to give anything away but in short it was bad.

Do yourself a favor and wait for this to come out online. At least that way you can turn it off once you have had enough. I had high hopes for this film. I wanted it to be awesome. I was hoping the decline in the MCU would have ended or at least taken a break, but sadly I was let down.

1112,3.0,6-May-23,"Other than Spider-Man: No Way Home, and a couple of average films, the 4 years since Avengers: Endgame have been pretty weak fir Marvel. Though watchable, the films have been almost completely forgettable. What made Marvel films great in the first couple of phases was al.ost gone. They weren't even films anymore. Not special, just the continuation of a formula.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 is mostly what made Marvel films so popular. Entertaining action films but with enough heart and characters that we care about to make them memorable. When Guardians Vol. 1 came out no one new that it would become as popular as it did. It was a very funny, energetic film that gained a great following. Vol.2 wasnt as good but the cast and director James Gunn and the willing cast made it entertaining. With Vol.3 we have supposedly the last Guardians film. And after seeing it it just might be better than even rblhe first one. Everyone is back, including director Gunn. Everyone knows that now he will be in charge of the DC universe and if he can bring his energy to those films it would be a good thing.

The focus of this film is Rocket. He has been captured and on the verge of death so his friends go to save him. The film focuses veryuch on Rocket's origin story. The villain this time is the High Evolutionary. A highly intelligent being that wants to create the perfect society. He experiments on animals but destroys them as soon as they don't meet his perfect standards. Rocket was one of his experiments. He showed great intelligence. He was able to escape and become a Guardian but High Evolutionary wants to study his brain so that he could again, create the perfect beings for his next society.

All of the cast is really good. The tone of this film is more darker than the other two entries but there is still the great banter between the characters and the film has some great laughs. But this film has a lot heart. There some really good dramatic moments and feels like there are some stakes here. So we care about what happens on the screen. That has been lacking in most Marvel films lately.

1116,9.0,10-May-23,"The team returns for one final installment, so they can wrap-up the story arc of this incarnation of James Gunn's modern classic. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023), will also answer some of the questions, about what the future holds for these cherished characters. It's safe to say, that it's not the end, but more of a transition, because the actors might change, but the characters are part of Marvel's canon of characters. They may come back someday, but this is the end of line for this group of filmmakers, performers and this particular storyline. The main ingredient being the real-world reality, that actors age and eventually need to be replaced. If there was no such thing as aging, this group could continue forever. That is a commentary on how loved they are to the audience and fans alike. James Gunn serves up a plate of emotions in this film, that helps the audience feel included in the celebrations.

A very influential entity in Marvel's canon of characters is the High Evolutionary. He is responsible for the creation of many characters from Marvel's history, most notably, the creation of Rocket (voice of Bradley Cooper). This is the point where the film takes root or maybe Groot (voice of Vin Diesel), as a launching pad for the rest of the film. It's the desire of the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji), to take his evolutionary science to the next level, no matter how atrocious it may be. He needs to capture Rocket, in order to solve the mystery of the racoon's amazing brilliance. It is this part of the film, that shows how good Marvel and Gunn are. Marvel has always been known for having an important message embedded into the plot of their films and comic books. In this case, it is a commentary on animal rights, being humane and that age-old science fiction example of not playing a god. The High Evolutionary thinks he is a god and therefore answers to no one. This is why the Guardians have to stop him and save Rocket.

The set-up begins with Rocket, who becomes injured, after Adam Warlock (Will Poulter), the now, uncocooned super-creation of his creator/mother Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki), tries to capture Rocket, from orders from the High Evolutionary. The injury to Rocket sets off a kill-switch inside his robotic implants, thus sending Star-Lord and the gang out to find the file download, that will turn off the switch. We are than introduced to a wide array of unique, sometimes frightening, genetically altered creatures, that the High Evolutionary has created. We also get to see what happens with all of our heroes and what their futures will be. The film has the emotions, the action, the plot, the Marvel magic and the performances of the cast, who express this intellectual property, the way it should be. The problem lies in the pacing, which slows the film down a little. It is still a very good film, but definitely ranks third out of the three films. This may be a good thing though, because the way they marketed this film as a finality, didn't really feel like an end at all, but more of a new beginning. That lack of ending made things feel more like hope. It was all in the emotions.

It's one of the most emotional movies I've ever seen and it has a lot to do with how much we've grown to care about these characters along with the excellent writing and amazing performances.

I am glad I didn't bring my kids because as emotional as this movie is, it's also the most gruesome and violent Marvel movie yet - but it all works so well.

It also has one of the greatest epic fight scenes in any movie that was so satisfying to watch and I can't wait to watch it many more times to come.

It was hilarious and had a very well thought story and everyone was equally important in this one. Was filled with a lot of emo sentimental stuff mainly kudos to Rocket's backstory. The perfect marvel movie with everything. It even helped make sense of a few loopholes.

Some great characters were introduced here like that space dog and warlock. And James Gunn's brother's character filled the void left by Yondu.

And this is definitely one for the IMAX theatres because there's some nice visuals in this one that can only be experienced in the best theatres.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
1123,1.0,3-May-23,This film is beautiful and has the perfect emotional payoff for all these characters. Although marvel in recent years has been nothing short of a joke this film revives the old life of the franchise and had me gripped throughout. It's a big shame for marvel that James Gunn is leaving to dc as his writing and directing is incredible with each cast member putting in a remarkable performance. The main Villain is also great and poses a proper threat for the hero's. Making rocket the main character was a great choice and Bradley cooper kills it yet again making his arc the most compelling out of everyone. Amazing.,"May 5, 2023 (United States)"
1124,1.0,9-Jul-23,"Gunn has made volume 3 much darker than Vol 1&2, resulting in a tone that is very inconsistent. You see glimpses of the magic of the first two volumes; great action vs well timed comedy, but this is disrupted by poorly timed jokes, a rather pointless plot (although touching at times), and an unnecessary darkness. The ending of the film felt lost as where the characters. Overall, very disappointed by this final instalment. Gunn couldn't hit the right mark on suicide squad either, failing to find any comedic timing and going too violent again. Fearful of what he will bring to DC as the new CEO and new director/ writer of Superman Legacy.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

Things I didn't like, gamora in this movie was a pure ass, no chemistry, not exciting about her in this movie she just gets you mad every time she's on screen

1130,1.0,6-May-23,"Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is the last of trilogy and maybe the final time we get to see the Guardians together trying to protect the galaxy. The storyline centered on Rocket after a bounty hunter played by Will Poulter tried to take Rocket back to his maker The High Evolutionary played by Chukwudl Iwuji. We learn how raccoon became Rocket and the ideal perfect specimen to start a perfect world. James Gunn wrote and created a great movie with a wonderful cast that has the original cast return to help Rocket from dying. Chris Pratt returns to play Star-Lord and is still trying to get over the loss of the old Gamora. The new Gamore played by Zoe Saldana hangs out with a new crew led by Sylvester Stallone. Karen Gillan, Vin Diesel, Dave Bautista and Pam Klementieff reprise their roles as the Guardians with a supporting cast that includes Sean Gunn, Sarah Alami, Nico Santos, Judy Greer, Michael Rosenbaum, Nathan Fillon, Elizabeth Debicki, and Linda Cardellini who voiced Lylia. The story was complex, fun, intriguing, a movie that i love to watch over and over again. I would hope Gunn continues the story but I don't think it's going to happen.

1131,1.0,7-Jul-23,"I have to disagree with so many overwhelmingly positive reviews - some are saying this is one of the best mcu movies. Definitely not 8+ score. Its a solid 6.

In my opinion, the movie is not that good really. It has a lot of lame scenes - something I really dont like, especially gunn's movies have those cringe moments. And obviously, poop and piss jokes - that's really unnecessary and annoying. The casting and especially the portrayal of Adam Warlock is the biggest downgrade. The character's arc is completely ridiculous. Same waste of character like drax. Apart from all those silly jokes, the action sequences were also pretty bad.

What i really liked in the movie is raccoon's story - it was a really nic touch. Thats probably the only good part in the movie that people really loved. High evolutionary was also nic - but in the end, it somewhat fell apart a bit. Kind of like pushing the story the way you want - lazy writing in other words. Overall, its decent fun watch - but i wouldn't call it a very good movie.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

Not a perfect movie, I personally think part 2 is the best of the trilogy, and some of the new characters felt a little underdeveloped just because there was so much going on, Adam Warlack felt like he could have used a little more attention. The villian is fantastic and just diabolical so great job on that. The main characters all get some great moments and development especially Rocket. James Gunn and 5he cast just do such a great job of hitting all the emotional notes and tgat was by far the strongest part of the movie.

It was funny, action-packed, and really emotional. It will make Rocket Raccoon all over again. I liked the soundtrack, I liked Rocket's flashbacks and I liked the climax. My favourite characters are Star-Lord, Drax, Mantis, Groot, Cosmo the Space Dog, and of course... ROCKET! However, I did not like the new variant of Gamora, and I thought the High Evolutionary villain was SO emo! You know, always yelling at people when things don't go his way.

1138,9.0,10-Jul-23,"I loved the first and second movie so I was looking forward to watching this with very little knowledge of what was going to happen.

Unfortunately I did not enjoy this movie and this is coming from someone that usually enjoys dark movies.

The animal cruelty was very hardcore especially for a movie rated 12A. I was very close to turning this movie off but forced myself to sit through the full movie. I have sat through tons of kids movies about animal rights as a child and was fine watching them. I have also seen plague dogs and was fine watching that. Guardians 3 however I could not handle it and this is coming from an adult.

The forced humour made me cringe so much and the soundtrack didn't match with the tone of the movie. It's like they tried not to make the movie too dark by forcing bad humour and a lively soundtrack into the movie to try and make it less traumatic to the audience.

The only positives I have for this movie is the action and CGI were good and the movie did it's best at trying to deliver the importance of animal rights. Unfortunately that's not enough to make me like this movie.

I get it, you didn't like Love and Thunder (I did) and you witnessed She-Hulk twerking and all the other crap on Disney (I only watched Loki and WandaVision!) so you're tired. But what is the alternative I ask? DC have not released one good universe movie. Not one. Man of Steel doesn't count, that was a Superman movie by its own right and Joker is not part of the cinematic universe. Don't get me started on Wonder Woman. Character and acting - fantastic, movie as a whole - poor. I love Batman as much as the next man but I'm not watching Flash because DC don't deserve it after all the crap they have put out, all the years of betrayal. Adding in Keaton is a cheap shot, I'm not falling for that.

GOTH3 is very good. I want to ask you all to remember how you felt when Iron Man came out, or Captain America - look, these aren't even highlights for me, but based on a few tattered comics from my childhood I went along for the ride, watched most of these offerings and was awarded with Thor 1, GOTG1 and Infinity War. So yes, Marvel have made some unbelievable trash, including The Marvels (I'm calling it) but this movie is something else and I think you all should give Marvel another chance.

For those of you who have lost faith after the giant starfish movie, I think Gunn just needed to get a few 'bad' movies out of his system.

This has probably his best film to date moving forward. I truly believe that upcoming DC films are in really good hands. He has really involved as a filmmaker and writer. This might actually be one of the very few films I might have to go back in theaters and rewatch. This movie has really stayed with me even the next day emotionally.

W Warlock, marvel did an amazing job in not overpowering him too early, I sense he could be the future 'Thor'-like character and actor that marvel needs ( with Hemsworth eventually leaving the MCU). The introduction was steady and learnt a lot about lots of future characters to come. Marvel did amazing with this one.

Gimora and Nebula were amazing and the CGI was phenomenal, the overall storyline was tugging at heartstrings in the origin flashbacks.

Only thing is change is, get mantis n drax together man😂, and yes I know not everyone needs a relationship to end in a happy way, but I feel the sly dissing and back n forth left plenty of room for flirting.

The digital special effects are remarkable, since in this type of film they turn out to be very generic.

1150,9.0,5-May-23,"Two days ago I watched ""Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 3"" in the cinema. Here is my personal impression of the movie. The review is absolutely spoiler free!

Plot / Storytelling / Pacing (spoiler free)

The plot is actually quite simple, but despite the simplicity there is a lot of stuff between the lines. On the surface, it's about the Guardians trying to save a friend in their own ranks and going up against the High Evolutionary in the process. Under the surface, however, it's about much more than that. It's about what friendship and trust mean and how far one would go for them. It's about sacrifice, about loyalty, and about genuine feelings between individual Guardians. It is also about the cohesion of renegades, outsiders and outcasts.

Furthermore, it is about what ""life"" means and whether there is such a thing as evolutionary perfection at all, that it is morally questionable to decide about life and death for the supposedly higher goal of the ""perfect society"" and to no longer value life itself as such, regardless of whether it is perfect or flawed. What is the use of striving for a perfect life and a perfect society, if one loses all empathy on the way there and does not even shy away from mass murder in order to achieve one's goals. Shouldn't one set an example for such a future oneself?

The film is so full of messages and it touches on many topics. Despite all these complex issues, the film still manages to come across as very light hearted, a lot of fun and enjoyable, feel good without, again, the drama also losing its power, which is also very strongly staged in some scenes. Here no eye remains dry and there are some scenes that have touched me deeply, shocked and made me gulp. Even two days after the viewing, I still have to think a lot about the plot.

It's also worth mentioning that this film addresses unanswered questions from the two predecessors and brings loose ends to a great conclusion.

To follow the plot, it is enough to know ""Guardians of the Galaxy 1 & 2"" as well as ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and ""Avengers: Endgame"". The latter two also only to know what happened to Gamora and that we are dealing here with Gamora from the past, who never came into contact with the Guardians until the events of ""Endgame"" and accordingly has a different relationship status with them.

Actors / Characters

The Guardians team continues to exude extreme charm in the third installment. The characters skillfully pass the ball to each other and one dialogue is better, more biting, funnier or more dramatic than the other. It's incredible how much fun it is to watch the Guardians, to sympathize with them or to fear for them. The actors/actresses behind Guardians know how to get me as a viewer attached to the characters and capture my heart. I fear for every single character. Of course, this is only possible because both James Gunn as director and screenwriter and the actors all seem to get along wonderfully on set. You can feel in every scene of the film how well the teamwork of the actors works with each other and with the director.

It's also great that every character is allowed to shine and there is no one who comes up short. Each character is allowed to develop (meaningfully!) and they all rise above. There are highs, there are lows, and each character contributes something to the team and to the victory. There is never a feeling that any of the characters are superfluous. Each has their strengths and weaknesses, and these are used believably and ingeniously or woven into the dialogue and plots.

Even apart from the Guardians, the actors/actresses know how to convince. Whether Sean Gunn as Kraglin, Chukwudi Iwuji as High Evolutionary or Will Poulter as Adam Warlock. Their characters are not particularly multi-layered or complex, but it is enough to generate feelings, whether disgust, anger and hatred for the High Evolutionary or sympathy for Kraglin or even hopes in Adam Warlock.

Setting

The settings are, as in the two previous films, diverse, varied and totally wacky. Whether it's the Guardians' ship, outer space, space stations made of organic matter, an Earth-like planet with alien species, Knowhere or the dark spaceship of the High Evolutionary, there's plenty of variety for the eye. The settings are always so extremely atmospheric that it's simply a feast for the eyes. The environment animations are also of the highest quality.

Camera / Editing

The camera work is once again extremely well done. The perspectives are varied and also very nicely captured. Even some of the perspectives in the Guardians' ship or at the beginning on Knowhere are a real eye-catcher. Slow camera movements and pans, so that you can examine everything nicely, without hectic or too fast cuts. In quiet scenes, but also in fast-paced action scenes, the viewer always keeps a good overview of the action. A fight scene of all Guardians in a long hallway is also ingenious. The camera work is just great.

I didn't notice anything negative about the editing either. No hectic or fast cuts that could throw me off while watching.

Action scenes / CGI

The action scenes are brilliantly staged, choreographed and great captured on camera. Every action scene is a hell of a lot of fun. The aforementioned hallway fight scene is also brilliant. Grandiose!

The animation quality or the CGI is on a very high level and can keep this high level from the beginning to the end of the movie throughout.

There are not suddenly extremely bad CGI effects here like in a ""Black Panther"" or ""She-Hulk"", but everything just looks top notch. Especially in sci-fi settings and in outer space, this makes a lot of difference and contributes to the atmosphere and immersion.

Music

The license music used is once again very successful, but overall it doesn't come close to that of the first part in my opinion. The soundtrack composed especially for the film is great, as always. Of course, the Guardians theme appears once or twice, and that always gave me goosebumps. Dramatic or dark scenes are also accompanied by appropriate music.

Humor / Drama

The humor of the film is just top notch. Almost every gag is right on the money and during the screening everyone laughed a lot, very loudly and very often. This is simply real situation comedy and spontaneous humor, no silly Waititi slapstick like ""Thor - Love & Thunder"", which just rarely ignites and is almost never really funny. No gag or joke is used inflationary often here. There is nothing like the screaming goats in ""Thor - Love & Thunder"", which were used ten times in the film. It's also great that the humor never takes the wind out of the drama's sails. Dramatic or tragic scenes are respected here and not torpedoed by gags or silly humor. Despite all the humor in the film, the plot and the film still take themselves very seriously and it often goes very heavy on the substance.

Personal conclusion

Chapeau to James Gunn! ""Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 3"" is in my eyes the perfect conclusion to the Guardians trilogy.

For me, this film is directly THE most emotional MCU film ever, both in terms of positive and negative feelings! In the cinema, no eye remained dry with me. Heftig, as so some scene and so some moment has moved me deeply and touched and as I also equally much in this film laughed from the heart.

Also visually, the film is simply a blast, which is again underlined by the great camera work.

Before another viewing I do not want to praise too much, but as of now after my first viewing this is one of my five favorite films of the entire MCU and perhaps also the best part of the Guardians trilogy! This is what a good MCU movie should look like and nothing else!

James Gunn is a great writer and director, if not the best the MCU has ever had. Too bad he's out now, but good for DC and the new DCU! I'm excited to see what he does with Superman Legacy and am in good spirits.

1158,8.0,6-May-23,"Cons Entire movie there's music that's FORCED and completely un-natural

Adam Warlock is so cringe it caused me physical pain

Every single line read by actors felt un-authentic and robotic

Jokes are terrible, they dropped the ""F"" bomb in the car scene

Peter keeps asking Gamora why Gamora doesn't remember him like how is he confused?

Movie was legit worse than Love and Thunder, at least Love n Thunder had an absolutely shredded Chris Hemsworth 90% naked and Natalie Portman

The costumes were so bad it was the only funny parts of the movie

There's moments so cringe with Rocket that half the movie theater laughed and it wasn't supposed to be funny.

Pro's So many cringe moments that my 9 year old son looked over at me and asked if we could leave

Stranger sitting next to me, asked me if his eyes were bleeding, which made me laugh so hard that I was then Shushed

Someone brought a baby that cried, giving the only performance of the entire movie genuine emotion

Conclusion: Any rating above a 3 for this movie is a bot, or a Gen Z that loves cringe for the sake of being different.

The CGI, screen play between actors, writing, casting, music choice, and general direction of events were all competing for being the worse part of the movie.

The MCU has been finished since Phase 4, and in this movie the demonstrate their resolve by continually stabbing it.

The rendering was heartfelt, gut punching and beautiful and elegant. I hugged my rescue cats a little tighter when I got home after watching GOTG3. The movie has become the BEST Marvel CBM in my book. The cast gave their best to play their assigned roles and their chemistry on screen is almost palpable.

It's a 1000/10 for me.

The musical score and the soundtrack are absolutely amazing! I can't find better superlatives to herald how good GOTG3 is.

Rocket is the heart and soul of this film. It was actually the clip of him and his friends in a cage that moved me to go to the movie house once again after more than three years. That clip with Lylla, Teefs and Flor had me weeping. The last time I went out to watch a movie as in Jan 2020, I watched Starwars the Rise of Skywalker.

89P13 is forever etched in my heart and in my mind. I have watched GOTG3 plenty enough to have memorised Rocket's batch number.

Especially since rocket is one of my favorites from the guardians. And his backstory is incredible. Me and my boyfriend were talking earlier today how some filmworks drifted away from the main plot of the story, like transformers or fast and furious (haven't seen all the movies to any but no shade), and I love how guardians of the galaxy v3 made it about rocket BUT also kept it about the guardians of the galaxy themselves and amplified traits and revealed even more about the rest of the characters, all in a perfectly linked combination. This movie made everyone in the cinema laugh for a second then have their heart clenched in the next one and then laugh at some funny phase again. It's a masterpiece and definitely worth watching.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

My only complaint was how many times it kept hitting the heart strings, very emotional film. But also fantastic in every way. It's been awhile since they made an MCU that hits hard on the heart strings, Endgame was the last film that really pulled out the emotions for me. But this one was above and beyond in that department. They balanced it out beautifully with a lot of jokes and great action. I really liked the new characters that were brought in and the story was excellent all around. This one is 100% worth the watch.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

After being attacked on their home base by one Adam Warlock, Will Poulter, Rocket Raccoon finds himself mortally hurt which prompts the rest of his comrades to find a means of getting him healed (when they discover his DNA has a lock on it which if tampered with can kill him). Primarily using Rocket's backstory to tell our main narrative, we learn the evil machinations of the High Evolutionary, played by Chudwudi Iwuji, who succeeded (if success is a barometer when an animal is given humanistic traits!) w/Rocket where his other creations haven't quite landed. Throughout a series of increasing bizarre adventures on different locations, the audience is in constant state of having lumps in their throats not knowing if one of their faves will bite the dust but Gunn is shrewd enough to know which buttons to press making this an immensely satisfying time at the cinema checking off all the relevant boxes.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

I cried a decent amount of tears when we had to say bye to them as a whole , I'm sure we will see them in different movies but not as a team which is sad but it's better to stop while people still care ! The movie has amazing visuals if there is something Guardins movies are the best in are AWESOME looking creatures , AWESOME colors ,AWESOME music and AWESOME jokes and Vol.3 has a lot of everything ! It was very well paced and I was engaged the whole time even though I was sick and felt that 3D even worse still I didn't wanna blink for a second so I don't miss a thing .

Before I saw it I actually did read a few articles about the movie and I read that many parents were actually mad because the movie made their kids sad ... and you know what I'M SO GLAD !! And those parents they should be too cause at least they know their kids are not some sickos !

THANK YOU JAMES GUNN!! Thank you for sneaking such an important and powerful message in such a popular movie that will be seen by so many even if they "" close their eyes "" when it comes to this in normal circumstances! I cried a lot. I am a person who cannot stand such stuff and it hurts the deepest parts of my soul seeing something like this . I've chosen to live the way I live because if there is one thing I believe in is equally but I know how many people out there change the subject really fast when it comes to that because deep down they know its not right but it's just easier to do nothing !!! I'm happy kids saw that !! I hope they ask questions after the movie and remember how they felt while seeing these scenes ! I don't see why would someone feel offended when this is the miserable reality and if someone's mind should be changed that's exactly the kids !

However, ""Guardians of the Galaxy 3"" swooped in to rekindle my happiness and restore my faith in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I went into the theater with tempered expectations, but I emerged with a renewed sense of joy and anticipation.

From the opening scene to the final moments, ""Guardians of the Galaxy 3"" captivated me with its perfect blend of humor, action, and heartfelt emotion. The film not only lived up to its predecessors but also stood out as one of the best entries in the Guardians franchise.

The movie takes viewers on an exhilarating and emotional journey that reminds us why we fell in love with these misfit heroes in the first place. The chemistry among the cast is electric, and the performances are top-notch, effortlessly blending comedy and genuine depth of character.

Director James Gunn's masterful storytelling shines through in this installment, as he skillfully balances the various plotlines, character arcs, and breathtaking action sequences. Gunn's creative vision for the Guardians universe is undeniable, and he has once again delivered a stellar cinematic experience that resonates with audiences.

One aspect that cannot be overlooked is the exceptional soundtrack. The carefully selected songs not only enhance the storytelling but also evoke a sense of nostalgia and emotion. After leaving the theater, I found myself playing the Guardians' OST on repeat, reliving the moments and feeling a surge of emotions all over again.

James Gunn's impressive directorial skills have garnered him well-deserved recognition, and it's thrilling to see him taking on new projects, including his upcoming work in the DC universe. With his proven ability to create memorable characters and weave engaging narratives, I can't wait to see what he brings to the table in future DC movies.

""Guardians of the Galaxy 3"" is a testament to the power of storytelling, the strength of characters, and the magic of the Marvel Universe. It brings back the joy and excitement that initially drew us to these beloved characters, and it leaves us eagerly anticipating what lies ahead. This film is a must-watch for Marvel fans and anyone in need of a heartwarming and action-packed adventure.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

Rocket has become my favorite Guardian after this movie. I have great respect for anyone that values all life (higher and lower, human and animals alike). Never abandon your friends. Especially don't abandon the furry ones that can't always fend for themselves.

It brought up emotions in me that have been spilling over since the war in Ukraine started: a need for righteous justice & revenge against a an evil overlord hellbent on exterminating you and your loved ones.

This was Marvel back to their best: excellent character development, stunning visuals and a decent story to boot.

It was a mistake to emphasize the relationships between the characters because the vast majority of them have irrational expectations and behavior; It was another mistake to put Rocket's drama as a catalyst for the film because the villain depends precisely on his relationship with Rocket and that makes any sense of danger disappear. The villain is unfortunately the weakest in Marvel history and he really looks like a jester. If you expect entertainment you will find a couple of moments to laugh (thanks to Mantis) and some interesting visuals. The rest can be said to be pretentious, unbearable, tedious and generally leaves a very bitter taste in the mouth. I rarely yelled at the good guys in a movie theater, Die!!

The film's humor is one of its strongest aspects. The jokes are clever, and the delivery is spot-on. It's impossible not to laugh when watching the Guardians bicker and banter with each other. The film also doesn't shy away from emotional moments, which are handled with care and depth.

In terms of action, the film delivers some truly impressive set pieces. The special effects are top-notch, and the fight scenes are choreographed to perfection. The soundtrack is also a standout, with a mix of classic rock and pop hits that perfectly complement the film's tone and style.

Perfect photography, I won't even talk about the direction (you will see some of the most well directed fighting scenes of at least the last few years), the dynamics between the main characters are top tier and the main focus as usual (I would've loved to see this saga as standalone without MCU references, even tho they are minimal, but this is just me asking too much, Gunn handled this perfectly) and the plot, even tho very simple, is very well paced, effective and to-the-point.

Highly recommend this movie as long as the whole saga even to people who are not into cinecomics.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
1181,8.0,9-Jul-23,"The first two Guardians of the Galaxy movies are incredibly good and fun, with their fun appearances in other Marvel movies, and fun holiday special. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) was a great ending for the Guardians, and for James Gunn's last time directing for Marvel, this movie is more serious and emotional than the earlier two Guardians of the Galaxy movies, but it still has comedy like those earlier two movies.

The whole Guardians of the Galaxy team is exceptionally good; Chris Pratt as Peter Quill/Star-Lord was great when he is trying to get over the loss of Gamora and lead the team, while also having the members of the team Drax, Groot, Mantis, and Nebula played by Dave Bautista, Vin Diesel, Pom Klementieff, and Karen Gillan who are also great in the movie. Since the focus of the movie is where Rocket came from, I am going to honestly say that Bradley Cooper as Rocket was fantastic, but he needed to be in more of the movie. You would need to see Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019) to understand the return of Zoe Saldana as a different Gamora, who is particularly good not knowing about her relationship with Peter Quill or the team.

The main villain and creator of Rocket named The High Evolutionary played by Chukwudi Iwuji was a very intimidating, weird, easy to hate villain. Doing cruel experiments to animals and Rocket's friends who Rocket made when he was held captive by the villain, and killing any experiments that do not work how he wants them to. He was easy to hate, and all the flashbacks to where Rocket is from were cute and sad whenever they would appear during the movie. I liked the appearance of Adam Warlock played by Will Poulter, and I liked the look of him, but the problem is that he only shows up at random in certain scenes without a reason when I wanted more of him; the only thing I understood was that he wanted to capture Rocket because he was working for The High Evolutionary.

The action scenes are fun and cool to watch, with there being a lot of beneficial effects, and the soundtrack is great to listen to just like the other two movies. There are a lot of emotional moments that will make you tear up with a lot of brutal moments too, but there is also good comedy that works well and is funny. The ending to the movie was nice and will make you tear up; this made Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 a great send off to the team, and nice ending to the trilogy that does have some little issues, but it was entertaining to watch.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
1182,8.0,20-May-23,"Before watching this, I read/heard alot of folks saying it was the best MCU movie in years. That it is. But I think that understates how good it is. This MIGHT well be the best MCU move...EVER.

Now, that's a high bar, IMO. And it's difficult to compare because GG3 is a different KIND of MCU movie. GG1 and 2 were the quintissential MCU movies. Funny to the max. Action packed spectacles with heart and character thrown in. GG3 dials the humor and even action WAY back, and hits you with the feels, something few MCU movies do at all...and none do so as powerfully as this one.

This movie is effectively a story about Rocket's backstory. And warning time - it's dark. Dark enough that I think you might not want to bring the little ones. Now, I am not a believer that dark==good the way the DCEU seems to believe, but the darkness is done well here and I promise you, you will choke back some tears because you feel silly crying for a CG talking animal.

Now, the movie does have a ton of action. And some of the story beats don't ALWAYS make the most sense. Like, I could definitely watch this thing and pick apart some plot holes. But the thing about making a good movie is that nitpickers like me won't bother with your plotholes. We're too busy enjoying the movie.

I don't necessarily love where all the story arcs go at the end of the movie. Peter and some of the others have direction changes that ... kind of happen too suddenly, even when I saw them coming. I definitely like the way they handled the Quill/Gamora situation. Very unconventional choice and a very good choice.

But yeah, generally - good action, good spectacle, good humor. It checks the MCU boxes. But it also is a character movie about Rocket that is just outstanding. The complaints I have are minor and didn't even bother me that much.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

I jumped in having no expectations and still, compared to the previous films, thought of it as mediocre at best. Allow me to address how much I adore the previous two films. For personal reasons they hold a very special place in my heart regardless, they are fantastic films. Unfortunately, this film felt like it was trying to cram in too many plot points at a time, not allowing the viewer to breath or comprehend what they had witnessed/heard seconds before. It did not feel as polished (likely due to COVID restrictions), nor did it feel crafted with the same love, care and passion as the previous two. And with this being the ""final film"" for this franchise, I cannot say it was a satisfying ending. This films villain, played by the brilliant Chukwudi Iwuji, was very forgettable. I can't recall he was even given a name. His cruelty and harshness came off as very forced making it difficult to see him as a real threat. I also picked out a bit more than just a handful of editing/continuity errors (which often times I can overlook) but it was honestly quite annoying. Many of the comedy bits were either not funny or cringe inducing. I will say this film does have its moments, but the positives just weren't enough to outweigh the negatives.

1186,8.0,21-May-23,"The quirky, entertaining, and distinctive Guardians series has always been a fun watch for me. As the MCU was only producing mediocre films throughout its last phase, I went to the theatre with very little hope.

Although the characters are far from ideal, they make every effort to do what is right.

What makes this movie so unique is how all of the main characters are willing to give their lives for one another when necessary, despite their incessant verbal sparring and attempt to show others that how wrong they are.

Every character received adequate screen time, which led to improved character and relationship development. Writer/director ""James Gunn"" did an excellent job with the screenplay. We are able to comprehend the reasoning behind Villain's actions and those of his accomplice.

The choice of vibrant, colourful attire and bizarre set design fits this universe so perfectly. I never enjoy seeing too much CGI used to create worlds, but I was pleasantly surprised by how stunning, distinct, imaginative, and immersive the entire universe is.

What a great soundtrack and background music for various scenes, it emotionally draws the spectator in.

Excellent action set pieces. Particularly the fight scene in the hallway, which was shot in a single extended take, is one of the most intriguing long shots I've ever seen. It features beautiful camera movements that give the impression that you're in the middle of the action.

The thing that stands out to me is how, from a writing perspective, they are able to inject humor into chaotic situations and emotionally taxing passages. When humor and humorous dialogue produce moving moments, it is just gold.

And the main character ""Rocket Raccoon"" will make you cry with his past with the other subjects of batch 89. And then you get to understand why he is the way he is in current time.

Movie could have been little shorter as some scenes were stretched a little and missed the mark. The screenplay doesn't do ""Adam Warlock"" justice as ""the perfect cosmic being"" that he is, and if he had been developed more, his final moment may have had greater emotional impact.

The Rick & Morty-style sci-fi that we had hints of in the first two are given full bloom in the third film. Not a negative, necessarily: that style of humour and irreverent science fiction is very fun to watch. But that means we also don't go deep into a sense of high-stakes threat or intriguing mystery (something which Infinity War did so well). While I appreciated Rocket's backstory, and his friends' attempts to save him, this story didn't fire the imagination like the first two Guardians movies did. The plot's developments were also more predictable than the first two: a few times I correctly guessed the next scene...

Vol. 3 generally felt a bit more kids-friendly, what with all the animals, cute aliens and children (indeed, Return of the Jedi did something similar by introducing Ewoks and going overboard with puppet-aliens...a now oft-criticised move).

The cast are all on top form, as always. Tho' it's frustrating from a viewer perspective that this Gamora has to reset her relationships with everyone...it was however as neatly done as can be expected. The antagonist is played expertly by Chukwudi, but his performance can't quite save the not-credible character of the High Evolutionary, a clumsily-scripted and underwhelmingly-directed Big Bad. Ego, and even Ronan, were a bit more compelling overall.

The music, such an addictively-strong part of the first two films, doesn't quite hit the same way. Song choices seem uninspired, the production (the sound) of said songs clashes with what's on screen, rather than complements...

...as a certain character mused, the soundtrack sorely needed some King Crimson, specifically Belew-era. That bit of edge, a bit of that experimental avant-garde; while still sounding pop, fresh & mainstream. Come to think of it, the story could've done with a bit of King Crimson too.

If my review sounds a little harsh, it's only because after two strong 9/10's, and being aware of rave reviews for the third one, I was expecting something really epic. Vol. 3 still deserves the 8/10 as despite going the easy route and going 'for the feels', those feels worked...even if they were predictable. The jokes landed fine, a couple genuinely laugh-out-loud funny! There's some outstanding action & FX (one single-take battle scene near the end is particularly noteworthy). The whole package is very fine fun entertainment, a worthy end to the trilogy as long as expectations are dialled down a little...

Some things can be difficult to understand without the MCU knowledge but in general could the trilogy be outside of the MCU, so definitely a recommendation for aswell non-MCU Fans.

Some pros for the movie: It's hilarious - I've never laughed so much in a movie like in this one. Overall I really like the humor in these movies. Another thing what works really well is how the action scenes are choreographed. It's stunning to watch. Another thing the movie makes completely right is the way how it staged to bring this dramatic and sadish flavour to the movie.

On the contra side aren't that much things to mention except for one story arc you will see. Without spoiler I think it's way too easy written. Like in a child movie where everything works just out. But to be honest is that all I can complain about actually.

So I will definitely recommend the movie to everyone who likes science fiction. Even if you don't like the MCU (like me) it's amazing to watch such a movie.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

The ""No Sleep Till Brooklyn"" scene was epic. Beastie Boys playing while the Guardians do some work.

There is a great mix of humor, intrigue, drama, action suspense and love in this movie. It leaves you wanting for more, wanting to know what happens to everyone and how they get on. James Gunn absolutely did an amazing job. Love the move and recommend it to all.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

There are quite a lot of scenes that caused me, as an adult, emotional distress. I cried a lot during this movie. This is a very good movie that I would not bring a kid to see. I would probably bring a kid to see Fast X before this movie. That said, I saw this in IMAX and it's the best makeup, costumes, DP work, CGI work etc that I've seen in a movie so far. The action scenes are very very good because of the DP work. For the bad... There was just too much music used. I can't even remember what songs were in this movie, and I saw the movie last night. However, I can remember the songs in the first GOTG. Some of the story just didn't make sense or seemed unnecessary to me. Like the ending. Subjectively, I just don't like the ending. It doesn't make sense considering the plot of the movie. There seemed to be a lot of stream of thought adlibbing or dialogue that just seemed like ADHD bouncy braining of a script writer, which I didn't care for since I personally deal with it in daily life. I don't like what they did with Groot's dialogue. Overall, Rocket stole the show as usual. Love him. I'm glad I saw this in theater-specifically IMAX.

The best lesson Marvel can take from this movie is to trust its directors more and give them free rein to do what they do best from the basic guidelines of Feige's plans.

In GotG3, the freedom that was given to James Gunn is very noticeable, since this film has many similarities with Suicide Squad. The vulgar humor, the explicit battles, the visceral forms, and the extreme emotion. The characters are at the maximum of their abilities, displaying an action show worthy of the best years of the MCU.

The directorial work stands out, with the use of unconventional lenses, the dizzying sequence shots of action scenes, the soundtrack full of rock hits from past decades and the visual effects, which this time are at their highest level, making us forget resounding failures in this regard, as in She-Hulk and Quantumania.

Perhaps the most reprehensible thing is that there are certain details that aren't very neat in editing, revealing a crude process of cutting and eliminating scenes, to prevent the film from being even longer.

The third and final part of James Gunn's work at Marvel is better than its two predecessors, envisioning a successful path for the future DCU.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
1205,8.0,25-Jul-24,"An excellent way to conclude 'Guardians of the Galaxy'.

'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3' is my favourite of the trilogy, it's easily top ten from the MCU as a whole too. There's a ridiculous amount of heart placed in throughout, none more so than with a certain Rocket Racoon; those early scenes are so well done visually. Plenty of seriousness doesn't stop the humour though, of which there is - as one would expect - plenty... that carrot face gag actually got me most.

The cast/characters are such a ragtag team, on paper I don't actually think they all fit together perfectly but in actuality it is a great bunch to follow. As for newcomers elsewhere in the film, Chukwudi Iwuji puts in a strong showing; I enjoyed him in 'Peacemaker' so good to see him further here.

All round, a thoroughly entertaining movie and a fitting wrap up... to this set of Guardians, at least.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

This was like watching a horror movie. I had my eyes shut through a lot of it. I don't like animal experiments at the best of times. I know it was Rockets story but did they have to make it so horrendous. It was mainly loud explosions and the characters shouting at each other. They kicked the whatever out of the mixed tape and music. What made it worse was our Odean cinema had the sound way too loud my ears were ringing afterwards. The other two movies had me laughing, crying and wanting more. This one I wanted to walk out of half way through. It seems to have become like a lot of the other Marvel movies.

1208,4.0,15-May-23,"I went into this film with really low expectations since the last couple of movies films have been more than forgettable but this movie was something incredibly different, James Gunn was able to make a great ending for such an amazing set of characters by expanding on everything we thought we knew about them the main example would be rocket raccoon (which once again was played brilliantly by Bradley Cooper) and how the plot and the villain revolve mostly of his back story which was an incredible story to show how he became who he is all while making the audience tear up.

Chukwudi Iwuji did an incredible job of selling the threat the high evolutionary was and frankly, I found it refreshing that Marvel is doing villains who are just pure evil where I feel like in the past couple of movies they have made they have tried to make you feel empathetic for the villain wherever it's the villain trying to reconnect with their family (Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness) or whether they are avenging their family (Thor: Love and Thunder) so it is nice to see a villain who you can see as just pure evil and completely deranged.

Once again every member of the guardians were played so well by each actor with some old side characters such as nebula taking centre stage this time which I thought was really enjoyable and nice to see such a good character being put into the spotlight and the same with kraglin who in the past was just a background character behind yondu but now hes a full fledged character trying to prove to the team he can be useful like yondu was and the new character introduced being adam warlock (whos played by the comedic genius will poulter) was a fun and charming character my only problem with him and really the whole film is that hes called this top of the evolution chain superhuman but really throughout the film he does not do much hes just there and the only relevance he plays to the plot being at the start after that he just pops up every 20 or minutes (side note: I personally wasn't the happiest with how they used him overall as in the original comics hes this powerhouse who was used to take down thanos so to reduce him to just some little side character who doesn't show off too much power just feels like a injustice to a very important character in the marvel universe but is coming more from a comic fan then a movie critic).

Any film following a team that's directed by james gunn whether they are a group of renegade heros trying to protect the cosmos, a team of criminals sent out to be toys for the government to earn their freedom or a team of young mystery solvers, he always knows how to capture that team and/or family feeling with the bond between them all whether it's the serious moments where lives are on the line or just sitting around having a banter james knows exactly what to have them say and do to make to make them feel like they are all a real family and the same works with how he makes the films this film was such a bright and fun bit of entertainment for all the family to enjoy which knows when its time to be dumb and silly and when to be serious and it all works so well with eachother where like more recent marvel movies you could have a serious and tense scene but then all that serious feeling be taken away by a badly timed joke which hasn't landed well but that's not what happens here all the jokes and funny moment stay to their own parts to not ruin the impact the seriousness some of the moments in the film had.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

That big bloke is funny. Some bits in it about a spaceship, I think there was a bit where you were thinking 'yeah, he's well dead, oh wait, for some preposterous reason that totally defies all known physics and biology, he isn't dead no more because of the power of redemption'.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a fantastic addition to the popular Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise. Like its predecessors, it combines action, humor, and heart to create an unforgettable cinematic experience that will leave audiences satisfied and excited for what's to come.

One of the strengths of this film is its character development. Each member of the Guardians team is given time to shine and is given a storyline that adds depth to their already beloved personalities. Writer/Director James Gunn masterfully takes their stories in new and unexpected directions, while also managing to stay true to the characters that fans have come to know and love.

Another standout aspect of the film is its incredible soundtrack. Continuing the tradition of the previous two films, the soundtrack is packed with hits from the 80s and 90s, perfectly setting the tone for the film and adding to the overall enjoyment of the viewing experience.

Without giving away any spoilers, it's safe to say that the story is exciting, emotional, and ties up loose ends from earlier films in a satisfying way. The film also features stunning visual effects that transport audiences to different worlds and allow them to fully immerse themselves in the Guardians' adventures.

Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a worthy conclusion to this beloved series and a must-see for fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

The storytelling is similar to the one once George Lucas did in Star Wars. I think the film deserves all the praise it gets. The soundtrack is very good, but nothing special.

What I like too is the graphics and the villain. Rocket Racoon's story is one of the missing pieces.

James Gunn will make a big hole if he leaves Disney. The film was sometimes boring at the beginning, but the buildup was perfect.

I recommend watching the chrismas special before it otherwise you won't get some details.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

Without the romantic tension and without Rocket in full form for most of the film, it's weak. Too bad. What happened? Different writer? Different director? Whatever it is, it's too bad.

Gunn finds a way to make us cry, feel anger, laugh, and marvel as the best MCU Franchise comes to a close.

Through Adam Warlock and the out-of-time Gamora, we see through their eyes as they both realize how much family means to each Guardian, all who had lost nearly all the family they ever had before.

Warlock is a bit underutilized, but this was not his story to tell; it was Quill's, Drax's, Mantis's, Nebula's, Gamora's, Kraglin's, Groot's, and especially Rocket's.

The villan was wonderfull and the actor is captivating, in every scene that he is in your afraid because he is powerful but also unstable. It's great that we get to see the past of a character and also see him grow through this movie. Friendly advice go watch the movie now, and bring a lot of tissues.

Some are picking flaws in plot or saying too many explosions - don't listen to that. It is not meant to be a cinematic masterpiece. It does what it has always done, it brings the entertainment and it makes you feel all the feels. That is by no means a bad thing.

Immensely satisfying end to a wonderful series, I wholeheartedly admit I am not emotionally prepared to let these characters go.

Rocket is attracting here. I never thought he was that clear, like a genius. As the main character in this film, Rocket is the shinning star, a real one show his talent and love to all creatures.

That being said, this movie is fantastic.

It's a bit slow to get going but once's it does it really is a fun ride.

My son (8 years old) loved it as did I. Well worth your time. If you haven't seen it already.

1219,5.39,20-May-23,"Guardians of the Galaxy 1 was one of my favourite MCU films. It was silly, funny, but also had characters that had enough depth that you felt something. The sequel was similar but not quite as good.

Volume 3 to me was similar to 1 except we have about a decade of build up totalling 7 MCU appearances and back story galore. They feel like family to me at this point and so that's what made this farewell of a film so emotional. It has the humour we know, but depth and emotion well beyond anything I think we have seen in the MCU so far. The first official F-bomb is perfectly placed in such a casual way which makes it even more effective.

Guardians volume 3 is now one of my favourite MCU entries and I am looking forward to THE DCU with Gunn and expect Superman legacy to be amazing. Marvel over the last couple of years has been very disappointing and they have definitely dropped the ball. That's another reason why I think Guardians 3 feels so good!","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

If you are going to watch thus movie, watch it in the theater but bring tissues. It doesn't deliver the heart break of the Red Wedding, but it dances right up to that line.

Overall each character gets the right amount of screen time to feel like they are part of the movie rather than part of the set though Rocket plays an outsized role.

A balanced display of all characters of Guardians of Galaxy. Every scene was captured with great exhibit of emotions by all the actors.

Overall, this movie's ending wasn't as emotional as I expected; the emotion is kind of spread throughout the whole movie. If you liked this movie I would also recommend Bullet Train and Dungeons and Dragons. They're both similar movies to this one: messy but extremely fun. Personally, I found D&D to be better than Guardians of the Galaxy 3, and since it's in the theaters right now I need people to watch it so I can have a sequel. All in all, Guardians of the Galaxy 3 is a fun, funny, crazy, and fitting ending to an amazing trilogy (if you've made it this far just know I'm not usually this bad at writing).

I felt nothing from this, mote like cheated from the greatness it once was. What an utter disappointment.

This 3rd installment is inline with the previous two parts and will not feel out of place at any point of time. Which we have earlier seen with ant-man 3.

Adam warlock is also introduced, hopefully we get to see him in future.

The movie centers around rocket and how his journey has been. It also focuses of character development of Nebula, drax and mantis. Peter and Gamora also reconnect in a way which feels natural and not forced. I am very glad that movie focuses on every character and not just romantic angle between Peter and Gamora. (I was completely expecting movie's focus to be on this, but to my surprise it was not).

The movie in a word is fun. Very enjoyable and a satisfying ending. Camera work and music are especially brilliant.

It beautifully explores themes of self-hatred, the profound significance of family bonds and ultimately self acceptance reminding us of the strength and growth that comes from embracing who we truly are.

This movie has the gravitas lacking in so many newer Marvel films. It gives you greater emotional pull either of the first two, but still has all the heart and probably the best action sequences to boot. The fight in the hallway is particularly good!

Oh, and let's not leave out that the main villain, High Evolutionary, is one of the most developed and real villains we've had in some time. Easily the most menacing since Thanos.

I cannot believe I am saying this but, finally in the last few years, I actually enjoyed a mcu movie since ""Avengers: Endgame (2019)"" with a few exceptions in between like ""Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) and ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022)"". Most of the movies and tv shows released in between were terrible, lacking stories and characters and were all around boring and bad.

James Gunn successfully ends the guardians of the galaxy trilogy and his journey with marvel with a gem of a movie like an icing on the cake.

This movie really brought back the original vibe and charm of the marvel movies back in the first phases without any garbage whatsoever to fit whatsoever (up to you to interpret what that means). It was coherent with the narrative and everything actually made sense.

Marvel usually overdoses in throwing in jokes and comedy whenever they can and it misses most of the time but with this movie, 95% of the jokes were hitting and I was actually cracking a smile during them even though I usually don't especially with the character of Drax. The other 5% were the Mantis jokes which FOR ME, weren't hitting MOST of the time, but in general it was all good.

All the cast were amazing no need to mention all of them everyone knows the crew at this point.

The High Evolutionary, which is the main villain which was played by Chukwudi Iwuji was very good and it shows that villains that are just filled with pure evil and nothing more while lacking motive can sometimes still be as good.

As to Adam warlock, I was very excited to see him on the big screen since I last saw him in the ""marvel's guardians of the galaxy"" game, and he delivered but I was bit disappointed with how much screen time he got, he got decent screen time but I just wished I've seen more with him with some more depth around him.

The way James Gunn gives space to each of the characters (even the minor ones) is incredible. I highly recommend watching this (although 3D is not worth it as it doesn't add a lot).

I also believe there is no absolute need to watch both previous movies. There are mentions of those here as well but not enough to stop you from enjoying it. It does add to the emotional background (which helped to why I couldn't stop crying towards the end of film).

Disney's track record of taking a franchise and running it into the ground with politics and agendas took a small break here with the only obvious attempts at inserting their political will as they attempted to make Nebula gender nonbinary, hiding the natural beauty of Karen Gillian with costuming and weird poses (see poster).

All, in all, I was provided a free screening so at least I did not have to pay for this movie, as I would be one I would wait for to come out in the $4.99 bargain rate on iTunes or Amazon Prime.

You feel like you can connect with them and are desperately hoping for their final outcome to be a good one.

This movie is not only a farewell, but it gives us yet another great adventure with the perfect mix of comedy and seriousness blended together with a soundtrack that is fitting and absolutely spot on. This alone would be enough, but it goes even further to deliver us the background story of Rocket. It also manages to bounce between Rockets story and the present adventure seamlessly. If Rockets story doesn't put you in the feels then I don't know what will. It certainly will be difficult for some viewers to watch as James Gunn isn't one to hold back when trying to hammer home a point and Rocket's story is no exception. Some scenes are incredibly difficult to watch due to the cruelty displayed, but it is Gunn's way of acknowledging harsh realities and how brutal and tyrannical the High Evolutionary truly is.

In my view the High Evolutionary was a much more compelling villain than even Kang in Quantumania who is tagged to be the Big Bad. The High Evolutionary's appeal as a villain is a combination of a significantly better script and an absolutely fantastic performance from Chukwudi Iwuji. The rest of the Guardians also play their roles beautifully and are casted perfectly. Each of them is also provided the correct amount of screen time to tell their story as well.

I hope the other Marvel directors take note of Gunn's success as he departs for the DCU. Every Guardians of the Galaxy film has managed to develop its characters while telling a story, something sorely lacking in other recent Marvel films.

For me this is the best Marvel movie since Infinity War (which I have pegged above Endgame).

Enjoy this film as we may not get another Marvel movie of this quality for quite some time.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"

1244,5.39,5-May-23,The movie pans out in a seemingly random fashion where you gotta think where it is leading too. Then from there on you get a picture of what's it is all about! The writer has done justice and made the movie so surreal that it triggers your imagination and also gives you the emotional connection to it. It's more of a celebration of the team and the efforts that they put in all the other three. The plot is rather simple but the characters were complex and had you thinking what's coming next. I believe this is by far better than the others just released as it hits hard into the present and as well as the future of the series. It has a great ending to it and nothing beats it better than a popcorn and a cup of soda to it ! So cheers.,"May 5, 2023 (United States)"

1247,5.39,19-May-23,"Boom! I'm not convinced the MCU is back to it's top level status, but this is a top tier MCU movie. I'ts easily in the top ten territory, with some even putting it above the first Guardians movie, though personally I'm not set on that... yet.

Also, if there was ever an MCU movie that is going to produce tears, it's this one.

Probably not a secret by this point, but one of the Guardians back stories gets explored, and we get to see what they've been hiding under that mask all this time. It's an emotional gut punch to say the least.

That being said, it still had all the charm and comedy that you'd expect from a Guardians film. The music, as always was practically perfect. Alternate timeline Gamora was great.","May 5, 2023 (United States)"
