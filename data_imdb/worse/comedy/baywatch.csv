7.0,30 May 2017,"I don't review movies too often, but when I saw all the horrible reviews for this movie, I felt the need to write my own. I have a feeling that most of the people who rated this movie poorly haven't seen the movie at all (like a lot of ratings on IMDb) or just have no sense of humor at all. Is this movie action-packed? Yes! Does the movie include a lot of dick jokes, bouncing boobs and swearing? Yes! Did I enjoy the movie? Oh yeah! Will it be an Oscar winner? Of course not! It's not that kind of movie. People take things too seriously.

If you liked Baywatch like I did, check out Zac Efron in Dirty Grandpa and Dwayne Johnson in The Other Guys."
7.0,22 February 2023,"My review for this movie is sort of late as I had zero interest in viewing it when it came out. The trailers looked silly, bad, cringy so I skipped. Now, almost 6 years later it has come to pass that there was nothing better on the TV, so I gave it a chance.

Is the movie Bad? Yes. It is very selfaware though, over the top, silly and dare I say... fun. The movie is just ridiculous in a good way, making fun of but also tributing the original series.

The plot is simple, the actors are just having fun on set. The CGI is laughable, but I believe on purpose. There is a part with a rescue from a burning boat. The flames look so fake that it was funny in it's own right (sharknado level CGI in fact).

Do not expect inteligent humor, do not expect a well thought out plot, effects or acting.

In fact, this movie is probably best consumed with a group of friends and a side of alcohol. I went into this movie with absolutely zero expectations and came out pleasantly surprised with how much I was entertained."
7.0,24 July 2019,"I can understand a bit why you guys rates it that low. You probably wanted a good plot. When I walked into the theaters I expected 3 things: Muscles, macho and action. It's not about the plot. It doesn't matter with a cliché-plot, because It's all about what I mentioned. Watch this movie again, and focus on those three things. I loves Baywatch because of these things!"
2.0,24 May 2017,"It's fair to say that Baywatch was never a great television show. Sure, it was popular but for reasons very different to it actually being a quality show. It was trashy as hell and combined slow-motion with a number of scantily clad supermodels running down the beach in bathing suits so no surprises at all that it attracted viewers.

There seems to be a bit of a trend in reviving franchises that were popular back in the 80s and 90s, and right now, it was the turn of Baywatch. Quite why is something that I'm still scratching my head about.

When Mitch Buchanan (Dwayne Johnson) butts heads with new recruit Matt Brody (Zac Efron) over how to run Baywatch, they uncover a local criminal plot that threatens the future of the bay.

As soon as the film started and we see Dwayne Johnson saving someone before Baywatch rises from the sea in giant letters behind him, I immediately thought this was going to be exactly what a Baywatch film should be if it was to be successful. A self aware comedy made as a parody of the show, in the same way that made the Jump Street films such a critical and financial success.

We get flashes of that formula however, for the most part, Baywatch is just an awful film. Painfully unfunny and not one memorable action sequence means it utterly fails as the action comedy it set out to be, and with a runtime of two hours it becomes one hell of a slog to sit through.

I tried to enjoy it and take it for what it is but the problem is I just can't do that when there seems to be no effort into making the film funny, particularly when watching a comedy. Literally every other joke is a dick joke, including an overly long joke about one of the new recruits getting their dick stuck in a deck chair. I knew it was going to be silly and I didn't have high expectations at all but sadly they weren't even met.

Coming to the performances, Baywatch is absolutely lifeless. Even Dwayne Johnson or Zac Efron, who has shown good comedic timing before, can't save this from becoming the absolute car wreck that it is. Alexandra Daddario, Kelly Rohrbach and Ilfenesh Hadera are sure nice to look at but the film fails them totally in giving them anything interesting to do, Daddario in particular who is actually quite a talented actress. Then there is Jon Bass who delivers an irritant of a performance as he hopelessly lusts after Rohrbach's CJ Parker. I felt embarrassed for them as they had to perform such a terrible script.

I won't even waste time in talking about the pathetic cameo that David Hasselhoff makes in the film. All I will say is what a waste of a cameo that had much better potential if they'd actually stopped to think about it.

So there you have it, Baywatch is an awful film that fails as both an action and a comedy. It's already one of the worst films I've seen this year and I won't be surprised if it's still up there come the year's end."
6.0,26 May 2017,"It's a warm, beautiful day on the beach. The pristine waves crash gently against the sand as the sun-kissed folk of Southern Florida come out to play. Lifeguard Post 1 stands like a sentinel - its windows permanently cocked forward towards the horizon. There's a change in the wind. A wind surfer looses control of his sail and is catapulted upward towards the sky before plummeting, head first into a coral reef. He's knocked unconscious...all seems lost. Then Mitch Buchannon (Johnson) appears on the scene.

What results is a valiant rescue that inexplicably involves slow-motion running, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson flexing his pectorals underwater, fireworks and dolphins for some reason. The movie could have stopped right there as by that point we got the best version of what could have been the cinematic version of a far-fetched TV show. Unfortunately the first fifteen minutes aren't so much a harbinger of the hilarity to come but rather a visual metaphor for the movie's inflated sense of self.

The film energetically sets up its main characters with all-too-brief introductions on tryout day. We immediately endear ourselves veterans Stephanie (Hadera), C.J. (Rohrbach) and Mitch as they judge incoming trainees the tough and brainy Summer (Daddario), the dorky Ronnie (Bass) and disgraced former Olympic swimmer Matt Brody (Efron) whose ego Mitch sees as a liability. Much of the film's prouder moments are spent with The Rock and Efron doing what they do best; The Rock deflating Brody's ego with real-deal charisma and action hero one-liners - Efron playing the dim-witted, put-upon jock who deserves everything he has coming to him because he was in High School Musical (2006).

But just when you think everything will turn out for this movie, the narrative drastically shifts to a crime story that stops the movie's momentum cold. The narrative thrust involves the new owner of the beach's fancy yacht club (Chopra) and her suspicious connection to a new designer drug called Flaka. The rest of the movie doesn't so much spend time exploring that connection or its implications (Chopra compares herself favorably to a Bond villain pretty much from the get go) but instead it lays every aspect of the conspiracy out on the table and waits for the lifeguards to connect the dots.

This ploy not only doesn't work but it basically splits Baywatch into two completely unsatisfying pieces. The first piece brings a diversity of comic set-pieces which on their own, probably couldn't make a good sketch on Key and Peele (2012-2015). They lack a depth of character requiring one or two of them to be more gullible, less resourceful or otherwise dumber than what was previously established.

The other half of the movie plants its flag firmly on The Rock's ability to recap what we already know while Priyanka Chopra chews unhelpfully on the scenery until the timer runs out. All throughout the film drops hints that you should care about this or that - an insert shot of a watch brings more pause than a fiery boat rescue. Yet because nothing new is ever revealed, the film's call for attention becomes soporifically annoying.

The overall tone of the film is also aggressively reductive, treating the, in retrospect quaint misogyny of the original series with an uncomfortable amount of contrarian glee. Every time one of the girls of Baywatch justifiably call out the boys for being pervs, the payoff by the end of the film amounts to nothing more than quid pro quo ribbing or worse - they end up with the dude at the end. If Baywatch had just treated the subject as window-dressing, I might have been inclined to let it go (after all trash TV is trash TV). Unfortunately the movie stops just short of waving its d**k in the air while saying ""you think we're being sexist, f**k you bruh!"" Thus I think its worth a brief mention.

Baywatch has all the necessary ingredients to make a pretty satisfying comedic soup. Unfortunately apart from The Rock and Efron standing out as the film's sole saving graces, everything else is squandered on a useless story, oblivious editing and a unifying tone that's unnecessarily combative. Unless you're the type of person who truly believes Kelly Rohrbach's slo-mo runs along the beach are enough to maintain your attention, I suggest skipping out on this aggressively unfunny movie.

On a related note: Stop with the dorky guy gets the hot girl for doing nothing cliché. It's been done a hundred times before, you're bringing nothing new to the table and it's come to the point where if you do it at all it just feels icky. The Sam Witwickys of the the world should have to, you know, work for it now."
2.0,7 February 2020,Not that the original was a masterpiece but hell this is way too bad....
7.0,30 May 2017,
2.0,26 May 2017,"When will Hollywood comedies of this decade hire writers who at least have a clue of comedy? Why hire immature morons who think the idea of a dick is funny and can replace a good script. Hollywood seems to be obsessed with male nudity and full frontal at that in this decade.If it is in the right context it could be funny but haven't seen one this decade. What happened to the writers of 40-year old virgin,knocked up,etc? This movie is a pathetic excuse for a comedy and is particularly sad since there was an opening for a new franchise which has been firmly grounded. Avoid if you are lucky and watch 'Central Intelligence' if you want to see the Rock in a good comedy!"
7.0,29 May 2017,"I'm a giant fan of Kelly Rohrbach. I met her three times and at the latest time I asked her about her role on Baywatch. She said she was nervous about it, I told her she would do well and I'd be there in the theaters to watch her film debut. Fast forward a year, and this has happened. Kelly was so great and unbelievably sexy in the film which is great. That's really not all though. I'm not gonna lie I had a bit of a blast watching this film. Its stupid and crude but its a lot of fun and gave me all of what I was expecting.

The film is about a group of lifeguards on a beach and three trainees who try to make it into the squad. Once they join the team they realize all is not what it seems on the beach. Murder's are being covered up and drugs are being embezzled through the beach and the team must take the responsibility of uncovering what's going on while protecting their beach. I have never seen the TV show but from what I've heard the film is more R-rated and a bit more comedic than the TV show. I'll take it. I don't care what the critics say this film was satisfying. Its raucous and cheesy but fun. Its excessive on dick jokes, but you'll leave. The plot is pretty predictable but I can forgive it. The soundtrack is GREAT too, although I'll say the song placement isn't always great.

The main complaint I have is some characters really being bland. Especially that of Alexandra Daddario and Ilfenesh Hadera weren't developed and had no real depth. Hadera should have had more going on and it seemed like the ""love story"" between her was a bit under-filled. There was longing with these characters. Also wasn't that keen on the beauty and the geek scenario that was hammered in. I also didn't buy Priyanka Chopra as a villain. Hasslehoff and Pamela Anderson's names should be taken off the opening credits just for the nostalgic surprise appearances.

I also really liked that the film was self-aware. It was aware of the climate of the TV show, just like how they mention how everyone can see people moving in slow motion. I can't deny that Dwayne Johnson is a born movie star. Can do action and comedy equally and he always has great compatibility with Zac Efron (he always does well in the buddy scenario). All the jokes don't land but Efron provides some good comedy. Overall, there's a few laughs, a generic and predictable plot, but its a very fun time. It's a perfect summer movie with some 10/10 babes on the bitch. Its a lot of fun, enjoy. I hope there's a sequel.

7.5/10"
1.0,25 May 2017,"The humor was sophomoric.. I can't believe some of the lines being delivered by the actors. I guess if you're getting paid millions you'll concede to saying anything.

Could have been done so much better. Lazy writing. Lazy plot.. but I guess some audiences will fall for this. They will serve a certain demographic.. unfortunately it's not mine."
8.0,28 May 2017,"Baywatch is super cheesy, low brow, campy, ridiculous, etc, etc.....but you know what? That's enjoyable sometimes! You don't knowingly buy a ticket to a movie like this and then go write a review afterwards complaining about plot, teenage boy humour, and character development. hahaha. I had low expectations, shut my brain off at the door, and enjoyed this movie for what it was."
7.0,28 May 2017,"In ""Baywatch"" beauty doesn't conquer stupid. It ends up a tie at best, on points. People Magazine's 2017 Sexiest Man Alive Dwayne Johnson, ""The Rock"", stars as iconic lifeguard Mitch Buchannon in Director Seth Gordon's ""Baywatch""—his recreation and homage to the worldwide TV syndication phenom. All the lifeguards, sans one by narrative, are stunningly beautiful. In reassuring self-mockery Gordon vividly recreates the classic ""slow-mo"" running shots of his stars in homage to the original series. In the introductory beach sequence, wannabe life guard Ronnie, played by charming soft-bodied geek Jon Bass, gazes longingly at the crush of his life C.J. Parker, played by beautiful, sweet former Sports Illustrated Model Kelly Rohrbach, as she runs emerging from the ocean.

It's a shame on several levels, because the cast like Rohrbach and Johnson are amazingly beautiful, and they are also charismatic, funny, and charming. Unfortunately, those attributes are distinctly lacking in Damian Shannon and Mark Swift's dreadfully erratic screenplay. A real embarrassment.

Along with Rohrbach and The Rock, Zac Efron and Alexandra Daddario bring their comically charming A-games. Efron is totally jacked; his body is ripped beyond, giving even The Rock competition. Efron plays disgraced 2-time Olympic swimming Gold Medalist bad-boy Matt Brody, a thinly veiled caricature of Ryan Lochte. Except here, Efron infuses more heart and character to bear as Brody. Daddario plays Summer, the young marine biologist whose dream is being the lifeguard who saves others. Efron's Brody quickly falls for Summer upon their meeting at Baywatch tryouts. Daddario endures the movie's blatant boob punch line, brilliantly understating her smarts, and radiance.

Well, nuance is not inherent to ""Baywatch"" given the campy source material of the TV series. However, the narrative tonal currents make your headache. At the lifeguard tryouts Johnson's Mitch iterates that at Baywatch, ""We save lives."" In the awesome opening scene Mitch courageously saves an unconscious surfer from certain death. Later Mitch and Brody dramatically save the drowning Mother and her two young children near the pier. Offset this with Director Gordon numerous penis jokes, and incoherent story-line, and you'll both laugh and scratch your head. Farce and self-mockery don't mix, mainly because they are redundant. ""Baywatch"" is stupid, funny. More often it is stupid, stupid. There is one sequence where Johnson fights the bad guy with baby toys. Yeah. The Rock is the coolest action star, so this makes absolutely no sense.

Johnson is at his movie star best as Mitch—charming, bright, and swag. He and Efron have the very cool screen partnership and bromance. When Efron's Brody arrives at Baywatch he expects his entitled pass to lifeguard, because of his Olympic Gold. Mitch and second-in-command Stephanie played by gorgeous and under leveraged Ilfenesh Hadera, tell him, ""We don't give a f***!"" Brody predictably lets Mitch down. In the nice scene Mitch tells Brody, ""I watched you win your 2 gold medals in the Olympics. It was amazing"" But Brody did that alone. He is part of a team now. He enlightens Brody that he is a selfish jerk. Mitch sees greatness in Brody; he needs to grow up.

Shannon and Swift's script fails miserably, instead opting for the ridiculous story-line about evil femme fatale Victoria, played by exasperating Priyanka Chopra, and her drug trafficking scheme of the meth-like designer drug in hopes of owning all real estate in Emerald Bay. However, not at all threatening, Victoria lands as extremely annoying, more the effect of the writing. Instead of more charm of the whimsical Mitch-Brody bromance, we get stupid morgue jokes that extend way too long. In the inadvertent signature moment Brody offers his hysterical misinterpretation of computer networks while Ronnie attempts to hack into the villain's secure server. Ronnie tells Brody, ""It's a good thing you're pretty."" Pretty alone isn't enough to save ""Baywatch"".

There is the spectacular montage as the Baywatch lifeguards all run in classic slow-mo on the beach. Seeing those perfectly sculpted bodies in red Speedos is stunning and the sentimental homage. The actors in ""Baywatch"" are both beautiful and gifted. It's a shame that ""Baywatch"" didn't save them as well."
5.0,22 July 2017,"Baywatch... Based of the 1990s TV series starring David Hasselhoff, about lifeguards... with some bewbs in between... And now, it's a movie, starring The Rock... Now in theaters, in my country...

Everyone already knows when your source material is ""this"", it was a recipe for disaster, and oh boy, it IS bad (but they know it!)

Let's start with the acting. Literally all the main characters are great. Dwayne Johnson is likable as always. Zac Efron is also good in this movie. The bromance between The Rock and Efron is probably the best thing in this movie. Alexandra Daddario... from Percy Jackson to this, she really does improved and in this movie, she probably gave her best performance so far. What's surprising is the comic relief guy, played by Jon Bass. He's no annoying/trouble making guy, he's actually helping the team, which is great, well done writers. Kelly Rohrbach and Ilfenesh Hadera is also great as C.J. and Steph respectively (although C.J. was overly sexualized, but that's pretty normal in this movie, obviously). Priyanka Chopra is way to good for this movie. I mean she could took something else rather than this. The cameos from Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson were also great.

Everything else is... 70% garbage. The story is awful. So convoluted, so many plot holes. The pacing is uneven. The fight scenes were so disappointing. There so many quick cuts and close ups in the fight scenes, especially those involve The Rock. You don't need quick cuts and close ups for the fight scenes, you got a former wrestler in this movie! He definitely can fake fight scenes. The visual effects in this movie is a joke. There's not a single CGI looked convincing in this movie.Every scenes that should be intense is gone thanks to the easily noticeable CGI fires and CGI explosions. I was expecting more practical than CGI, but now I'm disappointed. (But again, they kinda know it! They know it's bad, so they kinda tried to be more bad that the original!)

Let's talk about the humor. It didn't work, like 80% of it. They tried so hard to make you laugh, but most of the time, you'll be like: ""..."" The recurring jokes also gets annoying the more you've heard it. There's a lot of penis and bewbs, and most of them were so unnecessary. There's a conversation between Daddario and Efron in which Daddario kinda ""forced"" to bounce her bewbs (personal opinion btw). I mean: WHAT. (-_-) You don't needs bouncing bewbs and big balls all the time! Just give me a good movie that has a good story that is based from a really bad source material and I give this movie a immediate 9/10 stars. Seriously, are the writers writing an actual script for Baywatch, or a fan- fiction version of Baywatch? Because I'm pretty sure every 90 seconds in this movie would involve bewbs, or penises.

Overall, this is definitely a bad movie that knows itself is a bad movie. It's the perfect disposable stupid fun movie. If you're a casual movie-goer like me, you'll have mixed feelings for this movie. For anyone else, skip this movie and watch Dunkirk or Apes 3 instead. But you'll probably enjoy this movie more if you're drunk (or if you dare, drunk while you're mind is ""flying"", then you'll woke up finding yourself leaving the world, or if not, you'll woke up in a rehab facility.)

Final Score: 5/10. The acting is the only saving grace of this movie. And slomo bouncing bewbs.

On a personal note: *SPOILER ALERT* How could a fat guy can get laid with a blonde sexy chick, while others don't? What logic is this? What kind of sorcery is this?"
1.0,23 May 2017,"A little over 20 years ago, the world was introduced to Baywatch the TV show. This was an awesome show for any pre-pubescent boy or middle aged pervert who liked to watch Pamela Anderson run in slow-mo. Much like the TV show, the film is all brawn and beauty and doesn't have a brain cell to its name. Starring Zac Efron, Alexandra Daddario and Dwayne Johnson, the cast can't even save this atrocious excuse for a film. It is far from the comedic romp that was promised in the trailers. The film takes itself seriously and then other times it knows it is a parody. The only problem is, the filmmakers and writers can't decide on a tone. This really killed the film in more ways than one. Those who are expecting another Neighbors will be sorely disappointed and those of you wanting to see Dwayne Johnson kick some ass, you get to see that a little bit but there is much MUCH more to this film that could have been. I normally would go into a longer review and really talk about the film itself but I stopped myself short of this because any longer than this and it would simply be a waste of time, much like this film."
7.0,23 May 2023,"I'm not how this movie rates so low, I mean sure it's cheesy and a bit silly but it's such a fun watch. Don't get me wrong it won't be earning any awards for writing per say however the movie as a whole is brilliant, the action is great - some great fight scenes, the story surrounding Brody and his character arc is fun and as well as that all the characters are likeable. I always find that this movie puts me in a great mood for summer and not to mention it has a great soundtrack. It's a well balanced blend of funny but cheesy moments, action, wholesome moments and an entertaining heroes vs villain story. Bump up the ratings for Baywatch!!"
1.0,28 June 2017,"For the first time I actually walked out of a film before the end.

The humour is infantile, so stupid I was embarrassed for the actors.

This film is just beautiful bodies wandering about hoping it makes an entertaining film.

Clear proof you can't make a silk purse, no matter how many beautiful people you use, out of a rotting, festering, maggot ridden pigs ear written by talentless chimps.

Complete waste of time and money 0.5/10

Suspicious of the many 10/10 ratings, given by first time reviewers/new reviewers. Confirms suspicions Studios try to promote their films with bogus reviews."
7.0,29 May 2017,"This was a lot of fun, some action, banter, romance and pretty people. Writing and actors are right on the line between parody and playing it straight. Some holler backs to the TV show. Parents be aware, LOTS of adult language, genitalia jokes and full frontal male nudity. The promos make the film look like a fun romp, but don't take young kids. (Had to have a talk with my kid about ""it's a movie, we don't talk like that at home""). Good light summer fun, go enjoy, don't think too hard."
1.0,16 August 2017,"The old series used to be full of beautiful women and rather rubbish plot lines. So if you didn't get any enjoyment out of the plot at least you had something interesting to look at.

The new one appears to have adopted the idiotic new age feminist approach of making every male character a moron and every female character an undervalued well respected genius. It really is tiresome have strictly the story sticks to these tired and utterly moronic and sexist stereotypes.

To further push the semi-anti male theme running through this film you have the key characters keep on harping on about how female characters should be in charge and that ""if a man had said this or that it would of been OK""

Quite frankly not worth anyone's time and a complete waste of money.

Avoid like the plague."
6.0,11 May 2017,"Baywatch is a movie based off the popular TV show of the same name which launched the careers of such acting talents as Yasmine Bleeth and Pam Anderson. And then those quickly died right afterwards but hey, the show ran like 11 years andlittle known fact, Jason Mamoa was on spin-off show Baywatch: Hawaii.

The movie is very much like the show; as in if you walk in expecting to take it seriously you're already watching it wrong. The situations people need to be rescued from are just as ridiculous and far-fetched and the main plot here gets far more convoluted and hackneyed than the average day of any real lifeguard.

And like 21 Jump Street and a bunch of lesser TV to movie adaptations, this seeks to make fun of all of it, plus all the slo-mo beach running. Does it come off as good as Jump Street? No. Do we need this? God no. I mean didn't the show basically already make fun of itself enough as it is?

But all I can say here, and I guess the only thing anyone interested in this might want to know is, it could have been so much worse. I'm not saying this is the best movie of the summer so far. I don't really even know if i'm saying this is a good movie. But it's easy enough to sit through and the laughs, while not great, are consistent.

Where the script sucks, the cast knows how to make fun of itself. The Rock is the head honcho who takes the job very seriously. Zac Efron is the selfish, cool pretty boy new trainee who clashes with him. Both have a plethora of jokes for one another that work with varying degrees of success.

There's a fat lifeguard and the movie takes the shots you would expect it to take but actor Jon Bass also does have some comedic talent here in the Josh Gadd sense of the word. Actually he may even be funnier than Josh Gadd. Point is he works the best here from a comedic perspective.

The movie gives us quite a few dick jokes but this dude actually has one embarrassing moment that may rank up there with ""There's Something About Mary"", just with not as good a payoff.

Hannibal Burress also gets a couple scenes for a cameo and I love when he gets those. It's time for Burress to headline a movie though.

The women aren't as funny but I guess you can say they add some nice support to that and the action. Alexandra Daddario has shown a few times she's a pretty decent actress, and the others don't just seem like stiffs there to just show off a hot body. Priyanka Chopra is also here as the villain, and she's fine.

The whole movie can really be described as fine. It's funny and doesn't take itself too seriously and the cast all seems game for it. You don't have to see, but if you do, know it's already planning on sequels.

But overall I say 6 out of 10. If you guys liked this, check me out on Youtube for more."
1.0,25 May 2017,"Fun fact: The original TV show ""Baywatch"" was cancelled after only one season. True story. Ratings for NBC's skin-tastic lifeguards-save-L.A. action-drama placed it in 73rd place out of 103 shows for the 1989-1990 television season and its studio (GTG) went out of business. But, as Norm McDonald used to remind us from the desk of SNL's Weekend Update, ""Germans LOVE David Hasselhoff."" (And people in lots of other countries do too!) Keeping the show from becoming a footnote in TV history, series star David Hasselhoff brought it to first-run syndication, where it ran from 1991-1999. Having become an international sensation, it then continued in a new setting, with a mostly new cast and under a new name, ""Baywatch Hawaii"", for two more seasons. Along the way, the show became a major part of the careers of Hasselhoff, Pamela Anderson, Alexandra Paul, Yasmine Bleeth, Carmen Electra, Brooke Burns, Parker Stevenson and many others. Given the show's small screen stamina and enduring popularity, it seems natural that the TV show ""Baywatch"" would eventually become the movie ""Baywatch"" (R, 1:56), much like ""CHiPs"" earlier in 2017. Unfortunately, much like ""CHiPs"", the big screen ""Baywatch"" sucks.

On a Florida beach, Lt. Mitch Buchannon (Dwayne Johnson) leads a group of lifeguards that he calls ""the elite of the elite"". Mitch himself has over 500 water rescues under his trunks, while teammates Stephanie Holden (Ilfenesh Hadera) and C.J. Parker (Kelly Rohrbach) are similarly brave and skilled. In order to expand their team, Mitch and company hold try-outs for an additional three lifeguard slots. The new trainees end up being: the beautiful and brainy Summer Quinn (Alexandra Daddario), an awkward, out-of-shape but hard-charging nerd named Ronnie (Jon Bass) and Matt Brody (Zac Efron), a cocky, selfish 2-time Olympic gold medalist in swimming, who has since become persona non grata in the swimming world – and in society. (His new job somehow counts as community service for unspecified legal trouble.) As Ronnie harbors a not-so-secret crush on C.J., and Brody flirts with Summer, training commences. Brody has to learn what it is to be a real team player and that there is more to being a lifeguard than just being able to swim fast. Meanwhile, a local police officer (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), Mitch's supervisor (Rob Huebel), and even Brody, want Mitch to learn that he is a lifeguard – NOT a cop.

The reason that Mitch and the other lifeguards feel the need to act like cops is found in the person of Victoria Leeds (Priyanka Chopra from TV's ""Quantico""). She's the new owner of a bayside resort called The Huntley Club and it looks like she's up to no good. We hear her accused of running drugs and she doesn't deny it. We see her colluding with a city councilman (Oscar Nuñez) on some real estate deal and see bribes him with an expensive watch. We understand that Mitch doesn't trust her and she invites him to a party. At this ""meet the neighbors"" gathering, Mitch and company do their best to dig up some dirt to back up their suspicions, but Leeds is a wily woman and proof is harder to find than body fat on Dwayne Johnson or Zac Efron. When packets of a dangerous designer drug pop up, plus a suspicious fire and a couple of corpses, naturally it's up to a few lifeguards to solve the mystery, right? That's what the Baywatch babes and boys think anyway. And that's just part of what's wrong here.

""Baywatch"" is mostly ridiculous and unfunny. What passes for character development are back stories which raise more questions than they answer. What passes for acting are one-dimensional characterizations which aren't believable or even sensical. And what passes for humor basically falls into one of three categories: references to the areas of the human body usually covered by swim suits, vomit jokes and seeing how many pop culture references Mitch can come up with to insult young pretty boy Brody (although some were funny) – and the best gags are all in the theatrical trailers. The screenplay, by writing partners Damian Shannon and Mark Swift, puts the characters in situations which are more insulting to the intelligence of the average Movie Fan than they are humorous. Seth Gordon's direction is too weak to make sense of it all or to give the audience more than a few chuckles along the way.

The acting is across-the-board bad, but the worst of the worst is a tie between Bass, for simply doing a 2-hour Josh Gad impression, and Chopra, for showing nowhere near the gravitas or menace necessary to be an effective villain with a (dis)honorable mention to the usually entertaining Johnson, who ends up in his worst role since 2013's ""Pain & Gain"". For a few amusing moments and for poking self-aware fun at its source material, the film scores minor points, but it basically can't decide whether it wants to be a comedy, a parody or a drama and it doesn't do any of those very well. (But don't gloat Dax Shepherd. ""CHiPs"" made most of the same mistakes.) ""Baywatch"" would be better titled ""No Way Watch"". This movie is as lame as that pun I just made. In a mid-credits scene, Johnson talks sequel with a cast member from the original TV show. Don't hold your breath, Dwayne. Consider your movie fortunate to get out of this review with a ""D+""."
9.0,5 June 2017,"I had a really great time watching this movie and I am quite glad I chose it over the Pirates of the Caribbean. There are lots of nice jokes and contrary to my initial thoughts, there are very few nude scenes. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and Effron are both great leads and they inarguably take part in all the funny scenes of the movie.

I have to admit that I was quite cautious before going to see the movie due to all the negative reviews and I finally came to a conclusion about all the people who believe that every movie should be reviewed as a potential Oscar nominee! Not all movies have to be ""serious"" and dramatic. I know most of the reviewers out there were expecting to see something like ""The Pianist"" when they bought tickets for ""Baywatch"" and that is the reason why this movie let them down. My advice is to watch movies that make you have a nice time (Baywatch is one of them alongside Piranha 3D, American Pie). Not all movies are filmed in order to become Oscar Nominees! Many of them are made with the goal of making the viewers have a great time! Please take that into account the next time you are criticizing a movie!"

2.0,24 May 2017,"Comedy is dead. Baywatch has made me lose any hope of any movie being funny in 2017. If this is the best Hollywood can do, they are done for.

There is no inspiration or creativity to be found. The idea is: Hey, 21 Jump Street was hilarious! What would happen if we did the same thing for (fill in the blank)? 21 Jump Street was one of the rare occasions where a TV-adaptation film was worth seeing, and ultimately, ended up being better than the source material. What was Baywatch originally? A horrible TV show in the 80's. It existed only to show off the glistening, bouncing, beautiful bodies of it's lead actors David Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson. There isn't much material to make a film off of. That is, unless, the filmmakers went nuts and turned the source material into an absurd farce.. lets say of the Will Ferrel variety. Instead, Baywatch 2017 is a lopsided, painfully stupid, unbearably dull, cringe- inducing insult to the intelligence of the filmgoing public. Pain and Gain had more nuanced humor. Mike and Dave was the funnier Zac Efron movie. Let that sink it.

I might have said, ""This makes no sense"", out-loud in the movie theater about 10 times. They made a film completely out of action-comedy clichés, strung together incoherently. The big laugh set- pieces are desperate. One joke in particular is a genital mishap lifted directly from ""There's Something About Mary"". That joke is 20-years old. If you're going to be a thief, at least steal something timely. The cast might be the only positive thing I can note. They are all really charming, and sexy to look at, but at what cost?

I couldn't think of a worse film to be slated for Memorial Day weekend. This is going to be a long, hot summer of Hollywood failures."
1.0,21 June 2017,"It seems like the studio is trying to inflate the reviews, and now I know why. The movie is not funny at all, don't waste your money. The worst part was when Efron touches a dead man's genitals, disturbing uncomfortable and unnecessary.

The only good thing is the cameo of Pamela Anderson and David Hasselhoff, but just look for the clips on youtube and you will be totally fine."

7.0,30 May 2017,"I didn't expect much when I went to see Baywatch because of negative reviews on IMDb.com. So, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed Baywatch after seeing it.

The plot was simple, which I like. The acting was first rate, all of them. The relationships between the characters was believable. The girls were beautiful. The scenery was beautiful.

I honestly cannot think of a negative thing to say about the movie....except many reviews are way to harsh.

Go see Baywatch with a light-heart and have a good time."
4.0,23 May 2017,"Here's my review of #Baywatch movie and the reason why I don't hate the film as much as someone who probably over analyzes it is that I wasn't expecting this to be any better than the long-running cheesy TV series that I did grow up watching. If you recalled, the show was basically just about attractive people in swimsuits patrolling a beach and it had the occasional soap opera romance. It produced such hot babes as Pamela Anderson, Brooke Burns, and Yasmine Bleeth. Teenage boys watched it religiously whenever they can't get their hands on a copy of the latest Playboy magazine.

With that said, this movie throws the drama out the window and cranks up the sex- crazed raunchiness that the TV version could only hint mildly. The action sequences are not well-staged, the jokes more than often don't land, but from time to time it does exactly what it's supposed to do, it entertains.

Starring Dwayne Johnson, Zac Efron, Priyanka Chopra, Alexandra Daddario, Jon Bass, Kelly Rohrbach, Ilfenesh Hadera, directed by Seth Gordon, the story is about veteran lifeguard Mitch Buchannon who finds himself butting heads with a brash new recruit, 2-time gold medalist named Matt Brody (Zac Efron) who thinks highly of himself. Meanwhile, a certain local criminal plot is operating an underground drug ring that threatens the future of the Bay.

This is a movie that from the start wants you to know that it doesn't intend on taking itself too seriously. There are scenes that I'm thinking the writers and director thought were going to be solid when they viewed them during storyboard process perhaps, but on screen, they're actually uneven and off-putting.

The whole crime investigative aspect of it is anything but smart, sure one can argue that's because these guys are lifeguards and not cops, a point which by the way keeps being hammered again and again throughout the course of this film, but what I mean is that there really is nothing clever about solving the drug ring because everything about it is obvious and out in the open. But I am a sucker for a comedy about nerd guys and hot girls falling for each other and so I find the dynamics between Jon Bass' character and Kelly Rohrbach's character to be adorable, it's like those impromptu in-between moments that I consistently look forward to.

Overall, I think people are going to want to watch this movie for the very same reason they watched the TV series, and that is: the beautiful people. Girls will come for shirtless Zac Efron and beefcake Dwayne Johnson, and guys will come for Kelly, Alexandra, Priyanka and their voluptuous bodies, I'm just keeping it real. Attractive people in swimsuits have always been the essence of ""Baywatch,"" they are what this franchise banks on. So the story quality and the jokes may not be up to par, they're silly, they're lousy, they're ridiculous, but ""Baywatch"" has an unlimited supply of sex appeal.

7.0,23 May 2017,
1.0,11 October 2017,"Okay, that sounds rather harsh but to me 'Baywatch' really was that bad. The original series was not exactly great, was very silly and can be easily criticised, but it at least was from memory sort of fun and had some campy charm.

Something that 'Baywatch' (2017) completely and utterly fails to do, it actually came across that nobody involved had actually seen the show and only heard about it. Really though, 'Baywatch' is better seen on its own terms and it even fails spectacularly on that front. Have said a few times recently that 2017 was a very hit and miss year for films (from personal opinion), 'Baywatch' is, to me, along with 'The Emoji Movie', 'The Mummy', 'Stratton', 'Fifty Shades Darker', 'Flatliners', 'Eat Locals' and 'Transformers: The Last Knight' one of the year's worst, and it's the worst of the lot.

'Baywatch' has only one thing that's semi-decent and that is Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, he fits his role well and at least tries to give the film some energy and charisma. All that effort feels wasted however because his character is so weakly written and his material even weaker than that.

The rest of the acting is dreadful. Zac Efron's comic timing is completely lost at sea here and he fails to make his character interesting or likable. Then there's the supremely irritating Jon Bass and Priyanka Chopra portraying the single most insipid villain of the year. There are some lovely-looking ladies here, but their acting is sophomoric in vapid roles that never feel real, eye-rolling dialogue and in a few cases limited screen time. Alexandria Daddario is particularly wronged in all those areas. The cameos from the likes of David Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson may have been intended to be affectionate and nostalgic but were actually neither, instead they were useless in cameos that were clearly shoe-horned in to provide some clumsy connection to the original series.

Despite the near-uniformly poor performances, they are in all fairness saddled with everything else failing even worse than they do. The writing is particularly bad here in a strong contender for the worst script of the year, with dialogue that would even be beneath actors and actresses who can't act their way out of a paper bag and truly laboured and excessively crude jokes that throughout all land with a sickening thud than soar with hilarity. Just for the record, crude humour is not always a bad thing but it depends on how it's executed. Plus there are a lot of great comedies out there that make me laugh every time, so it would be unfair to accuse me or anybody else who hated the film of not having a sense of humour. The crudeness, dumbness and complete lack of taste are just far too much to stomach in 'Baywatch' to the point it's vomit-inducing, and there is no sharpness, wit or subtlety of any kind in a completely laughter-free and distasteful film.

Nothing good to say about the story either, which is not just predictable but even more problematically it's shallow, not the easiest to follow and lifelessly paced. And before anybody defending 'Baywatch' screaming and preaching don't take it so seriously, please try and take on board that those who hated the film knew exactly what to expect and watched it expecting a silly turn-your-brain-off-at-the-door sort of film but got a film that took itself much too seriously to judge it on that front.

It's a very cheap-looking film too, especially in the shoddy editing and obvious and abused use of green-screen. Even the scenery is flat. The soundtrack is forgettable at best and there is not a single interesting, fun or likable character, being either personality-free or annoying. As for the direction, what direction? All in all, awful way in every way apart from Johnson. 1/10 Bethany Cox"
8.0,29 May 2017,"It's not a James Bond movie, but the drama is real!

Let's be totally honest - the movie is exactly as it's supposed to be. It's light, slightly offensive (to whoever it can) and sends this wink to the audience. Not like Deadpool completely breaking the 4th wall. In a way that keeps with the summer vibe.

Definitely, a summer movie to watch with friends on a hot evening with a glass of Pimms!

I went into the cinema expecting a comedy, but it turned out I actually went in to see an emotional character development journey with Zac Efron. It honestly was not worth it, all the funny parts of the movie can be seen in full in the trailers. I would rate the trailers 10/10 as they actually fooled me into thinking that this would be a good movie."
2.0,18 August 2017,"A drab story line, annoying movie and character references and pathetic jokes are just a few ingredients in this boring recipe called ""Baywatch"". There's no part during the whole run where a viewer can actually say that it gets interesting. I hadn't been able to stifle yawn after yawn after yawn and found myself unable to sit through the entire show. There was absolutely no hint of the original Baywatch magic thanks to the mediocre acting and a script lacking anything substantial. Baywatch goes from boring to annoying to mundane all in 30 minutes which probably is its only quality."
6.0,31 May 2017,"As someone who never watched the TV show ""Baywatch"" but knew of its reputation as the fluffy, action series with a good-looking cast, I didn't have much expectations of enjoying this movie version with my movie theatre-working friend. Still, despite some funny raunchy scenes, I came to like the serious plot that permeated much of the movie and liking the way the characters were depicted most of the time. Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron give whatever gravitas to their roles as needed as do many of the supporting cast. And the cameos from a couple of the original stars of the series was also nice tributes from what I know about them. I'll just now say we both enjoyed Baywatch the movie."

Lots of pretty people and tight outfits, but again, it's Baywatch.

I thought the comedy was pretty simple but it fit the movie. Lots of hard-on jokes and flirting.

I think the best part is all the stuff that happens to Zach's character. Especially the morgue scene. Absolutely hilarious.

I say, if you like movies like ""Pineapple Express"", ""Superbad"", etc then you'll probably like this movie.

Might I also suggest partaking of substances to help you enjoy yourself."

Didn't even hold a candle to Pamela Anderson. Save your money and get this when it comes out on redbox."
8.0,1 February 2021,"8/10 - funny, sexy, and attention-grabbing, this action comedy is good for some mindless entertainment"
7.0,6 June 2017,"Baywatch is the big screen remake of the 1989 TV series of the same name. Mitch Buchannon(Dwayne Johnson) is a dedicated lifeguard who would do anything for the bay. Along with the rest of his team including, Stephanie Holden(Ilfanesh Hadera), CJ Parker(Kelly Rohrbach), Summer Quinn(Alexandra Daddario) & Ronnie Greenbaum(Jon Bass), Mitch saves lives on the bay, at any cost. A reckless new recruit named Matt Brody(Zac Efron), joins the lifeguard team. Mitch & Matt have to reluctantly work together, when a sinister plan threatens to tear the bay apart.

Baywatch is a good movie. However, it could have been so much funnier & entertaining than it was. With comedy experts like Dwayne Johnson & Zac Efron, this film could have been laugh-out-loud hilarious. However, the script by Damian Shannon & Mark Swift is pretty tame & all this movie elicits, are a few chuckles here & there. Director Seth Gordon tries his best but, this film pales in comparison with his previous directorial effort, Horrible Bosses(2011). The cinematography by Eric Steelberg is gorgeous. The beaches of Miami look breathtaking. The action set pieces are brilliant. Acting-wise, there is nothing to fault. However, with this talented ensemble, there was potential to make Baywatch as iconic as its TV counterpart. Dwayne Johnson is spectacular as Mitch Buchannon. Zac Efron is amazing as Matt Brody. Priyanka Chopra is mind blowing as Victoria Leeds. I just wish Chopra was given more screen time. Alexandra Daddario is superb as Summer Quinn. Kelly Rohrbach is impressive as CJ Parker. Ilfanesh Hadera is effective as Stephanie Holden. Johnson, Efron, Chopra, Daddario, Rohrbach & Hadera all have perfect bodies, in keeping with the look of the TV show. Jon Bass is hysterical as Ronnie Greenbaum. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is outstanding as Sgt. Ellerbee. Hannibal Buress' vast comedic talent is wasted in his minor role as, Dave the Tech. Rob Huebel is awesome as Captain Thorpe. Amin Joseph, Jack Kesy & Oscar Nunez are decent as, Frankie, Leon & Councilman Rodriguez, respectively. David Hasselhoff & Pamela Anderson are excellent in their cameos as, The Mentor & Casey Jean Parker, respectively. Baywatch is not a must watch. However, slow-mo run to the theaters if you're a fan of the TV show & a fan of the cast."

7.0,19 August 2017,"I can't believe how many positive fake reviews this has gotten, telling you to ""ignore the bad reviews"" and this movie being ""worth a watch"" or even funny. This is the saddest attempt at humor this year - easy. This movie is surrealistically politically correct except to white men. Dwayne Johnson disappoints here especially, just like in the majority of recent movies he's made he appeals to a generation of self-entitled, brainless teenagers and should-be-grown-ups. Fist-bumping with a black police officer whenever he can because he's half Samoan or whatever while ridiculing the white male sunny-boy type of a character at the lowest levels, who is depicted as a braindead, mush-for-brains super-athlete who is so reckless and egocentric that it hurts following his dialogue, while not surprisingly the virgin-type of a character played by Jon Bass is getting all the attention of the ladies despite his much-less-than-athletic bodytype and shyness around women. It is so obvious that it seems as if this movie was funded by George Soros himself. On the other side the female characters are depicted as smart and witty. No exceptions. In addition the female villain character is depicted as a feminist (the extremist nonsensical type) who talks-down at her own bodyguards/henchmen in such an incredibly rude manner I am generally surprised this is acceptable for the theaters leaving a bad image for the younger viewers as to what is acceptable behavior for women towards men. This does not exclude the majority of other female characters though, it's pretty much standard through and through. Except towards Dwayne Johnson and his friend Jon Bass of course. Seriously. If it wasn't for the sex-sells premise this would have deserved zero stars. I do not recommend watching this movie, ever. If you can watch it for free, maybe, if you have absolutely nothing else to watch. Don't give such terrible writers your money in the theaters. It only encourages them to feed you sh*t movies in the future - and get away with it making millions just because The Rock is in it and it's based on a 'classic' from the 80s."

This movie is suppose to be a fun movie mixed with some violence. This is not a serious crime/Drama flick. This is a lighter version of the 1989 series with David Hasselhoff. He is even in it for a cameo so even Mitch himself (the original) approve this movie. It's a strong 7 for me, nearly an 8. Just have fun, have a few beers n enjoy. Don't hate this movie because it's a Little bit silly. It is suppose to be despite the age limit. Just watch the whole movie."
8.0,30 May 2017,"To start, I had high hopes for this movie...well maybe high hopes is a little strong...let's just say a lot of good vibes. The cast is strong with very likable and funny actors all through the movie, even in the ""bit parts"", (Rob Huebel, Oscar Nunez, Hannibal Buress) However, the comedy falls flat throughout the film. Dwayne Johnson and Zac Effron have a talent for comedy and natural charm and there were one or two scenes that made me chuckle (Heimlich Maneuver, Coroners Office, The Rocks insults to Zac Effron) but most scenes felt like the jokes had somehow been edited out. For example, every scene with the Beach Patrol Officer. Every line is delivered as if it's supposed to have you cracking up, except the dialogue is as bland as baby food. There are literally no jokes in anything he says...I felt bad for the actor, hell, I felt bad for all of the actors. Instead of witty or even mildly amusing dialogue, we are left with shoe horned in curse words. Don't get me wrong, I love a good f word here and there and everywhere (Midnight Run is in my Top 10 Comedies) but there is a feel for it that good comedies can pull off. Deadpool had a feel for it... Baywatch definitely does not. The plot was all over the place and nonsensical, but that can almost be excused, as it's a Baywatch movie after all. However this wouldn't have passed a script reading for Baywatch Nights. (Google it, it's dreadfully amazing) Seriously, they could have done a mashup of different episodes of the show and had a better story (Brady Bunch Movies) or even a mashup of Son of the Beach episodes (totally underrated) and been better off. As I left the theater, a quote from A Bronx Tale kept playing in my mind; ""The saddest thing in life is wasted talent.."" Amen to that."

Now he finds himself down on his luck, offered a job on a reluctant Mitch's lifeguard crew. Mitch challenges young Brody with inventive belittling nicknames and endurance course antics. It is an amazing thing to see the fitness challenge between the equally impressive Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron. Somehow, I really believe they could carry two refrigerators on their shoulders. Ronnie is a new character actor, and is incredibly funny as the ""IT"" lifeguard recruit and love interest of ""slow mo"" hot girl with daddy issues CJ. Priyanka Chopra does not quite hit the mark as the gorgeous villain who is buying up beachfront and running a drug empire. Still, the cast appear to have had great fun and good chemistry in the filming of this movie. The theatre I attended was full and there was plenty of spontaneous laughing throughout.

6.0,23 September 2017,"Baywatch is an elite team of lifeguards patrolling the beaches of Emerald Bay. They are led by their leader Mitch Buchannon (Dwayne Johnson), second-in-command Stephanie Holden (Ilfenesh Hadera), and goddess CJ Parker (Kelly Rohrbach). Ronnie Greenbaum (Jon Bass) is in love with CJ. He and Summer Quinn (Alexandra Daddario) are two of the new recruits competing for a place on the team. Matt Brody (Zac Efron) is an arrogant Olympian who is forced on Mitch. Despite being only lifeguards, Mitch is constantly on the lookout for anything endangering his beloved beach. His unauthorized investigations lead to businesswoman Victoria Leeds (Priyanka Chopra) who is corrupting politicians for her nefarious goals.

I'm willing to give this a shot. Jon Bass looks like the last person who should be a lifeguard in the ocean. I assume he's supposed to be the comedian but Hannibal Buress would make more sense. The character turns into the tech guy which is his natural state in the first place. There are too many dick jokes. One or two do work but it's an overload. Zac Efron is pushing too hard into the unlikable category. He and the Rock are good comedic performers but the team needs an actual comedian. This stuff piles up but I'm still trying to give it a chance. Finally in the morgue, Matt jumps out of the drawers into the arms of the bad guys and I have to give up. It's too annoyingly stupid and it only gets stupider. Problem is that it's not stupid funny. The serious crime caper is badly written. It's all simply stupid. The joking gets less and less funny. Even the David Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson cameo do nothing. I gave it every shot but the movie kept missing."
1.0,29 June 2017,"This movie is just a roller-coaster from start to finish. Everything that happens is just so unbelievable, I was left with my mouth hanging as to how something like this could have even happened. It baffles me to think that somebody actually thought that this was a good idea.

Luckily, the writers/director were obviously aware that they weren't making a masterpiece, so they decided to go the completely ridiculous route of just throwing absurd stuff at the audience until they're laughing from how awful it is. And I do believe that this movie is really enjoyable to see as a ""so bad it's good movie"", especially with a bunch of (possibly intoxicated) friends. None of the jokes land, so you're actually laughing at the unintentionally funny moments, or just laughing from the sheer sadness because there's nothing else you can do, except stare in bewilderment.

During the opening credits, they're not even being remotely subtle about what kind of movie they're making. A ridiculous rap soundtrack, Dwayne Johnson jumping into the water in slow motion, things exploding, dolphins jumping out of the water and giant ""Baywatch"" letters coming out of the water really dramatically. Everybody in the movie was so obviously cast as eye-candy that it's painful, but then again, I didn't expect anything else from Baywatch. There is a full two or so minute scene of Zac Efron completing some sort of course shirtless, only for us later to find out that the scene was COMPLETELY unnecessary. However, the hottest person in the movie by far was the woman villain drug dealer, and that's coming from me, a straight girl.

I don't think anything else really needs to be said about this movie. I mean, do you even really need to be reading this review? Did people even expect anything from this movie? There's literally nothing else to be said. In conclusion, this is insane. I'm conflicted whether to recommend this movie just so people could see how NOT to make a movie and then make fun of it, or not to recommend it, since that means that the people who made this will get more money and make more films like this."

Parts where the movie goes wrong for me is that when the raunchy gags where thrown in, and I can't help but feel that was in at the last minute, and I thought it brought the movie down.

Dwayne Johnson seems to be having the most fun here, as Mitch. Johnson is always a joy to watch, regardless of what role he's playing. Zac Efron is alright has Brody, moments where he wasn't whiny like a little school boy. Alexandra Daddario has Summer, don't get me wrong is beautiful, but wasn't giving much character to play to the point where I just didn't care. Kelly Rohrbach has C.J. was pretty descent, I like the way she wasn't written has a dumb blonde, but has a smart and very friendly person, and every bit has beautiful has Daddario. Jon Bass who thought was gonna be written has an annoying sidekick, but his character seems to change has it goes on. This started out terrible, but got better in spots, moments that where funny, action scenes that where okay. Not a great film by any standards, questioning anything in it would be rather pointless, but it has some amusing moments."

*To be clear, Jon Bass' character isn't meant to be an actual Cole Sprouse look-a-like; I just wanted to point out that he really looks like Cole Sprouse."
1.0,26 May 2017,"For what it is worth, it is a good movie. Plenty of decent jokes. Some vulgar jokes but very few. Some awkward jokes as well. I did enjoy it and so will you. Just a genuine movie for good laughs. The sense of humor this movie calls for is not for everyone. Still, you can enjoy this movie and I hope you do. It will not become one of your classic movies though; it is not that kind of humor at all."
1.0,6 November 2021,"If this movie were not so real funny at many parts, this would not deliver so much fresh air. The very idea of beach beauties movie is nothing new, yeah, but the nice team of Dwayne and Zac and all excellent female graces make it fun and watchable - mind you, this is a deep psychological thriller or art house flick, this is a sunny breezy referent for eyes. Some very risky jokes may shock a trifle bit but this is what they intended and wanted to show us. The capacity of humorous situations is galore here and this helps to get this watched well."

6.0,16 January 2018,"""Baywatch"" simply isn't funny, it's way too serious and drags on immensely and was overall just way too long of a film with a paper thin story that offered pretty much no enjoyment whatsoever. The plot was extremely predictable, the characters had no emotional depth or chemistry (even if the actors had fun working together), the villain was absolutely horrendous, a vast majority of the ""jokes"" didn't land and the special effects were simply terrible just to name a few things wrong with this unnecessary re-imagining of an old TV Show famous for showing women in tight lifeguard suits (that probably being the best aspect of this film, too). It wasn't even fun to watch for someone like me who was just looking to sit back and watch a dumb comedy on a friday evening with the lowest expectations imaginable, despite it being one of the more raunchy comedies I've seen recently. The only thing keeping this mess from being the absolute worst film of 2017 is Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, he's just a likeable guy and is solely responsible for making me chuckle maybe once or twice during the entirety of ""Baywatch"". If you really really enjoy films with Dwayne Johnson as well as his previous work as a wrestler, you might get a kick out of this one, but for me, this was just too painful to watch."
2.0,30 June 2021,"A simple film which has the desire to produce fun and always manages to do it on a simple level. People who didn't expect a superficial script and shallow jokes from this remake of a quirky 90s series seem unaware of the essence of the original show. It is important that this entertaining fun doesn't take itself too seriously and that it ignores the PC junk of the 21st century. Dwayne Johnson is fun, the Baywatch girls are sexy (as it should be) and still strong characters in the context of the plot, the new characters are well written and Zac Efron was wrongly nominated for a Rasperry."

Sure there's hot girls in this movie, but that's what the freaking internet is for. Take my advice don't watch this movie, or at least go to matinée or rent it."

But hey, it's not trying to be those cerebral and deep films you see winning the Emmys but instead largely a comedy film to have a couple of great laughs. And for that, it sure did pretty well. So while not perfect, I can't really fault it either. Still, a fun lighthearted watch that did its job decently."

6.0,10 April 2022,"I say this in the nicest way possible; the Baywatch movie is dumb. The plot doesn't stand up to even a modicum of scrutiny and the production practically revelled in the cliches. And as entertainment, it works.

The cast all play their cut out characters well, playing up the stereotypes. Dwayne Johnson looks like he is just having a lot of fun being there, and probably took the role for the sweet paycheck and the vacation (shot primarily in Georgia and Florida beaches). Zac Efron actually looks like he is trying and wrings some pathos out of the stock bad boy character. Priyanka Chopra goes the distance as the villain, almost like she thought she was going to be in a more serious film. The David Hasselhoff cameos work better than most appearances by actors in remakes of their projects; he was invested in having some fun.

The location shooting is gorgeous, and the soundtrack is full of fun tunes. But the plot, like the original television show, takes a back seat. And that's just fine."
1.0,19 January 2020,"In her seventies, my mother really enjoyed watching Baywatch, because both she and her brother had been lifeguards. She would sit back and critique form and technique.

To be honest, I did not watch ""Baywatch"" for the story. Still, the story is pretty bad even taking into account that this is a brain off film. The story is contrived, and characters are good or evil in a dichotomous manner that it is funny in itself. The jokes are quite funny, especially the scene where a guy who has an incident with a wooden beach chair. The scene where things drip onto Zac Efron's face is hilarious too. Another good thing about the film is the use of Biggie Smalls' song as the opening song, which brings me right back to the nineties, setting the scene for the rest of the film.

Though ""Baywatch"" is not a brilliant blockbuster, it does entertain the crowds through jokes and eye candy."

6.0,29 May 2017,"I am forty-six years old and I'll be one of the first decry Hollywood's descent into 'nothing but potty humor' notions of what passes for comedy these days. Also, having been seventeen when the show first aired I can tell you that the gratuitous shots of bouncing breasts in slow motion we're not nearly as prevalent as people remember, in what little I saw of it. That said, I am absolutely dumbfounded by the negative reviews and poor opening of this film! I can't help but wonder what in the world people were expecting. To be fair, I may have watched about five episodes of the TV show when it was on, but my assumption was that the show was about a group of lifeguards getting into situations and capers well outside the purview of a group of lifeguards. For me, this movie was practically perfect at being what it set out to be. It never tried to take itself too seriously, yet was only just campy enough to let the audience know that. I thought everyone performed well in their given roles, the jokes were hilarious and no more excessive than what I would expect the 2017, rated 'R' film version to pull off. At times I even felt like I was in the middle of a seasons long binge on Netflix. This movie did a decent job of making the outlandish 'not-so-mysterious mystery' somewhat believable and I even half-expected a scene near the end with Priyanka Chopra's villain saying, 'And I would have gotten away with it if it weren't for you meddling lifeguards and your bigger, stronger Hasselhoff!' Now as a disclaimer, this was the first 'R' rated movie I took my teen-aged son to see so I thought perhaps my laugh meter was ratcheted up, but the theater that was 85% full at 9:20PM on a Sunday night all seemed to be laughing as hard as we were. I think perhaps people were just upset with this film for having not enough naked women and sexual situations, or contrarily didn't want their Baywatchers using foul language and making penis jokes? I don't know. I say go see this movie with zero expectations, let it be what it is, don't be a prude, and you will laugh a lot and have a good time!"

1.0,1 June 2017,"I've never watched the television series, so I can't compare the two, but this film, judged on its own merit, is all over the place, unable to decide if it's a satire or not, likely due to its lengthy writing credits: the story was begun by Jay Scherick and David Ronn, then rewritten by Thomas Lennon and Robert Garant, before the final screenplay was written by horror film writing team Damian Shannon and Mark Swift.

The trio of leads ( Johnson, Efron, and gorgeous Alexandra Daddario ) all have more than enough charisma and charm to carry the threadbare, generic plot about drug smugglers, lead by the lamest villain since that tech geek from Die Hard 4. I couldn't even remember the character's name, until I looked at the IMDb page again. Her character's death is more memorable than the character itself. Also memorable, but for the wrong reasons, is the lengthy scene of Ronnie getting his wang caught between the slats of a deck chair ( in a much maligned scene ) , Efron fondling a corpse's balls, and the numerous puke jokes added merely for gross-out enthusiasts. All of those bits could easily have been edited out, and the film would have been all the more better. 

Not that it really matters, but the trailer gives away far too much of the film: we don't need the melodrama about whether or not Efron will pass the physical evaluation, or the melodrama about Johnson possibly being fired, the trailer shows what will happen with them, even the dippy little subplot between Robbie and C.J. was revealed in the trailer.

During the lengthy closing credits, outtakes are shown, and Johnson talks of a sequel. Naaaahh. I didn't mind this movie as much as others, but have no interest in a sequel.

My slightly high rating for this is largely due to my fondness for the cast, who does more for the material than the material does for them. Without this cast, my rating would probably drop to a 4/ 10"
2.0,3 September 2018,"I wasted an evening watching this filthy parody of Baywatch. I thought Dewayne Johnson made wiser choices with his roles. Silly, juvenile, crude humor, and a terrible lackluster storyline."
7.0,31 May 2017,"Honestly, I am not sure why people are bagging on this film. Its great. The plot is fun, and runs smoothly. The comedy in this film is what sells it the most. Some of the jokes are actually great and unexpected. The others, are cheesy, on purpose, and will make you laugh regardless. Dwayne Johnson knocks it out of the park on this one. All of the cast has character, and none of them are neglected. It's a great film. I'd recommend it to everybody. Don't listen to the useless critics and pointless user reviewers with super over the top movie standards. If you wanna relax and laugh, watch this film. If you want to come in with a microscope and over analyze something in a way it wasn't meant to be analyzed, just don't come to not ruin it for others."
3.0,2 June 2017,"Nobody wanted a cinematic remake of the campy 90s show that cemented David Hasselhoff's enduring legacy as the butt of all jokes. But alas, here it is anyway, in all its Mickey-taking glory. And it's actually better than you would think. Turning up the tongue-in-cheek humour to maximum levels, this updated version throws in everything but the kitchen sink to garner a laugh: toilet and genital gags, racy double entendres, ironic meta-jokes, and ludicrous slow-mo shots. Whilst it's more of a quantity over quality plan of attack—resulting in its fair share of jokes that fall flat—there's a giddy energy that keeps it afloat, with a cast who are game to poke fun at the stereotypes they're playing. Dwayne Johnson is the beefcake leader, Zac Efron is the thrill seeking renegade, Alexandra Daddario is the hardworking rookie, Kelly Rohrback is the blonde bombshell and Jon Bass is the goofy sidekick; and all ham it up wonderfully. When it veers into action territory it loses momentum and interest. A couple of the bigger set pieces, including the finale, are drowned out with cluttered editing, shaky camera-work and poor CGI — and, quite simply, are completely boring. Those sporadic actions sequences threaten to sink proceedings but with its no-holds-barred comedic onslaught and enthusiastically self-deprecating performances, Baywatch is a fun time at the beach."
6.0,19 August 2017,I don't know why I still keep expecting a half descent movie with Zac Effron in it!?!

8.0,3 June 2017,"If you go back and look at the old Baywatch episodes, you can tell that not only was this show pitched by men, but men who were probably twenty-plus year subscribers to Playboy. Yeah, there were stories about sharks, diamond smugglers, and beachcombing thieves, Baywatch was merely an excuse to show pretty people, especially women in tight bikinis, trying to do things that lifeguards mostly do. It wasn't anything special, but it was popular (so much so that people used to call it ""Babewatch"", given that a lot of the cast members were former models of Playboy) and is a piece of the 1990's culture.

Making a movie of Baywatch is a tough, but not impossible task. Sort of like how The Brady Bunch Movie was a parody, I can only see a Baywatch movie working in the same stance. The same idea had been adopted for movies based on Starsky & Hutch, CHiPS, and 21 Jump Street. Baywatch can fit within these other movies as they all share the distinction of being time capsules of their era by accident. Not that they were bad series', but they could only embrace their setups rather then try to be one of the best. Let's see if Baywatch can make the cinematic translation.

In Emerald Bay, Florida, Lt. Mitch Buchannon (played by Dwayne Johnson) runs the ""Baywatch"" lifeguard patrol with both an iron fist and a high ego. His fellow guards include C.J. (played by Kelly Rohrbach), and Stephanie (played by Ilfenesh Hadera) are holding their annual tryouts where several hopefuls come to join the team. Newcomers include the geeky Ronnie (played by Jon Bass) the quick-thinking Summer (played by Alexandra Daddario) and Olympic swimmer Matt Brody (played by Zac Efron). Matt had disgraced himself in the last games to the point where his lifeguarding is a part of a plea deal for community service. Mitch isn't too happy to have him on the team, but his superiors tell him to deal with it.

After an incident where they all save a bunch of people from a burning yacht, a body on board is identified as a city official. Mitch starts to see this along with bags of drugs washing up on shore started to happen when businesswoman Victoria Leeds (played by Priyanka Chopra). Despite being told that the crimes are out of their jurisdiction, Mitch, Matt, and the rest of the Baywatch gang try to see if Victoria is behind all of this.

Let me make this clear. Baywatch is dumbbut the movie is completely aware that it's dumb and honestly has fun with it. It's clear that the movie is trying to replicate 21 Jump Street where not only is a comedy, but goes for the R rating to allow F-bombs and a couple of penises on screen. Does it all work. No, but there is a lot of moments where I laughed. The film does it's best to utilize it's stars, especially the comedic potential with Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron.

That is probably its biggest strengththe stars. I know nothing about the Baywatch series, but I'll guess that it took some creative liberties with their characters. I doubt there would be someone as geeky as Ron or dumb as Matt was on the series. Again, the movie is a parody and understands that by embracing it's own madness, it has a better chance. What's odd is that my favorite was the villain, Priyanka Chopra, who carries a lot of charisma for an actress I haven't heard of (No, I haven't seen her Bollywood work). I hope she becomes more prominent.

What prevents Baywatch from reaching the same levels as 21 Jump Street is it's story and pacing. While there is nothing wrong with a drug invasion story, it still feels too standard and confining for the world it's in. At one point, they point out some plots of the old TV show that I wish I'd see used for the movie (like surfers smuggling diamonds). The pacing unfortunately drags to a two-hour movie that not only makes it too long, but allows a lot of unfunny jokes to stay. In fact, there were a couple of characters that if you were to cut out (like Ron and C.J.), I don't think it would have affected the story. At least a half hour should have been cut.

I'll give this six lifeguard rescue tubes out of ten. While I'm glad I saw this movie, it does get lost a couple of times. Though it could have used some more saving, it does enough to stay afloat."
6.0,21 June 2017,"'BAYWATCH' was directed by Seth Gordon and stars Dwayne Johnson, Zac Efron and Priyanka Chopra. When a dead body washes up on shore, Mitch and his team of lifeguards launch a full scale investigation to uncover the truth behind this sinister plot.

Let me start by saying I've never watched the TV show and thus have no bias either way in this review. That said, I actively disliked this movie. Johnson's charisma and Efron's dead guy fetish do not keep this movie from sinking(no pun intended). It's a lazily written script that devolves into toilet humour, which some genuinely clever and funny jokes sprinkled in that NO ONE aside from myself laughed at at my screening. The demographic for this movie will be primarily fans of the show, and fans of this toilet humour. If you like that, fine but don't tell me it is comedic genius or the best comedy ever made because I will punch you.

I mean you don't watch this film for the plot but I may as well comment on it for those who have a positive intelligence quotient. It's a messy, incoherent blur of random plot threads that are messily stitched together to form something resembling a plot. It's not interesting. It's not clever. It's not even cheesy in the fun way. It's just a bland, dull by-the-numbers drug plot that tries to act smarter than it is(the villain actually says that mid film) and ultimately fails.

Now for the positives. All the acting was spot on from Dwayne Johnson to Zac Efron to Alexandra Daddario, with the exception of one. Johnson is disturbingly charismatic and Efron is a dumb guy. Both actors have been typecast but it works well in the context of the film. Jon Bass was good as the comic relief and didn't come of as forced(sometimes). He was funny in most of his scenes. The only performance in this movie I cannot praise was Pryanka Chopra. She was a cliché villain with a cliché plan and gave a very dull, not even cheesy fun performance.

This movie is competently shot and edited but if you are considering watching this film(or have already watched it, disagree with me and are gonna down-vote this because our opinions differ) then you probably aren't looking for technical perfection. There was an overuse of slow motion, however. I get this was a thing in the show but they could have reigned it in... a lot.

The visual effects in this movie are some of the worst I've ever seen put to film, with any indication of effort. 'The Last Airbender' was more realistic in its entirety than this movie was in TWO fire/explosion effects. They were abysmal and even George Lucas would cringe looking at them.

Now for the main concern, is the film funny. Yes and No. There are some jokes, as stated before, that are clever and will make you laugh if you pay attention. That and the comic relief was also pretty good. Aside from that and some of Johnson's charisma, the comedy devolves to toilet humour. TWO of the leading jokes in this movie and related to a man's (use your imagination) and neither of them work. They are lazy, go on way too long and are played just as a cheap gag and as a way to bloat screen time.

Then there is the atrocious action. This movie had two main action sequences and both are awful. They look fake as heck and don't have the credibility to make them fall into the cheesy fun category.

If you enjoyed this movie, good for you; don't rub it in my face. If you haven't seen this movie(which I imagine you haven't), I cannot recommend it. It's cheap, lazy and has little redeeming qualities. I'll rate it a generous 4 Taint Jokes out of 10."
2.0,1 October 2017,"Matt Brody is a 2-time Olympic champion swimmer. However, due to drug and alcohol problems he has fallen from grace, to the point that he now has to perform community service as part of a plea deal for an offense. He will serve his time as a lifesaver at Emerald Bay lifeguard station, run by the no-nonsense Mitch Buchannon. Brody soon discovers that his celebrity status will earn him no favours. Meanwhile, people are dying in mysterious circumstances in Emerald Bay and Buchannon and his lifesaving team investigate. The occurrences may be linked to a nearby property development.

Quite different to what I was expecting, and pleasantly so. I was expecting some sort of overly-politically-correct, dumbed- down/sanitized-for-SJWs/millennials version of the 90s TV series, or, at best, a remake of the 90s series.

Thankfully, it is neither. Rather than being a more-style-than- substance drama like the TV series, this is a comedy, and a pretty funny one. The humour doesn't pull any punches and, tellingly, the movie is more a parody of the original Baywatch than a remake. Many of the jokes make fun of the original series, and do so very well.

On the downside, it can be too crude at times, resulting in some scenes that aren't funny and just lower the tone. The broad plot is also pretty basic, but then, again, this is a comedy, so par for the course."
1.0,28 May 2017,"They tried to make another 21 Jumpstreet parody and just went horribly wrong. Quite possibly the script the cast saw when they came calling was different or a 'work in progress' -- otherwise, nobody in their WRONG mind would step up to make this trash.

And Mr. Rock, how could you?

We walked out after 30 minutes, the theater people actually approached us and let us into Pirates for free. That movie wasn't much better. Oh well. Just don't see this bastardization of Baywatch. Not funny, crude and filthy (and not in a good way). As far as titillation goes, guys you'll be better off with a beach/car wash flick from the late 80s."
6.0,22 May 2017,"*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Mitch Buchannon (Dwayne Johnson) is the head lifeguard and public face of Baywatch. He takes his job seriously and he not only saves lives but he's also beloved by everyone on the beach. The story picks up on a day where new recruits are trying out to enter Baywatch's training program. We meet a few of the possible finalists, they range from the enthusiastic Summer Quinn (Alexandra Daddario) to underdog Ronnie Greenbaum (John Bass). He's a regular on the beach but he spends his time drooling over lifeguard CJ Parker (Kelly Rohrback). Another potential lifeguard, Matt Brody (Zach Efron) is a former 2 time Olympic gold- medallist who has fallen on hard times. The head of the Baywatch program; Captain Thorpe (Rob Huebel) is shoving Brody down Buchannon's throat as he's only available to them through Brody's community service. Adding to Buchannon's troubles is business mogul Victoria Leeds (Priyanka Chopra). She's swiftly gaining more power in the Bay area through her newly purchased club. Will Mitch be able to properly indoctrinate his chosen recruits and get to the bottom of Victoria's shady behaviour?

I got to see Baywatch early through an advance screening. The success of the original Baywatch was something that didn't make sense. The show was before my time but it was regularly mocked for being extremely cheesy. People often used it as an excuse to check out Pamela Anderson and Yasmine Bleeth. So the 2017 movie version of Baywatch has to pay tribute to the source material yet update this story for a new generation. I'm happy to say that Baywatch has no problem making fun of it's roots and they often come up with creative ways to do it. They aren't quite as meta but the constant slow- motion running and these lifeguards working outside their job descriptions are repeatedly mocked and skewered. The overall plot is outlandish and ridiculous but the movie doesn't sidestep that issue, it addresses it continuously and has fun making fun of it alongside the audience. Does the movie drift too far into implausibility? Absolutely but you can't take this movie seriously. It completely unravels if you do. This isn't an issue just for Baywatch. If a movie can acknowledge how unrealistic it is, I can try to go along with it and Baywatch had the good sense to do this.

I really liked most of the marketing for Baywatch but the movie I got to watch was different from what I expected. The trailers billed this as more of a straight comedy but this ended up being more of an action/comedy. The action in this is decent, the movie is pretty fetishistic for slow-motion but I would still give it a passing grade. They luckily keep most of it light and it largely looks good (minus some pretty bad looking CGI fire). But the reason to see this is the comedy. The movie relies on gross-out humour a little too much at points but the comedic dialogue was really solid and the theatre I saw it in was laughing throughout the movie. The strong chemistry between Dwayne and Zac helps and while I had some small issues with the jokes, I thought they were pretty good.

This movie has a big and admittedly attractive cast that help this movie skirt around narrative issues. Dwayne is his normal charismatic self and his likable demeanour is key for this movie working. Zac shows again that he's an underrated comedic actor and he's really strong with The Rock and by himself. Kelly Rohrbach is funny but even the movie makes no bones about how she's there because of stunning she is. I liked Alexandra and Ilfenesh, both were good but the movie didn't give either of them much to do. I was kind of mixed on Jon Bass and I liked Hannibal Burress in his role. If someone surprised me it was Priyanka Chopra. Her character of Victoria is really cliché and the movie seemed almost determined to make you roll your eyes whenever the story moves back to her. But through her ability and her charisma, she takes a lacklustre character and actually delivers a memorable performance.

Getting to what I didn't like about Baywatch, the biggest thing is that the movie can't seem to quit while they're ahead. They fail to realize when to move away from certain jokes and they're guilty of this more than a few times. This is especially evident when you focus on Ronnie. Jon Bass is funny as this character but his awkwardness is dialed up so much that they run his material into the ground almost every time. It's also a little hard to determine how much Baywatch wants to be taken seriously. The movie goes for straight slapstick and then they will suddenly launch into how the Bay is in serious jeopardy without any transition. That kind of tonal switch can be done but they just couldn't sell it completely.

This movie faces an uphill battle because it will be compared to cinematic success stories like 21 and 22 Jump Street. More recently, you also had the re-imagining of CHIPS. Does Baywatch hit that extremely high bar set by the Jump Street franchise? No but it also laps CHIPS pretty easily. The comparison to 21 Jump Street is fair with this being in the same genre but I feel like people forget how special those movies were. Jump Street came out of nowhere and they achieved universal acclaim when you just don't get that for comedies. Baywatch can't completely distract from how ridiculous the plot is and the movie needed a tighter edit. But the movie is really funny, it features a good cast of actors/actresses that sell out for it and the movie does a good job celebrating/making fun of it's source material. I might be in the minority for this one but I'd give it a 7.5/10 rounding up to an 8/10."

7.0,2 June 2017,I found myself laughing at it rather than with it. Decent actors and acting matched to a bad script. A remake doesn't have to be this bad. This shouldn't have been as bad as it is. The good news is for the guys like me. My rating is for the aesthetics. I could have nearly turned the volume down and enjoyed it just as much.

I got an unbelievable disappointment, how did Seth Gordon get to this horribly directed sh** after directing the perfect horrible bosses? and this Alexandra Daddario chick, how bad can a human being play? one of the most disappointing movies ever, don't watch it even as a joke."

10.0,2 June 2017,"Genuinely entertaining at bits and just plain dull at others. The ending was the high note so you left the cinema in a great mood but the start and middle let it down.

Some particularly gross humor that wasn't to my taste but also some silly stuff that did make me laugh. My main issue was that although it certainly took the mick out of itself, it also felt like it thought it was important and left a bad taste in my mouth. The reactions by certain actors to reviews also put me off as it colored my judgement of characters."
7.0,3 June 2017,"Good cast is wasted in this unfunny and predictable film. If you were fun of ""Baywatch"" series on TV then you know what to expect from this movie. The truth is that ""Baywatch"" won't make anyone think about anything, except maybe about where to plan their next vacation where they, too, can run in slow motion on the sand. But it's summer and maybe this is not too bad. The sad part is that this movie falls back on cheap jokes that simply aren't that funny. Fans of Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron will still have a good time because they have nothing to do but look good in a movie that is otherwise a conceptual disaster."

5.0,22 August 2017,"Normally I don't bother with movie reviews but this was so bad that I had to. It is utterly crap , waste of time to watch this... what ever it is. I was expecting the see a parody about a crap show but no actually they take themselves very seriously and actually try to make movie out of it, complete rubbish."
6.0,2 June 2017,"I have neither been a fan of nor seen an entire episode of Baywatch. My limited exposure to the series was covering a weekend shift at work when it was still airing. And I am pretty sure every time that happened it was the same episode each time. Yet, I never did see the whole thing. So, when I first heard they were doing a movie based on the series, my knee jerk reaction was to snort and give it a hard pass. Then I saw that it was starring Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and saw a trailer and I said, ""Okay, now I have to see it!"".

So, where to even begin on this one?

WARNING: If you are lactose intolerant or suffer from dairy sensitivity, avoid, I repeat, AVOID this film at all costs. Content within contains extremely high levels of cheesiness. 5 times more that recommended USDA allowances.

Baywatch should also be avoided if you take life too seriously, have chronic uptightness, and are woefully lacking a sense of humor or appreciation for complete ridiculousness.

That being said, I confess Baywatch is an awful movie. Absolutely terrible. The plot is thin, the acting amateurish, the characters two dimensional, and with few exceptions the dialogue forgettable. In good conscious I cannot recommend seeing this film at all let alone in the theater except under the following condition. Baywatch is primo Mystery Science Theater 3000 fodder and should be approached accordingly. Even better if done so as a group.

You can neither take this film seriously nor should you try. You will find yourself crackin' on this bad boy and as a result, against all rhyme, reason, and self-respect enjoying yourself. This is one of those it's so bad it's good, train wreck of a film that while horrifying to watch, you can't tear your eyes away and secretly find entertaining.

At the end of the day, if you're looking for a good, quality film, let the sun set on Baywatch and see something else. If, however, you're up for complete, over the top, tripe and a guilty pleasure, brave the breakers, slather on the sunscreen, hit the beach and movie theater and check out Baywatch. It's awful. But, it's an awful 6."
1.0,1 October 2018,"Just incredibly bad. I give it two stars for the two chuckles it got from me. One of which was a female character trying to look cool walking into a palm frond. In comparison, it makes the dumb original TV show seem like it should have won all the Emmys. All of them."
6.0,30 May 2017,"This film has had so many bad reviews and I honestly don't have a clue why. I went to see this film yesterday with my mates and we absolutely loved it! It had so much to offer, funny and entertaining from beginning to end. The acting was fantastic and the actors in this really know how to keep you entertained.

The film was hilarious, action packed, very sexy and the story line was brilliantly planned out. The way you have to follow the character of Matt Brody played by Zac Efron is great and makes you want to stay and see what happens. At the end of the day these bad reviews and scores this film is getting really confuses me, this is the best film I have seen in such a long time and I can't wait for Baywatch 2!"
4.0,16 June 2017,"Baywatch is a good movie with a reasonably well developed plot and a fantastic comedic cast. It is a very fun movie that had me laughing throughout. As you know, it is based on the show of the same name and, similarly to 21 Jump Street, it turns the concept of the television series on its head, making it a raunchy comedy. The chemistry between the cast members makes this film, I enjoyed each individual relationship, particularly Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron, who have a big brother, little brother dynamic for the entire movie. Efron and Alexandra Daddario also had a very sweet connection with one another, as well as Kelly Rohrbach and Jon Bass, who had a dynamic that never failed to make me laugh.

I did not, however, appreciate the moments when this movie got too serious. There is an entire sequence when they go to save a burning boat, which I get was to showcase the seriousness of their situation, but it was fifteen minutes of no laughs, no comedy. It was all way too dramatic, and it seemed like the writers and director got a little too big for their britches.

As well as that, once the plot really kicks in, I found the performers started to play their parts far too straight. The first half of the movie is pure hilarity, then it gets very serious and turns in to a tribute to Baywatch, rather than a spoof. It should have taken a leaf out of Jump Street's book, in which it never took out the fun and steered away from the television series as far as possible.

It is simple, harmless comedy from start to finish. It certainly has its flaws, but Baywatch is a great laugh, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy.

A new crew member turns up on Mitch Buchannon's beach while a criminal plot threatens their future, causing them to investigate.

1.0,4 June 2017,"That's saying a lot cause The Rock is in it, and I mean you can't go wrong with the Rock and the Rock can do no wrong. He was funny as the head of the lifeguards who seems to take his job more serious than needed. Plus Zac Efron was funny too, as his foil, a hot shot Olympic champion who does not understand why the lifeguards are acting like cops. Plus I love Alexandra Daddario, such a beautiful woman, but a surprise to me that I found the women they got to play Pamela Anderson's part in the film more stunning, but she had an unfair advantage being next to Jon Bass who plays the lifeguard who looks nothing like the other beautiful people but had some funny bits that she got to tag along in, which made her look better.

Anyway, despite having the Rock in it, the movie Baywacth is stale as hell. It's not a matter of weather it's good or bad, it's a matter of it falling so bland that you can't even taste it. This movie is a waste of the Rock's time, and yours.

Just because it was ""Based"" off a popular show doesn't mean it's going to be good let that be a lesson to anyone who grew up with this show this movie really proves to be beyond stupid.

This movie within the first ten minutes was clearly made by people who never seen a comedy before in their lives and that the target audience wasn't aimed at the right people.

Wasted ten good minutes that I will never get back and I got up and left the room because I value my brain more than to see a second of this curse film.

And it shouldn't be allow to be called a movie when it is just made by a munch of idiots that goes for the writers the cast and crew you should all be ashamed that you even agree to work on this movie for what? Because you were bored?

This movie should be destroyed no matter the cost and avoid at all cost.

I wish IMDb would consider a zero star rating because this is one of those films that deserves it

Baywatch gets a zero out of ten !"
4.0,3 September 2017,"This could have been much better, but there was too much confusion on which age group to target.

The mindless entertainment quality was targeted towards teens, but the vocabulary and sexual innuendos were target towards adults. This in my opinion was a fail.

Add to the fact that the humor was lame (and could have been better for either target age group), this film missed the mark drastically.

Even though I wasn't expecting much, I still expected a little more than what was produced.

Sadly, only a 6/10 from me."
4.0,30 May 2017,"I broke down and saw this on $5 day because to be honest nothing else I hadn't seen was playing. I wasn't expecting much and the film didn't deliver much. The plot is crazy and most of the jokes fall flat (most of the jokes are of the lowest type of sophomoric humor which I'm not a fan of to start, but there are funny sophomoric jokes, just not for the most part in this film). But that being said the women were beautiful and looked great in their swimsuits and I'm sure the ladies will appreciate Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron, both of whom are absolutely cut. Of course next to Dwayne Johnson, Zac looks pretty small, but pretty much everyone does. The three female lifeguards are all very tall so as to not look ridiculous standing next to Dwayne (he still towers over them of course), but that means they are of course also taller than Zac. He gets most of his screen time with Alexandra Daddario who is about his height while Kelly Rohrbach and in particular Ilfenesh Hadera are taller than him. Tough to cast actresses who aren't too short for scenes with the Rock who aren't going to be too tall for Zac. The Rock really needs male co-stars at least 6' tall or so to not be totally overwhelmed by his size at 6'5"". All in all the film wasn't terrible due to all the eye candy, but frankly that's about all it has going for it."
7.0,27 March 2018,"I'm shocked by the terribly negative reviews. They read as if the writers were expecting a movie that aims for Oscar consideration or ""serious 'art,'"" or as if they expected it to be built with a George Carlin like comic style and genius. Baywatch should be judged on its own merits. If ""dick jokes"" as many have called them and or the kind of machismo humor used here offend you than perhaps you need to brush that chip off your shoulder and grow up. ""Childish?"" Maturity has more to do with an ability to cope and laugh at anything. An inability to do those, along with a need to appear adult like by rejecting some humor as inappropriate is by definition immaturity. If you don't like it, fine. But the horribly negative judgments are incredible.

This movie was HILARIOUS. Every movie has its place within every genre which also has its place, so this should be rated accordingly. This movie will make you laugh right from the start as long as you see it for what it is. It is a satirical comedy with an exaggeration on real life people, their egos, and the craziness they can get into. Along with Girls Trip, by far the best comedy of the past 5 years imo. I only gave it a seven because, after all, it still isn't ""great art"", nor does it have the strongest story line, but nevertheless, it entertained me so much it is only the second DVD I have purchased after seeing a movie in a decade."
1.0,17 August 2017,"Seriously, what is going on with you Americans? Are you really all as stupid as this movie, whooping and hollering to anything that moves! This movie is an absolute farce, it was OK for the first 15 minutes then became cheesier by the minute! The acting is terrible, the storyline and plots were pathetic, and if they had kept it to lifeguarding and general beach mishaps then it may have been OK! And wtf is going on with Zac Efron these days with his fake tan and plastic muscles? And if anyone lets their kids watch this perverted load of donkey turd then they want shooting through the head!"
7.0,1 June 2017,"'BAYWATCH': Four Stars (Out of Five)

A satirical feature film adaptation of the 80s cult classic TV show, of the same name, starring David Hasselfhoff (who also has a cameo in this movie, along with his TV costar Pamela Anderson). The film stars Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, Zac Efron, Priyanka Chopra, Alexandra Daddario, Kelly Rohrbach, Jon Bass and Ilfenesh Hadera. It was directed by Seth Gordon (who also helmed 2011's 'HORRIBLE BOSSES' and 2013's 'IDENTITY THIEF') and it was written by Damian Shannon, Mark Swift, Jay Scherick, David Ronn, Thomas Lennon and Robert Ben Garant (Lennon and Garant are of 'RENON 911!' fame). In the film Johnson plays the self righteous leader of a special team of lifeguards, which fight crime on the beaches of Emerald Bay, Florida. A disgraced former Olympian (Efron) is added to the team to help with PR, while the lifeguards try to take on a corrupt business woman who might be smuggling drugs. The movie has received mostly bad reviews from critics, and it's also disappointed at the Box Office so far. I found it to be much better made, and more entertaining, than the critics have given it credit for!

Lt. Mitch Buchannon (Johnson) thinks way too highly of himself, and his job as a lifeguard, and he often upsets the local authorities, and his captain (Ron Huebel), by investigating crimes he has no jurisdiction over. So when Mitch finds a bag of drugs on his beach, and suspects a local business woman (Chopra) is to blame for it, he gets himself, and his team of lifeguards, in a lot of trouble trying to prove his suspicions correct. At the same time Mitch also has to deal with three new recruits to his lifeguard team, including a cocky ex-Olympic athlete named Matt Brody (Efron). Brody and Buchannon's enormous egos both continue to battle each other, while they also try to keep their beach safe.

The movie is surprisingly entertaining; it's consistently funny and the action scenes are pretty slick and exciting too. Going into the film expecting it to be a bad movie, I'm sure helped it's enjoyment level for me as well. I think The Rock and Efron are both great in the film, and they also have pretty good chemistry together as well. Chopra makes a great femme fatale villain in it too, and Bass is pretty funny also. It's just an all around amusing and fun time at the movies, and it's much better than the TV show it's parodying as well.

3.0,17 August 2017,"Well, here's a film that thinks shoving tonnes of dick jokes (and dicks!) in the face of the viewer will induce laughter. I'd liked Seth Gordon's ""Horrible Bosses"". It sortof struck a balance between good humor and crass humor, and the cast shared great chemistry amongst themselves. But 'Baywatch' is a different scenario altogether.

The ensemble comprising of Dwayne Johnson, Zac Efron, Alexandra Daddario, Ilfenesh Hadera, and Kelly Rohrback all felt like they were playing 'wannabes' in the film. In fact, they seemed to be playing semi-parodies of themselves. There's a far-fetched plot line where a bunch of life-guards try to expose the drug-ring run by Victoria Leeds (played by Priyanka Chopra) and their sordid attempts at evoking hilarity.

The group seems to tick-off every stereotype known to hamper the fun element in films such as these. There's the out-of-shape I.T nerd (Jon Bass) who lusts after the hot blonde (Rohrback), the tough woman (Ilfenesh) who's exuding tough-woman vibes 24^7, the young spoilt achiever (Efron; who needs external help to realize his true strengths and the gratification of work in a team rather than alone), the brunette who helps the spoilt dude in 'finding himself', and led by the biggest badass of them all - Mr. Tough Guy Mitch Buchannon (Johnson).

The biggest flaw with 'Baywatch' is that the movie sticks to either one of the extremes - deadbeat or downright ridiculous. The women are more or less eye-candy placements, the men make terrible decisions and are subjected to dick-jokes every now and then..in short, the character arcs are not one bit worth the buy. Although, I should be honest in saying that the actors could've performed better had the writing been of higher quality. Even the cameo placements of Hasselhoff and Anderson are executed in a slipshod manner. Chopra impresses in her comparatively less screen-time-occupying role. If your idea of 'awesomeness' is an abundance of boobs, dick-jokes and sloppily executed set-pieces, then this film is for you. 'Baywatch' is at best, a throw-away afternoon watch.

Verdict: Not exactly the movie that turns things around for the brand!"
10.0,11 March 2019,"I didn't have high expectations for an Oscar nominator, and Batwatch met that. It was predictable, sexist, cringy at times, but I got a kick out of it.

My biggest gripe is that it didn't know what it wanted to be. At times serious, others quirky and at times trying to be a caricature of the TV show. The problem was that the characters themselves did the same, not just the plot, leaving me really disliking (as a character) many of the antagonists."
7.0,25 August 2017,"I usually write lengthy detailed reviews of movies, but honestly, this time I can't- this one was just terrible. Period. The writers could have done a better job of making fun of one of the cheesiest TV shows ever. The jokes were predictable and quite stale. The sexual puns were just less than childish. The girls were pretty hot however but the males were over the top ridiculously over buff, if that's a term. The cameos were totally unnecessary and silly. This was slapped together too quickly and not thought out very well. Hey- but if you've already watched everything else, you like face palming, sighing, and getting a lil puke in your throat, then, by all means, watch this. Honestly, I got one lil chuckle... or was it a hiccup?... idk."

1.0,18 June 2017,"I honestly don't know where the negative reviews are coming from. I mean haven't they seen the original Baywatch or what?

What really made this reboot succeed is the fact that it used source materials, it doesn't try to be different or new, it simply follows the original Baywatch.

It had the right amount of titties, dicks and ass just like back in 1989. It had great comedy, chemistry between The Rock and Zac Efron. Support cast was also likable.

The only downside is that after the first half of the movie some scenes started to drag a bit and kinda lost it's charm, that the first hour had and some jokes felt forced on. Still a great rated R fun.

I haven't laughed that much in 2 hours for a long time. Recommend!"

1.0,27 June 2017,"I went into this film thinking it was going to be serious and that I would judge it as such. After the hilarious over the top open sequence it's clear this film as no intention to take itself seriously, and neither should you. It's not trying to be a gritty hard hitting detective themed action drama masterpiece and I feel that's the standard to which this film is being held by many reviews. There are plot holes and some of the action scenes are over the top and unrealistic. One moment in particular when the main characters are hiding, laughing and making jokes not 5 feet from a couple of thugs without so much as a curtain to separate them, but it is a funny scene. The plot is thin and there is little character development but it doesn't matter. It's a silly, self-aware and ultimately fun film that makes no excuses for what it is or isn't. Don't go into this film thinking it's trying to get Oscar nominations and you'll probably just enjoy the ride."
6.0,11 July 2017,"Honestly, it's bad, but it still wasn't the worst film I have ever seen. Its acting is terrible (except the two I mentioned above), its characters are horrible, its writing is really bad, the villain is more annoying than menacing, and the jokes that it presents throughout the film are either okay or never cause a single chuckle.

Would totally recommend this to anyone and would love to see it again!"
6.0,12 September 2017,"I rented this off a to be unnamed red kiosk machine and didn't expect much from it, but it turned out to be mildly humorous movie with a few laugh out loud moments. It was more entertaining than I was expecting and deserves a bit better of a rating on IMDb and on the review boards. It's too bad that it was trashed like it was, but then again, maybe that is why I liked it."
1.0,25 May 2017,"I don't claim to know much about the original Baywatch TV series (besides the obvious things), but I do know what a good comedy entails. I know that when I go to a comedy I expect to laugh. Baywatch rarely delivers enough action or comedy to keep the film from moving at a begrudgingly slow pace.

So, if it's not funny then what's the point? Well, there really isn't any. Baywatch attempts to follow in the same line with films like Fast and Furious where silly humor and visceral action lead the way. But there's a big difference here. Where in other films it feels funny because the characters inside the story don't realize how serious they're taking the situations they're in, it's the opposite with Baywatch. It almost feels like the characters in Baywatch know they are in a ridiculous comedy and continue to act like it, coming ever too close to winking at the camera at times.

Films like that only work if the tone is just right. It's very difficult to pinpoint who exactly this film is targeting. You'd think it's the R rated comedy crowd, but the film recycles so many old jokes and comedy tropes that I would find it difficult for anyone to get super invested. When the jokes aren't hitting you have to look to the characters for something to grapple onto. All of these actors and actresses are beautiful to look at, but besides Zac Efron's character, none of them are fleshed out. In my mind The Rock can do no wrong, but I certainly would have expected more out of him (especially considering he helped produce this as well).

The worst part is that you can see every story beat coming. You know when someone is going to get the girl or guy they want, you know when they won't, you know when the characters are about to go through a big moment, and you know when the big gag or joke is about to hit. I didn't even mention how pointless and out of place the cameos feel. I haven't seen all of Seth Gordon's directorial efforts, but I really enjoy Horrible Bosses so I expected to at least get a kick out of Baywatch/superheroes on the beach, but it wasn't meant to be. Man oh man is it hard to make rated R comedies these days.

6.0,17 August 2020,"It has a couple of decent moments, but 'Baywatch' is mostly uninspiring.

For a comedy, it takes itself way too seriously in parts. None of the heartfelt stuff really lands, while a lot of the humour is over reliant on sexual innuendo. The premise is followable, if entirely predictable. The cast is oversized, way too many characters. Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron are good enough in their respective roles as Mitch and Matt.

Summer (Alexandra Daddario) and Victoria (Priyanka Chopra) are alright but underdeveloped, as is Stephanie (Ilfenesh Hadera). C. J. (Kelly Rohrbach) and Ronnie (Jon Bass), meanwhile, are annoying and extremely pointless. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II (Ellerbee) is solid in a small role.

I've never watched the original television series so maybe I missed a few callbacks etc., while there are two (incredibly forced) cameos from it. If it stayed at what it should be - a comedy - then I may have liked this, I simply didn't though.

Not terrible, but I still wouldn't say you should rush to see this."
2.0,28 February 2021,"One of the worst movies I ever saw. For those who liked the typical cliché style of the original series, will find this film a disrespectful view of the sarcastic use of certain filming methods, such as the slow motion drive.

The profanity is severe and the screenplay is just bad. Although, the amazing water scenes and the beach lifestyle create a good vibe for the first act, the ""villain"", Victoria, has no motivation nor a good introduction. She is just another foreign (in which is portrayed wrongly in so many movies, and creates a tendency) that is major thug, drug dealer, with huge body guards and a bad mood.

The only thing that is nice is the addition on a non stereotypical Baywatch team, by adding Jon Bass (""Ronnie"") be part of it. Other than that, is just a waste of time, and good actors."
7.0,22 September 2017,"Do you remember four months back when this was sold as a buddy movie? Maybe that's what piqued my curiosity, that it's not the T&A but the beefcake that people want (which it has in abundance).

""Baywatch"" has it share of missteps; it goes overboard with the slo-mo, and some of the hokes are awful. But as much as I wanted (subconsciously) to slam this movie, I ended up enjoying it as the breezy Summer fare that it is. I think it's because the other recent TV property that springs to mind is ""CHIPS"", and that's a low damn bar.

But I like this cast. And it works almost purely because of all- around good guy Dwayne Johnson. His enthusiasm for this is unbridled and this would sink quickly without him. It's a testament to his screen presence.

I'll come right out and say it: I wouldn't mind a sequel.

5.0,22 September 2017,"Charles Bronson once said ""I don't make films for the critics."" He had a point: His films were often unjustly criticized for having little social or artistic value, glorifying violence, etc. But like late great Roger Ebert said, every film must be evaluated within its genre. You can't compare Bronson's movies to, say, Frank Capra movies. Bronson made action movies and thrillers, and as far as those go, they were well made.

So when Dwayne Johnson echoed Mr. Bronson as a response to the criticism Baywatch has received, I was surprised. According to the IMDb trivia, Johnson tweeted that ""the film wasn't made for critics."" Who was it made for, then? Can't be adults, with a virtually non-existent plot and the humour level of Sesame Street. Can't be children, with all the swearing and sexual ""jokes."" Can't be teenagers, who are drowning in movie action and comedy, which this film delivers none.

This film is totally devoid of any kind of cinematic entertainment. There is literally no action apart from a fight scene and an explosion. No eroticism, which is a miracle: It's quite an accomplishment to have so many semi clad women and have zero sexuality coming from any of them. (I guess the best way to put it is, they are all very pretty but very unattractive). There's no homage to the Baywatch series, except one scene with David Hasselhoff and one with Pamela Anderson (she doesn't even have lines, just walks for 15 seconds).

As for comedy: now, where to start... First of all, I have nothing against sexual jokes. If they're done well, they're hilarious (American Pie, Animal House, many 80's comedies) But there has to be a joke, some funny situation. Sex itself is not funny. The famous scene in American Pie had the actor get his penis stuck in a pie, and caught by his parents. The situation was funny. The audience laughed. Baywatch does not aim for that audience. They aim for the audience that laugh at the word ""penis."" Hence we have long dialogues about penises. Try as hard as you can, and you won't find anything remotely funny. And just when you think it has become painful and start checking your watch, that's when it starts: more penis jokes.

The film even uses the ""nerdy, slightly overweight guy with glasses who stammers when he sees girls"" character. The first million times this cardboard character was used in movies, it wasn't funny. It still isn't funny. Plus, it doesn't work in 2017. This guy works at a beach, surrounded by women every day. He was born into the internet, he has seen more nudity than five generations of his ancestors combined. And he still goes bk... bk... bk... when he sees a girl? Ho ho and one more ho for you, dear writers.

He also has a dance scene that has to be seen to be believed. Just visit Youtube and you'll be out of breath from laughing at the funny dance videos of drunks, kids, bad dancers, etc. And here is Baywatch, presenting you the first unfunny bad dance video. It makes one cringe that this is the best an ""actor"" can come up with.

Then there are the leads... Dwayne Johnson spends the whole movie explaining things, since the plot can't. Teamwork among lifeguards is very important, one should never act alone. Since the writers have no idea how to demonstrate this with a couple of scenes, we have repeated lectures from Johnson about teamwork.

Zac Efron, who plays basically a drama queen, is stuck with the worst written character in his career, and that's really saying something. There is one particular scene where the ""team"" goes to a party to find out about drugs, and Zac is supposed to be the lookout. He happily agrees because he wants to be a part of the team. (Because teamwork is very important, remember?) Then out of nowhere, he decides to botch it up. Why? For the sole reason of playing out another cliché scene: He goes to Mitch (Johnson's character) the next morning, teary-eyed, and says he's sorry, and throws his swimming medal into the ocean.

Then comes the best part. Mitch is set up and removed from his position, and once the team finds out about it... oh, brother. Efron starts chanting ""Mitch was right! Mitch was right! He was set up! Mitch was right!"" Since neither the writers nor the director has any idea about how to create drama and suspense about an injustice done to the lead character (through editing, writing, music, or God forbid, acting) they choose the easy way and have the other characters talk about him. ""Mitch was right! He was right.""

Other reviewers have pointed out the numerous plot holes, inconsistencies, ridiculous mistakes, etc. Here is my favorite, if someone hasn't pointed it out before: The tech guy in the team (nerdy, chubby guy with glasses, of course) hacks into the drug lord's computer, and what does he find? Photographs of cocaine or heroine, neatly packed, ready to be smuggled. I'm sure all drug dealers take and keep photos of their operations on their computers, as souvenirs.

It's a small miracle that this film cost 69 million dollars. In its grueling 116 minutes of running time, there's nothing to justify that kind of money. Even the boat fire scene is obviously CGI.

The best thing in the movie is David Hasselhoff's cameo. He also appears in the ""credits roll"" which looks like they're saying ""Oh, the fun we had while shooting this!"" If you haven't had enough of penis jokes, we have more in the credits roll. D. Johnson's hearty and sincere laughter after these jokes is sad: It makes one think that he actually finds the word ""penis"" funny. They also mention a sequel... Heavens forbid.

But most important of all, it leaves you wondering: Was Mitch right?"

1.0,18 August 2017,"The trailers didn't deceive you: the film is gross, misogynistic, funny and fast.

Its biggest problem is that it often takes itself seriously - that alone deserves an outcry. You just cannot mix the elements of a dirty comedy with anything which wants to be close to a serious crime thriller.

And its second problem is that its two main lead male characters are a serious miscast. Rock Dwayne as a lifeguard? You must be kidding me.

And lastly, the script sometimes is just excessively cliché as if it was written for kids or teenagers.

Anyways, if you're in for some good laughs, I'd recommend this movie."
9.0,28 May 2017,"I rarely do this, but this is the orator film of 2017. I wanted to like it, but is is a dumpster Fire of a film. I just wanted to laugh, but the film is not funny.

I truly feel sorry for the Rock. Yes his career will survive, but this film is. MJor blow.

6.0,30 May 2017,"Director Seth Gordon (The Goldbergs, Horrible Bosses, and Identity Thief) steps onto the beach and lends his comedy chops to the big screen adaptation of Baywatch starring Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron. So, is it any good? While Gordon does his best to put a solid effort into Baywatch, the problem is it feels like it wasn't made for him to direct. The other movies he has directed in the past felt like the perfect projects for him, but this one just doesn't seem to work. Whilst filming hot babes and hot guys on the beach running in slow motion (like in the show) is all fun to look at for everyone, it never really gets to the point. Sometimes you wonder if it even has a point.The cast members do everything they can. They improvise, they take off their tops (mainly Efron and Johnson), they do weight lifting, loads of running, etc, but they just can't seem to save this movie no matter how hard they try. The villain Victoria Leeds (played by Priyanka Chopra) is also not a very good choice for a villain. She didn't have a good presence and wasn't intimidating enough to make us think she was really evil.

The chemistry between Efron and Johnson is actually quite interesting, and a lot of the gags work between them. Using references like Justin Bieber and High School Musical, it does have its moments of comedy genius. The problem is there are several of these kinds of jokes thrown in there and 80% of them just don't work. So much of the movie's comedy revolved around dick jokes, and while there's nothing wrong that, the problem is it felt extremely overplayed and overdone.Another problem would be the CGI. In comedy movies normally CGI shouldn't matter because it's a comedy and comedy is a joke, but come on THIS IS TOO FAKE! Whenever there is fire or explosions you just aren't convinced and it felt like you were looking at a bad 70's movie, and some of those movies had better fire effects. Even some of the regular backgrounds were fake at times it makes us wonder if Efron's body is fake! I know we sound like we're bashing this movie extremely hard, but there is goodness in it. The casting of everybody was perfect. John Bass (who looks and acts like Josh Gad) was quite good, as were the Baywatch girls. With a better director, better script, and a better special effects team this movie would have definitely been in much better hands. It's not disastrous, but it's definitely something unmemorable and we won't be watching it again. 2/5 stars. Check us out on facebook and Instagram. The Autistic Reviewers."

There was a plot, albeit not real great. I largely liked it because of the pretty girls/ladies. I'd like to say that it had a lot more to it than that, but it honestly do not although the acting was mostly fairly good.

So if watching it because it's the next greatest classic, you won't be, but it is fairly entertaining."

I hate the movie but i'm trying to figure out what i hate more the film or my friends. The film was hyped up so much, I was expecting to have an attack on all of my senses, a reenactment of Gallipoli if you will. But not even a boner was popped at any of those sexual scenes. Zac Erfon, aka Troy, was not even in tippy toppy shape. He did not fit the role what so ever. The Rock couldn't even make this film any better... it was that sh*t. I'm not gonna lie i did crack a cheeky giggle at fat boy slim getting his dick stuck in the beach chair, but the only comedy i feel i endured was my friends and I sexually caressing and bullying each other. I feel as if I've been ripped off and I am unfulfilled."

10.0,18 May 2018,"I used to watch the show on TV back in the 1980s and I had a huge crush on Yasmine Bleeth. But the show was pure cheese and ass. Okay, it was pure T & A, but the acting was pure cheese.

Skip to this version. Its not a bad overall movie, but like most of the remakes of television shows, they completely miss the mark in terms of tone of the original. Baywatch (TV) never took itself seriously and knew it was just about oogling the girls. The movie seems to want to be taken seriously.

Dwayne Johnson is Mitch (Hasselhof's old role). He treats Baywatch like its the last line of defense against an oncoming apocalypse. His character is way too intense and he gets the motivation all wrong. Its actually kind of understandable why the local law enforcement thinks he's nuts. Zac Efron is Matt Brody, a former Olympic swimmer being forced to join Baywatch as part of his community service. He comes off as arrogant, privileged and cocky. He actually played the character pretty well. The rest of the cast are kind of indiscriminate. Kelly Rorhbach, Alexandra Daddario and Ilfenesh Hadera as the fellow lifeguards are gorgeous and Daddario is so easy on the eyes, you want to fall asleep in her hair. Priyanka Chopra as the villain was wasted.

The plot appears to have been written by a 13 year old boy. Its both giggly over the jiggly and so dumbed down it was comical. In spite of all of that, I really enjoyed it. The actors are so likeable, its impossible not to become engaged in their performance, shallows as it is. Johnson and Efron have a nice chemistry and I still can't get over Daddario's eyes."
7.0,28 May 2017,"Baywatch is a movie based on the TV show of the same name that ran from 1989 to 1999. It is about a lieutenant of a group of lifeguards called Baywatch, who is played by Dwayne Johnson and he begins picking out three new recruits for the team, one is named Summer, another Ronnie and the last one is named Matt Brody who is played by Zac Efron. Out of all of them, Matt needs a lot of training before becoming an official member of the team, but as he receives his training from the lieutenant, it seems like there is someone causing trouble around the beach and it is up to the team to investigate and stop the trouble before it ruins their beach.

Now I've never gotten into the Baywatch TV show, so therefore I just don't care about it. When I brought the movie up with my father, he told me that the TV show was plain stupid, so I kinda knew what I was going into. By two minutes in, I knew exactly what I was getting into. The movie utilizes a lot of slow motion as if they want to make the characters look sexier or something. I didn't find it sexy though, I just found it hilariously corny. I'm not even kidding when I laughed at every slow motion scene in this movie. In fact, I laughed at every cheesy and stupid scene and joke in this movie. Since I knew that the movie was going to be stupid after the first two minutes, I just embraced it and enjoyed the experience while I could.

The story was confusing at times, but hey, it was at least coherent most of the time. I know what it was trying to be; an adaptation to the TV show from the 90s. While I can't judge it as an adaptation since I haven't seen the source material, I can say that it lives up to the corniness of the TV show that my father described. There were many dramatic slow motion scenes of the actors, mostly the women, running. The action scenes were okay. They were one of the few tolerable parts of this entire movie. The action and acting in general were fine. Most of the jokes missed, but I found them enjoyable in an ironic way. Even if I did enjoy this ironically, I can't call this a guilty pleasure. I can't say I enjoyed it simply because I laughed at it. This was an incredibly stupid movie that I can only recommend to those who enjoyed the show.

3/10"

1.0,23 December 2017,"12/22/17. A total disappointment on many levels. I like Johnson and Efron, but not when they are together onscreen. Apparently there is just way too much testosterone when they are together in the same movie. The screen (big screen included) is just not large enough to contain their competing egos. I was so disappointed to see the Rock basically bullying Efron at ever chance he got. The script was a total mess. One is never sure if this was supposed to be a fluff piece or a semi-serious murder mystery, or WHAT???!? Not sure if I can really recommend this, even to Johnson and Efron fans."

Not to down play Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron's performances but I just think that the casting and comedy was just not my cup of tea at all and the only excitement in this film was seeing David Hassaloff and the original and only CJ Parker, Pamela Anderson who came at the end and had no lines.

The plot was barely there and wasn't enough to string together the enjoyable bits, leaving the viewer with a feeling that something was off. There was no one bad thing about the movie and — to be clear — the cast and characters were great, the writing had its moments, the premise might have been successful had they tried a bit harder – but what we were left with instead was a lot of wasted potential, hanging plot points, and a bad taste in the mouth that most unnecessary reboots do."

1.0,28 September 2017,"Baywatch seems to function as some kind of attempt at propaganda for the idiocracy, but it's probably just that the producers in Hollywood at this point are sooooo out of it and out of touch that they actually thought this would go over well.

For some bizarre reason (as if ""reason"" has anything to do with any of this) they choose the grotesquely overmuscled ""The Rock"", a mediocre actor at best who looks like the toll-taking troll who lives under a bridge (ie, he is one ugly mofo), to fill the shoes of David Hassellhoff, talk about a miscast. It's almost as if someone out there wants to deliberately humiliate Mr The Rock and destroy his career, though it's probably just those drug-addled, sex addicted producers again thinking it would be a great idea.

Then there's Zac Effron, another mediocre actor who looks like a male Barbie doll and plays a character who is someone you would just like to kill with great satisfaction.

What a perfect pair: two mediocre actors who have a great future lined up in gay porn. One a top and the other a bottom.

Then there's the bevy of bimbos, some of which are fun to look at sometimes, although there's more attractive women out there these days they could have gotten, not to mention probably more talented too. I heard one of them is a big Indian star. Well whatever, not like her performance or presence could save this doomed stinkhole of a movie.

The only reason why I even saw this was because I have a dear friend who's unfortunately into a lot of bad movies. The weed helped, what can I say? I played with my phone as much as possible through it, for some salvation for myself. Seems like the big studio system evacuates movies out of factory a-holes these days deliberately manufactured so that you have an excuse to play with your phone.

The only good about this movie is that maybe the people who actually like Lame Johnson see how lame he actually is. Why this guy is, supposedly, the highest paid movie star is too nonsensical to comprehend or compute. Unless you can chalk it up to his fans being such a lowest common denominator lot that they haven't figured out how to use the internet yet, or their own brains.

10.0,5 June 2017,"Sometimes checking the critics before going to the cinema might be something to avoid (the practice in general can be questioned). Especially, in the case of Baywatch:

In my opinion, many of our beloved critics evaluated the movie against wrongly chosen criteria. It is neither supposed to be next Oscar movie, nor to contain outstanding character development or have a very sophisticated plot.

This movie is just fun - exactly what it is meant to be. Therefore, it gets 8 out of ten, because it exactly fulfilled that purpose."
7.0,16 August 2017,"Hands up who would believe Baywatch to have a serious intelligent plot that challenges modern day film-making?

Like me you probably don't expect much of this and with some pretty terrible films coming out of the USA with some really poor plots. However, Baywatch is different.

They have not gone down the crude and stupid that we see in many US comedy films lately. No sign of Adam Sandler, James Franco or anyone called Seth.

The plot makes sense and the characters are true to Baywatch's history of being slightly over the top. There are realistic stunts and as such it almost feels sensible. The jokes are mostly PG and corny. In this film they do all the things from the TV series, such as investigate and occasionally save lives on the beach and yet the police constantly remind them this isn't their job.

All in all it's better than expected. It won't win an Oscar and the Rock and Zak Effron add their usual talents. While they have been joined by some great new talents including the very beautiful Kelly Rohrbach, who reminds me of Margot Robbie. I will even consider watching it again and if a sequel comes around then I'd like to see Erika Eleniak make a cameo."

1.0,16 August 2017,"Baywatch

The most important thing to remember when lifeguarding is to not rely on dolphins to save every one.

Thankfully, the lifeguards in this comedy are keeping their beach safe themselves.

When esteemed lifeguard Mitch (Dwayne Johnson) is forced to add hotshot Olympian Brody (Zac Efron) to his summer roster, he shows his distain by training the cocksure rookie himself.

After enduring Mitch's grueling feats of strength, Brody is filled in on the Baywatch team's (Alexandra Daddario, Kelly Rohrbach) extracurricular activities: surveilling a suspected drug smuggler (Priyanka Chopra).

A raunchier version of the already exploitive television series, this poorly written feature film adaptation brings the show's best assets to the forefront but at the expensive of a decent story and capable acting. The terrible T&A humour aside, this quasi-tribute plays more like an insult to the show and it's fans.

Incidentally, the only explosions lifeguards see are the beached whale kind.

The plot is stupid, very simple and predictable. Anyone could have written a better story. The acting is so bad that it is painful to watch. The characters have no personality, none at all. The jokes have been heard so many times before and they are just clumsy and not funny. It's like a bad Seth Rogen movie. And the filming and cutting is very bad/annoying. It seems like it is supposed to be very artistic, but in my opinion it failed horribly.

This isn't even one of those movies that are so bad that they are good. This is just a terrible movie and it seems they only made this to show how much muscles the Rock has."

7.0,20 June 2018,"The first time I heard about Baywatch was from Friends and they made it clear what it was, an over the top show made for men's fantasies. So I knew the film was going to be ridiculous along with the reviews and it was. But it was ridiculously over the top and even self aware of it. There were a lot of problems with the film but above all that the characters talk like they are trying to make it entertaining knowing that it's filled with problems. A lot of scenes and dialogues felt like taken right out of a cartoon show and it worked for me. Then there was Alexandra Daddario and Kelly Rohrbach who helped me forget the rest of the problems. It's probably a bad film but was a hell of an entertainment as far as I'm concerned."
1.0,21 January 2020,"""Baywatch"" is a 2017 action comedy directed by Seth Gordon starring Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron. There has been an era in the history of TV when a show about sexualized lifeguards in way too tight, red swimsuits who tend to walk in slow motion and like to pose as detectives delighted the audience with it's sheer cheesiness. I asked my mother whether she liked it then and her genuine answer was ""Yes, we all did back in the day, but I think a show like this wouldn't work in modern times"" and I think that's the quintessence of the film's general reception - mine included. From the beginning on it appeared to me that Michael Bay watched over the whole production (pun intended) as it's already shown in the first sequence how silly and overstated it is. The whole editing style was simply ridiculous and what in the actual hell was that thing with the dolphins, the title epically rising from the water and the apotheosis of The Rock? I knew I was in for some cheesy stuff, but that was already more than I have asked for. In the same manner the film went on and introduced us to characters who couldn't have been more irrelevant. Bass, who I expected to be the comic relief and the appealing figure, was just a laughingstock who just fulfilled the stereotypes of the group dork. Also the other actresses were reduced to their outer appearance. Don't get me wrong, they all are smoking hot, especially Kelly Rohrbach, but I think it's a wasted potential that all of them, particularly Alexandra Daddarrio, who I consider as a talented actress, only had the chance to present their two most convincing arguments. It's a shame, least to say. I mean, it's undeniable that they are pretty to look at, but if that is what I'm looking for I'd be watching porn instead. The same applies to Efron, the HSM glamour boy who should rather consider a career as a model instead of trying to be a serious Hollywood actor. I like him, actually, but he isn't quite the most talented man in the business. The only notable performance is probably The Rock's. He reached mediocrity with it and you can clearly see how he put blood, sweat and tears in this flotsam of a film and literally is as solid as a rock in it (again, pun intended). I don't wanna say it's good, but it's acknowledgeable that he tried his best. He made the best out of this mess. Although it's supposed to be (or tries to be) a comedy the movie had no scenes I'd consider as particularly funny, except for probably the names Efron's Brody is called on a regular basis. But aside from that there were only unfunny dick jokes and ... no, I think that's the only kind of humour I'm able to remember, maybe it's because the film miserably tries to be an action film in the first place. Remember this somewhat trashy cult game ""Hitman""? This plot feels worse than the most idiotic of all missions. That's enough said. A forgettable villain and embarrassing dialogue create this special feature and it is not redeemed by the attempt to be self-ironic. Oh, before I forget: Have I mentioned how terrible the visual effects look? Was it really so hard to create flames that don't seem to come straight out of a PS2 game? Apparently, it is. All in all, this remake is more of a rip-off of already terrible source material and I'm once more disappointed that this film was actually green-lit and that someone actually thought it's a great idea. Where's the originality? They lost this perspective in favour of making lots of money. This film was doomed to sink and drown from the beginning and there's nothing that could really create a feeling of pleasure in me, it's even too dumb to be a guilty pleasure. Not even the cameos could save it from painfully drowning. They might not have disappointed the Hasselhoff, but they disappointed me. I'd rather suffer from asphyxiation than ever watch it again. And oh lord above, please, don't let there be the sequel that was hinted ... Now let's go back to the good films."

6.0,15 March 2018,"Saw the extended version two hours. The extended version is better because it is longer. And for the reason that I am sure i did'nt miss some very good conversation jokes.

So a seven, maybe not too critical maybe 6,5."

GRADE: D

THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.

IN BRIEF: This lewd unfunny movie is far from entertaining, but definitely far-fetched.

SYNOPSIS: The lifeguards recruit new trainees and fight crime on the sandy beaches of LA.

JIM'S REVIEW: Baywatch 2017 is awful. A smutty profanity-laden movie that seems obsessed with boobs and penises. Now you may say, ""Well that's what I expect from this film version of the television series."" and I will say, ""No, you really don't...it's just plain bad."" The salacious streak that runs deep in this new (and not improved) film version loses that tongue-in-cheek humor and innocence of the 90's television series and detours into lewd and titillating shock value tailor-made for the frat-boy mentality.

￼Just like any body building competition, the human machines are in good shape and well oiled, ready to pose and preen. The flesh is willing, even if the brain is dead. And Baywatch 2017 is in need of rescue...stat! It barely has a pulse!

This movie substitute is has today's audience in mind offering lots of skin, mindless action, and a healthy dose of sleaze whenever the story takes a dive, which is often. A committee of seven led by Damian Shannon and Mark Swift who are credited (or discredited for the resulting non- hilarity) concocted this inane screenplay. Jokes repeatedly fall flat and the double entendres are endless. Just one example of the dialog shows the level of sophistication: ""Why do your balls sound like three-year-olds?"" 'Nuff said?

The casting is picture perfect. The new lifeguard family, still sporting that trademark form- fitting red swimsuits are: a likable Dwayne Johnson as Mitch, the patriarch and Big Kahula, Kelly Rohrbach as sexy C. J., Alexandra Daddario as Summer, Ilfenesh Hadera as Stephanie and Zac Efron as Matt, the main reason to see this film. Also in charge of the so-called comic relief is Jon Bass as Ronnie, a nerdy every-man (sans muscle definition, but having a huge ""personality""). His role is an embarrassment of twitches.

Much has been made of Mr. Efron's regimen to sculpt his fat-free physique. (Let's just say that Michelangelo's David looks like a puny specimen of mankind by comparison.) His dieting and exercise program has certainly succeeded, and his comedy timing is watchable, among other things.

￼As for the script, the minimal plot is in need of a few protein shakes. It involves Mr. Efron's bad- boy character's transformation from egotistical and dim-witted former Olympian champ in need of a PR makeover to a kinder and gentler dim-witted former Olympian champ, under the tutelage of Mr. Johnson's Mitch, the older and supposedly wiser leader. (The bodies aren't the only thing ripped, think back to Ryan Lochte's headlines.) The lifeguards must swing into action to stop drug dealing on the beaches of L.A. Enter Priyanka Chopra as the super villain, and that's no spoiler, as she plays this femme fatale role dressed to kill, literally and figuratively, wearing a host of slinky outfits and stiletto heels. The drugs may wash ashore but subtlety never touches land.

Beside the aforementioned dreadful screenplay, much of the blame goes to Seth Gordon's sub- standard direction. Scenes go on endlessly and the comic pacing is off, although the chemistry between the two leads works as well as any routine buddy movie. The film may pay homage to the once popular television series, but even those episodes looked more realistic than this more expensive movie version.

Although some moviegoers may become slightly woozy at the bodies on display, Baywatch 2017 may cause cinematic stupor and possibly brain damage. Stay outta the water!"
6.0,30 August 2018,Boring and predictable story with maybe three laughs in the whole thing. Only watch if you've seriously nothing else to watch
5.0,25 June 2021,"Well it's not very very good. But its not bad. Avarage you know. Some jokes aren't bad, some jokes are clichés. Well if you want watch it, just watch it. For me you're not gonna regret it."
7.0,20 June 2018,"It's Baywatch so I expect mindless entertainment and that is what I got. The Rock is always good and I swear, Efron grows on me more with each movie he does. Did not care much for the comic relief dude but outside of that, solid enough of a film. Not sure what people expect....it is Baywatch after all."
2.0,15 June 2018,"Terrible, just terrible. Paper thin plot, bad acting, mockbuster quality special effects."
10.0,6 June 2017,"Baywatch was brought back to life on the big screen after the most successful TV show in the early nineteen nineties. The show castes David Hasselhoff as Mitch Buchannon, and Pamela Anderson as one of the beautiful Baywatch babes, C. J. Parker. The movie in turn, has made people around the world feel ecstatic, heartfelt, and sometimes even anxious. In addition, several of the actors showed us each of the iconic characters in a whole new light. The movie starred Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson(as Mitch Buchannon), Zac Efron(as Matt Broody), Alexandra Daddario(as Summer Quinn), Jon Bass(as Ronnie), Ilfenesh Hadera(as Stephanie Holden), and Kelly Rohrbach(as C.J. Parker). The Hoff himself does a short cameo, along with Pamela Anderson in the film. In the first part of the movie, you see Mitch running alongside the ocean, watching everyone with eyes like a hawk. He stays calm, cool, and collect. However, Mitch still sticks to his job in a very serious manner ensuring, everything is as it should be, but with a warm touch. Later on, he gets even more assertive, as he has to deal with the brand new recruit Matt Broody, who thinks he is hot stuff because of his skill set, or the lack of. Matt Broody tries to get by with a half hearten work ethic, but fails miserably. All the while, having no knowledge of what a lifeguard is all about, and the never ending drinking habit. During which the offer lifeguards see him as some kind punk wanna be, trying to impress them. When instead, he proves he is just a total lazy butt, who craves everyone's attention. As the movie progresses, Mitch becomes more reluctant about having Matt on their team knowing he will just drop the ball again. The other lifeguards such as, Summer Quinn and Stephanie Holden even object him for a while. Broody has no respect for women, or what they do on a day to day basis to save their beach. Near the end though, he has a change of heart once he realizes the issue is much bigger than himself. I felt like the actors did an amazing job portraying their roles on screen. I definitely noticed how each character developed throughout the movie. I was also impressed with how the director, Seth Gordon, the whole crew, as well as the cast stuck to the story line the entire flick. The movie flowed smoothly from beginning to end. Also, Vaywatch had a very good message to give to the audience. Which it consists of looking out for your team, but doing it the right way, even if you have to go out of your comfort zone. In conclusion, I recommend Baywatch for people ages seventeen and older. There is language throughout, nudity, and crude adult content."
6.0,10 July 2021,"The olden day baywatch i only liked cause of the hot busty lifeguards lol so i thought i would give this one a chance even though theirs not many busty female actresses in it But i can tell you the Great one, The Peoples champ and his comedy always makes things better and funnier.

Now watch the movie Jabroni! And quit staring at the Peoples Strudel."

5.0,25 October 2017,"Greetings from Lithuania.

You can summarize ""Baywatch"" (2017) in one sentence - exposition of good looking bodies and missed opportunities.

I was really looking forward for this movie. Premise was great - it could have worked as good comedy. Unfortunately script of this movie is beyond anything that could have made this movie work - it has zero suspense, zero humor (not a single really funny moment during whole 2 hours) and lack of any creativity. Plot was beyond average.

Overall, basically nothing worked in ""Baywatch"" because of very poor script. It is not a funny comedy and as some sort of action comedy it totally lacks any suspense or anything that resembles character development. Sure you don't watch movie like ""Baywatch"" for character development, but boy oh boy does it lack anything that resembles for a fun movie.

Unfortunately ""Baywatch"" is one of the worst movies of 2017."

5.0,19 November 2017,"What the hell went wrong? I remember the old series and even if it wasn't exactly high quality TV, compared to this it was Oscar material. The women in this film are there to show of their boobs, the writer and the director seem to be oblivious to the fact that we have heads on top of our bodies. One man in this film are so taken by all these boobs that he end up in strange situations, why do the director want to give fire to the old (very old) belief that men are victims to their urges and can't control themselves? Really? And this in 2017? What will be the next project? A movie about a rape where they blame it on the victims dress?

So, it is worse than After Earth? Yes. Both movies suck, but this one is sexist beyond belief. Spend your money on some corn seeds and watch them grow, that will definitely be more interesting."

4.0,24 November 2018,"Baywatch is a movie that just stands out because of the name of the old tv show. This movie is dump, unfunny and boring.

First of all: I didn't expect anything like a deep story, cool characters or even good effects. I just wanted to watch this movie with some friends to see if its funny. But after I saw the credits, i can say that it is not even that.

I only laughed like one or two times in this movie, although it is a comedy film. Most of the jokes are not funny, some are even really bad.

The actors are not good at all, just one or two. Something like a character development or a tiny bit of a story doesn't exist at all. Everything is too predictable.

It' s not even entertaining to watch! There is never something like tension or a plot. And the computer effects look like there were made by a 14 year old tennnage boy who just learned about Windows Movie Maker.

I normally don't write reviews. But in this case I have to warn you to watch the movie. It is a waste of time and money. And it is not even good for a funny evening with friends!"
6.0,18 August 2017,"Based on the reviews and ratings I saw before hand I expected this film to be a weak plot with horrible acting. I was, however, presently surprised. Being in my early 30's I vaguely remember watching the original Baywatch on TV. I do remember just enough of it to get a few of the easter egg jokes in this movie.

This is a comedy! The movie purposely does not take itself seriously. The whole concept of the movie is this group of over-zealous lifeguards who take their job way too seriously, while the real world around them is ""tolerating"" it. The dialogue between the characters is actually well delivered by the actors. I legitimately laughed and replayed a few scenes. Any corny one-liners or cringe moments are obviously done on purpose as the other characters will react to the cringe appropriately.

One of my favorite scenes is when all the characters are sitting around the table trying to explain to Zack Effron why their job is so important. Reminiscing about situations (old Baywatch TV episodes) when these ""lifeguards"" had to stop thieves from smuggling diamonds in surfboards or ""sand-grifters"" stealing from people on the beach. To which Zack Effron says ""That sounds like a really entertaining but far-fetched TV show, but if that was the case I would definitely just call the cops"".

Dwayne Johnson does a great job of being the ultimate boy-scout lifeguard as ""Lieutenant"" Mitch Buchannon. A military title every questions yet he never actually explains. Kelly Rohrbach fills the role of blonde bombshell CJ Parker (originally played by Pamela Anderson) with her slow-mo runs down the beach while looking sexy then walking into a plant off-center frame. Zac Efron's Matt Brody is called everything from ""One Direction"" to ""Highschool Musical"" by Dwayne Johnson in the movie. I don't think he ever called him the same name twice.

This is definitely a funny movie with enough ""R-rated"" jokes that anyone can appreciate. You don't even need to have ever seen a real episode of Baywatch to get the humor and appreciate this movie. It's a fun movie to watch with friends or by yourself at home. You don't have to pay attention too deeply and it comes with lots of laughs. I do not regret watching this movie."
4.0,27 May 2018,"This was stupid, gross, and awful. I don't rate movies. But this one was bad."
10.0,10 June 2017,"Critics tend to rate from too much of an artistic angle and seldomly write reviews from the perspective of a viewer. If I were to write reviews on a movie I don't like I would also say the movie's fun quotes are not funny, crime scenes are not intense, and overall plot does not deliver. I watched it I liked it. I never even saw the original Baywatch but it doesn't matter. I literally laughed out loud in the first 20 minutes and there were many more funny enough moments to keep it going. So don't get hindered by the critics' reviews, especially not Rotten Tomatoes, and let yourself have some fun. Could it be better? Sure. But why does it matter when you enjoyed it thoroughly?"
7.0,24 May 2022,"Somewhere in all this material there is a decent movie that could have been released; unfortunately the editing is amongst the worst I've seen in a film. It's a shame, because while nothing would have made this a good or classic movie, a more competent edit could have given us a good enough summer popcorn comedy. The actors are capable, there's a potentially servicable if basic and forgettable plot, and there's a few genuinely funny jokes.

The editing, however, is absolutely atrocious. I'm not one who generally pays much attention to editing, transitions, etc. But this film makes all of the above obvious in addition to being poorly done. Scenes are just rammed together like a combination between a sketch show and the ideas in the high school presentation you never found time to finish properly. There is absolutely no attention to flow, story, or transition. There are multiple scenes included that rehash the same plot points that then ultimately get dropped, and it seems like every dick and fart joke filmed got kept like it was gold. There's points where several diolog takes are obviously pieced together without even normalizing the volume level between them, which leads to rapidly changing volume and background noise when some characters are talking. Then on top of that some genius throws music overtop that's louder than the actors delivering the lines.

There's still some enjoyment to be had, but this is a masterclass in how not to edit a film."

7.0,31 March 2018,"So I just watched the Baywatch movie.

It's very uneven. Its main storyline was something from a pg movie with no real danger (real Scooby Doo pantomime stuff) yet the humour was from a gross-out r rated flick

The alleged comedy sidekick (who inexplicably gets the girl he lists after all movie) is awfully unfunny!! This type of character would have been cut from the American Pie type movies, so god knows how he made it in this.

It wasn't all bad. I laughter twice once when Efron said ""Everything you are talking about dealing with, sounds like an entertaining, but far fetched tv show"" And when the Rock made Efron fall in to the pool, the Hasselhoff cameo raised a smile (though I'd wish older celebrities would not have so much plastic surgery) All the cast look good none more so than Alexandra Daddario WOW I'm developing quite the crush on her!! The other babe Kelly Rohrbach was easy on the eye too, and I have to admit Zac Efron is winning me over.

I'm surprised this did as bad as it did, as I thought there would have been an audience for it!!! At least during its opening weekend, I'd have thought name recognition and the billing of The Rock and Efron would have brought the crowds in. Even changing its release date twice didn't help it."

7.0,3 June 2023,"Common signs of political corruption include bribery, lobbying, extortion, using corrupt police, and intimidation. These strategies were used by Victoria Leeds, a successful businesswoman and owner of the Huntley Club, to increase her ownership share in the island for her own purposes. Despite Matt Brody's reputation being tarnished due to a drinking incident and his lack of expertise, she gave Captain Thorpe strong instructions to appoint him as the head lifeguard in order to attract media attention. Olympic gold medalist swimmer Matt Brody is immediately selected for the Baywatch team without having to try out or prove his eligibility. He is a good swimmer, but he also needs to be familiar with the lifeguard training that is required which includes CPR, first aid, victim assessment, rescue techniques, injury prevention and facility safety, as well as patron surveillance. Matt eventually swallowed his pride and decided to take lifeguarding seriously and learn from Mitch that their job was not simple and that they were real-life heroes, he was welcomed into the family."

But mankind must have some fun, it's still going to the cinema. So, Dwayne Johnson: probably in real life is a cool guy, I feel this from his presence in movies. Priyanka Chopra: It would be good to stay only in Bollywood productions. And, she might well have Zac Efron as a partner, playing white Caucasian males. Alexandra Daddario and Kelly Rohrbach are both beautiful and talented. Being actresses, they have to eat too, so I understand them perfectly, they accept almost anything. That's it!

3.0,19 June 2017,"..but at least fun. Well what could you expect from a remake of a mediocre (but damn entertaining) TV series. I guess I was a bit naive. But I at least expected more self irony but instead the film took itself too seriously. The slow motion stunts or Dwayne Johnson jumping into the water in slow motion really got old after some time. Zac Efron wasn't much better in that case but at least some of their little intimate battles were fun, at least more fun than the story itself which felt like it was copied from a TV episode and enlarged into an overlong episode or overlong movie in that case. There was some pretty cinematography and several nice action scenes also the cameos of David Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson were refreshing (tho also I expected more in that case) but overall it was very dull and uninspired. Oh the soundtrack gets most of my kudos actually."

But that's exactly what it's all wrong about this movie. Hollywood, the biggest money making factory on the earth, which is vehemently calling for women rights and so on, which stands against all kinds of misuse of women and not objectifying them, with all their political agendas and virtue signalling all over the big stages, they themselves create a movie which has got nothing but objectifying women and men for box office. If this is not the biggest hypocrisy in the world, what else is it?"
7.0,21 July 2018,I don't usually leave reviews but felt this one was needed. I actually really enjoyed this movie. I ran across it in the free movies section on demand.

Throughout the film there is lots of action which is exciting and all the actors and actresses do an excellent job! Ignore the critics and go and watch Baywatch, I have actually already pre ordered a digital copy I liked this movie so much! I hope more people watch it so they go and make a second film. If you don't watch this you are really going to miss out!!!"
1.0,9 October 2018,"This film was better than I thought it would be, but then I was not sure what I was expecting. However, I most certainly was not expecting almost a spoof like comedy. That being said, sometimes it played like a spoof comedy, sometimes a raunchy comedy and sometimes like a straight summer comedy with some action within it. It was very uneven as it did not seem like it knew which style of comedy to settle on. Still, it was funnier than I was expecting and thought it was uneven, it still proved to be entertaining.

The movie stars the Rock as Mitch, one heck of a good lifeguard. He is about to be saddled with a new recruit whose only attribute is that he is a gold medal swimmer, but he has an attitude! He also has a portly guy he personally chose and a female that the gold medal swimmer is attracted to. Soon, a death is discovered and Mitch just knows that there is something going down and starts an investigation, while the gold medal swimmer is confused by this as this is a job that is seemingly more fitted for the police!

The movie was funny, despite the flow of the film which seemed really uneven. Dwayne the Rock Johnson does a pretty good job with comedy and so did Zak Efron. The film did feature a couple of appearances by former Baywatch stars, but both amounted to simple cameos. I found it stupid that they put their names in the main credits as this kind of took away the surprise when you finally saw them.

So, a pretty good comedy that could have just stayed a bit more consistent. Be a spoof, be an action comedy or be a raunchy comedy, but don't try to be all three within the span of 10 minutes. The Rock would go on later in the year to make the far superior and much higher grossing Jumunji, but while this one did not score huge at the box office, with its world wide take was still a hit for the Rock. He has become the Arnold Schwarzenegger of this generation where his films do pretty good or great in the US and if they fail a bit here, they do well overseas."
4.0,30 August 2017,"Another Hollywood movie which couldn't help itself engage in depicting unrealistic, cancerous, politically correct scenarios. The most poignant is how an overweight, geeky, unfit, awkward man can somehow beat out an entire squadron of fit, healthy and more suitable contenders to become a lifeguard - because he tries hard. The fact that the producers would even try and entertain this notion is mind-boggling. Coupled with the flagrant overuse of super-women stereotype makes one nauseous. These politically correct skits are so boring now. Wake up Hollywood, the overwhelming majority of people reject political correctness."

1.0,25 August 2019,So at first I was like another remake of tv series. Baywatch was a really good tv series to watch and thought this film was not going to work. But I must admit it was not the best but it was okay and entertaining to watch. Zak Efron and Dwayne Johnson were really good working together plenty of laughs with action in the film. I think it should have got a bit better rating
7.0,3 September 2017,"The trailers for Baywatch might lead you to believe that this film is a funny, meta send-up of the original TV series. Yet when the movie begins with a tepid ocean rescue played straight, it immediately confuses the tone of the film. That sums up Baywatch. This movie doesn't know what it wants to be.

There's a running gag in this film about the Baywatch lifeguards refusing to understand that they're not law enforcement. It's hilarious satire of the original show and the entire premise, and the film almost starts to sound smart in these moments. The script keeps returning to this joke and it remains humorous, but there's no real payoff.

Other humor in the movie is sporadic. The Rock and Zac Efron have chemistry as rivals. Efron is especially funny and the highlight of the film. Aside from that, there is some gross-out humor that doesn't work, and the rest of the story is played as a straight and dark action piece. There was potential for the action sequences to be played for comedy, but they're strangely earnest. Even when an action sequence strives for humor (in particular a tussle between Dwayne Johnson's Mitch and a henchman), it feels like a weak attempt.

In the end, this film doesn't gel. It wouldn't have worked at all if it was just a self-serious action spectacle. But the comedy that's there is lazy and occasional. There was probably a better version of this film that went further into Police Academy-level absurdity. What we got was a mish-mosh of a movie that feels unfinished."
1.0,19 August 2017,I don't why people are giving bad reviews but today i watched this film and it is not that bad. I enjoyed the film and i want to watch it again. I don't have any complain about anybody's acting or anything. I love all of them. Story is nice. It is really funny and entertaining. You should watch it.
6.0,8 October 2019,There's one amusing moment when a goon gloats over his taciturn sidekick's taciturnity - and said sidekick ruins it by promptly chipping in with a comment of his own; and that's about it for nearly two overproduced hours in which the constant use of giddying steadicam attempts to compensate for the fact that little is actually happening that is worthy of your attention. But Alexandra Daddario makes an attractive Summer Quinn.
1.0,15 September 2024,"Baywatch is a 2017 action comedy that follows a group of lifeguards who must take down a drug lord in order to save their beach.

Based off of the television series of the same name, Baywatch is a pretty good comedy that I enjoyed a lot more than I thought I would. Although I was never a fan of the T. V. show, I thought the film did a good job with the comedy aspects which is something the show kind of only did unintentionally. The sense of humor that the characters brought out of the films mediocre story kept things entertaining and made me want to see what was going to happen next. The cast was decent with the Rock and Zac Efron giving a good performance and playing off each others insults well, and of course there's plenty of beautiful women just like the show.

It's not going to become an instant classic, but I was definitely entertained. If you haven't seen this silly flick before, it's worth checking out at least once."

Even he could not redeem this trash beyond a single star.

Actually I can't even find the words for how bad this was. Over acted, over edited, absolutely D grade toxic rubbish.

So much gratuitous swearing was used - and it just made it go from bad to worse and then worse again .

My intelligence is deeply offended at having paid to watch this garbage.

Please do not bother !!

Sorry - Dwayne ... but sack your agent asap..."
3.0,20 August 2017,"The cohort of people belonging Generation Z, hidden in their homes from litigant summer sun, was ""lucky"" of witnessing the transmission of a series focused on the adventures—independent in each episode—of the lifeguards of a beachfront city in western Los Angeles County, California, which was on-air a laughable period equivalent to a decade. The main promoter and only beneficiary of real fame thanks to the show—relegating, of course, the sexual symbol in which Pamela Anderson became—, was David Hasselhoff, who created a ridiculous and superfluous succession of feature films and spin-offs in order to keep afloat a TV series that since its beginnings were buried in the mess of simplicity and silliness. A few years later, definitive cessation of audiovisual products on the lifeguard group was declared, however, the satisfaction did not last forever by informing, shortly thereafter, that a powerful Hollywood producer would take to the big screen the underworld of the bay with much younger faces, muscles, and buttocks. It is today when it premieres its homonymous cinematographic idea, a kind of hybrid between 21st- century comical vices and analogies of vacuous modern blockbusters of the forebear decade.

Having as a main culprit the inordinate budget Paramount Pictures bestowed director Seth Gordon—I don't understand why, but it was really surprising to me watching Andy Garcia and Eli Roth as producers on screen—, the film manages to leave, momentarily, the superficiality of robust, suntanned and perfect bodies to tell a joke of criminal story about drug trafficking, which employs a spoof of contemporary action movies while trying to keep a bearable aura by comical gags (moderately funny), ending in a high-calorie recipe, the equivalent of a super comedy production brought to disappointing levels. At present, there are noteworthy works which were released on similar dates and that had the same tone, the difference is that they had solid ideas from its origin, a quick and timely sample: ""Spy"" by Paul Feig.

They are giving hints of the jolly and trivial tone from the very start, that will prevail in the story with Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson emerging victorious from the water with a bather in his arms and the film logo, with emphatic pride, as a backdrop, adding dolphins gambolling—perhaps lacking oxygen among such megalomania—out of the water. I must confess I felt an intense good foreboding in the kind of initial video clip, nevertheless, it fell apart as soon as I watched that the first two names in the opening credits are masculine, explicit significant that some actresses are merely eye- candy, in the same way, the detail of the dolphins provoked that, almost automatically, I took my hand to my head, a disappointing posture lasting at least the half of the extensive almost hundred and twenty minutes. It should be pointed out that this action had a brief lapse of laughter, but, they were so provisional, that I don't remember the causes.

The storyline is as bad as if it were an episode of the series they forgot to transmit on TV. Matt Buchanan (Dwayne Johnson) and his pair of stunning workmates oversee a competition to find new and suitable members of the Emerald Bay life-saving squadron. In parallel, the corresponding subplot is unfolded about a network of criminals who use the beach as a camouflage for narcotics trafficking, with multimillionaire Victoria Leeds (Priyanka Chopra) as the key ringleader. The story honors its source by flaunting big men and voluptuous women in extra small bikinis stammering cheeky jokes.

Neither inherent vis comica of ""The Rock"", Efron nor rising star Alexandra Daddario manages to consolidate an unambiguous definition for this work from the beginning, and although some of the humorous circumstances, especially those expressed graphically, are quite jolly and acerbic, the lax direction by Gordon, regrettable screenplay by Damian Shannon and Mark Swift, some word-for-word absurd special effects, raccord detectable mistakes, and the way in which ideas are let out, cause the film to finish as an adolescent, summer, rated-R film prospect with one of the most valued acting teams today, an enviable budget and an audiovisual result, fatally drowned."
6.0,15 September 2017,"If you are paying to watch Baywatch, then you oughtn't write a review for Vertigo.

This is Baywatch, based on, well.. Baywatch. What did you expect? Something out of the cerebral wedlock of Orson Welles and Alfred Hitchcock? Yes there are dick jokes, and the dialogue is sophomoric at best. The actor were pretty, and for once, Priyanka Chopra gets the fate she deserved and all is well with the world.

If you went into this expecting a taut, suspenseful thriller or some kind of an emotional epiphany or dialogue that would make you want to become a better human being, then something is certainly wrong with you! This is a campy movie that even the makers and actors do not take seriously, why should you?"
1.0,1 September 2017,"I watched a lot of the original TV series, and like many others was drawn to the beautiful bodies instead of stellar script writing. The episodes were not all that bad though, and had enough to keep you watching to the end. Besides, it was decent enough for the whole family to watch...

Fast forward to Baywatch 2017. NOT to watch with your family unless you are the cringe-a-minute sort. Totally gratuitous and unnecessary foul language, and inept and ill-timed attempts at comedy. Replete with clichés and a plot-line filled with more holes than a rotting Swiss cheese, I had to force myself to watch this to the end over three days. Funny enough, the best part of the entire movie was the ending, with all the beautiful bodies running in slow motion..."
7.0,20 February 2018,"I found myself WAY more entertained by this movie than I was expecting. It is very stupid, makes fun of itself, lots of crude humor and swearing. After all was said and done I felt like I had watched an episode of Baywatch, the same formula the same plot all very straight forward, there are no twists, you know how it will end before it ends but you don't care because it's funny as hell to watch the characters do what they do. Good (enough) acting, hot people, funny people, The Rock is awesome in it, Zac Effron isn't bad either. The two play well off of each other. I would totally recommend if you just want some cheap funny thrills, or miss the old Baywatch and need a little more."
3.0,1 September 2017,"This movie is not a comedy. This is a bad Baywatch reboot with comedic scenes written in. You can tell they rewrote the script to adjust for the unexpected success of 21 Jump Street. Unfortunately they cast 2 Channing Tatums as the main leads. They also didn't understand what made 21 Jump Street funny or good, as they got everything wrong and bad. The characters are underdeveloped and poorly written, the Bad Guy is barely in this and is so boring. Most of the time the female characters could've been replaced with cardboard cutouts labeled ""Romantic Interest"". Their attempt at Meta Humor is shallow and weak. The pacing is painfully slow. Zac Efron's face looks like an old shoe. I hate this movie. Maybe next time they should hire someone who didn't write Freddy vs. Jason."

The absolutely biggest issue with the film is that it is not funny. For the life of it, it just isn't funny. Was it the director, was it the script? I mean, shouldn't a comedy be just a little funny? I just don't get what is going with comedies in general. I could go on and on but it isn't worth my time. It is just a bummer The Rock has to be associated with this mess of a film."
8.0,1 June 2017,"That was strange to have David in the film but another dude to play the role of mitch especially at the end when the mentor asked.......how can u play mitch when I was mitch for 20 years ?

I know this is a remake so we got a new c.j parker a new Stephanie a new matt and a new summer but since they had David in the film and they also showed pamela at the end it was a bit of confusing of what they did with the brand iconic names.

maybe they should give new names to the new cast and leave the t.v legends rest in peace but anyways.....

the film was not bad.....not bad for a remake at all. it had all u expect to see from a Baywatch project.

gorgeous women...sexy women...hot guys....action...suspense...humor....and in general the movie had almost what the original TV show had except of course the original cast which was the main minor in the movie.

that Ronnie guy new recruit who fell for the new C.J PARKER girl was funny and his role was a plus for the movie.

All in all I don't get the negative reviews. I am a huge fan of the t.v show and I own all 11 DVD seasons too plus the two Baywatch nights seasons and I really enjoyed the movie for what it was.

not great like the show was but good enough with few boring and unpleasant scenes.

David and pamela were paid tribute and even the classic song I'M ALWAYS HERE was also included in the movie but not in the opening credits like it was done with the original show.

really my main issue was that David was not the only MITCH in the movie and he with duane even talked about this matter in a post movie credit scene like I also told you above.

Hope there is a sequel cause u can relate to the chemistry the cast had like u did with the original series.

not great....not perfect but good enough to like it.

6.0,6 May 2019,"I think I was the only teenager growing up in the early nineties who never watched a single episode of the TV show 'Baywatch.' Therefore, I'm not one of those people who is going to start moaning on about a 'big screen adaptation ruining my childhood memories' (I save that rant for Michael Bay's 'Transformers' franchise!). Plus I'm a huge fan of cheesy movies and Dwayne Johnson - so odds were on that I'd enjoy this. I didn't. Pity.

First of all Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson - once again - proves why he's currently one of the highest paid actors in Hollywood. He has a natural charm that shines through in whatever he does, 'Baywatch' is no exception. He's definitely 'the star' of the show, but that's not to say that Zac Efron doesn't pull his weight. The two of them do well in every scene they're in, however just because the actors are good, doesn't mean the film is any good.

Johnson and Efron's performances aren't enough to make up for the armies of dull and cliched characters they're forced to interact with. I know one thing everyone expects to see in anything with the title 'Baywatch' is young, fit people in revealing swimsuits, but then women they've chosen (despite looking the part, obviously) just don't get the lines to make their characters anything more than cardboard cut-outs. And this isn't just a fault aimed at the female cast-members. There's the 'token' fat guy who is supposed the be the 'comic relief' (in a film where basically every character tells jokes anyway). He's just awful. Almost all of his jokes don't land and some just go on for so long that you actually will find his performance quite painful to watch.

The story revolves around the lifeguards trying to foil a drugs-ring plot. Yes, this should be something the police take care of and, to give the film some credit, it is self-knowing enough to point plot-holes like this out for a quick laugh. If ever you had to suspend your disbelief then it's with the plot of this film. People do stuff that wouldn't seem out of place in a 'Scooby Doo' cartoon, i.e. constantly peeping over the edge of walls to 'spy' on the villain's operation and then 'disguising' themselves in order to infiltrate the operation.

I really wanted to enjoy this film. Even with Johnson and Efron desperately trying to do their bit to save the movie, I doubt I'll ever watch it again. I reckon some people will. It truly is one of those 'guilty pleasure' films that might just sneak into a DVD collection here and there.

6.0,18 January 2021,"It is very easy to think that the movie Baywatch, which is build around the ""lore"" of the famous tv-show, is a rather good comedy or a very very bad one. In my humble opinion I think this film deserves a place in the middle. Obviously, it has a thin story and shallow characters. What did we expect? But if a film knows that the badness is the premise for the whole concept and embraces it, they are doing a good job. I think they did.

First, you need one or two good actors that can be very corny and still convincing. With Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron you have two actors that are a delight. The fact that Zac Efron's character is a good-looking guy but still has a very unattractive and cheesy demeanor is a nice touch.

When it comes to the jokes, I think they are often fairly good. They are not hilarious but not boring. Yes, there is a lot of dick humor, but I guess that people with only swimsuits brings forward that kind of comedy.

The plot is thin but not a catastrophe. They solve a simple drug mystery, not more or less. The jokes about them not being cops or characters in a classic American hero-movie like Top Gun is entertaining even if they lose their freshness after 20 minutes. But hey, it is just some light Baywatch entertainment."
1.0,12 June 2017,"This movie was loaded with unnecessary vulgar language ... found it extremely offensive ... although I will admit many within the audience found it funny.

While the women in this are stacked the jokes fall flat and the action is corny. Truth be told, this is not worth paying a buck to see at the dollar theater. Heck I am not sure it is worth watching for free at a friend's house over a few beers. If you want to see some T&N there are plenty of ""websites"" all over the net you can see a whole lotta them."
7.0,17 May 2022,"Baywatch was never a series that could be taken seriously. It was pure titillation filled with eye candy for adolescents.

The movie version just goes for stupid fun with a few crude jokes. It even parodies some of the absurdities of the Baywatch television series.

Matt Brody (Zac Efron) is the arrogant Olympian with a few issues. He is forced to be a lifeguard as part of his probation.

Mitch Buchannon (Dwayne Johnson) is the head lifeguard at Emerald Bay. He takes a dislike to Matt but both are forced to team to investigate arrogant businesswoman Victoria Leeds (Priyanka Chopra) who plans to buy up the local properties on the bay by paying off corrupt politicians.

Baywatch the movie never aims high. It is good looking people, a stupid plot, a few jokes and some action.

It is enjoyable for what it is but it knows it is not striving for high art."
2.0,4 June 2017,
8.0,6 June 2017,"I'm 60. I remember the original. This is probably the best parody I have ever seen. The characters, the story arcs, and yes, the dick jokes, all send ups of the original. Dwynne is so straight and serious, it's sad, because this is a guy with one of the world's most winning smiles, but by playing it straight, he allows Zac Effron, not a natural comedian, to come off as funnier than his acting suggests. The female villain (villaness?)is not real, or believable and has had a lot of plastic surgery, I wondered for a while if she was a transgender person. (No, she's not, but both her parents are doctors)But were any of the original series' villains believable? This is a film that never takes itself seriously. It's natural audience is teenage males. But it will attract a few seniors who enjoyed the original, and they will have a good laugh, and occasional groan."
6.0,1 September 2024,"Baywatch is a 2017 action/comedy that centers around the life guards known as Baywatch. Inspired by the T. V Show, it Mainly focuses on Mitch Buchannon (Dwanye Johnson) and new recruit Mitch Brody (Zac Effron) Mitch Brody is a former Olympic simmer that fell from grace and is constantly butting heads with Mitch. Mitch tries to get him on board with investigating the narcotics and dead bodies that keep popping up.

This is a movie that will give some laughs and still afford some entertainment, but overall is middle of the road. There were certain things that in a way left me a little confused. As they didn't really highlight many of the other characters in the movie. One instance was in a scene they are all clamoring for Jessica to be head guard, but we don't get to see much of her character to really understand why she should be. CJ, played by (Kelly Rohrbach) was pretty much reduced down to flirting and crushing over tech guy Ronnie Greenbaum played by (Jon Bass) which was a little strange. Also there are the obvious Easter eggs that pop up later in the film and if you've ever seen the original T. V. show, I'm sure you'll already know."
4.0,15 June 2017,"After the release of Baywatch's first trailer, it seemed as if it was going to be THE comedy event of the summer. The trailer teased an entertaining bro-down with The Rock and Zac Efron, slick references/cameos to the original TV show, a silly premise not taking itself too seriously, and lots of beautiful bods. To viewers' disappointment, it didn't deliver any of that -- except the funny parts already shown in the trailer, and of course the beautiful bods. Instead, viewers were treated to a feast of lame jokes, a predictably melodramatic story, wasted cameos, bad visuals, and the wrong kind of R-rated nudity (i.e. small, white, non-threatening dingus)."
4.0,31 May 2017,"I wasn't expecting anything great from this movie, so I wasn't too disappointed. What can you expect from a Baywatch movie? Of you're going to get a few cheap jokes, sexual references, the occasional violence and a lot of camera ogling (albeit mostly focusing on Zac Efron during a workout scene). What damages this film the most is the fact that it tries too hard to be as good as 21 Jump Street. 21 was, and still is, a very funny film and Baywatch has clearly taken note of the ""pro-takes-on- the-bumbling-apprentice"" style of comedy of which is so brilliantly portrayed in movies like 21 J S, Hot Fuzz (etc). However, Baywatch is not the new Hot Fuzz and it isn't the new 21, it is just Baywatch.

The humour is very predictable, often relying on bad language to add some sort of risqué edge to the painful, slapstick humour throughout the movie. It has its moments of humour and the action is exciting enough for the purposes of the film, but it just doesn't have enough in it to make it interesting. The film itself is roughly 2 hours, that is ridiculous. Trim it down to a 1-hour one-off reboot special and you'd probably be watching a very good episode of Baywatch, but as a standalone film, it is painfully bland."

The bottom line is this is a 90s TV series, so people should stop calling it an 80s TV series. It is important to do your research and state facts correctly.

6.0,27 February 2018,"After reading all the really bad reviews of this movie I figured it would be a low brow turd on a par with a typical Adam Sandler movie. I eventually caught up with it on tv and honestly, I didn't think it was all that bad.

I chuckled pretty consistently throughout and there are some genuinely funny moments. The interactions between Zac & the Rock were enjoyable and reminded me of the squabbles between leads in much better 'buddy' movies. It knew its premise was stupid and sent up the 'lifeguards as private eyes' ridiculousness quite well.

Fair enough, it does linger on some of the beautiful bodies on show which has drawn criticism as being gratuitous, but hey, it's a movie set on a beach, what do you expect?

It's weakness though is the plot (kinda of a big one I know). When it tries to move the 'villainous property developer' plot forward the movie tends to lose it's humour and drags a little (especially at the climax) but then there are very few comedies where the plot is a strong point.

All in all it was a considerably funnier than I was expecting having read previous reviews and a pretty decent comedy diversion."
5.0,21 August 2017,"I went into 'Baywatch' hoping for a similar case to '21 Jump Street'. '21 Jump Street' as a show never held any interest to me whatsoever, however the movie version (and its sequel) were nothing short of brilliant. On that occasion Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum found some of the best comedic chemistry you'll ever see and that, combined with a fun and interesting script, were enough to make for a brilliant film. Sadly, the film version of 'Baywatch' encompassed none of those assets and was a lot closer to the actual show version of 'Baywatch', which I consider near on unwatchable.

Let's start with the casting. Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron. Now admittedly they both have the look, but that's where it ends. It seems the casting director figured as long as the stars had good bodies that would be enough to carry it (again quite a similar philosophy to the TV series). How wrong they were though. Johnson does his best to bring some humour and light-heartedness to the film, but Efron just completely fails. In fact he sucks all the humour out of most scenes he's in. Also the pair have zero chemistry together. They never clicked and this is a huge part of why the film fails.

The next problem is the story. My God was it bland. The laziness in the creativity department was quite astounding. And then as if that wasn't bad enough, the villain characters they created for the story were as dull and cliché-ridden as you will ever see. The entire script for that matter is lazy. They couldn't even come up with an interesting opening scene to kick the film off with a bang.

As for positives, it's a nice looking film. By that I mean the cast is very good looking. Other than that though it's a very hard film to praise. This could have been something special with a different couple of actors in the lead role (possibly Johnson could have stayed on if the other actor had some serious talent to find some chemistry and carry some scenes) and if an entirely different script was used. That wasn't the case though and so this ended up being a very poor film."

Its about really hot guys and really hot girls running around on a beach saving beach-goers and fighting criminals. Plain and simple. If you go in not expecting more than that, you'll be pleasantly entertained. It's a big dumb entertaining popcorn movie based on a big dumb entertaining TV show. Dwayne Johnson and his super charismatic yet intimidating demeanor is an excellent lead supported by a great team of actors including Zac Effron who hardly ever disappoints, Alexandra Daddario and her amazing blue eyes as Summer Quinn, Kelly Rohrbach filling Pam Anderson's infamous role as CJ Parker, Ilfenesh Hadera as Stephanie Holden, and rounded out by Jon Bass as Ronnie (Del from Big Time in Hollywood, FL).

The only disappointment? Hobie is not in this movie! Though if you think about it, Zac Effron is kinda like a better looking Jeremy Jackson doppleganger anyway. So I guess it works out."
7.0,2 November 2017,"I was a fan of baywatch when I was younger and almost didn't see the movie because of the trailer. Oh, but don't get me wrong. The trailer is a good one for the movie. I ended up seeing it by chance, expectations were low. In the end I did have fun. It is a very different version from old baywatch, way to goofier in general. Don't watch with kids (contrarily to original TV show). Acting, some is better than others. The script and plot are nothing knew. All in all, it is a fun movie, were you should't expect much. Regarding Zac Efron, he is a great actor and I wish he wold stop with the silly comedies he has been in lately and put his talent in more varied genres. Something he did after High School musical. And then he got stuck in the goofy business. Get out of it please."
1.0,11 September 2017,"The original series was cheesy commercial for life guards. It showed a little respect and some admiration.

This here goes several levels lowlier: superficial honor statements, ghastly jokes of the worst kind, simple plot, predictable story and character development. Etc.

Don't go!"

7.0,12 October 2021,"The team spirit, the fun, the beach parties and the showing-off... it's all entertaining actually. Besides the childish (jewish) dick jokes there is some character development and a story.

The double Mitches and CJ's are just way too confusing for me and I see no reason why this character mash-up had to be! If the writers just came up with a new beach team looking for new members in modern times it all would have made more sense. Once I managed to ignore these hickups I enjoyed the ride and boy, the music was good."
3.0,28 August 2017,"Long story short, this is Fast and Furious beach version. And it even has the ""barbecue ending scene"".

Baywatch is full of clichés, it is lame and so cheesy you might even find yourself laughing at some rather bad jokes.

It really depends on what movies you like to watch. If you walk into cinema expecting a quality comedy, you might as well walk right out. This movie is more than just ridiculous. Leave your dignity at the door and just watch it for a simple reason of relaxing and not thinking at all for a moment.

I didn't come looking for a mind-blowing plot when I decided to watch Rock's version of Baywatch. I just wanted entertainment and have a good, loud laugh. And Baywatch delivered all of that in a hilarious way."
7.0,4 December 2017,"Leave your brain at the door and you'll probably have some fun.

Sure it's clichéd, camp, puerile etc but unlike most of the reviewers berating it, Baywatch knows this already and plays upon it to create a likable experience. That the reviewers couldn't grasp this and wanted an Oscar winner under the name of Baywatch... they really don't get it! I had far more fun watching this than most of the latest 'super hero' movies. New Spiderman take note - this is how to do camp teenage angst - just go over the top.

It has a likable cast being silly and stupid delivering a couple of hours of full on nonsense fun. It has no pretensions above that and is all the better for it."
5.0,19 June 2017,"I love TV series in general but somehow have never really delved into the legendary Baywatch"" (1989-1999), starring David Hasselhoff, Pamela Anderson and other megababes of the time. At its peak times, it was followed by over billion viewers! Whatever qualities the original action drama"" series must have relied on, the movie is very different aquatic mammal altogether. 65% of the original's audience were women but the remake is clearly a raunchy mainstream comedy for guys. There's a recent successful example of how to serve cheesy old TV hit to modern cinema audience – 2012's 21 Jump Street"" starring Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill –, so the new Baywatch"" goes down the same road, only with less hilarious or fresh results. The movie is watchable enough for the first two thirds or so, when it's mostly about beach, good-looking people and dirty jokes. All this is, sadly, followed by switching to action mode, which makes nonsensical events less bearable and more forgettable – and doesn't offer much thrills for compensation. Perhaps surprisingly for boys' comedy, Baywatch"" concentrates on its stars Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron, so the cute girls are relegated to the sidelines, even the Bollywood star Priyanka Chopra. But this may have been a conscious choice of those who gave the movie its final form in post-production, because Rock & Zac have way more charisma than anybody else here. Which may be the fault of mediocre material (they couldn't even make good use of obligatory guest appearances by Hoff and Pam!) So, it's passable entertainment for modern raunchy comedies crowd – but not really a recommend-worthy for anybody, even for its target audience. Still, there's something likable and winning about Johnson, although most of the movies starring him are mediocre at best. And Efron's cool too, beefed-up muscles and good looking stupid guy roles fit him extremely well."
6.0,18 June 2018,Baywatch is the type of movie that is supposed to be bad but film is made to tell you yes this is a bad movie and they I know it too. But honestly it's really funny and I would suggest it. I think they should've cut back on the dick jokes. Baywatch has probably the same amount dick jokes as probably Deadpool.
1.0,18 September 2017,"This movie is about a hardworking and determined lifeguard Mitch and his crew trying to work out there ways with a new reckless recruit for uncovering a criminal plot that threatens the future of the bay.

The story line of this movie was way lost it had a promising start but towards the middle it was all a complete mess. There were some action and good comedy scenes here and there. All the actors in this movie did a really good job but they could not make the audiences rooted to their seats. Some actors in the notable category in this movie would be Dwayne, Zac, Priyanka, Kelly and Jon. From the middle towards the ending of this movie was all expected and predictable. Actually this movie could have been made a great success if the script was made better.

No I would not recommend anyone to watch this movie.

My Rating 0/10"
8.0,12 February 2021,"This movie was supposed to be ""bad"" good movie!! It's baywatch people, it's muscles and boobs and bad jokes and odd couples.

7.0,28 July 2018,Didn't expect much from this but really rather enjoyed it. Dwayne Johnson is always an engaging movie presence and I though zac effron was good too
1.0,26 May 2017,"""Are you ready? Never full of fear?"" Poor use of the theme song lyrics aside, one might fear for what is to come with the Baywatch movie. If you've read other websites or seen the google news feeds you know this hasn't been doing well. Yet the question remains, is it bad enough to deserve lower than 20%? Robbie K here to ask that question as I hit the theater trenches to scope out the wonders the bay holds in this relaunch. So once more, here are my thoughts on the latest ""hits"" of the Hollywood Box Office!""

LIKES:  Some of the comedy  The Beautiful Cast  Dwayne the Rock Johnson

Summary: If you've seen the trailers, you know this movie is going to attempt to be funny, and at times it succeeds. Despite what some reviews say, Baywatch has its clever moments involving slapstick humor and insult bashing. There are numerous references buried in the sand of this movie, and even more punches at the ridiculousness of the legendary series. These quips are fun, tasteful, and on many levels so true at how we ate up the drama. And yes, the cameos are certainly fun to watch and well-timed.

But outside of comedy, the main selling point of this movie is the beautiful cast of lifeguards assembled for this movie. The trailers have not sold you any lies in regards to the anatomy in this movie and the sex appeal contained within. Female audience members will certainly enjoy the chiseled features of former wrestler Dwayne Johnson and former Disney Channel singing ""sensation"" Zac Efron. Beefy bodies and plenty of shirtless scenes had a number of my fellow audience members drooling, or at least making sounds. Fear not guys, you'll get plenty of chances to make your own sounds and gawk at the lovely figures of Alexandra Daddario, Kelly Rohrbach, and Ilfenesh Hadera These visions of loveliness not only have a little spice to add to the mix, but plenty of ""bounce"" to their step that brings energy to the film. In regards to the acting of most of the cast, not bad I must say, but many are reduced to mere shadows of what I had hoped to see. All with the exception of one.

The Rock is still cooking up a storm in terms of his acting. He led the comedy for me with solid delivery and timing, his lines perhaps the best written of the whole cast. Using his physical attributes, he does some nice stunt work into the mix helping to add excitement to a rather bland movie. But his greatest contribution is the energy brought to the film, which kept things fun, balanced, and moving at various points. You can guess that this reviewer felt the most solid aspect of the movie was the Rock.

DISLIKES:  Most of the comedy  Predictable story  Zac Efron's character

Summary: I said there was some witty moments, but we all knew this was going to be a run of the mill modern comedy. Baywatch is loaded with shallow comedy that is stupid, crude and in many cases lazy writing. You can guess that much of it is centered on the stereotypical sex jokes, including a few shots of the genitalia itself. Other comedic ploys focus on prolonged banter between two characters, who randomly stop in the middle of a crisis to argue their pointsyeah that's funny. Yet many jokes involve taking the clever dialogue and quickly dumping it foryes pointless cursing that quickly grew stale for me.

You would think the story could try to make up some of the shortcomings, but no that too failed. It was a predictable plot from start to finish, with all the relationships, turning points, and big twists known within probably 30 minutes. While this should not be too startling, I had hoped that the stunts and suspense could break it up the mundane plot, but this too failed considerably. I get it, it's a cute attempt at making an extended episode reminiscent of the show, but the execution was poor and I think that a stand-up comedy approach might have been better.

Yet the worse thing for me was Zac Efron's character. Don't turn click off the review quite yet, hear me out, this is in no way all Efron's fault. The former High School Musical star is playing the same role he always does and is starting to go off the deep end. However, the design of this character was annoying on so many levels that it was hard to not wish a swift end for him. The development was weak at best, minus a few well-developed scenes, and the fact that he had some of the lamer comedic moments didn't help things at all. But when you got the body he built up, I guess you don't have to do much in this movie to win the favor of the audience.

The VERDICT:

Baywatch is clever at times and fulfills its promise of shallow laughs, Dwayne Johnson having energy and of course the sex appeal. They certainly polished their actors for this one so that audiences would get a feast for their eyes, but sadly that's the only thing this reviewer can share. Baywatch has much balancing to do for the sequel that could come, and really needs to focus on the wittier comedy and less on the innuendos. Certainly, you should hold out for this movie to grace Netflix or RedBox.

My Scores are:

Action/Comedy/Drama: 5.5 Movie Overall: 4.0"
3.0,16 June 2017,
7.0,26 August 2018,"Yes the plot is not a master piece. Yes the humor is heavy-handed, sometimes ridiculous. So yes of course it is not great cinema. But sometimes you just want to go to the cinema to be entertained and laugh. And this movie do that. This movie can be enjoyed if you properly categorized it: get your brain off and have fun!"
3.0,17 September 2017,"I will say this for the film version of Baywatch. You can't say it wasn't keeping up with the times. Villainess Priyanka Chopra seems to be based on Ivanka Trump and those who paid to see this and rent this I think will recognize same.

Dwayne Johnson steps into the role that David Hasselhoff did on the small screen, Mitch Buchanon mentor and trainer of lifeguards. He's getting a new recruit in Zac Efron former Olympic champion whose reputation for being too much a party boy has preceded him. His joining Baywatch is a kind of community service.

On TV the Baywatch cast always got into things that had a most peripheral connection to the beach. Here Johnson says this is part of our mission. Which has him bumping up against real cops instead of how it was on TV.

Priyanka Chopra is a fabulously rich woman with her fingers in a lot of pies and her objective is to privatize their beloved beach. I guess she wants her own little Mar-a-Lago in California. But the Baywatch crew will stop here no matter how many she corrupts.

John Bass has a few moments as the goofy lifeguard with tech smarts and the beautiful boys and girls are there as they were on TV.

I think the film would have been better had it played it far more straight."
6.0,21 July 2018,"Dwayne Johnson has truly arrived as an action star. He makes every movie he is in better than it has a right to be, This movie was not made to be taken seriously. Baywatch as a concept is ludicrous. This movie works in nicely making fun of the concept by having actors point out that they are lifeguards, not police. The show in the 80's was called ""Boobwatch"" for a reason. It would not have been as popular without those Playboy models. I was entertained by this movie and had a laugh or two. So called ""critics"" need to lighten up."
5.0,4 June 2017,"Given that the movie is rated R, the jokes couldn't have been more funnier. The dialogues weren't sharp enough and the story wasn't written in a way to establish chemistry between actors.

It is OK to have a dummy story in a funny movie, but when you have big players like Rock and Zac, there should be more."
6.0,14 September 2018,"If you are going into this movie with zero expectations (like I did), then you might actually find a few things to like here. The film is mostly a parody of the original series that sometimes works and sometimes doesn't, the biggest fail being that they simply don't know when to quit; just like the unfunny shock jokes that go on way too long, they keep hammering in the same jokes that lose steam with every repeat. That all said, the actors all seem to be having a good time and even I cracked a smile at least once, so I really can't say that I left the cinema angry or upset in any way. To enjoy this, switch your brain to zero and go in there expecting exactly what you would expect from Duane Johnson making fun of a 90s series that always took itself way too seriously."

8.0,17 August 2022,"Look... we all know this film isn't going to win any awards, but it's hilarious! At least the unrated cut is. I've never watched the theatrical version. Regardless, I cry damn near real tears of laughter before we even get 30 minutes in!

It's just funny and super over the top. Plus, I'm sure we can all agree, the TV show wasn't the greatest either. At least this movie doesn't take itself too serious. Just watch and have fun. Everything doesn't have to be a damn masterpiece to be enjoyable."
7.0,24 June 2017,"I saw this as we had a toss up between this and Pirates of the Caribbean. We couldn't face another rehash of that franchise, so despite the negative reviews we went for Baywatch. We were both very pleasantly and humorously surprised.

Baywatch isn't going to win any Oscars or cause me think about it again and again like some movies do (Covenant & Prometheus being good examples) but it did entertain me solidly for two hours.

It has funny bits throughout the film which caused me to laugh out loud and is well paced, although a little formulaic with the story. The cast were good, especially Dwayne Johnson who seems to have had the part written for him. The humour isn't high-brow but there is a good amount of the film parodying itself.

Much better than The Mummy and a good waste of two hours, which is exactly why I go the cinema."
3.0,23 March 2019,"I really wanted lo like this movie, I really do. But in the End, it's quiet obvious: what a wreck! What a dumb piece of garbage! What a waste of time! I read that this movie ""is exactly as it's suppose to be?"" So, what is it supposed to be, tell me because I didn't get it? A new way to get rid of the brain? Because after five fairly entertaining first minutes, what else can he do, helpless as he is watching a fairly promissing concept becoming an insult to human intelligence. If that's what you are looking for, ok, be my guest, watch it ... on your own risks. But I warned you guys! One star for mister Dwayne Johnson's wimpers actor's studio method! No offence dude: we all love you!"
1.0,11 February 2021,"It started badly, and steadily got worse. There is so little I can say favourably about this movie. Makes the Dukes of Hazard movie look brilliant."
7.0,15 July 2017,"When my teen daughter said they wanted to go to Baywatch but needed a drive I was damned to go with them because I just have seen a few flicks last week in theaters but hey, as a good dad I went with them. Was it a good idea?

I knew that Zac Efron was in it and the seats being taken by teen girls I knew they all were waiting for him. But having a WWF and WWE past I also knew that the rock was in it. And I do know that he had a lot to say about Baywatch that it was going to be a good ride.

I laughed a few times and I enjoyed the story and the effects used. It's not just a teen flick. It has a lot of one-liners referring to other flicks or to the past of Zac Efron. The humour used was okay and it even had a lot of stupid situations especially with Ronnie Greenbaum (Jon Bass). The acting was above mediocre. I never had a feeling of , let's stop it even the cameo by The Hoff were okay. At the end you will have a few seconds back to memory lane with Pamela Anderson too.

Please be seated as the movie ends because throughout the end credits there are bloopers and they are really good. So at the end of the day this flick was a nice surprise. A bit of action, showing off of Dwayne Johnson with his body. a lot of laughing with baywatch itself and stupid situations like you see in Dump And Dumper and Hot Shots.

If you want to enjoy your evening with a no-brainer then this is definitely your pick up. Loved it.

5.0,31 August 2017,"With the hype prior to its release, I thought I was in for a treat. Unfortunately; I discovered, after wasting my precious 120 minutes that this was a mediocre movie.

The story-line had no taste; and the cast did a pretty lousy job too. The ladies seemed to be more focused on showing whom among them was sexier than the rest.. I guess they forgot that it wasn't a beauty contest.

Lousy as it was; unfortunately it was a box office success. I guess that's what we get when a bad movie gets good marketing. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone."
6.0,18 January 2020,
1.0,1 June 2017,"I grew up watching Baywatch back in the 90s with David Hasselhoff that also includes Pamela Anderson, Yasmin Bleeth and Carmen Electra.

The comic timing between Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron was perfect with both of them flexing their muscles and the macho banter during the obstacle challenge. Dwayne Johnson takes over Hasselhoff's role as Lt Buchanan a man dedicated to his job as a lifeguard, keeping the beach safe and clean as well as training the newbies. Zac Efron play his part well as a cocky athlete riding high on his two gold medals representing USA in the Olympics to serving community service.

Alexandra Daddario has some good comic moments. Kelly Rohrbach and Ilenesh Hadera were fine although they did not have much screen time. Jon Bass's character of Ronnie as the Tech lifeguard who has the hot spot for CJ.

Last of all Priyanka Chopra's big Hollywood debut after starring in Quantico was the weakest link in this movie as the villain. She plays the owner of the bay side resort The Huntley club, whilst dealing with drugs and forcefully buying out existing businesses so that she can expand her drug trade. This leads to Buchanan finding drugs on the beach and investigates how they ended up on the beach and who is dealing them.

All I can say that this it's a good enough movie to watch if you would like to have a good laugh and kill some time."
7.0,13 April 2020,"I watched this film with extremely low expectations, fully expecting to hate it. And it certainly shared a lot of the characteristics that make many Hollywood blockbusters so unpalatable.

Impossibly attractive lead characters? Check. Ridiculously unrealistic plot? Check. Over-the-top special effects? Check. Predictable romances? Check. Cheesy dialogue? Check. Coarse vulgarity? Check.

And yet despite all this, I actually quite enjoyed it. This film doesn't take itself too seriously and is quite satirical in places, almost to the point of being a parody of the original TV series. There is a refreshing lack of pretentiousness and the cast are surprisingly likeable.

Zac Efron and Alexandra Daddario are so ridiculously good-looking they actually stop being good-looking and basically just become a meme. Both perform pretty well throughout the film, striking up a decent enough on-screen chemistry. Kelly Rohrbach has all the beauty of Pamela Anderson but is a lot more wholesome and congenial. Jon Bass plays the all-too familiar quick-witted goofy nerd, but he does it well and has some good moments. I reserve judgement on Dwayne Johnson however, as I still cannot be sure if he is taking himself seriously or not. He's either a great comic actor or the most cringeworthy guy in Hollywood.

The film is let down by a dire plot that chugs along aimlessly. Pryanka Chopra is a tedious Bond-villain and most of her scenes are fairly painful to watch. The long-winded ending of the film is a bit excessive and, coupled with the unnecessary two-hour duration, it makes it hard to remain interested. With a more original script and a shorter runtime, this could have been a really solid production.

This sort of movie does have its place- as long as it's done well- and Baywatch scrapes a pass mark. Anybody expecting more than lowbrow tomfoolery will be rightfully disappointed, but those looking for a nice Friday night wind-down movie should be reasonably satisfied."
2.0,10 June 2017,
8.0,11 September 2022,"The plot of the movie was similar to the TV show (I think so) and it was kinda interesting. The storyline was kinda well-written, of course I think there were plot holes and some unexplained questions. The location of the movie was really good, I really liked the beach and the whole summer vibe! The characters weren't very interesting, but they were so likeable and funny. There were many jokes in that movie, most of them were very funny. In my opinion, it's an underrated movie that comedy and crime were combined really well! The duration of the movie was fine, I didn't felt bored at all. Because, it was an intense movie. Also, the casting was really good and the acting was hilarious! The 3rd act was very well-developed and it was action filled. In my opinion, that movie deserves a sequel. Moreover, the cinematography of the movie was really good and the quality was amazing. Last but not least, the movie was totally unexpected and I'm glad they didn't follow the same concept, that the TV show had."
7.0,14 June 2018,"It's Baywatch. You should have known that this was about hot girls, fake detective work, some crazy stunts, and some corny ass jokes. This movie delivers some good laughs and doesn't take itself too seriously. It was far better than the TV series. It's not cinema verité people. Just a fun flick."
1.0,1 July 2017,
1.0,18 May 2018,"I didn't even make it 1/4 of the way through this movie. I thought it would be fun to watch while running on the treadmill. I felt blindsided by the dick jokes, the sexism, the objectification of women AND men and their body parts, the unlikeable characters, the cheesy lines, etc... I think some of these things would have gotten a pass 20+ years ago (sadly) and I was disheartened to see a movie like thjs made in 2017. It was the worst 20 minutes of film I can recall ever seeing. And I've seen THE ROOM."
7.0,19 August 2017,"""Baywatch"" suffices as mindless entertainment. I've never seen the television program, other than a clip shown in ""Red Corner,"" so can't compare it. It has the feel of a script written for television, but with a bigger budget and greater freedom to present adult-ish content, which actually seems geared more to adolescent boys. As such, it seems a bit incongruous at times, trying to titillate without getting raunchy. There are several action scenes and car chases that are well executed, a few nods to the original series, some self-deprecating humor and self-parody of the type seen in ""22 Jump Street."" Although the premise is unrealistic, the actors never seem self-conscious and don't wink at the camera, which helps make some of the weaker humor funnier, as if the entire cast is playing straight man to the original program's screwball. It doesn't try to be the least bit cerebral or cathartic. But as light entertainment, especially for somebody who missed the television program, it gets the job done.

Kudos to the filmmakers for using some sort of rigid camera mounts, avoiding the jigglycam shots that are overused in many films."
1.0,2 June 2017,
7.0,27 August 2017,"A few objectification, some weak punchlines. Seems pretty loyal to the original series. This is still pretty goldhorrible, I mean, it is a movie with a bunch of actors known - I'm not saying they're not talented, I love The Rock and Priyanka's work - for their beauty and stuff. Anyhow,if you want a film to spend time and give some laughs, this is it!"
5.0,29 May 2018,"The show may not have been great but it sure left a mark on history as the sexist show. Baywatch was never a comedy, only model driven people who loved to show off their bodies and rescue people. Nuff said

Did I say it was never a comedy."
6.0,12 October 2017,"The names The Rock calls Efron are funny. Always a reference to something and it had me rolling because of the way he delivers it. I like that they made Baywatch into a comedy. I was hesitant about watching because reboots of a show/movie are not usually good and lately that is the new thing. I thought it was going to be like the show and the seriousness of it, but then The Rock knows how to do both, so I was iffy. I saw a few minutes of the original when it aired and I did not like it at all. I could not finish it. Everyone talked about the show and it wasn't for me. My husband wanted to watch the movie and I found it enjoyable. I hope they make more and keep Hasselhoff off. He aged horribly. I don't know why they made The Rock's character Mitch Buchanan. They should have named him something else, passing the torch or a relative. It would have still been enjoyable and Pam looked wonderful. I hoped they would give her a better part."
1.0,29 June 2018,"Baywatch: Directed by Seth Gordon and written by Jay Scherick, Thomas Lennon, Robert Ben Garant and David Ronn

I knew better. I didn't care about the show. I saw through what they were trying to do from the trailers. They were going for that 21 Jump Street thing where they basically make fun of the show while still remaining true to the spirit of the show. It's just too much.

It feels like Michael Bay made this movie. The camera is always swirling around making me nauseous. It has constant slow motion not just for the jokes on the show's liberal use of it. It has that trying to be bad ass slow motion. It has that Michael Bay thing about it. I know this is the point. It's the whole joke behind the film but it made me roll my eyes too many times.

The Rock is naturally fine in it. He's funny in the role and just enough over the top. Zac Efron is also good playing on the frat boy Olympic athlete image. It works for him. The problem is the women are window dressing. They have no character to speak of. They're only there to ogle and for the male characters to win. The original show wasn't like that. It felt off to me. I understand that everyone is meant to be watched and enjoyed for their physical appearance.

The main problem with this movie is it's just not funny. At all. I didn't laugh one time. It's gross out humor and it didn't need it. The schlubby guy wasn't funny either. The whole joke is he didn't fit the whole super physically fit aspect of the lifeguard and that's funny that he tries to fit in feeling awkward. It's not funny. None of this is funny even the jokes at the expense of the original show.

I say skip this one. I give it an F. I should have stuck with my gut feeling on this."

Take it for what it is: a comedy!"
1.0,24 September 2018,"This was one of the most dissapointing, and terrible movies I've ever seen. Ay Iove Alexandra and I like high school musical. What I don't like is garbage and cancer and this garbage film gave me cancer. Now it hurts my weenis when I watch movies because all I can remember are the terrible boyband reference, the unfunny high school musical reference, and the rock being one of the actors of that year. Oh, and the KSI song was worse than when eazy-e got aid."
5.0,16 June 2018,Third grade soft-porn movie! I am utterly disappointed by watching this movie. Just body exposure is the worst form of objectification of women. The movie makers have tried to inject exotica by featuring an actress from the Third World. This could only satiate the sexual fantasies of the already over-sexed American male audience. As a pro-feminism male this is utterly unacceptable in a modern progressive society where women have been making giant strides in all walks of life.
7.0,10 October 2021,"Alright .. the world famous Baywatch . Basically one of my grandfather's favorite TV shows was Baywatch , he used to watch it a lot on Star World and would tell me about it and he used to tell me how distinguished these people were as lifeguards on the beach, but from the Baywatch, they were a lot more than just lifeguards on the beach, they were crime-fighters and mystery solvers as well. The original Baywatch TV show went on for a long long period , around more than a decade . I used to feel really weird why he's praising up this show .. Nan (grandfather) used to tell me if you can't find a job then just be a lifeguard on the beach 😂, that's how much he used to love this show . And I've seen some episodes as well . So this is like a remake movie of the original Baywatch in today's times . And I think they've given a super job with it . Honestly speaking, the responsibility the lifeguards have on the beach on their shoulders is insurmountable . Some stars from the original show also show up in this movie ."

5.0,10 January 2019,"I would like to start out by saying that I am a big fan of The Rock. I also really like a few of the other actors in this movie (from other movies I seen them in). That being said, I have tried about 4 times to watch this movie all the way through, and I do not know why (maybe I just got really bored with it), but I just could not get through maybe the 1 hour mark, and had to turn it off, and watch something else. I am not sure that I have ever been unable to get all the way through a big budget movie, and this may be the 1st one. I understand that this review is not going to be the least bit helpful, but just wanted to post my thoughts anyways. I think that maybe the movie is just too silly (in my opinion), and I just got really bored with it. I never watched the classic TV show."
2.0,23 July 2017,"If all you're looking for in the movie is to laugh, Baywatch may make you laugh. In my case, though, I went expecting a super high quality movie. That wasn't the case. There were many scenes in which I felt like the editing wasn't good. It often felt as if it was filmed with only one camera. The story wasn't that bad, but it wasn't that good either. Baywatch has a lot of the elements that are common to comedies but that's exactly what made it a 'common comedy movie' - more of the same. It reminded me about the movie 'Neighbors.' I expected something better. This is definitely not a standard-setting movie."
10.0,28 December 2021,"This pointless, terrible movie adaptation is nowhere near as watchable as the original Baywatch TV series. This movie fails as badly as the later Baywatch TV series (set in Hawaii). Like most hit tv series and movies, it is the original cast, creators and writers which create the perfect storm for a hit. Any later attempted re-productions just fail miserably - it makes one wonder why the even bother."
2.0,16 March 2019,"I do not like Zach Effron. That being said, I loved him in this movie. It was the first time he seemed to not take himself seriously.

I did enjoy this movie from start to finish, though the plot was so thin it bordered on anorexic."

8.0,28 January 2022,If you're a fan of Dwayne Johnson then this has some enjoyable set pieces and pokes fun at itself and the classic show. It is overly long and doesn't make a lot of sense after the first 45 minutes. If you have low expectations and want escapism only this is worth sticking on once on a Wednesday night. Definitely doesn't deserve sacrificing a weekend night for. You may switch off by the second half though.

5.0,30 October 2017,"There are two reasons I thought one might want to watch this: it's stupid fun and it's sexy. But it was just stupid and not that sexy. For me, having Priyanka, Alexandra Daddario and Kelly Rohrbach in a movie and not have it be sexy is an awful fail.

And it could all been saved if the story would have been a little more interesting or the jokes better, but they just weren't. Did I have difficulties watching it? No. It was like a dumb TV movie that you can enjoy and I was on an international flight. But other than that specific situation, I can't imagine myself wanting to watch it."
1.0,16 May 2018,"Baywatch was a disappointment overall, sorry Dwayne but i think the critics have it right on this one.

I wanted to like this movie, I am a fan of the cast members. I love Dwayne Johnson and I like Zac Efron too. To be fair it wasn't the cast's fault that this film fell short. Johnson, Efron, Daddario, and the rest all did well with their roles and were good picks. To be completely they were the only good parts of the entire movie. Pretty much everything else was poor in quality.

The writing is lazy and the ""comedy"" isn't even comedy, it's completely unfunny. The movie uses crude slapstick as the basis for all of its humor and that is lazy. I didn't laugh at any of the moments that were meant for laughs. The action parts of the movie were decent, meaning that they were average.

I liked the actors and their chemistry, but that's all, the rest fell flat. 5/10."

8.0,13 May 2018,"'Baywatch' was a long running series that was largely successful because it didn't take itself too seriously. 2017's film adaptation pays homage to its source material, but instead could not possibly take itself any less seriously.

Unsurprisingly, the cast of characters who make up the Emerald Bay crew include Dwayne Johnson (what movie isn't he in?) and Zac Efron, plus standard eye candy in Kelly Rohrbach and Alexandra Daddario. Since this is a silly, juvenile comedy, we are graced with the likes of Jon Bass's Ronnie Greenbaum, who does anything he possibly can do to embarrass himself in front of his crush, CJ (Rohrbach).

At its core, 'Baywatch' is a loose drug bust wrapped in a slapstick comedy (sound familiar, '21 Jump Street'?), as the lifeguards try to get to the bottom of why mysterious drugs keep washing up on their beach, which then leads to other, more sinister things. Efron plays a disgraced Olympic swimmer who is sentenced to serve as a lifeguard, and let's just say people do not take too kindly to him at first. Businesswoman Victoria Leeds (Priyanka Chopra) also charms the lifeguard crew with a fancy club, but not all is what it appears to be.

But who cares about the plot?! 'Baywatch' is probably a low point for all of the actors whose names are attached to it, most specifically for Johnson (who will act in just about anything). There are pretty much no redeeming qualities here, and while there are some funny scenes here and there, most everything is rehashed, sloppy and just plain stupid.

Instead of giving 'Baywatch' a watch, just spend the day in the bay."
4.0,3 July 2018,"In the quotes section on here, there's part of an exchange between Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron where they're discussing the kind of things the Baywatch team have done: Mitch Buchannon: ""How about diamond smugglers who are putting the rocks in surfboards and bringing them ashore?"" Matt Brody: ""Everything that you guys are talking about sounds like a really, like, entertaining but far-fetched TV show.""

I used to enjoy the original Baywatch series; it was fun to watch and added a bit of Californian sun to a dull weekend and had pretty ludicrous story lines that didn't feel forced; the diamond smuggling episode reference was back in 1993, and also included a group of frantic UFO experts. Zac Efron was five when that episode first aired, and this film watches like it's been made by someone who is that age now.

Given the cast, it could have either been a decent, feature length Baywatch adventure - akin to the episodes of old - or a poke in the eye parody, spelling out every cliche and plot hole from the old series. I mean, it could have worked if it had been a self aware comedy - breaking down the fourth wall like Deadpool, poking fun at the original series - yet switching between cock jokes and over serious spy scenes, it didn't get into a good stride.

Yes. they included plenty of nice shots of the beach. Yes, they included plenty of the signature slow motion shots (and mocking them accordingly). And, yes, they included plenty of good looking people doing daring do. Yet the ""baddie"" is so obvious, they don't need brain boxes to work out what's going on. Jon Bass as the comic relief - we get it; he's not the same as the other chiseled Life Guards - would probably be the lead in many other underdog films. And the cameos from Hasselhoff and Anderson don't evoke a sense of nostalgia but more a sense of depression that it's been almost three decades since the original series came out."
1.0,11 November 2018,"The script was bad, the acting was bad, and the actors were bad. I want a refund on the two hours of my life I wasted. Plus interest!"
5.0,29 May 2017,"Let's get the obvious out of the way. This is a remake of the '89 to '01 TV series, Baywatch. How does Hollywood remake it's classic TV? First, they take what was a serious show and turn it into a comedy. Then, they throw in a few unnecessary F-bombs. Then they include a lot of sex jokes, some of which are funny and others that are just stupid. They usually include one or two cast members from the original show (Of course it's going to be Hasselhoff and Anderson, who else?) And they throw in a bad guy, or in this movie, a bad girl.

And that is how Hollywood does remakes. They did that with Dukes of Hazzard, They did it with Starsky & Hutch, they did it with CHiPs, every remake had the same setup.

Set at Emerald bay, Mitch Buchannon (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) is a lifeguard who takes his job seriously. Backed up by the lovely C.J. Parker (Kelly Rohrbach) and Summer Quinn (Alexandra Daddario) and a few other co-workers, Mitch is setting up tryouts for the openings to the Baywatch team. While several potential lifeguards are putting an effort into their work, Former Gold Medalist Matt Brody (Zac Efron) is there for his own benefit. He and Mitch are at constant odds, when a series of drug packets, and bodies wind up on the shores of Emerald bay.

To be honest, I enjoyed this movie despite not really seeing the original show. I only watched Baywatch once during it's run. I was 7 years old at the time. It wasn't long after the episode ended I walked around with rigor mortis in my shorts that my mom said I shouldn't watch it anymore.

I can understand why people hate this movie - It takes it's source material, beloved by many just the way it is and dirties it up with a lot of swearing, unnecessary sex humor and other gross material. Some moments are funny, others make you shake your head.

But, I liked it. I'm not saying it's the greatest movie of the summer, because it's not. But it is a fun movie when you don't analyze it too hard. It's a 2-hour trip to the beach where you're going to have fun.

Just don't get caught checking out the lifeguards too much."

3.0,16 June 2020,"While this movie could have worked as a light-hearted summer movie with stupid jokes that it's starting out as, it really tanks in the second half when it turns into a boring crime comedy. The movie looks good, but it's just too silly, the characters are not really that likeable, the cast is giving a good job, but the humor is just all over the place and seldom manages to find the right tone or keep it for more than 2 minutes. I liked the idea of the female villain, however that's the only original thing about this film - but it's at least fun, even though it's often cringe worthy."
5.0,3 September 2018,"Over all the story line was bad, topped off with lame jokes. The cast had much more potential with a better script. I have to cut them a little slack though since obviously we didn't want to offend some of the viewers from the traditional Bay Watch delivery. I think the spent to much money on abs than writing."
2.0,19 May 2018,"Baywatch was hyped up and promoted heavily before its release. Upon the film's release, it has been considered a flop and has been panned from critics and fans. The film was supposed to be another Dwayne Johnson blockbuster, but wasn't.

Baywatch isn't as bad as some are claiming but overall the film just isn't funny and tries a little too hard. Johnson has charisma as usual but his chemistry with Zac Efron isn't there, and the constant back and forth jokes between them becomes tiresome quickly.

With some decent and entertaining moments, overall Baywatch didn't live up to the hype and has somewhat been forgotten already. With clear hopes a sequel (as showed after the end credits), we highly doubt that will still happen."

5.0,19 May 2022,"As I've said in the past, reviewing comedies is weird because, more than any other genre, humor really is subjective. So keep that in mind.. When I first went into this, I was expecting a cheesy drama action flick full of in-your-face eye candy. Well, I was only half right. It has its cheesy moments but they're mostly outshined by making fun of itself, immature yet personally hilarious humor (though I can see why some people wouldn't like it), and, yes, a very attractive cast. With its exceptions, and nobody except for maybe Zac Efron was a perfect 10. The movie really seemed to give an equal spotlight on both the men and women when it came to sexualization; they even joked about their attire in the bloopers. Plot wise it's just as silly and cliché as you might expect, but once again even the absurdities of the storyline are mocked in the script. Ultimately it comes off as a parody of the source material, and with David Hasselhoff in a funny cameo, you can tell they really just had fun making it. If you still expect any level of seriousness that lasts more than a ten second scene, or have an unusually mature sense of humor, you're not gonna enjoy this."
8.0,27 April 2019,"This movie comes well actually in the first minutes. They have jokes, occasional sensuality, skimpy clothes, and crude jokes. They even going meta for a few moments. All are good until the conflict comes, and I am just bored to watch the rest of it. I am not against this American crude comedy movie like this, but this movie offers nothing other than comical actions and hot bodies. I guess people say that you don't have to be serious to watch this kind of film, and I did.

I acknowledge this movie develops the plot and introduction well. The cliches used by this movie, Oh my God, are in the whole different level than superhero movies. This movie like to recycle all possible funny contents, with touching and philosophical meaning of being lifeguards, camouflaging and dumb faces from the girls, and thinking you could get away just because you got bodies as the safety net, it's just horrific.

Let's say that I give this movie stars because they have it good in the beginning. If they stick to the plan, going meta with references, or having more authenticity, I would love to give this movie more, considering that I never like a single type of film like this."
3.0,3 February 2019,"The movie is really bad. I mean really, really bad."
5.0,27 April 2019,"Nobody watched the original Baywatch TV series for its meaningful plots or award-worthy performances; the same goes for this big screen version. Baywatch the Movie definitely works on the assumption that the viewer will be too busy ogling the cast's hot bods that they won't notice or care that the script is self-mocking trash that relies heavily on dick jokes.

Having recently seen Wonder Woman, all the while thinking how much better Alexandra Daddario would have been in the role, I decided to console myself by watching the gorgeous actress in a tight swimsuit for a couple of hours. Delicious Daddario is joined by the equally lovely Kelly Rohrbach as blonde lifeguard CJ Parker. And for those into guys, there's the impossibly ripped Zac Efron as Olympic swimmer Matt Brody, and everyone's favourite action star of the day, Dwayne Johnson as Mitch Buchannon.

While I admit to finding the dick gags amusing (I never claimed to have a sophisticated sense of humour), the rest of the film isn't anywhere near as funny as it was clearly intended to be, the action scenes are unimpressive, and the plot is mind-numbingly predictable (intentionally so, perhaps, but banal is banal). Thank heavens for the constant eye-candy, without which the film would have been much more of a chore.

5.5/10, mostly for Daddario and Rohrbach, rounded down to 5 for that terrible scene with the burning boat, which features really bad CG flames."
4.0,5 March 2018,"""Baywatch"" was one of the most popular television series of the nineties. The programme-makers might have liked to kid themselves that its popularity was due to the quality of its scripts or its acting, but the truth was rather different. Setting a TV drama among a team of Californian lifeguards was a brilliant stroke. It not only permitted plenty of shots of young women in swimsuits but also provided an obvious retort to anyone who complained about a gratuitous display of female flesh. ""But real lifeguards have to wear swimsuits to work!""

Well, so they do, but perhaps not all real female lifeguards look like the cast of ""Baywatch"". It was obvious that no actress could ever hope to win a part in the series unless she possessed the face and figure of a ""Playboy"" model- and several of the cast were precisely that in real life, most notably the series' biggest-name star, Pamela Anderson, who had several ""Playboy"" appearances under her belt. The formula of sun, sea, sand and sexy swimsuits worked for a while, and for a number of years young male audiences all over the globe were tuning in to watch the lovely Pamela and her co-stars sporting themselves in the surf, but all good things come to an end and the series eventually came to an end. There are, after all, only a limited number of plots you can get out of a team of lifeguards, however beautiful they may be.

Only that wasn't the end. Now, twenty years on, someone has decided to revive the format for a movie. The film keeps the original setting, and some of the original names, although fans of the series will have noticed some changes. Casey Jean Parker (the part played by Anderson) is taller and less voluptuous. Summer Quinn, once blonde, is now a brunette. And Stephanie Holden and Mitch Buchanan are now black. (Stephanie also, for some reason, has taken to swimming in a long-sleeved swimsuit more like a leotard).

The plot revolves around a new recruit to the ""Baywatch"" team. Or perhaps I should say a reluctant new recruit. Matt Brody, a former Olympic gold medal swimmer, has been forced to work as a lifeguard as part of his community service for some unspecified offence. The rest of the team take an instant dislike to Matt, which is hardly surprising, given that he has an obnoxious personality and a massive ego. The scriptwriters seem to agree with me that there are only a limited number of plots you can get out the basic ""lifeguard"" theme, because the team here spend surprisingly little time in the water. They spend most of their time on land (although still dressed in their swimsuits) investigating the doings of a gang of drug dealers. You and I might think that law enforcement is something best left to the police, but in the movie the only people who try to point this out are portrayed either as an officious, arrogant jack-in-office (the local police lieutenant) or as a spineless coward (Matt).

The original television series was, ostensibly at least, a serious drama, but the film is very much an action-comedy. There is a good deal of bad language and crude lavatorial or sexual humour, something from which the TV series was surprisingly free despite being aimed at a predominantly young male audience. (In Britain it always went out at Saturday tea-time, traditionally a slot aimed at the family market).

The television series was not noted for high standards of acting, but the film is considerably worse in this respect. Dwayne Johnson may have ditched his ""The Rock"" nickname, which was always more appropriate to a professional wrestler than to a professional actor, but he is still as stony-faced and emotionless as ever. None of the original team of Baywatch Babes (with the possible exception of Alexandra Paul, the original Stephanie) had much talent as an actress, but at least they did bring some personality and charisma, as well as beauty, to their roles. The current team (Alexandra Daddario, Kelly Rohrbach and Ilfenesh Hadera) have the beauty without the charisma. The film's storyline is just as hackneyed and clichéd as anything in the series, which was as little noted for brilliant plots as it was for brilliant acting. My feelings are perhaps best summed up by the words of Richard Roeper, film critic of the Chicago Sun-Times, who said ""When you make films from junk TV, more often than not you're going to wind up with a junk movie"". 3/10"

No 2017 audience has the brains to deal with the complexities we presented 20 years ago. We'll have to dumb it down. We'll have to dumb it down A LOT"".

And so they did. Gone are our worries that intellectual challenges like those presented by Pamela Anderson and David Hasselhoff in the 90s will go over our heads in the movie remake. Nothing is intended to go over our heads in this one. Instead, we're pounded repeatedly in the gut by scenes and locker room talk about body parts, body fluids, and involuntary muscle reactions.

You don't go watch The Avengers looking for a Shakespearian script. You don't go watch 007 looking for a kids movie. You don't go watch a horror movie looking for a relaxed moment. See my point?

2.0,12 September 2017,"Baywatch is a 2017 comedy film starring Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron. The story follows Lt. Mitch Buchannon, played by Johnson, and his team of lifeguards as they patrol and protect Emerald Bay. Conflict arises when Matt Brody, a former U.S. Olympic swimmer played by Efron, arrives to join the team as part of his community service. Brody's rebellious personality clashes with the close-knit team of Baywatch and Buchannon must find a way to rein in the young swimmer.

The scenery of Baywatch is beautiful. It will make you want to turn off this film and take a vacation, which is a good thing because this movie is awful.

Baywatch is full of faulty premises, bad acting, and has a lame and generic villain. Everything about this Disney Channel-esque movie is corny. You have the embarrassing ""coolest guy in the world"" trope and it's used multiple times. Every character is overly friendly, overly cocky, overly tough. This replaces any and all character development you would get from a movie. She's the cocky one, he's the cool one, she's the friendly one.

The worst part about this film is the comedy. Every single joke, with the exception of one or two, does not work. This isn't helped by the fact that the jokes come at you non-stop, and nothing is funny. It's horrible Disney Channel humor with obvious puns and situational comedy with premises so bad that they don't work. A bad joke hammered in to death is a terrible experience and that's all you're going to get out of this film: a terrible experience.

Overall, Baywatch is one of the worst films I have seen in a while. The entire movie makes me feel uncomfortable and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. The entire movie, including the ending, is completely predictable and boring. If you're interested in seeing a comedy film that is never funny but never stops trying, then check out Baywatch."
10.0,26 May 2020,"Baywatch is not a good film. That's the first thing you need to know. The characters are bland, the dialogues are too basic, most of the jokes are predictable and some of them take too long without evolving. You need a heck of suspension of disbelief in order to follow the events of this movie.

On the other hand...well this is a remake of a tv show that was not known for being good but for including hot women in bathsuits. this film has that. it also has the likeability of the rock and the cockines of zac efron that actually bland well together. Priyanka Chopra is criticized by most people as a villain, but i actually enjoyed every minute she was in. she was completely cartoonish don't get me wrong: not very further from an inspector gadget villain. But at the same time the film is self aware of that: so i had real fun everytime she appears on screen.

so i did laugh sometimes and i was pretty entertained throughout this film. It's too long? probably but still doesn't fade. its self awareness of knowing this is not exactly a gem of a film is the best part of all. This wanted to be kinda a 21 jump street and actually it could have been that if it tried harder. As it is i can't say is good but i can't say is horrible either. If you want to see a mediocre movie just to pass the time (nd this happens) this is a good option.

I had fun. And i would probably see a sequel of this. I hope next time, if it happens, anderson and hasselhof have more screen time."
3.0,8 February 2019,I never watched the original series and I didn't have high expectations for this movie. The bad/dirty/sexist jokes were not very funny and the whole thing just seemed ridiculous and unrealistic. At least I didn't pay for watching it. I think the part I enjoyed most was trying to figure out where else I had seen Alexandra Daddario before.
4.0,10 June 2022,Baywatch is not a good movie. However the film is exactly as advertised - a cast of extremely attractive people playing around a loose plot. You get exactly what you are asking for out of this one.
5.0,24 February 2018,"I mean really? Who possibly thought this was a good idea? I mean...Baywatch! Have Hollywood seriously run out of ideas that they are now consistently pumping out films from TV Series? 'The A-Team' was tolerable, this was just pointless. Lifeguards of the ""Baywatch"" team take it upon themselves to unravel a drug smuggling, property purchasing and countless murdering case that plagues the beach. ""Why not just let the police deal with this?"" is a line consistently spoken. I would agree, but then chances are we would have a 'Hawaii Five-O' film in our midst and I just cannot deal with another one of these mundane disasters. So lifeguards abandon their own beach and perform a variety of illegal activities like, but not limited to: high speed boat pursuits, imitating professions (such as a doctor) and playing around with dead people. The 'Suicide Squad' are more qualified to look after this beach!? God damn. I knew as soon as the massive titles came up out of the ocean on a noticeable green screen, with a barrage of explosions and flailing dolphins...that I was in for an experience. Credit to Dwayne Johnson though, he still gives everything his all and never fails to make me smile. I did laugh three times due to Johnson name calling Efron ""High School Musical"", ""NSYNC"" and ""One Direction"". I did get a good chuckle from that. Everyone looked the part I guess, plenty of slow motion running with jiggly boobs and wet hair (if that's your thing...). Hasselhoff and Anderson make cameo appearances, rejoice! But heck, even their brief performances couldn't save this oceanic mess. The story was generic with a boring antagonist. The noticeable green screen was extremely noticeable that even I noticed the noticeable green screen. Did I forget to mention it was noticeable? The worst CGI fire ever is included. Jon Bass was not even remotely funny. And, to top it all, they thought to joke about making a sequel. A sequel!? Good luck. Johnson needs to step up and pick some better projects, his persona is wasted here."
3.0,6 January 2022,"I can't believe how dense the people who gave the 5 stars are who don't see the brilliance and humor.

This film doesn't pretend to be anything more than what it intends to be - powerfully funny, charming, sexy with excellent timing for the writing, acting and atmosphere. I haven't laughed and replayed these scenes in a movie since The Hangover. Kudos to the writers and the people who chose the acting crew. Give it your time. It's an absolute worthwhile ride.

4.0,24 September 2017,"Based on the TV series of the same name, 'Bawatch' is a film that tries to revive the spirit of its source material, but fails to make a feature length film of out it. Pecs and Boobs are aplenty and a lot of slow-mo. And then what?

'Baywatch' Synopsis: Devoted lifeguard Mitch Buchannon butts heads with a brash new recruit, as they uncover a criminal plot that threatens the future of the bay.

'Baywatch' stands on a faulty script. The Writing settles for good-looking people with gym chiseled bodies and a lot slow-motion to get you amused. And while all that is appealing, considering its 'Baywatch', but why would one watch that for nearly 2 hours? Also, the track of a drug lord (Priyanka Chopra, in hammy mode) is uninteresting.

Mark Swift and Damian Shannon's Screenplay is funny initially, but lacks meat overall. Seth Gordon's Direction is passable. Cinematography is alright. Editing is fair.

Acting Wise, Dwayne Johnson & Alexandra Daddario are the only reason why 'Baywatch' doesn't sink entirely. Johnson, buff as always, is striking & an effective leading man. Daddario, on the other-hand, sexier than ever, lights up the screen with charm & energy. The rest barely add much.

On the whole, 'Baywatch' doesn't really work."

9.0,15 January 2021,"It says here that Mitch Buchanan - Dwayne Johnson - leads his elite team of lifeguards. I have a hard time with that concept. Life guarding is a seasonal occupation for teenage boys to earn a few dollars. It lets them yell at children and develop a tan for the pretty girls. Although the requirements may have shifted, it's the equivalent of Pete, the Good Humor man when I was in grade school. During the winter, I seem to recall, he sold coal. I can't imagine any of these occupations as being skilled, let alone elite, although I imagine you need to have passed the usual Red Cross classes.

Anyway, there's a murder, and rumors of someone selling drugs, and Johnson has to put Zach Enron in his place, and there's a ski jet sequence to some rap music. I don't recall the original TV show, which I never watched, but heard about occasionally, as being one that aspiring performers took to stretch their acting abilities and try to speak the words, trippingly off the tongue. It was about looking at good looking people in G rated sexy swimsuits. David Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson have cameos. They were in the show, weren't they?"

3.0,30 September 2017,"This could have been a good film, not great but good. The problem is, it's a Hollywood film. Once again Hollywood has managed to ruin what could be a decent film with one character (Ronnie).

The humour in the film wasn't the best, and certainly lacked any subtlety or class. But for what it was, it worked. Was it Baywatch? No, was it an over the top action comedy, yes, which is exactly what I set out to watch.

Unfortunately until Hollywood stops casting people in the same cliché roles again and again films like this are going to be dragged down by individuals who are not funny."

Do I recommend it? Yes, its super funny and the actors are fantastic. Dwayne is a legend and he always makes the movie 10x better. Really enjoyed it from start to finish, it was so ridiculous at some scenes I cracked up hard out.

Is it worth your time? Definitely yes. The movie wasn't boring one bit and I had a fun experience watching this. I probably wouldn't watch it again though but it was a really good movie, just not many wow factors though. Just your standard comedy."
5.0,9 June 2017,"I am a heterosexual male. After watching the new action/comedy BAYWATCH, I can firmly state without hesitation:

ZAC EFRON IS A VERY GOOD LOOKING YOUNG MAN

Based on the cheesecake television show of the 1980's that made ""The Hoff"" a household name and launched the careers of a bevy of beauties, this incarnation of Baywatch made an interesting choice.

It has toned down the cheesecake (girls) and turned up the beefcake (boys).

Don't get me wrong, there still is a myriad of ladies in bathing suits and plenty of slo-motion running, but Director Seth Gordon (HORRIBLE BOSSES) has chosen to linger more on the ripped bods of the two male stars of this film - Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and the aforementioned Mr. Efron. I'm sure the excuse that the filmmakers will trot out is that the plot is centered around the Mentor/Mentee relationship of Johnson and Efron while the entire Baywatch team focuses their attention on an undercover crime that...

Oh, who am I kidding. The focus of this film is the beefcake and cheesecake, the plot is superfluous and the humor and plot machinations are just there to get the good looking leads in this film to strip down to shorts or bathing suits. If they can get wet at the same time - all the better.

This film purports itself to be a comedy. You might ask me, ""is it funny""? My answer is ""meh"", funny enough, I guess. There are some funny folks in this film - Hannibal Buress, for example - that aren't utilized to the extent that they could have and cameos by the 2 most famous folks in Baywatch history (I'll let you figure this out) aren't nearly as effective as they need to be. But the relationship between Johnson and Efron is good enough and Alexandra Daddario (SAN ANDREAS), Priyanka Chopra (QUANTICO) and Kely Rohrbach (some minor roles, but - basically - her big screen debut) are all equally ""good enough"" to make this movie a passable way to spend 2 hours. Only Jon Bass (LOVING) rises above the material. Ilfenesh Hadera (CHI-RAQ) had a chance to rise above - if only they would have given more (or at least SOMETHING) to do.

But...let's be honest...you don't come to this movie for the acting, the intricate plot lines or the comedy. You come to see good looking people in swimsuits running on the beach.

And...on that score, this film delivers.

Letter Grade: C+

5 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
8.0,12 August 2021,Beautiful and funny in a new way. Could have been truly original and even a stand out.
3.0,18 February 2019,"Hormone film, don't care about the plot, just watch the beach."
2.0,23 July 2018,"Mitch Buchannon (Dwayne Johnson) is a head lifeguard who is devoted to his work and takes a serious and professional approach to his job. He soon finds his patience tested when cocky gung-ho new recruit Matt Brody (Zac Efron) joins the programme and he clashes with Mitch as they have very differing attitudes to what being a lifeguard is actually about; however the 2 men find that they must work together when they learn that real estate magnate Victoria Leeds (Priyanka Chopra) is taking unethical measures in order to create a monopoly on the bay.

Let's all be honest with each other here; this film never had a chance of being brilliant and anyone who was actually expecting this to be an amazing film either doesn't live in the real world or perhaps hasn't seen the original TV Series upon which this film was based on - which I can understand with younger viewers as it must be close to 20 years since Baywatch was last on TV. Having said that the film did work on a very basic level for me; the banter (mainly between Johnson and Efron is amusing - even if Efron being compared to every solo male singer or boy-band member in the last 20 years was a one-note joke it was a fairly effective joke for the most part). Sure it's a shallow film, but in some ways it's amusingly shallow as it does at least have a degree of self-awareness about it; there are a number of slow-motion scenes which are obviously an in-joke about the original TV Series (which perhaps won't work for those who haven't seen the TV Series), but for someone like me who was a teenager at the time and remembers the TV series I did find some of these references to be quite funny.

Although there is a plot here, it is rather weak and with all the focus being on the cast members perfectly toned bodies or wonderful breasts - like Efron himself I found Daddario's assets something of a distraction, and I also thought that Kelly Rohrbach was pretty hot as well. But this forms part of a problem in the fact that these are the things that you remember about the film and the story takes second place and almost feels inconsequential. Like I say it is the fairly amusing banter between Johnson and Efron that prevents me from completely hating this film.

The acting is pretty much as bad as could be expected with, rather unsurprisingly, the 2 people in the film who seemingly haven't been selected for their looks (Johnson and Bass) giving the most engaging performances and it is these 2 actors that come across as being the most believable and 'real' people out of the cast. Efron isn't very good when he's on his own and only works well when he plays off against Johnson. Daddario and Rohrbach are both hot, but they are fairly vapid characters who add very little (apart from the obvious) and the same extends to Hadera who I felt could have been used better.

There are a couple of lazy and rather meaningless cameos from ex-stars of the TV Series which add nothing to the film (which strikes as desperation from the producers and with Johnson being one of the producers I thing he should hang his head in shame). I get that the film isn't meant to be taken seriously and I liked the way it made fun of itself a bit, but there's this underlying feeling that Baywatch the film is far too in love with itself and for me this took some of the enjoyment away from my overall viewing experience."
3.0,4 November 2018,"Ok, lets start with; this is not a ""good"" movie...its stupid, corny, cheesy & over the top! That said; i still enjoyed it!

It definitly wont win any Oscars, but Its lighthearted fun... kind of remind me of the cheesy 80's actioncomedies i grew up with.

Its something to put on when you just Want to relax and have a cheap laugh, like for a hangover-day when you dont really have the energy to have full focus on a movie...just Take it for what it is..."

Would definitely recommend to anyone who enjoyed 21 / 22 Jump Street or Bad Neighbours 1/2"
3.0,8 May 2023,"I got to see Baywatch right on time through an early showing. The outcome of the first Baywatch was something that didn't seem OK. The show was before my time however it was routinely ridiculed for being incredibly messy. Individuals frequently blamed it so as to look at Pamela Anderson and Yasmine Bleeth. So the 2017 film variant of Baywatch needs to honor the source material yet update this story for another age. I'm glad to say that Baywatch has no issue ridiculing it's foundations and they frequently concoct imaginative ways of making it happen. They aren't exactly as meta yet the consistent sluggish movement running and these lifeguards working external their sets of expectations are more than once taunted and speared. The general plot is amazing and ludicrous yet the film doesn't avoid that issue, it tends to it consistently and has some good times ridiculing it close by the crowd. Does the film float excessively far into improbability? Totally yet you can't treat this film in a serious way. It totally unwinds assuming you do. This isn't an issue only for Baywatch. On the off chance that a film can recognize how ridiculous it is, I can attempt to oblige it and Baywatch had the sound judgment to do this.

I truly enjoyed the greater part of the advertising for Baywatch yet the film I got to watch was not the same as what I anticipated. The trailers charged this as to a greater extent a straight satire yet this turned out to be a greater amount of an activity/parody. The activity in this is fair, the film is pretty fetishistic for slow-movement yet I would in any case give it a passing grade. They fortunately keep its vast majority light and it generally looks great (short some quite terrible looking CGI fire). However, the motivation to see this is the parody. The film depends on gross-out humor excessively much at focuses yet the comedic exchange was truly strong and the theater I saw it in was giggling all through the film. The solid science among Dwayne and Zac assists and keeping in mind that I definitely disapproved of the jokes, I thought they were very great.

This film has a major and truly appealing cast that assist this film with avoids around story problems. Dwayne is his ordinary magnetic self and his agreeable disposition is key for this film working. Zac shows again that he's a misjudged comedic entertainer and he's areas of strength for truly The Stone and without help from anyone else. Kelly Rohrbach is amusing yet even the film gets straight to the point about how she's there as a result of shocking she is. I enjoyed Alexandra and Ilfenesh, both were great yet the film didn't give both of them much to do. I was somewhat blended on Jon Bass and I preferred Hannibal Burress in his job. In the event that somebody astounded me it was Priyanka Chopra. Her personality of Victoria is truly antique and the film appeared to not entirely set in stone to make you feign exacerbation at whatever point the story moves back to her. However, through her capacity and her magnetism, she takes a dull person and really conveys a noteworthy exhibition.

Getting to what I could have done without about Baywatch, the greatest thing is that the film just can't stop while they're ahead. They neglect to acknowledge when to create some distance from specific jokes and they're at legitimate fault for this time and again. This is particularly obvious when you center around Ronnie. Jon Bass is entertaining as this person yet his ponderousness is dialed up such a lot of that they destroy his material pretty much without fail. It's likewise somewhat difficult to decide the amount Baywatch needs to be viewed in a serious way. The film goes for straight droll and afterward they will out of nowhere send off into how the Sound is in serious peril with next to no change. That sort of apparent switch should be possible yet they just couldn't sell it totally.

This film faces a difficult task since it will be contrasted with artistic examples of overcoming adversity like 21 and 22 Leap Road. All the more as of late, you likewise had the rethinking of CHIPS. Does Baywatch hit that incredibly high bar set by the Leap Road establishment? No yet it likewise laps CHIPS quite without any problem. The correlation with 21 Leap Road is fair with this being in a similar kind yet I feel like individuals fail to remember how extraordinary those films were. Hop Road appeared unexpectedly and they accomplished general recognition when you simply don't get that for comedies. Baywatch can't totally occupy from how ludicrous the plot is and the film required a more tight alter. Yet, the film is truly entertaining, it includes a decent cast of entertainers/entertainers that rat for itself and the film works effectively celebrating/ridiculing it's source material. I may be in the minority for this one yet I'd give it a 7.5/10 gathering together to a 8/10."
8.0,27 September 2023,"Baywatch excellently cast Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron who were both in incredible shape for their roles and then completely squandered this opportunity with a lame script, bad CGI, overused green screen and crude humor. The supporting cast consisted of just good enough looking female lifeguards instead of the bombshells from the original TV show and the obnoxious, out of shape Jon Bass.

I added two stars to my rating just for being impressed to see actors like Efron actually getting in top shape for their role. Alexandra Daddario unfortunately is not that attractive of a woman where someone like Efron would be infatuated with so their romance felt very forced. But don't get me started with someone like Kelly Rohrbach falling for nerdy out of shape Jon Bass. It is just never going to happen.

So much of this movie looked promising when the actions scenes start but then they fall apart as soon as the horrible CGI shows up or the never ending use of green screen. I mean they were literally eating lunch near the beach but it was still shot with a green screen? Are you kidding me? Why?

I never wanted to remake a movie more than this one. How could you not make a good over the top action movie about Baywatch with The Rock's charm? All the elements were there but instead they thought crude humor was the way to go and you wind up just wanting to turn it off. The plot involving Priyanka Chopra was so bad it came off like an SNL skit.

The original TV show was never going to win any awards but you could watch an entire episode and feel like there was actually a story there unlike this movie which is just painfully unfunny."
3.0,17 April 2018,"When I first heard they were remaking this as a parody, I was quite relieved. I doubt it would have worked at all if they did it seriously like they did back in the eighties. But if you're making a parody, you've got to make sure it is really funny. With better writing it could have been much, much funnier,"
5.0,10 February 2019,"Finally could not get out of watching this.. for nostalgia sake.. 4/10 is generous and only for the innuendo and gags, the movie should get less.. entertaining screen filler at best.."
5.0,1 May 2022,"OK. This was surprisingly less mindless than I expected. It's a tick better than average. No great shakes, but some laughs, some decent enough acting, and it made the 2 hours pass pretty quickly. There are a lot of better movies out there, but there are also a lot worse movies out there. Taken for what it was, it was kind of fun."
5.0,21 September 2019,"So many of the reviews for this are awful and I'm at a loss to understand why, most of them start ""Just like the TV show it was based on"".

Maybe it is, but if it is, what the hell are you complaining about?

As it is, I haven't really seen the TV show and couldn't care less.

This film is cheesy, sometimes awkward and often cliché, but it is consistently hilarious, especially toward the end.

If you're expecting Godfather level acting or a serious life guarding action film, you're watching the wrong movie, and even if you've not seen the trailer, one look at the poster should have been enough to give a fair expectation of this Comedy.

If you're a fan of Dwayne Johnson and Comedy, this is a great film to watch. It could definitely have been better in some places, but it delivers on what I think most people who went in to this with a logical expectation wanted."
8.0,9 November 2017,"Baywatch is a movie based on a classic TV show (that no one really watched for the plot) starring Dwayne Johnson, Zac Efron and Alexandra Daddario. It's about a group of lifeguards who discover a hidden conspiracy and try to resolve it.

It started out decent enough with some parts that were actually funny, but as soon as the actual story kicks in it comes crashing down. There is one particular scene with the fire on a yacht that kick-starts it and it's probably the funniest scene in the entire movie because of how laughably bad the CGI is. Honestly, I've never seen such bad CGI in a studio movie. So yeah, sadly, the funniest scene in the movie wasn't even supposed to be funny. What's even worse is how long that scene goes on and tries to be intense, but it looks like something out of a freaking mock-buster! That scene alone is a story for itself. At least that story is stronger than what follows. The characters are completely one-dimensional with a completely forgettable villain. And it just doesn't feel very realistic. There is no chemistry between the characters, there is one plot point, one scene, that was probably supposed to bring them closer together, but it doesn't work. At all. It really doesn't change much about them. But apparently the writers thought it does. At least it seems so.

But at least it's fun and the acting is decent enough. It's not to be taken seriously (even though it's still not very good if you don't), but it's problem is that when it tries to be funny it mostly fails and when it tries to take itself seriously it's laughable. Even though it's dumb fun, I don't recommend this."
5.0,4 April 2022,"There is one reason why you see that star, and it's only because of the boobs displayed in the movie. You cannot lie, the women casted are pretty appealing and very beautiful (But I'm not a pervert, so I'll top there)

The rest of the film, however, is not appealing in any way whatsoever, Shallow characters, some of the worst CGI I've seen in any film released after 2016 and a very boring, cliché and very predictable plot and ending. The bad guys are so stupid that they often act like someone you'd see in a children's cartoon. The main antagonist died a very dumb death and for some reason Zac Efron punches the police chief in the face at the end.

This movie is probably worse than the TV series."
3.0,6 October 2018,Don't waste your time on something you're not going to laugh at for two hours.
5.0,27 September 2021,"What a waste of Zac Efron. You want him to make him a dumb guy like in the news report on the tv or a cool sarcastic guy like in the rest of the movie? Make up your mind!

Cringe dick jokes that go on for too long. God i hated that guy that he got stuck in the beach chair.

It only had a couple of funny smart moments that were breaking the 4th wall, but thats about it.

What a horrible written comedy. Not recommended."
5.0,18 July 2018,"I normally like Dwayne Johnson, Zac Efron, and Priyanka Chopra but this was straight out poorly written with some ok moments. The first scenes seemed like it had the making of something interesting show and I really liked the names Dwayne called Zac's character. Sadly the small name calling in the front was the only funny parts. It seemed like most of the ""humor"" was only the cringey awkward moments from Jon Bass's character or how disgusted you feel about what happens to Zac's character. Honestly if they took Jon Bass's character out completely the show would have been a lot better. I also think they should have made the reason they went after the bad guys more organic instead of straight up looking for them right off the bat. I feel so embarrassed for the actors and actresses involved in this film and I hope the lesser known ones get a second chance after this movie."
4.0,27 June 2017,"Baywatch was surprisingly an entertaining film. While a movie like this mike look like a car wreck because people assume its filled with eye candy and lacks substance it actually wasn't. In reality the film was a fresh reboot with a new spin. The plot was decent and nicely tied to the beach where a lot of the illegal drug transport occurred. The cast do a great job to carry this film. They excel in the looks department which is always nice but they manage to deliver on their performances to carry this film. The plot and its villain played very well by Priyanka Chopra were interesting and believable and it also set the stage nicely for the Baywatch crew to overreach and take matters into their own hands. The side plot involving Zac Effron and his inclusion in the team wasn't all that bad either. The focus amid the jokes was on the emphasis of the team and how he flied solo and needed to be a team player, he had earned gold medals individually but never as a team effort. The humor is nicely done and the jokes are actually pretty funny. Most films today have their humor forced and it's often just vulgar and nothing else. Baywatch does its humor very well and it flows well with the film. The scenes with The Rock calling Zac all kinds of names worked well and at one point even called him High School Musical. Another strength is the feel good factor of this film and how it remains mostly positive throughout to give a good experience.

Some criticisms include perhaps showing the evil plot in more detail and more screen time for the villain to increase the sense of danger. One big criticism is the soundtrack and the terrible music used mainly throughout the film. The only good song was Lionel Richie and old music would have worked better. Having said that it was somewhat disappointing that this film received bad reviews and ratings. The beauty of this site is the ability to voice an independent opinion based purely on the integrity of a film. If we were going to act like sheep and react the way others do then what is the point of coming on here? This film wasn't all that bad and in reality was a great fresh look at an old classic TV show and good homage was paid.

And while they proved that you can revive a TV show (21 Jump Street), this doesn't quite cut it.

There's something missing overall. There are some funny jokes here and there and The Rock delivers as expected. There's also a no prisoner mentality to it. Plus a couple of cameos. You know you can't do Baywatch without the Hoff. But while he is generally out making money out of others making fun of him, some may not feel that does the show and its legacy justice. And some others just don't get the premature humor and really low IQ humor this is based on ... just be prepared.

I think it could have worked if it was a meta comedy, or they went full in with the idiot plot and all the characters thought they were much more capable and smarter than they are. The current version feels like an early draft where they were trying to figure out the tone of the movie, and just throwing stuff at a wall. I have no idea who the audience of the movie is. It's not fans of the old show, or rebooting for a new generation. The movie turns into a ""And then"" movie where stuff happens and none of the characters really grow."
5.0,14 September 2018,"This movie totally blew the hilarity that it contains! The comedy and sense of humor is definitely funny and sometimes unique.. sometimes unique in a very bad way! This movie contains a lot of bad things! The script was not powerful, and it was sometimes overreacting and bothering. Most of the characters were very poor and not talented.. like Kelly Rohrbach as C.J. Parker, Jon Bass as Ronnie and Ilfenesh Hadera as Stephanie Holden. The performance of these characters was poor, and gave the movie a really bad spirit! The jokes about the slow motion were the worst of the movie. The way they overreacted about saving the bay was..... OVERREACTED!!!! The graphic-ed scenes were super-bad! The slow motion scenes were unneeded and annoying!!!! Matt Brody is good alone and very talented, but with the contest between him and Mitch Buchannon he did nothing but making him a joke... And he did more when he was alone.. how come!!!! The vomit is green.. LOL!! The sexual content worked with me very well. Most of the time, the sense of humor is great. I loved the performance of Dwayne Johnson as Mitch Buchannon, Zac Efron as Matt Brody, Alexandra Daddario as Summer and Priyanka Chopra as Victoria Leeds. So as a result, the movie was just fine"
5.0,21 September 2024,"Save for 3 or 4 absolutely hilarious skits that feature Yahya Abdul-Mateen's amusing bantering, & jokes that FINALLY pokes fun of Baywatch's fictional universe, this rendition of the 90s TV series, was an entertainment blunder. Sure, Baywatch has its audiences endure its generic & seriously forgettable narrative, and its un-stimulating CGI-heavy action stunts. The same can be said for its poorly written characters, casted for mere eye-candy, devoid of any character development nor interesting quirks. These nuisances however, come expected considering its source material, Seth Gordon directs, & its ensemble consisting of Dwayne Johnson, Zac Efron, a visibly uncomfortable Alexandra Daddario, and a bunch of nobodies never again seen in other Hollywood movies. It is Baywatch's brand of comedy that downright misfires, succumbing the picture to a new level of blandness, as it delivers crude jokes and lowbrow humor at the constant and in the most awkward of fashions. Its over-indulgence on penis humor & unfunny, raunchy dialogue, magnified by Gordon's propensity to dedicate significant screen-time for these, were distracting, skippable episodes, dragging the movie on with tiresome add-on gags that simple doesn't land.

Yes, 2017's Baywatch then drowns in its own cesspool of lackluster everything. From its weak storyline, absolutely shallow characters, and its disappointing, wasted comedic opportunities, it certainly does not deserve its explicitly petitioned sequel. Sorry Brahma Bull."
2.0,12 May 2018,Honestly? Let down by low level cast other than The Rock. Had glimmers of the show with some self referential humor but it's not worth getting into really

10.0,2 March 2022,"A movie with all the cliché possible: some characters really simple (not really deep), sexual jokes and graphics almost all the time. Showing the muscles and all thats stuff. If you like that type of content go ahead. But if you like something complex or more serious: please skip the movie!"
5.0,12 August 2021,"Utterly, utterly abysmal...lasted barely past the credits. How on earth does something this atrocious get green lit? And who in casting thought they would pass off short arse Zac Efron off as an Olympic gold swimmer is anyone's guess?"
5.0,5 May 2024,"In Emerald Bay, the Baywatch team is led by Lt. Mitch Buchannon (Dwayne Johnson) and composed by CJ Parker (Kelly Rohrbach) and Stephanie Holden (Ilfenesh Hadera). This summer, Baywatch hires two trainees that succeed in several tests and the chosen are Summer Quinn (Alexandra Daddario) and Ronnie Greenbaum (Jon Bass). However, Mitch's boss Captain Thorpe (Rob Huebel) forces him to accept the rebel Olympic champion swimmer Matt Brody (Zac Efron), who is on probation, in his team. He starts the life-saving training and Brody likes to show off but taking wrong decisions. Mitch is worried about the drug flakka that is used by people in the bay and suspects that the owner of the Huntley Club, Victoria Leeds (Priyanka Chopra), is the responsible for the distribution. Meanwhile, Leeds is bribing the politicians using Councilman Rodriguez (Oscar Nuñez) as a liaison with the authorities and buying the properties in Emerald Bay to become its owner. When Rodriguez is murdered by Leeds, Mitch starts his own investigation of the suspicious death and the Huntley Club but Police Sgt. Ellerbee (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), who has a beef with Mitch, does not give any attention and claims that Mitch does not have jurisdiction off the beach. But Mitch does not stop and finds how the drug comes to the Bay.

""Baywatch"" was a successful television series from the late 80's and 90's that I have never seen. ""Baywatch"" (2017) is a kind of weak tribute to this series with a cameo of the original lead cast (David Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson). Unfortunately, the lame screenplay and storyline do not help the cast. Sgt. Ellerbee is a ridiculous character with his beef with the Baywatch team. Why did Mitch not tell the FBI his findings of international drug dealing at the Huntley Club? The cliché relationship of Mitch and Brody is annoying, and the film tries to entwin comedy with crime that does not work well. My vote is five.

Title (Brazil): ""Baywatch: S. O. S. Malibu"""

2.0,25 July 2018,"I went to see this movie because it was rated 5.6! I did not ask myself how bad this can be? 5.6 is pretty decent score, isn't it? If you are looking for a parody of Baywatch then this just might be the right movie for you."
8.0,16 May 2018,"Yes it was cheesy. Yes it was stupid. However, I laughed several times. I would most definitely watch a sequel. Obviously it's not going to win any awards but I enjoyed it!!"
8.0,14 May 2022,"Which never appealed to me.

The Rock works quite well as the lead.

Theres plenty of innuendo which does actually make for funny moments.

The plot is reasonable but how it was dragged into a massive TV series is baffling.

Thankfully all major references to the original are saved till near the end of the movie but when they came, it was exceedingly cringeworthy.

The Plot is far fetched The Script is ok The sound is ok The Photography is ok The Acting is ok

Its a passable watch 👍👎"
9.0,1 June 2024,"""Baywatch"" aims to bring the iconic lifeguard series to the big screen with a modern, comedic twist. Starring Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and Zac Efron, the film follows a team of lifeguards who uncover a criminal plot threatening the future of their beach.

While ""Baywatch"" offers some entertaining moments and impressive beach visuals, it struggles to find its footing between comedy and action. The chemistry between Johnson and Efron provides a few laughs, and the film's self-aware humor occasionally hits the mark. However, much of the comedy feels forced and relies heavily on crude jokes and slapstick.

The plot is predictable and thin, with a storyline that fails to fully engage. The supporting characters are underdeveloped, and the movie often leans too heavily on nostalgia rather than creating a fresh, compelling narrative.

Overall, ""Baywatch"" offers a few fun, light-hearted moments but ultimately lacks the depth and originality needed to make a lasting impression."
8.0,30 June 2018,"I used to watch Baywatch on TV not because it was great drama but it was just pretty clean enjoyable fun. This movie was so far from that. The script from the show wasn't great but far better than this movie. Why do script writers think it is funny to have the f-bomb dropped about 10 times in 2 minutes of dialogue? There is nothing cool or fun about that. Oh then there are the ""dick"" jokes that never stop. They could have made this into an fun and enjoyable guilty pleasure kind of movie but no they have to go and do what every other writer does that remakes an old tv show into a film....they ruin it with an incredibly terrible script and stupid juvenile toilet humor that just isn't funny or entertaining. The only reason I finished this was to see if it got any better. I expect a little better from Dwayne Johnson and a whole lot better from Zac Efron. who I admit was the best part of the movie for me. But every time Dwayne Johnson spoke I literally wanted to puke. Do not waste your time on this movie unless you like this sorta thing and just want to oogle the girls in bathing suits in it."
8.0,5 June 2018,Sorry. Really bad jokes. Tried to laugh and enjoy but just didn't happen. Action scenes were well done but was tiresome and dimwitted. OK to watch with the boys but bring plenty of drinks to get through it.
8.0,2 May 2022,"Before wasting your time though, I would say that you'd have to like this kind of film or it wouldn't matter how good it was because you would still not like it.

As for the type of film it is, it's in the 'Die Hard', Bruce Willis bad-ass kind of action genre. The Baywatch 'family' as they refer to themselves is trying to solve a drug case so that's the basic premise. I normally would never have watched a film like this but Family Guy mentioned that it 'rocked' or something like that and i wondered if they were joking but I think they were serious. I didn't know anything about it going in but I grew up when the original series was on TV and I thought it was stupid which is why I thought this would be the same but it's much better and has good humor in it. So good acting, witty humor, good writing, great camera work, directing, editing, the whole thing is top-notch.

I don't know why it has a low rating here but I guess people were expecting something different, but I think it's unfair to rate a film low just because it's not the 'kind' of movie that you enjoy. As I said, it's very good for what it is."
9.0,16 June 2023,"Baywatch offers a mixed bag of entertainment with a weak plot, a somewhat average acting performance, and the sizzling presence of Priyanka Chopra and Alexandra Daddario.

Let's start with the plot, or lack thereof. Baywatch struggles to find a cohesive and engaging storyline, often relying on a predictable formula of beachfront hijinks and shallow character arcs. The narrative feels disjointed and lacks the depth necessary to fully captivate the audience. While some moments of humor and camaraderie between the characters are present, they often fail to compensate for the overall flimsy premise.

In terms of acting, the cast's performance falls within a middling range. While not stellar, the actors manage to bring some energy and chemistry to their roles. Dwayne Johnson's charisma and comedic timing shine through, providing moments of amusement. Zac Efron, too, delivers a decent performance, although his character feels somewhat one-dimensional. However, it's Priyanka Chopra's appearance as the villainous Victoria Leeds that steals the show. She brings a magnetic presence and a touch of intrigue to her role, showcasing her acting abilities amidst the film's shortcomings.

Despite the weaknesses in plot and acting, Baywatch does offer some redeeming qualities. The film successfully captures the sun-soaked, glamorous essence of the original TV series, featuring picturesque beachscapes and attractive lifeguards. The action sequences, though over-the-top at times, are visually engaging and provide moments of excitement. Additionally, the comedic elements, although hit-or-miss, manage to elicit a few laughs throughout the film.

Ultimately, Baywatch can be seen as a passable, if forgettable, summer popcorn flick. Its weak plot and inconsistent acting prevent it from reaching its full potential, but the presence of Priyanka Chopra adds a spark of intrigue. Fans of the original series may find some nostalgic enjoyment in the film's visuals and references, but overall, it fails to leave a lasting impression.

In summary, Baywatch delivers a mediocre viewing experience with its weak plot and average acting. However, the sizzling performance by Priyanka Chopra and the film's aesthetic appeal help elevate it from complete disappointment. While it falls short of making a memorable impact, it might still be worth a casual watch for fans of beach-centric action-comedies."
8.0,5 March 2022,"The TV display may also be mindless, however, the movie is often a barrage of puerile, unfunny dick jokes. An early scene entails Ronnie (John Bass) getting his junk caught in a timber seaside chair after CJ (Kelly Rohrbach) offers him the Heimlich maneuver - in superb sluggish motion, to nice emphasize the jiggle of her pert buttocks. The prolonged gag, which entails numerous oldsters commenting on Ronnie's imperiled penis, however, feels rehashed from a Farrelly brothers' movie.

In the movie's signature gross-out scene, Mitch's instructions disgraced Olympic medalist grew to become lifeguard trainee Matt Brody (Zac Efron) to investigate a nude male corpse's genitals, which Matt does together along with his naked hands. Mitch, of course, makes this a Kodak moment. Haha.

But wait, there's nonetheless greater below-the-belt humor. In one scene, Matt dons drag to move undercover, searching ridiculous with all his muscle tissue bulging. Efron may generate a grin as he adjusts his manhood in his too-tight dress, however, the hide is superfluous. Moreover, whilst Efron makes use of a girlie voice as he pretends to be his balls speaking to Mitch's balls in any other scene, ""Baywatch"" simply receives downright desperation."
8.0,4 November 2017,"In the 90s, when the original television series was aired, I was just a kid. Then it was too sexy, that I was not allowed to watch. The world has changed so much all these years. I always wanted to see that, but never had a chance. Now a film, possibly a new franchise if it all goes well. There were lots of expectations on it, but the film did not deliver that. Yet they have already announced a sequel.

The bay security team is now recruiting new members. Three joins as the trainee after the tryout. Within a few days, a couple of suspicious deaths happen in the bay. The cops are not worried to solve it, but the Baywatch team jumps in and starts their own investigation. That leads them to a dangerous territory. From there, how they deal with it was revealed with some action-thriller.

Pumped up body, starring alongside a current top star, nothing is working for Zac Efron. He's just an accidental actor, won't survive long, unless he turns it all his way like Ben Afflect did. On the other hand, Dwayne was awesome. All the other actors too. Priyanka was not ideal for such role. Because an Indian in a negative role for an American film, nah, it does not work. India keeps all the thugs and sends only engineers, doctors, scientist et cetera to the foreign lands. A Chinese or a Russian villain works better.

No suspense. Everything was open from the beginning itself. Some of the comedies were good, but some were most absurd. Especially, I did not like the storyline. The Bay security force not doing their job, but police work. It goes completely out of the frame. It's okay doing same within their enclosure, but the film entered beyond that. Thus, the film missed to cover the beach events as what the title had promised. I hope the sequel would fall in line.

But I had to recall my thoughts very fast on this one.. So I'm not sure why this movie is so bad rated by many people, had a bad day, or just taking everything to serious in life? Ok the storyline wasn't a blown away but it was ok , but that's not needed in this sort of movies I think.. It's a light action comedy with very funny humor and one liners. Fact is, I didn't laughed so hard with a movie for a long time!"

8.0,29 September 2017,I truly don't understand all the negative reviews. I guess you have no sense of humor. This to me is by far the funniest movie of the year. The Rock was awesome as always and Zac Efron was hilarious. I laughed through the whole movie my favorite scene was when they were in the morgue. Please don't listen to these boring negative reviews go see the movie and try not to compare it to the original Baywatch this one is is clearly in a whole different League. Im hoping there will be a sequel to this...

10.0,24 September 2019,I have watched this movie again and again....If you don't listen to every word you will miss the comedy. It took at least 2 or 3 times to hear all the humor in it.

Filled with A Beautiful Looking Atmosphere and People Who are in Amazing Shape.

There are a few Corny Jokes though but Overall, A Great Time."
8.0,17 August 2017,"As with all movies with ""The rock"" I must start off by saying ""Don't listen to the haters"" .

Baywatch(The movie) based on the popular/cult TV series is an action packed comedy with a great cast and epic punchlines that will have you gasping for air from the non laughter .

Less than 20 minutes into the movie , you will be rolling on the floor laughing and it only gets better ! The script follows the familiar story-telling of the TV show where you don't need great mystery or detail to create a great story . There is plenty of suspense and plenty of comic relief to keep this movie well balanced and true to the feeling of ""Baywatch"" .

There are many many haters that are slamming the movie for being too vulgar , not funny etc etc . Trust is , they propably expected a 2 hour slow motion strip show to drool over .

All in all , this movie is hilarious and has you crying in laughter with the epic punchlines and trolling while at the same time paying its respects to the original TV series with cameos and a special treat!

Don't listen to the haters . Its an action comedy , and its awesome !"

10.0,24 August 2018,"Is ""Baywatch"" going to win any awards? Of course not. Was it mindless fun that was worth a watch? Absolutely. There is something to be said for entertainment that is light and doesn't aim to be some cerebral think piece. The actors are all stunningly gorgeous, which never hurts. Not to mention, they were all game for the goofiness. I'm not sure why people try to hold this film up to such high standards. It was supposed to be fun! It definitely succeeded. Our theaters are bloated with sanctimonious, pseudo-intellectual excrement. Our reality is full of corrupt politicians, unthinkable violence, and widespread human suffering. Can't we just laugh and act like adolescents for five seconds?"

10.0,10 July 2017,"I'm not gonna lie. I really didn't know what to expect when I entered the theathre. The cast was great, but I wasn't really sure about how solid the plot would be. All I can say, is that it ended up being a pleasant surprise. The acting was great, the plot was full of funny moments, and it had some nice action scenes as well. The plot was well developed, and you didn't really get bored by it. So, keeping it short, it's a great movie, with hilarious moments and great acting. My advice, ignore negative reviews, and give it a shot."
9.0,15 September 2018,"This film is awfully entertaining, was laughing all way through. Would give it a 10, but giving it a 9 since I feel like Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnson didn't take the opportunity to show more of that fine body."

I still enjoyed it tho, the comedy is great, the cast go together well, it doesn't pay much respect to the original series but the series was dreadful anyway so why would it want to.. 🤷‍♂️ All in all its a good laugh to watch, not serious and doesn't pretend to be serious..

The movie is some good comedic moments, it doesn't take itself seriously, it has explosions, fighting, and cutie people in bathing suits saving the day. Enjoy it for what it is. You can tell the cast and crew had fun and it does a great job of being silly and paying tribute to the original source material.

It has bad jokes you kinda like to laugh at, and I think this was actually the intention of the movie, I love that American Pie type of the humor as it relaxes my brain.

9.0,18 December 2020,"This is a good comedy adventure movie, where it shows the daily life of lifeguards and their adventures to protect the beach.

Sometimes protecting the beach from bandits and drug dealers, when in fact the police should play the role.

This movie doesn't have much commitment to reality, at times, for example, one of the lifeguards chases a thug and that thug is armed and the lifeguard is not.

The police also show no interest in helping lifeguards even though they know they are working hard.

That is, if you are going to watch, keep in mind that you must not be strict with logic and reality.

In general it is a very fun and exciting movie. I think it's a good option to see in the summer 😋🏝🌴"

I think this movie is worth a watch despite the reviews"
9.0,17 August 2017,"I'm not sure what reviewers were thinking when they wrote so many bad reviews. They probably didn't watch the same movie I did or simply had no sense of humor.

Here's the thing... Baywatch is not about the Oscars. It's not about great acting. It's not about being focused.

This movie is a parody to the original show and it LIVES UP TO THAT. So, if you didn't enjoy the original Baywatch show, then you will hate this movie. Why even watch it if that's the case?

You don't go to the movies expecting to see anything specific from a movie because you will always be let down. Go expecting nothing and see where the writers and director(s) take you.

That's what I enjoyed about this movie. I read too many bad reviews and saw a horrible trailer. But when I went to watch it, I said f*ck all the bad reviews and let's see what they got.

They impressed me because it made me feel like I was watching a modern day Baywatch plus gave me an action plot line on top of the comedy.

Newsflash: The original show is not meant to be serious or have great acting, it's supposed to be comedy.

So yes, the movie lived up to what it was meant to. Those who expected more, hated it. Those who expected ""Baywatch"", loved it!

That's why I say, don't expect anything and enjoy the ride. Don't try to make the ride go where it wasn't meant to go in the first place."
8.0,7 July 2017,"The movie was an adventure with a ton of action and a star studded cast. Zac Efron and The rock stole the show in this one and allowed for the movie to flourish! It had a very unexpected plot as a movie like this usually follows a linear expected path!

It beat my expectations but that doesn't mean it didn't have flaws."
10.0,28 December 2018,"Funny movie, fun to watch and the most important things is a lot of hot babes"
10.0,2 July 2017,"This movie is great. It really is. Unless you think that the original Baywatch series was an amazing cinematographic experience renowned by critics and fans alike. This movie is fun, stupid fun. It has good one-liners, fun cast and a simple story for simple minds. Just like the show. I can't tell if it's a comedy, parody, or whatever... And it doesn't matter. Just watch it and chill, if you have weed, make sure to smoke that first. Enjoy the acting of Johnson and Efron, look at the chicks and try to ignore the character of ""Ronnie"" completely because it's just embarrassing."
8.0,2 July 2018,"It's Baywatch, not Academy Award winning material. BUT it was fun, lots of LOL moments. Simple storyline, catch a bad guy. But I totally had a good time watching it!"
8.0,23 September 2017,"It was just lighthearted fun, I really enjoyed it. The plot wasn't perfect but it made me laugh, had some great subtle jokes, and was just a good time. Baywatch by nature is cheesy and full of clichés and the movie was self aware and acknowledge it and made fun o fit. If you're in the mood for some care free movie watching this was great."

8.0,6 January 2019,"I really like the film and everyone's acting, story and there should also be a sequel but during one scene in which boat is being burned and they save girls, the VFX they use were poor otherwise film is amazing"

8.0,27 December 2021,"Such a pleasant surprise. In the first minute of the film it became clear that the movie was not taking itself seriously.

Its genuinely funny with Zac Efron stealing the show.

The film should also be recognised for its equal opportunity eye candy lol."
9.0,26 August 2021,"Looking for a really funny movie that is not too serious with beautiful people? This is it. Had me laughing the entire move. Unrealistic stunts and action. Fantastic acting, and the humor lands really well. This movie is so easy to watch, fun and relaxing. Just what you loved about the original Baywatch."
10.0,2 June 2021,"It doesn't have the best story ever told, but you still can have a lot of fun with it. Most of the parts are predictable, but the cast is really charming and does a great job keeping me entertained."
8.0,12 August 2018,"I love this movie..great comedy for the weekend.lots of fun and jokes,laugh my ass out"
8.0,12 April 2021,"Soo funny what a cast , rock and zac so funny , great comedy and action film."
8.0,19 August 2017,"I honestly don't get the negative reviews, I was 13 years old when Baywatch aired and immediately I was hooked and had major crushes on Eleniak, Anderson and Eggert. I watched many seasons back then so I know very well how campy the series was and how 50% of the time useless slow-mo scenes were added, just to fill the story-gaps. I had no expectations at all, the trailers were quite funny but I feared it would be a National Lampoon's or Broken Lizard Baywatch, too much slapstick funny stuff .. Luckily that wasn't the case, the movie doesn't take itself too serious and SFX is almost laughable compared to 2017 standards but frankly : you don't care when watching this movie, you just go with flow and accept its a silly flick about 2 beefcake lifeguards doing many things ordinary lifeguards wouldn't dream of doing (just like in the series). There is NO nudity at all, some dick-jokes, some sexy ladies in a tight swimsuit and the Rock & Zac Efron playing the ""destined to become buddies"" story line. Yeah so what the bad guy (lady) is miscast, Kelly Rohrbach isn't as pretty as she should have been and Daddario wears too much clothes .. Btw, don't expect too much of the cameo's from Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson, its just stupid how they forced in an extra scene for these 2."
8.0,25 August 2020,Must say this movie exceeded my expectations. It was ever enjoyable with lots of funny bits. Johnson plays a good part and it's fast moving to keep you engaged.
10.0,13 February 2018,"I thought that this Movie was very well done for what it was. The cinematography was great, the cast was awesome and the soundtrack - I have to purchase. The humour may not be for everyone, but for those who DO get it, this would be an excellent movie for you."
8.0,2 February 2018,"I enjoyed watching this. It's my humor for sure, might not be funny to everyone but still, I laughed a lot. The characters are dimensional and I liked all the main ones. Some of the dialog however was badly written, and there are a few plot holes and ex machinas. But I didn't go in to this thinking it would be a mind blowing, Oscar-winning experience, I wanted to watch a fun movie with some life guard-action - and it was. Some of the CGI could have been better but it was nicely shot and directed. Would watch it again :)"

9.0,17 April 2020,It is genuinely a fun film. The cast seems to be enjoying themselves. The plot is easy. Actors are eye candy. Film is also self-aware of it's own cheesiness. Fun time for couples and adults who like simple humour.
8.0,13 November 2021,"Watch the movie. Forget the rate of 5.5, that rate only shows that people went too far with 'non-constructive' hate.

This is a great, shallow, funny, quality trash movie. Pure parody, full of easygoing jokes that will keep you make positive comments during the film.

Watch it with friends."
8.0,19 October 2017,"I'm an old white guy and haven't seen the original Baywatch television series or movie. I'm a subscriber to Netflix and requested this movie with a ""what the heck, let's check it out"" attitude. It was very entertaining.

Dwayne Johnson just has something about him that I find enjoyable. I've seen him on Saturday Night Live and he was a great host. People who can laugh at themselves without taking it too seriously are my kind of people. Sort of like Arnold in Terminator.

There is a plot but not really important. The beach babes and dudes are also there but again, not really important. What does count is the absolutely entertaining atmosphere that follows this film. There are lots of jokes and situational humor and I laughed out loud quite a few times.

I thought it was well cast and everyone did a good job. I would give it 10 stars if the plot was just a bit more coherent.

When it's all said and done, movies like this are about entertainment and this movie is very entertaining. Well worth the rental. But then again, I'm an old white guy and haven't seen the original Baywatch television series or movie."
8.0,24 January 2022,"So cheesy but I loved every slow minute of it. I want more Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron buddy movies! This was very much a slather yourself with suntan butter and simmer in the sun, leave your brain at home movie. And it knows it, that's what made it so much fun."
9.0,3 April 2021,Its cheesy because its supposed to be and you can't hate on it for bei g what it's supposed to be Great jokes and made me laugh more than I thought.
8.0,18 August 2017,
10.0,6 January 2019,This movie has so many great jokes. Very funny and the Rock is fantastic as always.
9.0,23 January 2022,"If you're easily offended and can only watch woke humour, then do not enter, go away, grow up and try again later.

Massively underrated comedy that is genuinely laugh out loud funny from start to finish.

Unfortunately lumbered with a huge hurdle of ""can I really watch this, there's ladies in tiny swimsuits?"" Stops a lot of people openly watching this as a comedy film and instead set out to be offended by it before the opening credits even start to roll.

Genuinely funny, Zac Efron's best comedy performance, one of Dwayne Johnson's best movies but he will unfortunately have to abide with the naysayers as it's argument he can't win.

THIS is a comedy film, and a bloody good one."
8.0,12 September 2021,"This movie was filled with Bay Watch nostalgia! It was exiting, hilarious and heartwarming! Definitely underrated."
9.0,25 June 2018,"I enjoyed a lot. Plot is simple (logical for this kind of movies) but te important is having a nice time attending to cinema.

Don't ezpect a work of art but expect a funny movie which is worth to watch it."

5.36,21 November 2023,"""Baywatch"" is a comedy film that satirizes the lifeguarding TV series, which featured David Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson. The movie initially pokes fun at the show's cheesy nature, but then becomes unfunny, highlighting the unfunniness of the characters' roles in solving crimes and plucking bodies from water. The trailers were entertaining, but the full feature was less funny and had a rudimentary storyline. The storyline was created by Thomas Lennon and David Ben Garant, who have written a book on Hollywood screenplays. This added insult to injury, as the movie was not entirely predictable and the jokes were not as entertaining as expected. The movie begins with Mitch Buchannon, head lifeguard of Baywatch, running around his beach, reaffirming his supremacy. Tryouts for positions on his team are tomorrow, and new recruits introduce themselves. Ronnie, a tech guy with a fascination for Baywatch hottie CJ, causes physical discomfort in a long, drawn-out, unfunny ""stuck junk"" bit. Alexandra Daddario's Summer is another candidate, while Ilfenesh Hadera plays Stephanie. The crew is tasked with including disgraced Olympic swimmer Matt Brody, who is joining the crew for publicity stunts and community service. Mitch is not happy about this, but his name-calling of Matt, which includes the sobriquet ""High School Musical,"" manages to raise a smile. The movie introduces the characters and then moves to the next day's tryouts, where Ronnie and Summer prove their mettle, and Matt faces Mitch. The movie introduces an ""are you looking at my boobs"" exchange between Summer and Matt, where the characters are wearing their costumes from the previous day. This doesn't affect the jokes, as seen in the trailer where Efron's character gloats on a yacht deck, saying ""Jason Bourne ain't got nothing on me,"" but is knocked out by a bad guy. In the movie, the line and shot are taken from a tighter perspective, with anamorphic distortion, and there's no breathing room before Efron makes his proclamation, making the line fall flat. For over a decade, Baywatch was largely ignored by the world for lifeguarding instruction, as it focused on the fantasy American lifestyle of sun, sea, and semi-naked flesh jiggling along beaches in slow-mo. The only memorable aspects of Baywatch were the red floaty things they carried around. The film could have been a successful adaptation of retro TV shows, but it lacks the wit and stamina to stay afloat. The story sinks like an overweight tourist who took a dip too early after an all-you-can-eat surf'n'turf buffet. Dwayne Johnson, a decent David Hasselhoff stand-in, delivers a winning mix of comic charm, calm authority, and absurdly pumped physique. He's the king of the beach, respected by locals and fellow lifeguards, prepared for aquatic jeopardy. However, he faces a challenger, former Olympic swimmer Zac Efron, whose formidable muscles are even more formidable than Johnson's but need to learn a bit about being a team player. The film's lacklustre comedy may have been a golden opportunity for the film."

5.36,9 October 2017,"The wife and I had a good time watching it. I wouldn't call it a great movie but I really wasn't expecting much and it was goofy humorous. I assume that was all they intended.

That said, the last comedy I watched was ""Snatched"" with Amy Schumer so maybe my standards are pretty low right now.

If you have some free time and want to see something, I'd absolutely recommend Baywatch. I'm thinking if you are turning it on though, you have a pretty good idea what you are getting into."
5.36,2 February 2022,Lifeguard crime dramedy loosely based on the 80's sitcom. Not great acting and pretty corny at times but worth the watch if you're looking for a entertaining comedy flick.
5.36,1 November 2017,
5.36,1 September 2017,"A great surprise! I am a female so I thought I'd hate this movie. I never watched the TV show. But the characters are funny, or jerks, or good people that you care about as underdogs or just good people. The writers didn't make them so immoral and stupid like most recent comedies that you couldn't care less if they all died 8n the film or not. I will probably watch more than once. Efron and The Rock great as ALWAYS! Dwayne and the perfect straight foil for Efron's comic genius. He's never afraid to be the jerk or goof. Warm and interesting supporting cast members! If this were the TV show, I'd watch it every week because of the writing and cast. Also the music was great and the scenery was beautiful."
5.36,27 November 2018,All you people giving bad reviews need to pull the stick out of your backside and learn to laugh a little bit.
5.36,20 December 2017,"It's Baywatch, it's supposed to be cheesy fun. So as long as your expectations are grounded, this is super fun, well-written, well-acted and funny. It's slapstick, and extremely enjoyable. My only complaint is that it's a little too perverted.

If you are looking for good quality slapstick, then this will satisfy.

If it's a romantic or Oscar worthy movie you're in the mood for, then obviously you probably won't be reading this. But then why all the bad reviews? This movie doesn't intend to compete with Gone with the Wind, etc.

This is on par with Central Intelligence. The Rock is awesome in both."
5.36,12 October 2021,"It's so funny, just don't expect a serious film as this is a spoof like the Starsky and Hutch film. Loads of unbelievably beautiful looking people and that's where the similarities end with the series!"
5.36,19 January 2022,
5.36,18 August 2018,"A brand. Memories of a generation. New version for another. Summer, heroism, action, humor, beach and Zach Efron + Dwayn Johnson. Could hope you more ?Maybe, yes. A sort of innocence and freshness from old times.Less vulgarity and childish jokes can be a better solution. But, off course, it is a nice film."
5.36,17 May 2018,"I had told myself I would skip this movie because it didn't seem very good. But bored yesterday, I came across it on Amazon Prime streaming so I watched it.

In fact it isn't a very good movie but there are a few humorous parts that I found it entertaining most of the time. For a movie that isn't very good.

The TV series was set and filmed on the West Coast. This movie doesn't really tell you where they are supposed to be but most of it was filmed on the East Coast, including Savannah and Tybee Island.

Dwayne Johnson is Mitch Buchannon in charge of the lifeguarding program. They are recruiting new members and one who shows up is Zac Efron as Matt Brody, claiming he already had a spot. Seems he was an Olympic champion swimmer but with a bad attitude. So a big part of the story is Matt's attitude adjustment.

To add spice and intrigue there are some illegal drug operating just offshore and, even though it is not in their jurisdiction, Mitch, Matt, and several shapely female lifeguards get involved in cracking that activity."
5.36,12 January 2019,"As a die hard Dwayne ""THE ROCK"" Johnson fan, I'm very disappointed in this film. Executive producer? Really? Maybe not your best move Dwayne. You really think that you can just become a producer without putting the time and effort in? I don't know who you are anymore. I'm just disgusted. Too many dick jokes in this film too. It makes my skin crawl. I might have to take a bath in bleach when I'm done with this."
