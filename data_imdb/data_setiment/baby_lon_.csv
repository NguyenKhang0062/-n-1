0,0,6.0,7 February 2023,"...and I wish I could rate them separately. The first act of the film is a fast paced tale of innocence cast into a world of debauchery. It's a beautifully shot, fantastic tale showing the dramatized excesses of show business and the people who would do anything to gain entry into that world. 9/10

The second act was a somewhat more tame and methodical tale of the inner-workings of 1920's film production, with the standout scene being the ""hello college"" scene. Out of place however, was the whole tangent around the party leading up to the snake. While decidedly funny, I didn't like the pacing very much. 6/10

The final act was a tricky one, and probably could have been 30 minutes shorter. Despite absolutely loving Toby's character, the little side-quest they go on pushed to already exaggerated ""Babylonian"" theme to to a point of absurdity. It's obvious that some sort of narrative bridge was needed to set up the final scene, but I felt it was overdone. Pitt's character arc wasn't bad, but it lost a lot of steam and I honestly wouldn't have noticed if his character had only been mentioned in the pre-credits sequence. 4/10

If there is one strong point throughout the entire film, it's the use of the dueling saxophone score and quick cuts to drive home the manic energy present throughout the film. Without that score many of the slapstick-heavy scenes would have felt tiresome in an already very lengthy movie. I have a hard time recommending this film to any but the most serious of film nuts, but it's impossible to deny that the bones of a great story are here, they just needed to leave some of the fat on the cutting room floor.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",and i wish i could rate them separately the first act of the film is a fast paced tale of innocence cast into a world of debauchery its a beautifully shot fantastic tale showing the dramatized excesses of show business and the people who would do anything to gain entry into that world the second act was a somewhat more tame and methodical tale of the innerworkings of s film production with the standout scene being the hello college scene out of place however was the whole tangent around the party leading up to the snake while decidedly funny i didnt like the pacing very much the final act was a tricky one and probably could have been minutes shorter despite absolutely loving tobys character the little sidequest they go on pushed to already exaggerated babylonian theme to to a point of absurdity its obvious that some sort of narrative bridge was needed to set up the final scene but i felt it was overdone pitts character arc wasnt bad but it lost a lot of steam and i honestly wouldnt have noticed if his character had only been mentioned in the precredits sequence if there is one strong point throughout the entire film its the use of the dueling saxophone score and quick cuts to drive home the manic energy present throughout the film without that score many of the slapstickheavy scenes would have felt tiresome in an already very lengthy movie i have a hard time recommending this film to any but the most serious of film nuts but its impossible to deny that the bones of a great story are here they just needed to leave some of the fat on the cutting room floor,NEGATIVE
1,1,6.0,7 February 2024,"So I just finished watching Babylon.

I really liked it but I hated it. I was bored but I was entertained. It was an emotional rollercoaster and it was plain like the Great Salt Lake. It was clear but it was confusing. It was happy and it was sad.

OMG what a mess!! Not necessarily and not always a bad mess, just a mess - there's a lot going on in this movie, and throughout this complicated web of moving pictures and sounds comes through a story, I think, but I'm not sure.

The whole movie rests on a feeble script, and that's not good, but there's some decent acting, half-decent cinematography (kudos to the crew for managing to navigate through in tight closed quarters with hundreds of naked and clantily clothed people around) and some absolutely fantastic music! In fact, I rated this movie 4 stars, but added 2 for the score - it's mesmerizing! Just do me a favour and be patient through the entire credits, at the very end you'll hear Justin Hurowitz's New York!

Big budget, big actors, huuuge production, but really not much to write home about. Did I waste 3 hours of my life? Not really, yes for sure. Confusing.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",so i just finished watching babylon i really liked it but i hated it i was bored but i was entertained it was an emotional rollercoaster and it was plain like the great salt lake it was clear but it was confusing it was happy and it was sad omg what a mess not necessarily and not always a bad mess just a mess theres a lot going on in this movie and throughout this complicated web of moving pictures and sounds comes through a story i think but im not sure the whole movie rests on a feeble script and thats not good but theres some decent acting halfdecent cinematography kudos to the crew for managing to navigate through in tight closed quarters with hundreds of naked and clantily clothed people around and some absolutely fantastic music in fact i rated this movie stars but added for the score its mesmerizing just do me a favour and be patient through the entire credits at the very end youll hear justin hurowitzs new york big budget big actors huuuge production but really not much to write home about did i waste hours of my life not really yes for sure confusing,NEGATIVE
2,2,8.0,4 January 2023,"Whether it be orgies, showcasing various bodily fluids, plot threads, or the runtime of the film, Damien Chazelle is fully unrestrained in his latest film. La La Land and Whiplash are some of my favorite films and I'm a big fan of Chazelle's directorial style. He shows flashes of that brilliance often throughout Babylon, but does indulge in his most extreme tendencies as well in this modern Hollywood epic.

There is a lot I liked here. The opening sequence is a sight to behold and had me mesmerized with its vibrant energy. The film chugs along at a good pace for the next two hours to the point I really didn't feel the runtime for most of it. It's the last hour or so where Chazelle loses the story a bit. There were several instances where I thought the film was over, but another scene would pop up next. The runtime really feels unnecessary and there's honestly whole plot lines that could be cut out that wouldn't affect the film.

Justin Hurwitz has composed another terrific score (with some nice hints of La La Land) and the photography, costumes, and production design are all stellar. Outside of some shoddy editing, especially a bizarre movie montage at the end that really did not gel, the technical aspects of the film are quite an achievement.

Chazelle really needed someone to tell him no with this film. Some better editing combined with some self-restraint and this would be much closer to the epic masterpiece status he's clearly aiming for. As it stands, it's a pretty entertaining tale of excess and fame in early years of Hollywood.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",whether it be orgies showcasing various bodily fluids plot threads or the runtime of the film damien chazelle is fully unrestrained in his latest film la la land and whiplash are some of my favorite films and im a big fan of chazelles directorial style he shows flashes of that brilliance often throughout babylon but does indulge in his most extreme tendencies as well in this modern hollywood epic there is a lot i liked here the opening sequence is a sight to behold and had me mesmerized with its vibrant energy the film chugs along at a good pace for the next two hours to the point i really didnt feel the runtime for most of it its the last hour or so where chazelle loses the story a bit there were several instances where i thought the film was over but another scene would pop up next the runtime really feels unnecessary and theres honestly whole plot lines that could be cut out that wouldnt affect the film justin hurwitz has composed another terrific score with some nice hints of la la land and the photography costumes and production design are all stellar outside of some shoddy editing especially a bizarre movie montage at the end that really did not gel the technical aspects of the film are quite an achievement chazelle really needed someone to tell him no with this film some better editing combined with some selfrestraint and this would be much closer to the epic masterpiece status hes clearly aiming for as it stands its a pretty entertaining tale of excess and fame in early years of hollywood,POSITIVE
3,3,8.0,29 December 2022,"After an ""interesting"" opening scene about our main character Manny (Diego Calva) trying to get an elephant up to a party in Bel-Air, Babylon floors the gas pedal and barely comes up for air for the rest of the run time. I wanted to credit Damien Chazelle and his team for providing a unique experience in regards to pacing, setting and tone. The expression ""fever dream"" is overused but Babylon is captured in such a chaotic and constantly shifting way that kept me enraptured. The movie looks fantastic and even if you don't have an interest in this period of cinema, I don't doubt that Babylon will still pull you in. The costuming and sets are dynamic and show how disorganized and tumultuous early Hollywood was. I was hooked from the get-go and for all the movie's flaws, its presentation is vibrant and fast-moving to keep help you entertained.

While Babylon is distinctive with its look and pacing, when it comes to the characters, things are a little more familiar. Conrad and LaRoy are loosely based on a couple of people from that era but the lessons the movie wants to teach us about Hollywood chewing up and spitting out talent are pretty routine. I think Babylon is effective at getting those across but I was a little let down that the movie starts so bombastically and then quietly tip toes into conventionality by the end. Some characters are meant to be less distinctive (Manny is the audience avatar for example) but while I wish they were a little more fresh, I did want to follow them throughout the length of the movie.

Damien Chazelle has enough of a name now that he could probably get any actor/actress he wanted in his cast. He still attracted some big and interesting names for Babylon. I think every member of the main cast did a fantastic job and it's a credit to them and Chazelle for getting the most out of his performers. Brad Pitt's the biggest name and I really enjoyed the work he put in as Jack Conrad. He's appropriately funny in Conrad's lush and over-the-top behaviour but he garners some genuine sympathy for him when the world turns against him. Pitt could have played it so big that he came off as an entitled prick but there's some warmth and passion to Conrad and Pitt gets that across. I've always liked Margot Robbie and she's on point here as Nellie. She throws herself into it completely, there's a surprising amount of physicality and nuance in Nellie's whirlwind behaviour. Much like Pitt, she's really funny when she is given the opportunity to be. Despite the pretty telegraphed arc for her character, you understand why Manny can't resist Nellie even when it's crystal clear she's bad news wrapped in pretty packaging. I would hope that Pitt and Robbie both get awards consideration for their work here. Diego represents the audience, he's witnessing all the craziness and has to go along with it. He's a pretty blank slate but there's enough from Diego that his character is distinct and you understand his motivations. I want to credit Li Jun Li and Jovan Adepo as Lady Fay Zhu and Sidney Palmer respectively. Their characters are written with a heavy hand but both are sympathetic and have their respective moments. The oddest casting is Tobey Maguire as threatening mobster James McKay but Maguire's surprisingly good at being a creepy underworld figure.

Getting to the negatives, Babylon is a movie that indulges in the exact same vices that it's lambasting. As a film, Babylon's determined to show all excess and hedonism of the era in all its ""glory."" I appreciated some of this but there are moments where the movie gets pretty gross (there's an early scene involving a elephant that is going to shock people) and while I get what Chazelle and his team are trying to show, was it really necessary? I'd argue not. Babylon's lengthy run time is also going to drive some people away but it also has an affect on how the story twists and turns. Characters that started out with more depth gradually turn more generic (Nellie specifically comes to mind) and you could have easily trimmed some of the fat off this movie. The total length of Babylon feels a little self-indulgent and while the previously mentioned frenetic pace keeps you guessing, it saps some of the ending's impact. I got what the movie was trying to say with its wrap-up but I can't deny I was bouncing in my seat in anticipation of getting to leave.

Just like the lavish and insane partying that Babylon presents, you have to choose to take the hit of whatever your poison of choice is and dive in headfirst or not to indulge and slip out the back. Babylon is going to be an incredibly polarizing film and while I enjoyed large parts of this movie, there were also many scenes that fell flat for me. I'd grade Babylon somewhere between a 7 and an 8 but I'm rounding up because there are moments where Babylon has some real cinematic magic. I'm not comfortable wholesale recommending Babylon, if you're interested in a Wolf of Wall Street style comedy about the excess of Hollywood in the 1920s that gets pretty dark, check it

4,4,7.0,26 December 2022,"Babylon is a long, messy, repulsive, and magnetic spectacle. Unfortunately despite the great performances and set pieces it doesn't live up to Chazelle's previous work.

The movie wants to bring you down into the waste yard that is Hollywood then pull you out to see the beauty that grows out of the trash. The problem is the movie spends so much time in the mud, and goes so deep into it that by the time it tries to pull you out at the end it's too late.

On the upside the cast are great and almost completely carry the movie, especially Margot Robbie's enthralling performance as Nellie. And as with Chazelle's previous work the set pieces are well executed and (some) characters are memorable.

However, these positives could not completely overcome the movie's fundamental flaws which are -- going too far with trying to revolt the audience (to the point of childishness), not spending enough time with the characters or important scenes despite its decadent runtime, and the ending coming off as completely pretentious in the context of how practical/cynical everything leading up to it was.

In the end, Babylon does serve its purpose as an entertaining spectacle, but like the Hollywood it critiques, its self-indulgence prevents it from achieving greatness.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",babylon is a long messy repulsive and magnetic spectacle unfortunately despite the great performances and set pieces it doesnt live up to chazelles previous work the movie wants to bring you down into the waste yard that is hollywood then pull you out to see the beauty that grows out of the trash the problem is the movie spends so much time in the mud and goes so deep into it that by the time it tries to pull you out at the end its too late on the upside the cast are great and almost completely carry the movie especially margot robbies enthralling performance as nellie and as with chazelles previous work the set pieces are well executed and some characters are memorable however these positives could not completely overcome the movies fundamental flaws which are going too far with trying to revolt the audience to the point of childishness not spending enough time with the characters or important scenes despite its decadent runtime and the ending coming off as completely pretentious in the context of how practicalcynical everything leading up to it was in the end babylon does serve its purpose as an entertaining spectacle but like the hollywood it critiques its selfindulgence prevents it from achieving greatness,NEGATIVE
5,5,1.0,26 February 2023,"Wow. I came into this flick without great expectations so maybe that's why I was able to really enjoy this. This film was very entertaining to me and that's hard to find in todays film industry of rinse and repeat big picture films and the predictable art house and indie scene (which is ironic considering it's supposed to be what's different and boundary pushing). It was big and loud and at times out of control just like the 20s film industry.

The sets are amazing, cinematography is stellar, the acting is amazing and over the top in the right way, and a fitting soundtrack. The story is a bit all over but this film is better if you approach it like a film that is supposed to be lived in as opposed to followed.

I think Babylon is going to be a film more celebrated and enjoyed as time goes by and more people find it. It's the most fun I've had with a newly released film in the past few years. Film is my favorite hobby and it has been since I was a child. I've seen every type of movie and seen them from every era and modern film is the most disappointing to me. There's no magic anymore and it's just plain boring but this was a nice change of pace. It's is a movie lovers movie and it will now be in my rotation and I think it will only improve on rewatched because there is so much in this film that you can't catch it all the first time around.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",wow i came into this flick without great expectations so maybe thats why i was able to really enjoy this this film was very entertaining to me and thats hard to find in todays film industry of rinse and repeat big picture films and the predictable art house and indie scene which is ironic considering its supposed to be whats different and boundary pushing it was big and loud and at times out of control just like the s film industry the sets are amazing cinematography is stellar the acting is amazing and over the top in the right way and a fitting soundtrack the story is a bit all over but this film is better if you approach it like a film that is supposed to be lived in as opposed to followed i think babylon is going to be a film more celebrated and enjoyed as time goes by and more people find it its the most fun ive had with a newly released film in the past few years film is my favorite hobby and it has been since i was a child ive seen every type of movie and seen them from every era and modern film is the most disappointing to me theres no magic anymore and its just plain boring but this was a nice change of pace its is a movie lovers movie and it will now be in my rotation and i think it will only improve on rewatched because there is so much in this film that you cant catch it all the first time around,POSITIVE
6,6,6.0,1 February 2023,"This film felt like it was written and directed by a high school drama class kid with ADHD. It was exhausting to watch, and it was all over the place with too much filler, too many unnecessary sub-plots, convoluted scenes and dialogue, with horrible editing and scene start and cuts. In the hands of better more experienced filmmaker, this could've very easily been so much better and more enjoyable.

7,7,8.0,23 December 2022,"""Babylon"" tracks the career of Manny Torres, an aspiring filmmaker from Mexico who crosses paths with fellow aspiring starlet Nelly LaRoy at a bacchanalian party one night in 1920s Los Angeles. The film also follows several other characters at the same party, including movie star Jack Conrad, cabaret performer Fay Zhu, tabloid journalist Elinor St. John, and musician Sidney Palmer, as each rise and fall in their respective careers spanning the end of silent films and the beginning of sound productions; each of the characters cross paths throughout as they navigate the shifting business of Hollywood.

This large-scale epic from Damien Chazelle is, in a word, ambitious, both in scope and mere technicality. It opens with an utterly ravishing, debaucherous party sequence that captures the maddening spirit of roaring twenties Hollywood, setting a visual bar that is fairly high. While there are a number of fantastic sequences throughout the film, this key party sequence where each of the characters are introduced/first intervene is, without a doubt, the highlight of the film. While its characters are fictional, the screenplay blends them in with passing names of real-life historical Hollywood figures, as well as thinly-veiled references to others.

Firstly, it almost goes without saying that ""Babylon"" is gorgeously photographed. The performances are also uniformly solid. Diego Calva is a likable presence as the centerpiece character, while Margot Robbie's portrayal of the brash and troubled Jersey girl flying by the seat of her pants is comical and poignant by turns. Brad Pitt fittingly plays the drunken but goodhearted movie star, and Jean Smart is also a welcome presence as the curt and astute gossip columnist, ostensibly based on Louella Parsons (or a writer of her ilk).

The film is consciously over the top, at many points capturing the madcap spirit of something the late Ken Russell would have directed. Its first three quarters are particularly outstanding, and demonstrate the realities (and technicalities) of how the transition from silent films to motion picture talkies posed legitimate, career-altering (or more often, career-destroying) challenges for nearly everyone who was part of the business. Chazelle projects this theme to the audience in one memorable and protracted sequence in which Robbie's character (along with the sound man) struggles, fails, is interrupted, and struggles again to perform a simple one-page scene. The nuts and bolts of these logistical challenges in a then-fledgling industry are perhaps the most intriguing components of the story, highlighting just how vastly different (and more arduous) the process was of making a sound picture for the actors and filmmakers accustomed to the established ways.

By the time it reaches its final act, however, the viewer does get the sense that the project is beginning to implode under its own weight to some degree; the focus on certain characters ebbs and flows, and the film begins to lose some steam. It is revived somewhat by an insane sequence in which Torres and another crew member of his film studio (in an attempt to save LaRoy from reckless gambling decisions) cross paths with an eccentric crime boss played by Tobey Maguire, and journey into a subterranean gathering place for the city's debaucherous denizens, who have literally gone underground following the more reserved moral code of the 1930s. The garish and ghoulish sequence feels like a tour of Dante's Inferno (probably quite intentionally), and is almost more madcap than the opening party sequence.

The film grinds to a somewhat abrupt halt as each of the characters' lives and careers face further significant devastation in the last thirty minutes, and the sense of tragedy that one might expect to feel is strangely absent, perhaps because these characters are in and of themselves larger than life, even cartoonish at times; still, I felt that there was an emotional core missing as their stories are resolved. The film ends on a profoundly cynical note, showing Hollywood as a place that metaphorically devours its own, only to be constantly replenished by the unending stream of those who make pilgrimage there, seeking to etch their mark in the tapestry of cinema. The observation is astute, and the implications are splashed across the screen in a century-spanning montage of snippets from the earliest films to contemporary ones.

All in all, ""Babylon"" has many strong points: Mainly its visuals, sturdy performances, and focus on the industrial realities of early filmmaking that most 21st-century viewers would take for granted. It eventually grows a bit long in the tooth into its third hour, and loses some tenacity, but not enough so that the film entirely collapses in on itself (though it comes close). If nothing else, it earns its keep as an ambitious and scabrous love (and hate) letter to cinema. 8/10.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",babylon tracks the career of manny torres an aspiring filmmaker from mexico who crosses paths with fellow aspiring starlet nelly laroy at a bacchanalian party one night in s los angeles the film also follows several other characters at the same party including movie star jack conrad cabaret performer fay zhu tabloid journalist elinor st john and musician sidney palmer as each rise and fall in their respective careers spanning the end of silent films and the beginning of sound productions each of the characters cross paths throughout as they navigate the shifting business of hollywood this largescale epic from damien chazelle is in a word ambitious both in scope and mere technicality it opens with an utterly ravishing debaucherous party sequence that captures the maddening spirit of roaring twenties hollywood setting a visual bar that is fairly high while there are a number of fantastic sequences throughout the film this key party sequence where each of the characters are introducedfirst intervene is without a doubt the highlight of the film while its characters are fictional the screenplay blends them in with passing names of reallife historical hollywood figures as well as thinlyveiled references to others firstly it almost goes without saying that babylon is gorgeously photographed the performances are also uniformly solid diego calva is a likable presence as the centerpiece character while margot robbies portrayal of the brash and troubled jersey girl flying by the seat of her pants is comical and poignant by turns brad pitt fittingly plays the drunken but goodhearted movie star and jean smart is also a welcome presence as the curt and astute gossip columnist ostensibly based on louella parsons or a writer of her ilk the film is consciously over the top at many points capturing the madcap spirit of something the late ken russell would have directed its first three quarters are particularly outstanding and demonstrate the realities and technicalities of how the transition from silent films to motion picture talkies posed legitimate careeraltering or more often careerdestroying challenges for nearly everyone who was part of the business chazelle projects this theme to the audience in one memorable and protracted sequence in which robbies character along with the sound man struggles fails is interrupted and struggles again to perform a simple onepage scene the nuts and bolts of these logistical challenges in a thenfledgling industry are perhaps the most intriguing components of the story highlighting just how vastly different and more arduous the process was of making a sound picture for the actors and filmmakers accustomed to the established ways by the time it reaches its final act however the viewer does get the sense that the project is beginning to implode under its own weight to some degree the focus on certain characters ebbs and flows and the film begins to lose some steam it is revived somewhat by an insane sequence in which torres and another crew member of his film studio in an attempt to save laroy from reckless gambling decisions cross paths with an eccentric crime boss played by tobey maguire and journey into a subterranean gathering place for the citys debaucherous denizens who have literally gone underground following the more reserved moral code of the s the garish and ghoulish sequence feels like a tour of dantes inferno probably quite intentionally and is almost more madcap than the opening party sequence the film grinds to a somewhat abrupt halt as each of the characters lives and careers face further significant devastation in the last thirty minutes and the sense of tragedy that one might expect to feel is strangely absent perhaps because these characters are in and of themselves larger than life even cartoonish at times still i felt that there was an emotional core missing as their stories are resolved the film ends on a profoundly cynical note showing hollywood as a place that metaphorically devours its own only to be constantly replenished by the unending stream of those who make pilgrimage there seeking to etch their mark in the tapestry of cinema the observation is astute and the implications are splashed across the screen in a centuryspanning montage of snippets from the earliest films to contemporary ones all in all babylon has many strong points mainly its visuals sturdy performances and focus on the industrial realities of early filmmaking that most stcentury viewers would take for granted it eventually grows a bit long in the tooth into its third hour and loses some tenacity but not enough so that the film entirely collapses in on itself though it comes close if nothing else it earns its keep as an ambitious and scabrous love and hate letter to cinema,POSITIVE
8,8,6.0,15 April 2024,"An American epic historical black-comedy drama; A story about the rise and fall of Hollywood careers during the transition from silent films to sound films in the late 1920s. The burgeoning era of the American film industry was no less prurient, harsh, or nasty on its artistes than modern-day Tinseltown, which is why the film's theme is interesting: people who are subject to rapid change and exposed to excess, struggle to curb their personal indulgences and suffer for their art in the hope of big success. The tone is provocative and tragi-comic, but in overstating excess in the way it does, too many character stories don't lead anywhere; lavish Felliniesque scenes with their sweeping camera shots and high-spirit music test one's patience in the longer sequences. Also, it doesn't quite capture the period: stage sets, props and costumes look over-embellished. The self-entitled way some characters speak sounds like they belong to the 2020s, not the 1930s.

11,11,6.0,4 February 2023,"It's 1926 Hollywood. The silent movie era is having a party of epic debauchery. Manny Torres (Diego Calva) is the 'Mexican' fixer servant doing all the dirty jobs. Jack Conrad (Brad Pitt) is the big movie star. Nellie LaRoy (Margot Robbie) is the flamboyant nobody who fakes it until she makes it. She makes it and then the silent era ends. Everybody works to master the new sound era.

This is not an appealing start. I don't know what's happening with every Oscar bait movie which insists on an overly broad comedic scene with bodily functions. The elephant is completely overboard. I wouldn't open with that scene. It's an indication of what's to come. This movie is desperately trying too hard.

I guess we're supposed to root for Margot Robbie, but I don't. I find her abrasive and not always appealing. She does find her tragic heartbreaks and that helps her character. This would work better if it concentrated more on Brad Pitt's character. He has some of best heart-felt scenes during his climax. Manny Torres is probably the other main character with a big character arc. I like the character, but the performance is too stoic. I need a different performance from him.

Besides Brad Pitt's character arc, I love the general premise of redoing ""Singin' in the Rain"". It's a great premise that needs a little foreshadowing and less outrageousness. It could be a simple modern day revival with admiring fans watching ""Singin' in the Rain"" to open this movie. Damien Chazelle is just trying too hard. It hits a few false notes and the whole enterprise stumbles. It always gets back up with some very compelling scenes. For example, the first sound shot is fun. I don't like how it ends. Damien keeps pushing the comedy one step too far.

12,12,4.0,25 December 2022,"My main takeaway when I left the theater this evening after watching this film, was that it was far too long and had probably one storyline too many to make this movie fly, but instead after the first act, it drags, and drags, and drags.

The funny thing is, the best moments of this film are within the first hour. The less cohesive and more chaotic the film was, the more exciting it felt. After that point though, the film falls apart, the plotlines stray and the film has maybe 50% of the crazy energy that the first third had. It attempts to try and regain that energy in the finale, but doesn't quite capture what came before it. It turns from debauchery to horror, and it didn't gel well for me. Felt like the tone contradicted itself from where it began.

The acting on the other hand is fantastic. Robbie and Pitt are electric, and the way Diego Calva can emote without saying anything is brilliant. I just wished the script and direction from La La Land writer/director Damien Chazelle was as good as the acting. Sometimes, the film felt like I was watching four films at the same time. Each of these plotlines could have had their own movies and seeing them all jumbled together here felt self indulgent and exhausting by the end of it. Only one of the storylines have any sort of ending that makes it feel justified in it's telling. Afterward, when the credits start to roll, you're just sat there with no feeling for what you just witnessed for a little over three hours.

Overall, I only recommend for people who don't mind the three hour runtime, but keep in mind that the films plot goes absolutely nowhere, and although it might be a fun trip at times, it is a rather pointless one.

13,13,8.0,23 December 2022,"I recently read a biography of silent film ""It Girl"" actress Clara Bow. Margot Robbie, looking more like a Grace Kelly from a few decades later rather than a Bow, plays a character highly inspired. From her blue collar New Jersey upbringing, to a father following her to Hollywood and making money off her image (even opening a restaurant based on one of her famous movies), a gambling addiction, to an off-color joke at a hoity toity part - these are all inspired by Bow and her life.

The film is great as a love letter to Bow, warts and all, played magnificently by Margot Robbie, and just to the magic film can have on its audience, transcending time. It visually details the difficult transition had on the film industry with the transition from silent films to talkies, showcasing actors, producers, and musical performers adjusting to it all. Brad Pitt gives a great performance as a Douglas Fairbanks like silent star edging toward irrelevancy, but newcomer Diego Calva really steals a large part of the movie with his powerful performance.

Great music from Justin Horiwitz (who reunited with his La La Land/Whiplash director Damien Chazelle) with excellent cinematography and performances. However, the film was a bit much at time. Consistently frantic (lots of characters melting down and screaming) and/or stressful with excesses abounding, it was a little much at times.

14,14,6.0,13 March 2023,"The movie is really vivid at times - peculiarly (or perhaps deliberately?), the more vivid the less rich the end result is: the glitter and madness of the backstage shines most brightly when they still film the black-and-white silent pictures. And so is the movie pace and coherency - it's a sharply cut but consistent narrative for roughly the first half of the movie, and then is starts leaping years ahead and the narrative loses much of its meaning and focus. The last part before the ending brings madness anew - but surprisingly a completely different kind, as if taken from another story for no particular reason: those few last characters add nothing to the fact that they were already mentioned, yet the scene goes on and on.

And then the whole message is unclear - from the beginning and the epilogue (and from a few dialogues in between), it seems as if it's an ode to The Cinema, something grand and timeless and ""bigger than you and me"" - but most of what happens inside is about greedy and soul-crushing and disposable nature of the whole showbiz, where nobody's a victim but everyone's trying to get what they want at any cost.

So it's a grand spectacle (half of the time) and a frenetic misanthropy (the other half).

17,17,1.0,9 January 2023,"Babylon is cinematic marvel that Damien Chazelle is a messy, dazzling epic masterpiece that film hasn't yet accepted or had before. Damien Chazelle has called Babylon: ""A hate letter to Hollywood and a love letter to movies,"" but his messy, dazzling epic doesn't support that simplistic idea. Set in the early days of cinema, when talking pictures were a jaw-dropping phenomenon and Hollywood was still being created, Babylon suggests a deeper reality: the film industry's raw, self-destructive, narcissistic impulses and its glorious, magical results have always been opposite parts of the same whole. Chazelle's ambitions are huge. Babylon is full of remarkable set pieces with richly drawn characters, music, dancing, love and betrayal. The film's strengths more than make up for its serious flaws, including too many endings and a wrong-headed reliance on Singin' in the Rain as a touchstone. But if Babylon makes you groan occasionally, there are many more times long, exhilarating stretches that are mesmerising. In one of the film's multiple endings, which leaps ahead to 1952, a major character sits in a cinema tearfully watching Singin' in the Rain. That enamoured-of-movies scene hasn't been fresh since Sullivan's Travels in 1941, not to mention Cinema Paradiso in 1988 and this year's Empire of Light. The fact that the scene can be viewed as a homage to all those films doesn't make it less cliched. And a montage of other movies through history is a bravura but needless coda. At its best, Chazelle's film is a cinematic marvel, evidence enough that movies are magical, as it sweeps us into the beautiful, terrible world we recognise as Hollywood even now. The cast up and down Babylon is amazing and almost eerily in sync with my own tastes. Actors I deeply love, like Taylor Nichols and Ethan Suplee, show up oh-so-briefly as if casting director Francine Maisler had thumbed through my own mental rolodex and said to herself ""ah, here's another face Sonny would like to see."" This is, perhaps, another reason I found myself drawn in by Babylon's excess: I just liked spending time with almost everyone up on that big, beautiful screen, I fell in love with the cast and the story. Believing Babylon to be over, thus missing the last few of its 189 minutes. This was itself a fitting, almost serendipitous, way to end the movie.

21,21,6.0,29 January 2023,"The film starts on the wheel caps. We quickly get to the massive party that the film trailers promised us. And it's masterfully shot, with long takes, masterfully paired music, and explosive character intros. The first discussion between the two main characters funnily reveals the absurdity of the 1930´s Hollywood. But then the movie never recovers to such heights, save perhaps for the sunset-chasing sequence, and the scary underground party moment (amazing bit by Tobey Maguire). The story is weak, the characters are poorly developed (even the main ones), as a spectator you feel like you're hovering above the ensemble cast without ever meeting them. Each character is struggling and fighting against prejudice in its own way (being a woman, being black, being an immigrant, becoming obsolete) but the depiction of those struggles feel botched and cliché. And we never believe in the love story between Manny and Nelly. Once or the twice does the dialogue elicit a laugh, but given the material this could have been way more fun. Finally the ending stretches on forever - by this point we get that it's an ode to cinema itself but the director drives his point so heavy-handedly that he undermines his own argument. A completely useless retrospective of movies from the next 100 years (we're even served excerpt from the Matrix and Avatar) is inserted towards the end - at which point we felt it was over and ready to leave.

23,23,8.0,19 January 2023,"Damien Chazelle's latest opus magnum presents an overwhelming, sometimes indigestible inside look into the roaring 20's of Hollywood, starting with dynamic and powerful montages of Hollywood parties, drifting into every kind of excess you can think of, masterfully choreographed in long exhilarating takes. He shows his various immense talents, which I personally admire since I saw Whiplash, in an almost Orson Welles kind of way, shifting from wild orgiastic sequences into surreal absurdity, drastic comedy, naive sentimentality, tragic moments, jazzy musical sequences change into contemplative dialogue, (f.e. Jean Smart and Brad Pitt playing a touching scene together), but: he never finds a focus about what he really wants to tell. Maybe less would have been more. More focus on a stringent story for example.

Chazelle gives us way too much of everything, but yet too little in the end.

For a few sequences he looks behind the facades, revealing the immorality and brutality, the inhumanity, the racism, the ignorance, and these moments are by far the best in his toxic Hollywood Hommage, which is not as bad as some critics say, but not as good as I personally expected it.

It is a remarkable story following several characters living the dream and the starlight of Hollywood. Chazelle has created a movie that is a love letter to Hollywood not because of depraved parties or preventing talented minorities from becoming stars but from reflecting how far Hollywood has become.

I was amazed by the Oscar-worthy performances from Margot Robbie. She is fantastic and deserves a nomination. Brad Pitt is excellent as well, and the newcomer Mexican actor Diego Calva wow, perfectly carried the whole movie; he had great chemistry with Robbie.

26,26,6.0,4 February 2023,"SIMPLY TOO LONG: There is not enough content to justify the 3 hours screen time, and that's a big issue, it hurts the flow of the story. The opening half hour of the movie for example, fairly entertaining, but too long. How necessary was the cop scene? Opening could be done in 12 mins, not 31! Same logic applies to other scenes too. This movie should have been 1h45mins max.


STRUCTURE ISSUES: There are 3-4 main characters and each one of them has a separate story and takes on a unique series of actions, and that makes it hard to connect sequential scenes properly. Movie jumps from this character's actions to that character's actions, and the structure seems loose to me. Tarantino faced the same issue in Once upon a time in Hollywood and He pulled it off better in my opinion.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",simply too long there is not enough content to justify the hours screen time and thats a big issue it hurts the flow of the story the opening half hour of the movie for example fairly entertaining but too long how necessary was the cop scene opening could be done in mins not same logic applies to other scenes too this movie should have been hmins max structure issues there are main characters and each one of them has a separate story and takes on a unique series of actions and that makes it hard to connect sequential scenes properly movie jumps from this characters actions to that characters actions and the structure seems loose to me tarantino faced the same issue in once upon a time in hollywood and he pulled it off better in my opinion,NEGATIVE
28,28,6.0,28 December 2022,"This film is many things. It evokes memories of other films, and books. This film is Moulin Rouge and The Great Gatsby were those films to be directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. That may sound great but here, it isn't. It reminds me so much of Nightmare Alley from the holiday season last year. A beautiful, and yet bloated, overly long period piece directed by a highly reputable director with fantastic star wattage. It also reminds me of this year's Amsterdam, and again for those exact same reasons.

But above all of those other films, or possibly below, what this film surprisingly, if not shockingly has in abundance in comparison to any of those others, or even the director's previously beloved works of Whiplash and La La Land, what this film has is beaucoup, and I do mean beaucoup, scenes of grotesque vulgarity and unbelievable amounts of foul language.

None of these things bother me in movies, if it serves a purpose or is to be expected given the subject or scene. The gross, nastiness. The bodily fluids. The constant bad words in the dialogue, especially in the first half hour, it seems as though the filmmaker was purposely trying to stun his audience and this seems his only purpose.

I rarely clutch the pearls with movies. My movie date looked at me fifteen minutes into this horrendously long movie and said, ""What have you brought me to?"" It's a long sit the rest of the way.

I'm sure people around the world have simply walked out of the theater having been drawn in my the actors on the marquee and then quickly repelled by the filmmakers choices and lack of self-control when it came to editing or trimming down the run time.

Sadly, amazing cinematography alone, does not make a movie.

Margot Robbie, gorgeous as she always is, doesn't fit the time period.

She's way too athletically sculpted and her hair doesn't fit the era, at all.

Things like that will drive me crazy for a whole movie.

Brad Pitt is always great. Here, he looks and plays his part to perfection.

He's a more extreme and certainly more tragic version of Peter O' Toole in ""My Favorite Year"".

The lone, true bright light of this film, is its ultimate protagonist, Manny Torres played by Diego Calva. He is incredible and captivating in every scene.

This is a tale of debauchery, degeneracy. And destruction.

29,29,1.0,21 February 2023,"What mindless junk this is. Unlikeable characters in a long - MUCH too long - dreary and trashy movie (but not at all in a fun way).

Not one character has any likable qualities and by the end I was hoping a number of them would get killed off. Fortunately a few do.

Best scene is when Jean Smart's character tells the character Brad Pitt plays that his days are numbered. And based on Pitt's very lame and listless performance in this film she is really telling him that HIS days are numbered. What happened to him? He sleepwalks through this like he's bored and just doing it for the bucks.

What happened to everyone associated with this production?

The movie starts out with a scatological extravaganza party scene and ends with an amateurish psychedelic salute to the movies.

30,30,8.0,27 December 2022,"When the movie starts off with a first-person-POV shot of a guy getting showered by damp, steaming, elephant feces, you know the rated-R Damien Chazelle is back, yet this time rather than bombards of profanity, it's the orgy, the indulgence, the ecstasy. The combined usage of long takes, close-ups, and handheld shots portray the environment, emotion, and atmosphere to their fullest extent, exhibiting the directory's impeccable costume design and scenic layout. Despite the film mainly concentrating on the early theatrical industry, Chazelle still managed to merge his favorite jazz component into the storyline, and the overall soundtrack is, though not as pervasive and brainwashing as La La Land's, melodically memorable, ornamenting the flamboyant history with a light touch of sentiment. Plot-wise, I thoroughly enjoyed the individual character's venture, rise, and decadence while interacting with themselves, one another, and the changing world of cinematic art, which I found delightfully reminiscent of Wong Kar-wai's The Grandmaster. However, the introduction of Tobey Maguire's figure and the underground Tim Burton circus is entirely unnecessary and tedious, wrecking the pacing. In addition, the final montage of film segments is overly personalized to the point of being bewildering - in summary, not the best resolution.

I can't help but be amazed by these two mesmerizing characters and their respective performers, so spoilers might be included as I analyze them.

Nellie LaRoy by Margot Robbie, an unstoppable, blazing, and audacious child; like a flame glaring too brightly to be approached, or a gale dashing too swiftly to be accepted. You can see all of Harley Quinn's nerve, Tonya Harding's tenacity, and Naomi Lapagilla's seductiveness in this mysterious belle, as she is meant to be the center of attention. Such dreamlike symbol of talent, vivacity, and desire is afterall human: implied misery from orginal family, addiction to drugs and gambling, and tacit communal repulsion gradually diminishes her light. Although her tragedy is destined, I believe such crucial character deserves a better, perhaps more elaborate, ending than simply vanishing into the dark intersection and announced dead on the newspaper.

Jack Conrad by Brad Pitt, an ambitious, revered, and humorous celebrity; the wrinkles indicate his age that's slow to tidal changes, yet his three spouses younger and younger of age reflect a denial to time. Finally, his continual inebriation is sobered by the critic's censure and the audience's snicker, as the high tower of accomplishment is shattered. In one conversation with Lady Fay, Pitt absolutely defines what Award-winning-performance truly means, as all of nostalgia, melancholy, and relief can be found in his storyful glances and flickering tears - after ""betrayals"", compromises, and youth no more, Fay is still given the opportunity to renovate in foreign land, while Conrad is but a tired shell without purpose. In his ultimate act, Jack leaves all joy to those around him, and chooses to live in the era where he belongs, which is why the gun-held hand doesn't tremble.

Some complains that the film speaks of too much, yet I think it speaks too little of everything, with much blankness to be interpreted and resonated. To the very least, I can imagine myself rewatching Babylon many times in the future.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",when the movie starts off with a firstpersonpov shot of a guy getting showered by damp steaming elephant feces you know the ratedr damien chazelle is back yet this time rather than bombards of profanity its the orgy the indulgence the ecstasy the combined usage of long takes closeups and handheld shots portray the environment emotion and atmosphere to their fullest extent exhibiting the directorys impeccable costume design and scenic layout despite the film mainly concentrating on the early theatrical industry chazelle still managed to merge his favorite jazz component into the storyline and the overall soundtrack is though not as pervasive and brainwashing as la la lands melodically memorable ornamenting the flamboyant history with a light touch of sentiment plotwise i thoroughly enjoyed the individual characters venture rise and decadence while interacting with themselves one another and the changing world of cinematic art which i found delightfully reminiscent of wong karwais the grandmaster however the introduction of tobey maguires figure and the underground tim burton circus is entirely unnecessary and tedious wrecking the pacing in addition the final montage of film segments is overly personalized to the point of being bewildering in summary not the best resolution i cant help but be amazed by these two mesmerizing characters and their respective performers so spoilers might be included as i analyze them nellie laroy by margot robbie an unstoppable blazing and audacious child like a flame glaring too brightly to be approached or a gale dashing too swiftly to be accepted you can see all of harley quinns nerve tonya hardings tenacity and naomi lapagillas seductiveness in this mysterious belle as she is meant to be the center of attention such dreamlike symbol of talent vivacity and desire is afterall human implied misery from orginal family addiction to drugs and gambling and tacit communal repulsion gradually diminishes her light although her tragedy is destined i believe such crucial character deserves a better perhaps more elaborate ending than simply vanishing into the dark intersection and announced dead on the newspaper jack conrad by brad pitt an ambitious revered and humorous celebrity the wrinkles indicate his age thats slow to tidal changes yet his three spouses younger and younger of age reflect a denial to time finally his continual inebriation is sobered by the critics censure and the audiences snicker as the high tower of accomplishment is shattered in one conversation with lady fay pitt absolutely defines what awardwinningperformance truly means as all of nostalgia melancholy and relief can be found in his storyful glances and flickering tears after betrayals compromises and youth no more fay is still given the opportunity to renovate in foreign land while conrad is but a tired shell without purpose in his ultimate act jack leaves all joy to those around him and chooses to live in the era where he belongs which is why the gunheld hand doesnt tremble some complains that the film speaks of too much yet i think it speaks too little of everything with much blankness to be interpreted and resonated to the very least i can imagine myself rewatching babylon many times in the future,NEGATIVE

33,33,7.0,28 December 2022,"So listen... I don't even know HOW to rate this movie. It is so far unlike anything I've seen that I'm not even sure if I should be rating it, know what I mean?

However, I think everyone should watch just because it's a different movie going experience that you're likely to not have had before, and new experiences are always worth having, especially if you love watching movies.

I will say though... something that's not up for debate is the acting in this movie. Regardless of how you feel about the movie, the actors (especially Robbie & Toby) brought their A game to the max. So. Talented!

35,35,7.0,29 December 2022,"This would make a good companion piece with Mulholland Drive. Intense, extreme, funny at times, with some moments from the actors, but the movie is so scattered that the characters feel one-dimensional, slaves to the ideas of the film. I did not feel it dragged, though; it has enough energy to keep up the momentum. The main problem is it that is too scattered, and the audience doesn't connect or really relate to any particular character.

Margot Robbie definitely comes off the best, Brad Pitt does well but doesn't bring much more to role than other actors playing similar characters -- the male star struggling with the transition from silent to talkie films. Diego Calva as Manny obviously has the most historically relevant role, but I didn't care much for his acting. Tobey Maguire probably makes the strongest impression here, giving off Nosferatu vibes. One thing this film does a good job is not showing preference to its white cast. The white cast is not portrayed more significantly, with less value/importance, than the non-white cast. Babylon shows how Hollywood chews and spits out anyone and everyone.

This is definitely a love it or hate it film. Despite its flaws, it was worth watching, and I'll watch it again. My daughter loved it, but she is very open-minded when it comes to films she can handle and enjoys darker films. An older couple sitting a few seats down from us actually left the theater an hour into it. The ending took on a suprise abstract quality with a sequence about film with a little bit of a 2001 Space Odyssey vibe (when Dave Bowman goes through the monolith)...that is probably the best moment of the film, when it doesn't try to shock but actually steps out of the narrative structure of the film as far as it can go. I could have done without the Avatar moment, but I understood the point of it.

Overall, a worthwhile film! However, it doesn't do justice to its talented actors, though, (again, Tobey Maguire was the exception for me -- he puts a lot into the screen time he has, and this is the most I've enjoyed him since Spider-Man 2 -- although he was also my favorite part of Spider-Man No Way Home), and therefore it doesn't really give an opening for the audience to care too much about happens to them. The more obscene parts of the film end up being what the audience will remember versus the more poignant ones, unfortunately. For the money spent on this film, it should have been more accessible to an audience; there is really no audience for it. But that doesn't mean it's not an interesting film.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",this would make a good companion piece with mulholland drive intense extreme funny at times with some moments from the actors but the movie is so scattered that the characters feel onedimensional slaves to the ideas of the film i did not feel it dragged though it has enough energy to keep up the momentum the main problem is it that is too scattered and the audience doesnt connect or really relate to any particular character margot robbie definitely comes off the best brad pitt does well but doesnt bring much more to role than other actors playing similar characters the male star struggling with the transition from silent to talkie films diego calva as manny obviously has the most historically relevant role but i didnt care much for his acting tobey maguire probably makes the strongest impression here giving off nosferatu vibes one thing this film does a good job is not showing preference to its white cast the white cast is not portrayed more significantly with less valueimportance than the nonwhite cast babylon shows how hollywood chews and spits out anyone and everyone this is definitely a love it or hate it film despite its flaws it was worth watching and ill watch it again my daughter loved it but she is very openminded when it comes to films she can handle and enjoys darker films an older couple sitting a few seats down from us actually left the theater an hour into it the ending took on a suprise abstract quality with a sequence about film with a little bit of a space odyssey vibe when dave bowman goes through the monoliththat is probably the best moment of the film when it doesnt try to shock but actually steps out of the narrative structure of the film as far as it can go i could have done without the avatar moment but i understood the point of it overall a worthwhile film however it doesnt do justice to its talented actors though again tobey maguire was the exception for me he puts a lot into the screen time he has and this is the most ive enjoyed him since spiderman although he was also my favorite part of spiderman no way home and therefore it doesnt really give an opening for the audience to care too much about happens to them the more obscene parts of the film end up being what the audience will remember versus the more poignant ones unfortunately for the money spent on this film it should have been more accessible to an audience there is really no audience for it but that doesnt mean its not an interesting film,POSITIVE
36,36,1.0,30 December 2022,"I had rock-bottom expectations when walking in to see ""Babylon."" With mediocre reviews from audiences and critics alike, I assumed that this film would be a bloated, lengthy, and pretentious cinematic experiment from director Damien Chazelle; imagine my surprise, however, when ""Babylon"" turned out to be a rather gripping film about early Hollywood and the transition from silent film to talkies.

""Babylon"" is a good - no, a great - movie. At once a criticism of early Hollywood as well a celebration of film, this picture isn't afraid to depict to audiences the excessive, disgusting, and gratuitous lifestyle of the rich and famous during the roaring 20s while simultaneously addressing the fact that movies play an integral and essential role in the lives of millions of people. Art requires pain, the movie seems to say, and pain plays a major part in this film; underneath the glitz and glamor that many seem to covet and yearn for - indeed, that many seem to associate with movie stars - ""Babylon"" depicts the seedy underbelly of early moviemaking. From extras getting wounded during filming to crew members dying on set, from the excessive use of drugs and alcohol that would make even Tony Montana blush to the even more illegal proclivities that people had a taste for (a shame that one Chris Hansen wasn't around during the time period), this movie at once disgusts its audience while also planting the wondrous, rapturous seed of the undeniable euphoria of movie magic.

I've seen many reviews mention that ""Babylon"" seems to portray its excess in a positive, entertaining light, and that couldn't be farther from the truth; the opening party sequence plays out more like a nightmare than anything. With the scene drenched in a hellish red and accompanied by an overbearing, overloud percussive score, party-goers drink to excess, hire young girls to urinate on them, dive out of the way of a stampeding elephant, and choke to death on their own vomit from heroin overdoses. It's not a glamorous look at old Hollywood, but from the stories I've heard and read, it seems to be a somewhat accurate depiction of the lawless, wild-west-esque roaring 20s. And I, for one, found it endlessly fascinating. While being repelled by what I was seeing on screen, Margot Robbie's character, Nellie LaRoy, seems to be entranced; she dances across the room as if hypnotized or under a spell, and once she catches the eye of some big-wigs who need a backup actress in a pinch, her descent into Hollywood Hell begins.

""Babylon"" is truly about Hollywood during the transition from silent films to talkies, and the toll this transition took on both stars and studios. If you aren't interesting in this, then you're most likely going to hate this movie, but if Hollywood history is fascinating to you, then you're probably going to love this movie. There are so many interesting sequences that give you a (dramatized) look at behind the scenes shenanigans - from the deafening chaos of filming a silent film to the pin-drop silence that was necessary when creating a talkie, ""Babylon"" waves a magnifying glass at a point in history that has previously been touted as a golden age in American civility. So, you'll get a little tour of history while simultaneously following Nellie's rise into movie stardom.

Margot Robbie fans rejoice, because she is truly Oscar-worthy here - I mean, I don't think i can name a better performance this year. Brad Pitt and Diego Calva are also standouts, and luckily, each share an abundant amount of screen time. Each of their stories are interesting individually, and once their paths cross, the movie really begins to pick up steam, culminating in a razor-edge conclusion featuring Tobey Maguire in a role so menacing that the Joker would be alarmed. And while ""Babylon"" can get excessive in its storytelling, what with its large cast of characters and plot lines, it works for the story director Damien Chazelle is trying to tell. Directed and edited with pinpoint accuracy, Damien directs Babylon like a thriller, which at times it is, though for a large majority of its over three-hour running time, the movie is simply a historical drama. But because of this stylistic decision, Chazelle ensures that this movie is never boring - I did not feel the length at all, and I honestly could've watched a longer cut.

""Babylon"" is a really good movie - for film and history buffs alike, there is a lot to offer here, and off the top of my head, I can't think of a movie I enjoyed more than this one in 2022. If you're at all interested in old Hollywood, you owe it to yourself to give this a watch, and I cannot wait to go see this again.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",i had rockbottom expectations when walking in to see babylon with mediocre reviews from audiences and critics alike i assumed that this film would be a bloated lengthy and pretentious cinematic experiment from director damien chazelle imagine my surprise however when babylon turned out to be a rather gripping film about early hollywood and the transition from silent film to talkies babylon is a good no a great movie at once a criticism of early hollywood as well a celebration of film this picture isnt afraid to depict to audiences the excessive disgusting and gratuitous lifestyle of the rich and famous during the roaring s while simultaneously addressing the fact that movies play an integral and essential role in the lives of millions of people art requires pain the movie seems to say and pain plays a major part in this film underneath the glitz and glamor that many seem to covet and yearn for indeed that many seem to associate with movie stars babylon depicts the seedy underbelly of early moviemaking from extras getting wounded during filming to crew members dying on set from the excessive use of drugs and alcohol that would make even tony montana blush to the even more illegal proclivities that people had a taste for a shame that one chris hansen wasnt around during the time period this movie at once disgusts its audience while also planting the wondrous rapturous seed of the undeniable euphoria of movie magic ive seen many reviews mention that babylon seems to portray its excess in a positive entertaining light and that couldnt be farther from the truth the opening party sequence plays out more like a nightmare than anything with the scene drenched in a hellish red and accompanied by an overbearing overloud percussive score partygoers drink to excess hire young girls to urinate on them dive out of the way of a stampeding elephant and choke to death on their own vomit from heroin overdoses its not a glamorous look at old hollywood but from the stories ive heard and read it seems to be a somewhat accurate depiction of the lawless wildwestesque roaring s and i for one found it endlessly fascinating while being repelled by what i was seeing on screen margot robbies character nellie laroy seems to be entranced she dances across the room as if hypnotized or under a spell and once she catches the eye of some bigwigs who need a backup actress in a pinch her descent into hollywood hell begins babylon is truly about hollywood during the transition from silent films to talkies and the toll this transition took on both stars and studios if you arent interesting in this then youre most likely going to hate this movie but if hollywood history is fascinating to you then youre probably going to love this movie there are so many interesting sequences that give you a dramatized look at behind the scenes shenanigans from the deafening chaos of filming a silent film to the pindrop silence that was necessary when creating a talkie babylon waves a magnifying glass at a point in history that has previously been touted as a golden age in american civility so youll get a little tour of history while simultaneously following nellies rise into movie stardom margot robbie fans rejoice because she is truly oscarworthy here i mean i dont think i can name a better performance this year brad pitt and diego calva are also standouts and luckily each share an abundant amount of screen time each of their stories are interesting individually and once their paths cross the movie really begins to pick up steam culminating in a razoredge conclusion featuring tobey maguire in a role so menacing that the joker would be alarmed and while babylon can get excessive in its storytelling what with its large cast of characters and plot lines it works for the story director damien chazelle is trying to tell directed and edited with pinpoint accuracy damien directs babylon like a thriller which at times it is though for a large majority of its over threehour running time the movie is simply a historical drama but because of this stylistic decision chazelle ensures that this movie is never boring i did not feel the length at all and i honestly couldve watched a longer cut babylon is a really good movie for film and history buffs alike there is a lot to offer here and off the top of my head i cant think of a movie i enjoyed more than this one in if youre at all interested in old hollywood you owe it to yourself to give this a watch and i cannot wait to go see this again,POSITIVE
37,37,6.0,25 January 2023,"Must admit, was looking forward to seeing this film, simply because of the star cast.. however, I went along, knowing very little about the film, when normally, I would read up about it beforehand. I found it to be disjointed and a little all over the place. I also found at 2 hours that I was secretly hoping for it to start coming to an end.... This is not normally me. I could easily sit through a 3 hour movie, no issue, but some of the film, in my opinion, did not need to be there.

39,39,8.0,24 December 2022,"Personally, I'm a sucker for movies about old school Hollywood. The film is a satire on the transition between silent films and ""Talkies"" as they were called. If you like film as much as I do those moments are too cool. The frustration of adding sound to your movie by filmmakers use to the freedom that was given without the new technology and how this new technology effected the movie stars of the time. There are still some people on this earth (but not many) who completely understand what a game changer sound was to Hollywood and I thought the film captured that Brilliantly.

Babylon had an impressive ensemble cast lead by Margot Robbie. There were a few stories going through the movie and they intertwined really well. Never a dull moment at all, and thanks to the ensemble cast we got to touch on a lot of subjects that was Old School Hollywood. Socialism, racism, ageism, sexism. An all across the broad look just showing you how it was

And speaking of never a dull moment, going into this, I thought this movie was just going to be about a Hollywood party (technically, you can say the movie is about keeping the party going). The movie is long but it worth it because those scenes where they showed you how Hollywood Partied almost 100 years ago. You could never get away with that kind of epicness now.

42,42,9.0,23 January 2023,"Damian Chazelle doesn't make bad movies (whiplash, La La Land, First Man) but much of what I'd heard about Babylon in advance of seeing (no experiencing) it for myself was less than complimentary.

Turgid, overlong, rambling, too strident and lacking a narrative.

Well, in my view, all of those criticisms are both unfounded and unfair, because Babylon is magnificent.

It's an epic story spanning thirty years, beginning in the silent era when Hollywood was in its most outrageous Klondike era.

The talkies would pivot the narrative when Al Jolson's Jazz Singer arrived, but for now anything went and that's where the movie begins in a lavish set piece piece that starts with a scatalogical Elephant episode and culminates, some 25 minutes late, in a drug fuelled frenzy at the end of all parties.

Then up comes the title credit, fully 25 minutes in.

It's jaw dropping and hilarious.

We then see the, also hilarious, growth of silent cinema where anyone with a mind, and a budget to do it, can do it. This is where Brad Pitt (a matinee idol in his final years) and Margot Robbie (a wannabe with talent and gumption) dominate proceedings with Robbie putting in a career high performance.

In the third act the story slows down considerably and assumes a narrative direction before all hell breaks loose in the penultimate chapter (it turns into a horror film, with a stand out cameo from Toby MaGuire, that morphs into a psychedelic episode that Kubrick would have loved, before reaching its Jazzy musical finale.

It's three hours of endless ideas, superb styling, sets and costume design.

In using Singing In the Rain as a central plot device, and theme for the movie's funniest sequence on an early sound stage, Chazelle treats us to his first real exploration of humour.

It's an homage, as the whole movie is, to the greatest days of hollywood. It's a comedy, a romance, a horror and a musical all rolled into one.

And the music. On my, fans of La La Land will enjoy the musical themes that run throughout and are a direct follow up to his first masterpiece.

I applauded the movie as the final curtain came down. It contains more ideas, more vitality, more chutzpah than anything I've seen for ages and I for one hope to see it rewarded at the Hollywood gongs night in the spring.

43,43,7.0,1 January 2023,"""Babylon"" is the kind of movie that most viewers are either going to love or hate. I, for one, am one of those who's squarely in the middle. Writer-director Damien Chazelle's outrageous, pften-hilarious, visually dazzling epic about the early days of Hollywood and the excesses that typified an emerging industry during the Roaring Twenties (and the attempts to rein them in during the increasingly conservative 1930s) tells the stories of a number of rising on-screen and off-screen stars seeking to make their way while wrestling with personal and professional demons, as well as the advances (and challenges) in using the new cinematic technologies of the era. In some regards, I like to think of this opus as one that draws from a variety of vastly different cinematic influences, most notably the curious combination of Peter Bogdanovich's ""Nickelodeon"" (1976) and Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Boogie Nights"" (1997), with, of course, the musical aspects from Chazelle's own ""La La Land"" (2016) (despite the inherently more tawdry - and more engaging - nature of this project). Because of the narrative's extensive breadth in terms of time frame, characters, themes and story threads, it's not surprising to see how this offering would clock in with a runtime of 3+ hours (though there certainly are segments, such as the film's 30-minute opening party sequence, that could have been scaled back without losing anything). With that said, however, ironically, the picture is surprisingly well paced for one of this length, thanks to the vivid visuals, superb production design, and excellent performances of a great ensemble cast, including Margot Robbie, Brad Pitt, Diego Calva, Li Jun Li and Jovan Adepo, along with fine supporting roles by Jean Smart, Tobey Maguire and Eric Roberts, among others. However, considering everything that's been crammed into this arguably overstuffed package, there are some shortcomings worth noting, such as occasionally undercooked character development and a number of visual excesses that more than push the boundaries of acceptable taste for a mainstream film (their inclusion as a nod to the picture's title notwithstanding). Nevertheless, as this release also clearly shows, we wouldn't have the industry that's grown, evolved and matured over the years were it not for the ragtag pioneers of this period, despite their individual challenges and their succumbing to the temptations present in this often-dirty business. In my view, ""Babylon"" is certainly deserving of much of the recognition it has earned, even if some of it may at times seem questionable or misplaced. Either way, there's no denying that this is quite the cinematic rollercoaster ride, something for which movies themselves are often the ideal vehicle.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",babylon is the kind of movie that most viewers are either going to love or hate i for one am one of those whos squarely in the middle writerdirector damien chazelles outrageous pftenhilarious visually dazzling epic about the early days of hollywood and the excesses that typified an emerging industry during the roaring twenties and the attempts to rein them in during the increasingly conservative s tells the stories of a number of rising onscreen and offscreen stars seeking to make their way while wrestling with personal and professional demons as well as the advances and challenges in using the new cinematic technologies of the era in some regards i like to think of this opus as one that draws from a variety of vastly different cinematic influences most notably the curious combination of peter bogdanovichs nickelodeon and paul thomas andersons boogie nights with of course the musical aspects from chazelles own la la land despite the inherently more tawdry and more engaging nature of this project because of the narratives extensive breadth in terms of time frame characters themes and story threads its not surprising to see how this offering would clock in with a runtime of hours though there certainly are segments such as the films minute opening party sequence that could have been scaled back without losing anything with that said however ironically the picture is surprisingly well paced for one of this length thanks to the vivid visuals superb production design and excellent performances of a great ensemble cast including margot robbie brad pitt diego calva li jun li and jovan adepo along with fine supporting roles by jean smart tobey maguire and eric roberts among others however considering everything thats been crammed into this arguably overstuffed package there are some shortcomings worth noting such as occasionally undercooked character development and a number of visual excesses that more than push the boundaries of acceptable taste for a mainstream film their inclusion as a nod to the pictures title notwithstanding nevertheless as this release also clearly shows we wouldnt have the industry thats grown evolved and matured over the years were it not for the ragtag pioneers of this period despite their individual challenges and their succumbing to the temptations present in this oftendirty business in my view babylon is certainly deserving of much of the recognition it has earned even if some of it may at times seem questionable or misplaced either way theres no denying that this is quite the cinematic rollercoaster ride something for which movies themselves are often the ideal vehicle,POSITIVE
44,44,9.0,26 December 2022,"Based on the negative reviews, you'd be lead to believe that the movie is boring and has no plot, whereas the positive reviews discuss how fun the movie is and the involved plot. It's a movie where you may not enjoy the debauchery of fun to be had. If you give up on the movie early, you won't get the plot that evolves as the movie does.

The movie only works if the story is handled exactly the way Chazelle structured it. Like other films with ""no plot"", it's a story of people with no initial goals or major conflicts to overcome. These characters want to have fun and be successful, using movies as a way to get what they want. They take life as it comes, then try to adapt when their careers (mirroring their life) as best as they know how,

If you can sit back, have fun, and let the movie develop as it goes along, then perhaps you can appreciate it exactly how you should.

Or that it was a mis-marketed masterpiece. It is unrepentantly a hot mess, and sorely seeks to be seen as such.

Which is not to say there aren't good parts. The saddest thing about the film is that there is a really, really good story to be told under all the baroque delirium. The performances by Pitt, Calva and Robbie are all strong (the last one being the most over the top, in keeping with the temperament of the film). But in fact, Margot Robbie may be the best thing in the film, as her portrayal is in-your-face yet vulnerable, without being cloying. She is able to give the audience equal reason to fall in love with her, and to be repulsed by her. A subtle line to walk as to not fall into trop-ish characterizations on one side, or the other.

Ultimately, the film could have stood a severe editing. But, to be fair, it wouldn't be the story the filmmaker envisioned, so you have to take the good with the preposterous. Numerous oblique, along with quite direct, references to filmmaking, both in and out of Hollywood, abound. Nothing terribly romanticized, but neither terrifically critical.

56,56,1.0,6 January 2023,"This movie was beautifully real. I felt uncomfortable, heartbroken, disgusted, and nostalgic. I went in to the movie with the intension of observing the art as you would in a museum. I was not disappointed. The shots were beautiful throughout. I was extremely impressed with the framing of scenes that were painful. It added to how tragically beautifully life is. I feel like the people who dislike the movie don't understand how real this movie was. Life is horrendous. Sometimes it's beautiful. There are people who experience more pain in a day than some will experience in their life. From a sheltered point of view this movie would be pointless. It would look like they put everything that sells in a movie. Hence the realness. Everything portrayed in this film has happened to people. Some people who you think you know. Your neighbor, boss, even the people you pass on the street. It would be naïve to assume that the rich and famous are sheltered to every horror we experience.

57,57,7.0,21 January 2023,"Babylon is Damien Chazelle's love letter to cinema, as cinephiles or regular viewers witnessed earlier in the year with Speilberg's ""The Fablemans."" Babylon is flashy, over the top and magical. Set in the hay day of silent films to the eventual monumental switch to sound. Babylon's chaotic opening perfectly denotes a style of film that viewers will witness over its lengthy 3-hour runtime. Accompanied by a jazzy score, quick editing and stylish cinematography, Babylon transports us to a vibrant and lavish world of cinema production in the early 20th century.

At its core, Babylon's run time is supported and even helped by striking and stellar performances. Namely, Margot Robbie and her show-stealing performance. Accompanied by her dynamic range, she delivers the grandeur nature of her character Nellie LaRoy and, ultimately, her imperfections not as an actress but as an individual. Brad Pitt equally holds his ground as Jack Conrad, who exquisitely depicts his character's downfall from a star to a washed-up actor with no future. However, we must remember Diego Calva, who deserves equal praise for his exceptional portrayal of Manuel, who functions as the heart and soul that keeps Babylon together.

Babylon, however, does feel at times a series of ""set pieces"" within a more fantastic story but fails to connect the world and characters as one living, breathing entity. The film jumped from character to character too much, and potentially tightening of the plot, which interweaved them sufficiently (emphasis on Jack Conrad's character), might have reduced the run time and left a slightly better impression on the overall story. Manuel and Nellie's relationship as lovers who wanted to run away together came about too abruptly and even forced. Chazelle could have developed their story subtly throughout the film before its conclusion.

However, Babylon is much more than a story about our characters and their journey throughout Hollywood. Babylon is a message that (maybe too on the nose) exemplifies cinema's timeless impact on us as a viewer, the range of emotions they resonate within us and the beautiful, bitter-sweet memories they evoke. The opening scene perfectly highlights this notion and the pleasure and euphoria cinema can cultivate in us. People, actors and characters come and go and are lost and forgotten, but cinema itself endures and prevails.

Perhaps Damien Chazelle's Babylon is a personal gripe at what cinema as an industry has become through the characterisation of the menacing villain James McKay portrayed by Tobey Maguire. McKay states that anyone will do anything for money, and Chazelle articulates that the loss of cinema's ""true art"" is becoming apparent today.

60,60,7.0,22 January 2023,"I just finished watching Babylon just a few hours ago and I must say I enjoyed it despite its significant flaw which I will mention later. The story does follow our three main characters, two of whom are Hollywood megastars (Pitt, Robbie), but don't be fooled. The true star of the movie is cinema itself and Hollywoods golden years to be precise. Going from silent to ""talkies"" and how that affected lifes. About people who had a dream to create something bigger than life, something lasting that would touch peoples hearts. And of course about those people who truly enjoy movies, the people that open themselves to the experience, who willingly dive into and discover new worlds for a few hours, those who seek to escape, the true cinephiles. If you fit that description I can't recommend this movie enough.

I also really liked the message that I think the movie tries to pass on, that although as they say life imitates art, sometimes art imitates life too. That's when I think people fall in love with a movie or movies in general, when they recognize their own struggles and their own self in a movie.

Now for the bad.. the movie is too long, could easily be cut to half an hour shorter. I could feel people around me losing interest, even heard some complain about the duration, even I despite the fact I was enjoying myself found myself wishing for the credits to finally roll in the last 5 minutes.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",i just finished watching babylon just a few hours ago and i must say i enjoyed it despite its significant flaw which i will mention later the story does follow our three main characters two of whom are hollywood megastars pitt robbie but dont be fooled the true star of the movie is cinema itself and hollywoods golden years to be precise going from silent to talkies and how that affected lifes about people who had a dream to create something bigger than life something lasting that would touch peoples hearts and of course about those people who truly enjoy movies the people that open themselves to the experience who willingly dive into and discover new worlds for a few hours those who seek to escape the true cinephiles if you fit that description i cant recommend this movie enough i also really liked the message that i think the movie tries to pass on that although as they say life imitates art sometimes art imitates life too thats when i think people fall in love with a movie or movies in general when they recognize their own struggles and their own self in a movie now for the bad the movie is too long could easily be cut to half an hour shorter i could feel people around me losing interest even heard some complain about the duration even i despite the fact i was enjoying myself found myself wishing for the credits to finally roll in the last minutes,POSITIVE
61,61,4.0,24 December 2022,"I've seen all four of Damien Chazelle's movies; none has struck me as especially satisfying. This one, all three joyless hours of it, gave me barely a moment of pleasure. It's a perfect example of -- in a phrase often used by Esquire -- ""wretched excess.""

It purports to be, in part, that rather trite creation, ""a love letter to the movies,"" but spends most of its time trashing Hollywood as a pit of debauchery -- a slander that never feels remotely authentic (even though I was raised on Kenneth Anger's ""Hollywood Babylon""). The film titillates us with pulp-magazine fantasies of subterranean caverns outside the city where, by torchlight, jaded Angelenos gaze at torture, rat-swallowing, and other depraved acts. Its cast of characters -- the overprivileged fading film star, the shallow, wildly hedonistic sexpot heroine, the loyal, upright Mexican immigrant, the cynical gossip columnist, the passel of ludicrously snooty L. A. millionaires and their catty wives -- all felt like old cartoons. Even the crowd at the protracted orgy that opens the movie felt choreographed and utterly fake: frenetically cheering, dancing, and gesticulating at times in a caricature of Hieronymus Bosch, the next moment transformed into a sedate, respectful nightclub audience as silent as a library.

I did appreciate the music in this film, as well as the decor, the hundreds of extras, and the constantly moving camera. But ultimately I think Chezelle was provided with way too large a budget and simply squandered it.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",ive seen all four of damien chazelles movies none has struck me as especially satisfying this one all three joyless hours of it gave me barely a moment of pleasure its a perfect example of in a phrase often used by esquire wretched excess it purports to be in part that rather trite creation a love letter to the movies but spends most of its time trashing hollywood as a pit of debauchery a slander that never feels remotely authentic even though i was raised on kenneth angers hollywood babylon the film titillates us with pulpmagazine fantasies of subterranean caverns outside the city where by torchlight jaded angelenos gaze at torture ratswallowing and other depraved acts its cast of characters the overprivileged fading film star the shallow wildly hedonistic sexpot heroine the loyal upright mexican immigrant the cynical gossip columnist the passel of ludicrously snooty l a millionaires and their catty wives all felt like old cartoons even the crowd at the protracted orgy that opens the movie felt choreographed and utterly fake frenetically cheering dancing and gesticulating at times in a caricature of hieronymus bosch the next moment transformed into a sedate respectful nightclub audience as silent as a library i did appreciate the music in this film as well as the decor the hundreds of extras and the constantly moving camera but ultimately i think chezelle was provided with way too large a budget and simply squandered it,NEGATIVE
62,62,1.0,4 January 2023,"Did this movie flop money wise? Yes. However, I thought the movie was phenomenal and had great time. It has been a while since I thought about a movie so much after seeing it and wouldn't mind going right back into the theater to watch it again. This movie is meant for the theater as you can tell with all the sound. The party's music is meant to be played loud and surround sound. The ending is a montage better experienced in the theater. While it wouldn't work as well on a basic tv, the theme of film appreciation was achieved. After thinking this whole movie was going to be a huge party, it themes were shined own, and they were excellent. This film conveys 3 things in a unique and excellent way. One, as I already said, it makes you appreciate film.

Two, it brilliantly conveys the missing the good old day's theme and the mental effect new times can bring on people. Brad Pitts character showed this, and his role was amazing. He had so much yet so little. The deaths in this movie were so random and you could choose if they were funny or sad. Of course, if it was real life, it would be sad, but when you are watching this movie, you aren't thinking about the world and that's a good feeling. The movie also presents political issues but doesn't force them forward anymore. Nobody starts a rebellion or anything huge. This is a nice change of pace from other studios like Disney where they force it. The characters get screwed, and the story continues. You get to choose for yourself how to feel, and you feel sympathetic towards characters.

Three, the plot tells a story about the changing of the film industry. This sounds like one, but I mean something different. In one I meant the celebration of film. In three, I'm talking about the story/plot and the smooth progression of a somewhat historical story. I found it very fascinating how much changed. The introduction of sound into film was more interesting than I would have thought. I loved the scene where the producer's and LaRoy had to adjust to this, and the director had a meltdown. Again, the deaths were so random I didn't know whether to laugh or not, the movie let me choose. The comedy was spot on from the start with the elephant to the ending. A little much but nothing cringe. One last thing this movie did very well was different and not in a dumb way. This was a unique vision and fun to watch play out. It doesn't remind me of other films or of other films Chazelle did himself.

There wasn't one actor I thought that was bad. Brad Pitt keeps your attention and is and entertaining character at the beginning. By the end, he is a tragic character that you continue to think about. Margot Robbie is the best actress out there in my opinion. She constantly goes from crazy to sad. A character starting from nothing seeking grandeur who by the end doesn't know what to do with her life. I didn't know who Diego Calva was, but he was very solid as someone who gets most of the screentime. A character with a bright future and fixation in film who won't give up his obsession with LaRoy. Tobey Maguire was amazing in every scene he had, though they were few. A character with clever movie ideas. Tobey underground scenes were some of the most interesting in the movie and set forward the stakes. My two favorite secondary characters were the director that had a meltdown and Conrad's first director (not sure if those are the correct titles).

The soundtrack and lighting in the film were very impressive. The only reasons I could see it getting bad reviews is because of the runtime and not thinking the R-rated content was necessary. The thought of time crept into my mind, but I had nowhere to be and was more immersed in what was going to happen next in the movie.

66,66,1.0,25 December 2022,"It's the story of the peak and fall of silent Hollywood told through three individuals: Brad Pitt, who seems to be largely a mix of Douglas Fairbanks Sr. And John Gilbert; Margo Robie, who's Clara Bow with a little Jean Harlow; and Diego Calva, who starts off as an odd jobs man, spends some time as Pitt's gopher, and then a producer trying to save Miss Robie's career.

The movie establishes its credential as anhistorical right off by a reference to Garbo as a big star, at a time when MGM was groggily becoming aware she was not just a bimbo they had to take to get Victor Seastrom to leave Sweden. Soon enough, we hear the band at the orgy (more later) playing Tito Puente, a musical score for Pitt's big picture stolen from 1943, and similar effects. Movie-making techniques are those of 1916 rather than ten years after, and Miss Robie's first film sports the trademark 'K' of Kalem, a Patents Trust company that collapsed in 1918. Not to mention that her director is Phoebe Tonkin, at a moment when there were two women directing in Hollywood and neither was in charge of comedy shorts.

Having established my credential as to my ability to spot some anachronisms, I will admit they don't matter in the least, no matter how much they annoy me. As established in the first half hour of the movie, before the credits roll, this is not intended to be reality, but a mythic time. Actors who were shooting the next day did not get blasted the previous evening, fall into bed at sunrise for a couple of hours' sleep, and head over to the shoot. The morning was when they shot close-ups, before a long day's work lined the face. They had to get to sleep early, not attend orgies with elephants. By the time the movie got around to 1927, I realized that this was SINGIN' IN THE RAIN shot as a tragedy instead of a musical comedy, and the assumption was that Hollywood Babylon covered up the real smut of the era.

The rest of the movie confirmed my suspicions. This was intended as a spectacle to out-Demille Demille, and the formula for that is simple: eight reels of people enjoying themselves outrageously, followed by one reel of suffering and redemption. That mythic sort of handling works for two hours, but this one times in at three, as the deep subtext of the film (movies are art!) must be rammed down the audience's throat several times before Pitt puts a gun to his head. Which is true enough, but the long speech given by Jean Smart lays it out plainly. We don't need the movie to continue through 1936, with an epilogue in 1952, fifteen minutes of SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, followed by many clips which film buffs will preen themselves on recognizing.

So that makes this movie.... good. Pitt is excellent as always, an actor who is too good-looking for people to notice his abilities, Miss Robie is fine playing a loon, Calva, who I don't recognize, is excellent, and the large cast is impeccable.

My main complaint about the movie is its excessive length, and the question I ask often these days, whom did they make it for? Not the film buffs like me; not the kids who don't care what happened twenty years ago, let alone almost a century. I'm sure that Damien Chazelle ran as economical a shoot as he could, but there's a lot of money on the screen, and the hard R rating and length will limit its take at the box office and its aftermarkets.

72,72,1.0,26 December 2022,"Given that ""Whiplash"" and ""La La Land"" were outstanding films, it seemed reasonable to hope-and expect-that director Damien Chazelle's new film would deliver. It seemed to be a unique spectacle of excess and debauchery in 1920s Hollywood that would combine flashiness with, hopefully and given Chazelle's previous track record, a compelling story and profound character development. Tragically, however, ""Babylon"" is a bloated misfire that ends up being unique for all the wrong reasons.

Right off the bat, Chazelle brings the viewer along for a ride that ends up being a fusillade of pulse-pounding jazz music, a whirlwind of hedonism, and increasingly sophomoric and eye-rolling moments. This would have all been fine if he had a more coherent story or contextual justification for his indulgence, but alas, he doesn't. After all, some exceptionally well-directed films such as Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"" (or even ""The Wolf of Wall Street"") or Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Boogie Nights"" completely wrap themselves around a crackerjack, virtuoso sense of intensity while simultaneously complementing their own narratives. Unfortunately, ""Babylon"" does not do the same. The debauchery starts to get increasingly tiring after a while when the characters doing it are thinly written (especially by Chazelle standards) and uninteresting, in contrast to better films about excess that keep the viewer wholly engaged over a long runtime. The film's plot is pretty loose and unengaging for a gargantuan 189-minute runtime, which does not help matters much either. The performances are fine but unexceptional, yet even the more talented actors in the cast can't elevate the disappointing and sometimes-pointless screenwriting they've been given to work with. The result is a movie that feels far less satisfying and impactful than it should have, especially since its many moving parts don't really add up to anything. Even the film's message about the ""magic of cinema"" comes off as a bit hollow given that many far better films have dealt with that topic.

I hope Chazelle's next film will be stronger than this one, and something I will be eagerly awaiting. Given some of his previous works, he is certainly and clearly qualified of making great films.

The entire movie felt more like a fever dream than anything. The plot was messy at times where the plot jumped around way too much. I don't really understand the message Damien Chazelle's trying to say other than he has a love for movies. I can see why people are saying the movie feels self indulgent with a lot of the plot seemingly going nowhere, and you really feel every second of the runtime of 3 hours.

Margot Robbie's performance was very good, in fact you can really see her acting range, as well as her acting potential throughout this movie. I don't think I've ever seen her give a bad performance.

This movie is defiantly not La La land, so anyone going in thinking ""La La land"" will be disappointed. This movie honestly felt like an allegory for Hell in some ways. The entire beginning of the film where everyones dancing, getting high, and having an orgy looked like something straight out of a painting depicting hell on earth, or the end times.

78,78,1.0,17 September 2024,"""Just Okay"" perfectly sums up this movie. While it boasts a cast of talented actors, it is ultimately let down by a weak script and poor pacing. The film had potential, but the execution was flawed, leaving much to be desired. It's best to watch it in parts, almost like a mini-series, because sitting through it in one go feels slow and tedious. You don't need to be very attentive to follow the plot, which says a lot about the film's lack of depth or complexity. There's technically a twist, but it lacks the punch it needed due to poor delivery. The script is the biggest downfall, leaving an otherwise interesting concept feeling messy and unengaging. I'd only watch it once, and honestly, I'd find it difficult to recommend. However, I will say the music was a standout-it added some much-needed atmosphere and was one of the few enjoyable aspects of the film.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",just okay perfectly sums up this movie while it boasts a cast of talented actors it is ultimately let down by a weak script and poor pacing the film had potential but the execution was flawed leaving much to be desired its best to watch it in parts almost like a miniseries because sitting through it in one go feels slow and tedious you dont need to be very attentive to follow the plot which says a lot about the films lack of depth or complexity theres technically a twist but it lacks the punch it needed due to poor delivery the script is the biggest downfall leaving an otherwise interesting concept feeling messy and unengaging id only watch it once and honestly id find it difficult to recommend however i will say the music was a standoutit added some muchneeded atmosphere and was one of the few enjoyable aspects of the film,NEGATIVE

81,81,3.0,26 December 2022,"Our love affair with Hollywood endures like the great Hollywood epics themselves, we can't get enough of the inside look at the most influential art form in the history of civilization. Writer/director Damien Chazelle has crafted another navel-gazing potboiler, Babylon, about the early days of cinema, namely the '20's, its youthful energy and its decadence, like teens left on their own with only their appetites to guide them.

Jack Gordon (Brad Pitt) is a middle-aged silent movie star, arguably at this peak but about to be upended with the emergence of the talkies, even though his voice is appropriate for the new world. As in any endeavor, the time comes to retire. Nellie La Roy (Margot Robbie) is the opposite-she's ascending through a combination of stunning looks, performing talent, and pluck. Neither character, like the silent films themselves, can withstand the changes about to take place in this new entertainment.

Chazelle directs his actors at a frenetic pace, like the growing pains of Hollywood itself, such that the orgy opening the film is more like a circus with less sensuality and more mayhem. Everyone is more interested in advancing their careers than experiencing a chaotic moment of pleasure. Babylon shows the cauldron of ambitions and chaos underneath the false facades and flawed actors.

The length, over 3 hours, mirrors the excess of the subject matter. Like James Cameron's Avatar: The Way of Water the audience is tested for endurance whereas in times long ago, intermissions were allowed; exhibitors, unless compensated, were restricted for the number of showings per day; and some shots linger longer than necessary even for art's sake.

Babylon is not for kids, and it is not for casual moviegoers whose patience is tested in physical time and in enduring Hollywood's abiding self-interest. As for the rest of us who find the whole process of filmmaking down to its narcissism worth the hours required, enjoy!","December 23, 2022 (United States)",our love affair with hollywood endures like the great hollywood epics themselves we cant get enough of the inside look at the most influential art form in the history of civilization writerdirector damien chazelle has crafted another navelgazing potboiler babylon about the early days of cinema namely the s its youthful energy and its decadence like teens left on their own with only their appetites to guide them jack gordon brad pitt is a middleaged silent movie star arguably at this peak but about to be upended with the emergence of the talkies even though his voice is appropriate for the new world as in any endeavor the time comes to retire nellie la roy margot robbie is the oppositeshes ascending through a combination of stunning looks performing talent and pluck neither character like the silent films themselves can withstand the changes about to take place in this new entertainment chazelle directs his actors at a frenetic pace like the growing pains of hollywood itself such that the orgy opening the film is more like a circus with less sensuality and more mayhem everyone is more interested in advancing their careers than experiencing a chaotic moment of pleasure babylon shows the cauldron of ambitions and chaos underneath the false facades and flawed actors the length over hours mirrors the excess of the subject matter like james camerons avatar the way of water the audience is tested for endurance whereas in times long ago intermissions were allowed exhibitors unless compensated were restricted for the number of showings per day and some shots linger longer than necessary even for arts sake babylon is not for kids and it is not for casual moviegoers whose patience is tested in physical time and in enduring hollywoods abiding selfinterest as for the rest of us who find the whole process of filmmaking down to its narcissism worth the hours required enjoy,POSITIVE

The film is filled with all sorts of debauchery (especially in the initial scenes and then towards the end). There are also moments of pathos and great acting by the leads. It is a somewhat of a strange film to review - there are parts that are great (including the musical score) and then there are scenes that make you ask WTF was the director thinking? It is also over 3 hours long, so it requires patience to get thru - I would have edited out at least 20 minutes (including some scenes that were probably meant to be funny but end up being disgusting).

83,83,7.0,30 July 2023,"This movie works on the premise that anything said loudly is more cogent than something said quietly. As such this movie is a thrill ride that is surprisingly un-cinematic. It is very acutely visual but it purposefully ignores any kind of meaning or emotional connection. It delivers on the shock value of images to the point where it completely abuses it. And withholds most of the emotion. It's almost a parody of a bad movie. It does and shows everything a good movie shouldn't. Unfortunately it is played straight and therefore cannot be qualified as such. It ambitions to have a grand message.

It wants to be an homage to pre-golden age cinema and also a critique of something. A reverence to the wholesomeness of early cinema and simultaneously a shining light on the excesses. Yet, Babylon is itself oblivious to basic screenwriting and movie making technique. The argument becomes almost moot.

Basic screenwriting suggests that a film should have a beginning, a middle and an end. It should have a recognizable protagonist, the more relatable the protagonist the better. You can have multiple protagonists/heroes, but it's more tricky and you're essentially diluting the emotional core. Traditional technique would be to divide the story in separate acts, basically doing one thing at a time, so the audience can understand what happens at any given moment. You need to know what a character is doing and why, and also sort-of anticipate what will follow. You can adjust the pace to what is happening in the acts to give thing more meaning or emphasis.

For instance, you wouldn't include an interminable manic sequence, without any connection with the rest of the story, where a snake runs loose and bites a whole party in the middle of the desert. With pacing, it is also important to have loud moments followed by quiet moments. When you keep the intensity of the film to a high throughout it is exhausting. You need quiet beats as much as loud ones not only for that reason but also to absorb the louder moment and emotional rushes. If you represented emotional intensity graphically it should be sinusoidal waved curves not a straight line.

More than anything, this film is the story of Damien Chazelle, the fall from grace of a Hollywood wunderkind. It's a tale as old as time really, he broke out with Whiplash, a sports movie disguised as a film about jazz. Then came LaLa Land, which is kind of a simple movie, the plot is subpar and it's rather manipulative emotionally, but it charms you and it works because it's a musical. He is a smart man, with a sense of rhythm and pacing, with a reverence to jazz. He's got a style, a pattern, a signature. Thoses were commercial and critical successes. Hollywood says: We trust you: make whatever you want. You'll have all the resources, access to any and every actors/talent. Go nuts.

In the start it was kind of funny and entertaining. The last part was almost like it shiftet genre into drama. I dont know how the movie industry really was like this back in the 20s and 30s, but if it was like this its definitively one more interesting part of the movie.

But in the end it just felt to long and all I was thinking is that this felt like once upon a time in Hollywood'ish. The ending dragged out so long. The dialog didnt feel that interesting at the end of the movie and I felt like there was no plot. The way the movie ended with an obstical that just came out of nowhere, even if we got a hint of what could come earlier in the movie. It just felt out of place and the way they handled that obstical just felt to irrational to be true.

In my opinion the ending was bad. This was more a tribute to film then storytelling. It was not a bad film. Maybe I dont have the mind to really appreciate this film. I went out of the cinema having been entertained to an extent but also glad it was over. Im also pretty sure I will never watch it again since the rewatch value is pretty low on movies like this.

It's very possible the reason critics weren't as high on this movie as other films of its type were that it went beyond what they were even comfortable with.

He landed a dream cast. Brad Pitt, Margo Robbie lead one of the most talent laden movies I've ever watched. Margo Robbie steals every scene she's in. Pitt's Performance is serviceable, but at times perhaps uneven or uninspired.

101,101,2.0,31 July 2023,"Damien Chazelle's ghastly movie is a bitter attack on the industry that made him a prominent director. Since Sunset Boulevard,Hollywood has perversely sent poison pen letters to itself with films as diverse as Singin' in the Rain, Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?, Day of the Locust, Mulholland Drive, Barton Fink, S. O. B, Inside Daisy Clover, Trumbo and, from the European perspective, Jean-Luc Godard's Contempt, among others. But at least these films had something to say about the business and its impact on the lives of people--famous, yet-to-be famous, formerly famous, and obscure--who make movies, and the fans who watch them.

Babylon adds nothing new. Utterly lacking in originality, it's a mishmash of clichéd Hollywood characters and situations. By laying on revolting excess, Chazelle hopes we'll be too grossed out or bamboozled to notice the movie's staleness, its long past expiration date.

For those who like movies about movies, and the fascinating self-reflective insights they can offer on film-making, whether derived from the above-mentioned gut punches to Hollywood or from more affectionate homages to the movies like Day for Night, Cinema Paradiso, Hugo, 8 ½, or Chazelle's own La La Land, there are only two bright spots in this wearisome three-and-a-quarter hour opus: a sequence showing the frustrations for cast and crew of adjusting to the technical and artistic dictates of sound recording on the set, and a lovely speech that the waspish, but not unsympathetic gossip columnist gives to Hollywood's top star to explain that with the coming of sound his time before the camera is over, but he should be proud and grateful for his legacy that will make him known to moviegoers for generations to come.

These two episodes do not warrant sitting through the torturous contortions of the rest of this bloated film as it follows the fates of several stereotyped characters whom we first meet at a Bacchanal in a studio boss's home. The party is indeed wild but the by-the-numbers staging makes it the most lifeless whoop-de-do since the stilted ""orgy"" in Eyes Wide Shut. Only one of the characters' stories seems realistic, that of the the black trumpeter who realizes, despite his musical stardom, that his potential will always be limited by Hollywood's racial barriers, forcing him to comply with demeaning images that offend his dignity and expectations that distort his artistry.

The screenplay feels like the tantrum of a spoiled kid who didn't get his way at the carnival sideshow, The writing is scatological, rife with one clumsy plot contrivance after another. Mr. Top Star learns of the coming threat of sound from an executive who steps up beside him at a urinal. In another restroom revelation, the wild child who rocketed to stardom learns the studios no longer want her by overhearing people dissing her outside the loo. Shirley MacLaine once told an interviewer, ""I'm much more naïve about this business than you think I am."" Katharine Hepburn was famous for not following the trades. But to imagine the shining stars in ""Babylon"" would be this clueless about what's going on in their world strains credulity.

The climactic directorial blunder is inviting comparison with the zenith of Hollywood self-satire as clips from Singin' In The Rain appear near the end of Babylon. It's as if Chazelle is confessing his failure to capture the essence of vintage Hollywood. Singin' In The Rain's cheerful, merciless skewering of Hollywood's foibles leaves the viewer uplifted with its happy ending. Babylon, in contrast, is a downer--dispiriting, crude and hateful.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",damien chazelles ghastly movie is a bitter attack on the industry that made him a prominent director since sunset boulevardhollywood has perversely sent poison pen letters to itself with films as diverse as singin in the rain whatever happened to baby jane day of the locust mulholland drive barton fink s o b inside daisy clover trumbo and from the european perspective jeanluc godards contempt among others but at least these films had something to say about the business and its impact on the lives of peoplefamous yettobe famous formerly famous and obscurewho make movies and the fans who watch them babylon adds nothing new utterly lacking in originality its a mishmash of clichéd hollywood characters and situations by laying on revolting excess chazelle hopes well be too grossed out or bamboozled to notice the movies staleness its long past expiration date for those who like movies about movies and the fascinating selfreflective insights they can offer on filmmaking whether derived from the abovementioned gut punches to hollywood or from more affectionate homages to the movies like day for night cinema paradiso hugo ½ or chazelles own la la land there are only two bright spots in this wearisome threeandaquarter hour opus a sequence showing the frustrations for cast and crew of adjusting to the technical and artistic dictates of sound recording on the set and a lovely speech that the waspish but not unsympathetic gossip columnist gives to hollywoods top star to explain that with the coming of sound his time before the camera is over but he should be proud and grateful for his legacy that will make him known to moviegoers for generations to come these two episodes do not warrant sitting through the torturous contortions of the rest of this bloated film as it follows the fates of several stereotyped characters whom we first meet at a bacchanal in a studio bosss home the party is indeed wild but the bythenumbers staging makes it the most lifeless whoopdedo since the stilted orgy in eyes wide shut only one of the characters stories seems realistic that of the the black trumpeter who realizes despite his musical stardom that his potential will always be limited by hollywoods racial barriers forcing him to comply with demeaning images that offend his dignity and expectations that distort his artistry the screenplay feels like the tantrum of a spoiled kid who didnt get his way at the carnival sideshow the writing is scatological rife with one clumsy plot contrivance after another mr top star learns of the coming threat of sound from an executive who steps up beside him at a urinal in another restroom revelation the wild child who rocketed to stardom learns the studios no longer want her by overhearing people dissing her outside the loo shirley maclaine once told an interviewer im much more naïve about this business than you think i am katharine hepburn was famous for not following the trades but to imagine the shining stars in babylon would be this clueless about whats going on in their world strains credulity the climactic directorial blunder is inviting comparison with the zenith of hollywood selfsatire as clips from singin in the rain appear near the end of babylon its as if chazelle is confessing his failure to capture the essence of vintage hollywood singin in the rains cheerful merciless skewering of hollywoods foibles leaves the viewer uplifted with its happy ending babylon in contrast is a downerdispiriting crude and hateful,NEGATIVE

103,103,6.0,2 February 2023,"""I'm already a star."" ""Oh? What have you been in."" ""Nothing yet.""

A lot of people thought Babylon would simply be another Oscar-season ""movie about the movies"" but it turned out to be more darkly satirical than that, to say the least -- a love letter to cinema, but a hate letter to Hollywood, to paraphrase the director. (You think you know what you're in for when you see the old-school Paramount logo; before you know it, the frame is doused in urine and elephant feces.) Reviews have been all over the place, ranging from those who claim that this is the movie Baz Luhrmann wishes he could've made instead of Elvis (or even The Great Gatsby) to those who argue that this is just a flimsy emulation of The Wolf of Wall Street or Boogie Nights.

The movie is, in any case, mightily entertaining and it has the energy we've come to expect of Damien Chazelle. There is much to keep track of (some of which is redundant, failing to justify such a long runtime), but most of it indeed tracks.

Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie, Diego Calva, and especially Tobey Maguire give some wild performances, the look of silent films is superbly emulated (specifically the tinted kind, which is rarely paid tribute to in the same way as the black-and-white ones), and Chazelle's ear for music is as exquisite as you'd expect. The score, in particular, is a period-accurate jazz extravaganza and easily my pick for Best Original Score this year.

Of course I also appreciate that something ostensibly anti-Hollywood slipped through the cracks and got a few Oscar nominations, but it does make me wonder why Nope got snubbed. Probably because its undertones were too upsetting (it may have been a comedy, but its treatment of Hollywood's habits of sensationalism and erasure was pretty serious), but it might also have been the Academy's usual anti-horror bias -- and possibly a bit of racist neglect, which bolsters the point of the film, so bravo, Peele!","December 23, 2022 (United States)",im already a star oh what have you been in nothing yet a lot of people thought babylon would simply be another oscarseason movie about the movies but it turned out to be more darkly satirical than that to say the least a love letter to cinema but a hate letter to hollywood to paraphrase the director you think you know what youre in for when you see the oldschool paramount logo before you know it the frame is doused in urine and elephant feces reviews have been all over the place ranging from those who claim that this is the movie baz luhrmann wishes he couldve made instead of elvis or even the great gatsby to those who argue that this is just a flimsy emulation of the wolf of wall street or boogie nights the movie is in any case mightily entertaining and it has the energy weve come to expect of damien chazelle there is much to keep track of some of which is redundant failing to justify such a long runtime but most of it indeed tracks brad pitt margot robbie diego calva and especially tobey maguire give some wild performances the look of silent films is superbly emulated specifically the tinted kind which is rarely paid tribute to in the same way as the blackandwhite ones and chazelles ear for music is as exquisite as youd expect the score in particular is a periodaccurate jazz extravaganza and easily my pick for best original score this year of course i also appreciate that something ostensibly antihollywood slipped through the cracks and got a few oscar nominations but it does make me wonder why nope got snubbed probably because its undertones were too upsetting it may have been a comedy but its treatment of hollywoods habits of sensationalism and erasure was pretty serious but it might also have been the academys usual antihorror bias and possibly a bit of racist neglect which bolsters the point of the film so bravo peele,POSITIVE

-Amazing jazz score by Justin Hurwitz.

-Great acting from everybody, with the scene stealers being Margot Robbie and Tobey Maquire.

-Those montage sequences ""chefs kiss"" (aside from the ending)

-Probably one of the most epic movies about movies when It comes to scale





Bad/meh:

-The ending loses me after that montage. I though that ending It earlier, would have been a great way of showing how great movies are but also showing how people making them have to suffer for it.

-Sometimes the movie is so vulgar that It feels like an edgy teenager wrote the scenes

-It does have some dull parts. Mainly in the 3rd act.

-Li Jun Li's character felt underutilized

-Movies tone kind of put me off guard. The humor can be really over the top so when the movie does get darker It feels like a scene from a different movie

-The snake scene felt pretty pointless for me aside of getting the two characters together.

111,111,5.0,17 June 2024,"Nursing a sprained ankle, I finally sat down and watched Damien Chazelle's floptastic masterpiece, Babylon. Set in the 1920s to mid 1930s, Babylon charts the story of Hollywood's transition from the silent to sound era, but also indulges in the excess: the drinking, the debauchery, the kinks, and the general bad behaviour associated with Hollywood at the time (and let's be honest, even today) and its impact on the screen.

There is a really interesting and fun movie in here, especially for those who love the movies and are fascinated by the history of Hollywood. I think Babylon tackles a lot of interesting ideas, both from a plot standpoint (the impact on technology on film making and its players) and thematically (the feeling of behind left behind).

I also think, despite the film's completely unnecessarily long run time, it's never boring. From the moment it begins with a ""avalanche"" of sorts to its truly out there final scene, which almost feels an extended solo that just keeps going on and on, the movie kept my attention entirely. I did, however, feel it took about an hour and twenty odd minutes to really get going, plot wise and I can't say that's a good thing.

The problem is, I don't think any sane person could tell you Babylon is a tightly constructed, well told story. It meanders and goes off in so many different directions, but unlike Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, which is beautiful to look at and envelopes you in a world and time that you'd kind of want to stay in, Babylon is seedy, gross, and unhinged.

That's obviously intentional, but that along with the zippy editing (especially in the first half) makes this a truly EXHAUSTING watch. I often felt the movie was trying too hard to be shocking at times. There's one scene in particular involving Margot Robbie at a party that just felt excessive to the point of an eye-roll.

The film also doesn't quite feel like we're witnessing events in the early 20th century; there's something about the way people talk, the way they act, and the slang they use that felt distractingly modern. I didn't find the costumes or set design particularly good either and this is one of those movies where you really need that.

I haven't mentioned the performances because frankly, no one really stood out to me. Margot Robbie is kind of doing her ""New Jersey accent"" thing, Brad Pitt is pretty solid as always, and everyone else is fine, but nothing noteworthy. To be honest, a bit more restraint from a lot of these people would've been better.

Overall, I liked Babylon enough, but I'm never going to watch it again. I don't think it's a surprise this movie was a gigantic flop. It shows a lot and touches upon interesting ideas, but is almost too obsessed with spectacle to really delve into the emotional aspects of what's going on. I can admire what Chazelle's doing, but this one desperately needed some editing and script revisions.

The story takes place in Hollywood during the late 1920's and early 1930's when movies with sound were first being made. It begins with a wild Hollywood party where people are doing drugs and drinking and having sex and it really is outrageously entertaining and fun to watch the extreme behavior.

The movie follows several characters as they make movies and sometimes socialize and party. Margot Robbie is truly outstanding and Brad Pitt is also excellent. They both deserve Oscars for their performances.

However, the characters lacked depth and development, making it difficult to form an emotional connection with them. Despite Margot Robbie and Diego Calva's best tries, it was not enough. Brad Pitt was the only character that managed to leave a lasting impression.

The cinematography and music, while good, did not quite reach the level of excellence seen in La La Land. The long takes and practical sets were impressive. The first half of the film was the strongest, as it focused more on the portrayal of Hollywood at the time and less on the shallow characters.

I honestly don't even know where to start, but we can jump off where the movie started, and that's with a giant load of elephant defecation on our face. I know that doesn't sound as exciting as stated, but it's only the start to this wild ride Damien Chazelle takes us on. The movie starts with a vibrantly ostentatious house party in the Hollywood hills, for the first 45 minutes of the film we are watching chaos unfold, human debauchery prevail, and hopeless love unfold. We are then led through 1920's silent film era sets where once again, chaos ensues. This film focuses on the transition from silent films to movies with voice, and touches on the unique transition for many of the largest silent acts of the time. The acting was great, with stellar performances from the whole cast. You can see that the actors were enjoying themselves and playing into their roles, what a treat to watch. My one caveat is the lack of Tobey Macguire, his role was pretty limited for a top billing. I'm going to leave you with this, my homie said it best ""this movie is everything Baz Luhrmann was trying to accomplish with The Great Gatsby.""

121,121,1.0,24 February 2023,"Eesh, I just finished watching this and my eyeballs and brain have been violated. I don't usually write reviews for a film that is so fresh for me but I have never felt this confused after watching a movie. I had zero expectations going in to it but I honestly cannot tell you if it's good or bad! There was a lot of work put into into it and the production value is A+. Prepare yourself for a spectacle, extreme nudity, adult content and mild to moderate violence.

I thought it had a great start-a very in-your-face, bold, energetic, lavish and excessive party. I absolutely loved the the character introductions of the roles played by Diego Calva and Margot Robbie, and I loved seeing Flea with a decent part for once. Brad Pitt was cast perfectly but he could have put forth more effort, his performance was lackluster and lazy (several moments took me back to his behavior in Twelve Monkeys). There were plenty of well done scenes really packed with good story content, but I think it got lost as the show progressed. I was mostly entertained, but also disgusted and sad.

If La La Land and Quentin Tarantino had a baby, it would be this movie. I felt like I was being brainwashed in the last 5 minutes-fast flashing colors and scenes from more modern box office hits with other random stuff mixed in; I don't know if the director is trying to tell us that movies are no longer about acting or what.

124,124,7.0,11 January 2023,"It's painfully ironic to me that Damien Chazelle would choose to package a love letter to movies and the pleasures of movie watching in a 3+ hour film that's completely inaccessible to the average moviegoer and that no one is going out to see.

There's a little taped intro before the film where Margot Robbie and Diego Calva thank us for coming and experiencing ""Babylon"" with an ""energized"" audience. I and the one other dude in the theater with me really appreciated that message.

""Babylon"" has some moments that shine, but on average it's a bomb. It's loud, hyper, and obnoxiously self-aware of its own cuteness. It's also weirdly determined to be disgusting and repellant, which again, who is this movie for? In the first minutes of the film we see a guy get pooped on by an elephant in gory detail, and a second later see a fat dude being peed on at a party. What is with the bodily fluid fetish in this film, and was it really this common in 1924 Hollywood for people to be running around naked?

But this film is only taking place in 1924 in theory. ""Babylon"" doesn't establish any sense of time or place. Margot Robbie's hair and clothes look straight out of ""Boogie Nights,"" which Chazelle's movie spent most of its running time reminding me of to his detriment. Robbie doesn't give a performance so much as an endurance test. She should win an award for toughing through the awful things the movie does to her. The nadir of the film is a party scene that ends with her smearing food all over her face and then projectile puking all over the guests (Again....bodily fluids).

If you happen to find Brad Pitt charming anyway, you'll probably find him charming in this, but he just does his usual Brad Pitt thing, which doesn't do much for me.

My favorite parts of the movie were the scenes showing movies actually being made. They unfortunately also reminded me of a better movie, ""The Stunt Man,"" but they were the only scenes in the film that made me feel alive to it.

In La La Land he showed the sacrifices and choices one has to make to make it big, and the regrets that follow.

Babylon takes a similar course in that it follows three people in their path to making it big in the entertainment industry. Here the breaks are often more about luck than any work ethic, another factor in the road to fortune and fame. Also, rather than just plot their path to the top, Chazelle then examines what happens when they get there and it's not necessarily all wine and roses. The character of Jack Conrad (Brad Pitt) is there to show the career path of someone already at the top, where the only way from there is down.

This theme and plot alone should be enough for a brilliant movie, yet Chazelle doesn't stop there. He throws in a theme around the decadence of Hollywood: after the first 30 minutes or so I thought that was where this is heading, a film about the excesses of the Roaring 20s and how that all came crashing down with the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression.

There's also an element of the ending of the Silent Era and the introduction of talkies and how some actors and producers adapted to the new technology and some didn't. There's also a general homage to films and film-making.

As you can see, Chazelle has already diluted his efforts and focus through having so many themes running through the film. The film still seemed headed for a brilliant ending when Chazelle throws in a plot development which totally derails any thoughts of a great character arc story or profound ending. The movie takes off in a totally different direction, for the worse. It also results in a lacklustre sub-plot that drags on for more than 30 minutes.

Chazelle tries to recentre the film at the end with a scene and collage that is a homage to films and film-making but it by then it feels misplaced. It also feels like a clumsy effort to tell us that was his plan all along but this feels hollow after the detour he has just taken us on.

All in all Babylon is entertaining but wildly uneven. The first 25 or so minutes were disappointing as we see the decadence of Hollywood: much of this seemed put in there for shock value, a cheap tactic Chazelle uses a few times in the movie. However, things picked up significantly after that and until the plot detour the film was great, with some engaging characters, some great humour and an interesting plot. The detour then undoes much of that good work.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",hollywood nellie laroy is trying to catch her first break as an actress manny torres wants to do something in movies anything as he believes filmmaking is the ultimate profession sidney palmer is an unambitious young trumpeter whose happy to go wherever the music takes him jack conrad is hollywoods leading man their lives and careers are about to be intertwined in maelstrom of ambition breakthroughs disappointments changing technology and audiences and decadence written and directed by damien chazelle babylon continues a theme similar to those in previous chazelle films the price of stardom in whiplash he showed the discipline and dedication needed to make it in the entertainment industry and the toll this can take on you in la la land he showed the sacrifices and choices one has to make to make it big and the regrets that follow babylon takes a similar course in that it follows three people in their path to making it big in the entertainment industry here the breaks are often more about luck than any work ethic another factor in the road to fortune and fame also rather than just plot their path to the top chazelle then examines what happens when they get there and its not necessarily all wine and roses the character of jack conrad brad pitt is there to show the career path of someone already at the top where the only way from there is down this theme and plot alone should be enough for a brilliant movie yet chazelle doesnt stop there he throws in a theme around the decadence of hollywood after the first minutes or so i thought that was where this is heading a film about the excesses of the roaring s and how that all came crashing down with the wall street crash of and the great depression theres also an element of the ending of the silent era and the introduction of talkies and how some actors and producers adapted to the new technology and some didnt theres also a general homage to films and filmmaking as you can see chazelle has already diluted his efforts and focus through having so many themes running through the film the film still seemed headed for a brilliant ending when chazelle throws in a plot development which totally derails any thoughts of a great character arc story or profound ending the movie takes off in a totally different direction for the worse it also results in a lacklustre subplot that drags on for more than minutes chazelle tries to recentre the film at the end with a scene and collage that is a homage to films and filmmaking but it by then it feels misplaced it also feels like a clumsy effort to tell us that was his plan all along but this feels hollow after the detour he has just taken us on all in all babylon is entertaining but wildly uneven the first or so minutes were disappointing as we see the decadence of hollywood much of this seemed put in there for shock value a cheap tactic chazelle uses a few times in the movie however things picked up significantly after that and until the plot detour the film was great with some engaging characters some great humour and an interesting plot the detour then undoes much of that good work,POSITIVE
128,128,1.0,23 January 2023,"It's a sort of triptych of stories of Hollywood, this. A tale that starts off with all the excesses and hedonism of the cocaine fuelled, sexually lascivious antics where even an elephant isn't too much for a party hosted by a movie mogul. It's here we meet the three characters who provide the thread for the rest of this maelstrom of a movie. Firstly we have the young, naive, but quick-thinking ""Manny"" (Diego Calva) who manages to attract the attention of the much-married, established and former silent screen star ""Jack Conrad"" (Brad Pitt) all whilst Margot Robbie's ambitious and outrageous ""Nellie LaRoy"" is sniffing, snorting, dancing and generally sexifying everything she touches as she bids to get into the acting business. What now ensues is a really well crafted and thoughtfully entertaining tale of the rise and fall and rise and fall of these three characters and of how their success brings failure as surely as the sun comes up. Robbie is on excellent form, a truly convincing performance as a character ill-equipped for the journey she is so determined to undertake. Pitt, likewise, plays well here. His character has less in the way of shock factor to deliver, but that storyline offers us a rather more effectively stolid appreciation of just how fickle success can be: there, then gone - in what might seem like a blind of the eye. Finally, the aspirational but (initially) more measured, head-screwed-on Calva who falls in love, and ends up trying to fight the inevitable like King Canute! There's a quirky effort from Tobey Maguire, an alligator and a rat-eater; and a rather scene-stealing contribution - especially at the end - from Jean Smart's Hedda Hopper-style gossip journalist ""Elinor St. John"" - possibly the only honest character in the entire thing! It's a pastiche and/or an homage to all things cinema at a time of the gradual emergence and then dominance of sound pictures, and we are frequently exposed to the car-crash lifestyles as everyone adapted, re-adapted, and continued to stay on their toes as their industry and their audiences did not always want to take everyone with them - and at break neck speed too - as tastes changed. It's got everything from Cecil B DeMille to Baz Luhrmann to it, takes a swipe at the pompous-thinking stage theatricals (from the East Coast), the shallowness of the whole industry - and yet, it never loses a sense the these are still people. Human beings! It is not difficult to imagine Kenneth Anger advising on the script - it ""could"" all be true"". Maybe a bit on the long side, it certainly sags now and again - but it's definitely a big screen experience that delivers solid, engaging performances that are not over reliant on - even, rather comically (and dangerously) illustrating just how films were made before - CGI!

Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie were great, but Diego Calva was most impressive to me.

There's a lot of highs and lows in this movie, and Diego is in all the highs.

I wish there had been more of Sidney Palmer's story. His Hollywood journey was enough for a standalone film, and yet his story felt like an afterthought. Tobey Maguire was also introduced too late and we were robbed of a really creepy performance by him

136,136,7.0,22 January 2023,"It appeared in previews as a bit of a looney, quickwitted, party perspective view of hedonistic hollywood and its various staples...ing.

The only entertaining little bits are the few and far inbetween usually with wide-eyed Manny's scenes and even those are mostly ill-fitting in this discombobulated script.

The first feeling one gets is that its written super neurotic, everyone yells, everything is fast paced, everyone is its own island unaware and loud with all at the same time lacking be it wit, humor, depth or anything that would make it more than just loud and adhd.

The second offputting thing are the character where everyone is some over the top version charicature of a possibly interesting character. They just amp it up to 12 and become obnoxious and loud, also everyone lacking any self awarness. Its just hedonism for hedonism sake, there is not thought or intellect interwoven inbetween maybe trying to say or portray something except on the nose visuals that are constantly trying to top the previous scene and so soon losing the edge. No tempo, no anticipation, the director just keep pouring it on.

139,139,7.0,23 December 2022,"Damien Chazelle's newest venture is easily his most ambitious yet, and his most audacious. He throws everything at the screen to the point of sensory overload.

In his film about an age of excess, everything is excessive, all the time. It's often overwhelming and overreaching, but also often smart, funny, and subversive.

When you throw such a massive amount of characters and plot threads into a single movie, some of them will stick and some of them won't. This is the case with Babylon. Peppered throughout this behemoth screenplay are many instances of successfully affecting character-defining scenes and effectively tragic story choices.

But there is at least an equal amount of narrative baggage in the form of themes and characters that make an appearance but never feel like they reach their full conclusion. They comes across as a distraction and cause the film to often feel bloated-especially the third act which overstays it's welcome by about 15 minutes.

Brad Pitt was probably my favourite story line or equal favourite as Diego ( Manny ).

Brad is the big thing, until he starts to fade into the depths of talent and become overshadowed and that's a really good section of the movie.

143,143,1.0,9 January 2023,"Babylon makes up for its convoluted message and unsure direction with beautiful and creative cinematography, terrific acting, and pure obscene ambition. From the very first scene, Babylon makes itself clear of what it wants to be. The disgusting (and hilarious) opening sequence is followed by an even more chaotic and obscene party sequence that both properly introduces the numerous colorful characters that inhabit Damien Chazelle's absurd world, along with showcasing the pure chaos that we should expect throughout the rest of the movie. And the expectations he sets for us are definitely met, because the first half of the movie is both absolute confused debauchery and some the best cinema I've ever seen. However, unfortunately it does lose a lot of steam in the second half, which isn't unexpected, but still disappointing. Luckily, it regains some traction in a third act that may not be as exciting as the first half of the, but still a delivers a proper and tragic ending to an absurd movie.

While the first half of the movie could have stood on it's own without the participation of the terrific actors, I attribute the entire success of the second half of the movie to the participation of the main actors, especially Margot Robbie, who absolutely steals the show. Every moment she's on screen, the movie becomes better in every way. Her performance manages to be both all over the place and streamlined, properly portraying her bipolar and surface, and adding real depth to the already interesting character. From the moment she crashes onto to screen to the moment she walks off into the darkness, the movie is hers. That is not to discount the other academy award worthy performances delivered by Brad Pitt, Diego Calvra, and Jean Smart. Each performance could've been enough to carry this movie, but they all pale in comparison to Margot Robbie.

While Babylon is often inconsistent, one particular story presents itself as a near perfect character arc. While the stories of Margot Robbie and Diego Calvra are chaotic and at times incoherent, the story of Brad Pitt's character is a perfect and sad story of how the biggest star in the world slowly gets left behind and becomes a thing of the past. This long and drawn out trajest serves as the majestic emotional core of the movie.

Now, I've talked about the chaotic story and great acting, but I haven't really mentioned the way it's all presented: the cinematography is incredible. It shifts between long extended shots that portray the disorder being shown on screen, and single camera shots that feel a lot like classic shots from the silent film era. One shot in particular is one of the most mind blowingly beautiful and creative shots I have ever seen.

144,144,7.0,6 January 2023,"I really enjoyed this movie! Not the most conventional way to tell a story, but from the structure it's obvious the building blocks are of a romantic comedy although it ends bitterly. You meet both the characters, then a meet cute moment and just kicks off from there. At times, there can be too many characters to follow but if you're into fast paced story telling, this becomes a strength of the movie as all the stories are somewhat intertwined. Of course could have been better, but I really appreciated the time I spent with these characters. Someone's amusement is someone else's pain theme hits you hard in the end and shows how brutal it is to be story teller. I think it's better to watch this movie in theaters. Soundtrack is quite nice. Don't expect this to be family friendly popcorn flick. The theme can be self destruction leads to destruction? Or failure to do better leads to destruction. Either way it was fun for me.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",i really enjoyed this movie not the most conventional way to tell a story but from the structure its obvious the building blocks are of a romantic comedy although it ends bitterly you meet both the characters then a meet cute moment and just kicks off from there at times there can be too many characters to follow but if youre into fast paced story telling this becomes a strength of the movie as all the stories are somewhat intertwined of course could have been better but i really appreciated the time i spent with these characters someones amusement is someone elses pain theme hits you hard in the end and shows how brutal it is to be story teller i think its better to watch this movie in theaters soundtrack is quite nice dont expect this to be family friendly popcorn flick the theme can be self destruction leads to destruction or failure to do better leads to destruction either way it was fun for me,POSITIVE

146,146,7.0,23 December 2022,"Perfect film that solidifies Damien Chazelle as one of the greatest film makers of all time in my book. To compare his work to the likes Kubrick would be unfair to his unique and vibrant style but I do consider Chazelle's work, while different in substance, to be equivalent in quality.

While the sex and drugs was a bit too much for my taste as a traditionalist, it served a purpose in this warning of sin and usery. It works so well that when I felt disgusted, it felt as though Damien was whispering that this discomfort is exactly what needs to be felt in this film for the point to be understood.

On a side note, I cannot express enough how well this movie compliments La La Land. I grew up in LA, partied in LA, and worked in Hollywood; La La Land perfectly embodies a love letter to LA while Babylon reads more like a breakup text. This is an accurate representation of how so many from LA feel.

The rest of the cast is also great, with Brad Pitt bringing a lot of emotion, and Tobey Maguire giving his most unique performance yet. Newcomer Diego Calva is wonderful and is able to act off of veteran actors perfectly. Even though it's not his best work, Damien Chazelle still does an incredible job directing. The cinematography is gorgeous and the story is very engaging. However I do feel like the film drags sometimes and there are some plot lines and characters that probably could've been cut out to keep the film more focused.

150,150,1.0,5 April 2024,"In a world where the glimmer of Hollywood's golden age fades into the horizon, ""Babylon"" emerges as a poignant exploration of cinema's metamorphosis and the inevitable decline of its luminaries. It's a captivating journey that traverses through the annals of film history, offering a thought-provoking perspective on the enigmatic allure of stardom and the relentless passage of time.

I find myself perplexed by the vehement backlash this film has endured. Admittedly, it does linger longer than necessary, and there are moments where the narrative wanders into the realm of the inexplicable, seemingly crafted purely for the sake of artistic expression. However, amidst these occasional detours, there lies the potential for ""Babylon"" to ascend into the pantheon of cult classics in the years to come.

Margot Robbie emerges as the undeniable beacon of brilliance within the film, delivering a tour de force performance that showcases the full spectrum of her talents with audacious flair. Director Damien Chazelle ambitiously endeavors to craft his own rendition of ""Cinema Paradiso,"" infused with shades of ""La Grande Bellezza."" While the aspiration is commendable, the execution falls short of capturing the quintessential Hollywood magic that permeates through the veins of such cinematic endeavors.

Indeed, one of the film's central criticisms echoes the sentiment often leveled against American cinema in comparison to its international counterparts-the perceived absence of heart and passion. It's this elusive essence that, in my opinion, detracts from the overall impact of ""Babylon.""

Yet, within the melancholic strains of its conclusion, ""Babylon"" imparts a sobering truth: nothing in the realm of cinema is eternal. As the metaphorical casket descends, carrying the echoes of a medium crying out for salvation, there exists a twisted beauty in the illusions we construct to shield ourselves from the inexorable march of time.

In essence, ""Babylon"" serves as a poignant reminder of the transient nature of art, beckoning us to embrace its impermanence while cherishing the fleeting moments of brilliance it bestows upon us.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",in a world where the glimmer of hollywoods golden age fades into the horizon babylon emerges as a poignant exploration of cinemas metamorphosis and the inevitable decline of its luminaries its a captivating journey that traverses through the annals of film history offering a thoughtprovoking perspective on the enigmatic allure of stardom and the relentless passage of time i find myself perplexed by the vehement backlash this film has endured admittedly it does linger longer than necessary and there are moments where the narrative wanders into the realm of the inexplicable seemingly crafted purely for the sake of artistic expression however amidst these occasional detours there lies the potential for babylon to ascend into the pantheon of cult classics in the years to come margot robbie emerges as the undeniable beacon of brilliance within the film delivering a tour de force performance that showcases the full spectrum of her talents with audacious flair director damien chazelle ambitiously endeavors to craft his own rendition of cinema paradiso infused with shades of la grande bellezza while the aspiration is commendable the execution falls short of capturing the quintessential hollywood magic that permeates through the veins of such cinematic endeavors indeed one of the films central criticisms echoes the sentiment often leveled against american cinema in comparison to its international counterpartsthe perceived absence of heart and passion its this elusive essence that in my opinion detracts from the overall impact of babylon yet within the melancholic strains of its conclusion babylon imparts a sobering truth nothing in the realm of cinema is eternal as the metaphorical casket descends carrying the echoes of a medium crying out for salvation there exists a twisted beauty in the illusions we construct to shield ourselves from the inexorable march of time in essence babylon serves as a poignant reminder of the transient nature of art beckoning us to embrace its impermanence while cherishing the fleeting moments of brilliance it bestows upon us,POSITIVE
151,151,1.0,11 January 2023,"Reviews commenting on the busyness of the movie are fair. This is a long movie, with multiple plots, that could have been edited more. However, I believe this movie does a brilliant job showcasing the history of Hollywood. Moving from silent films to talkies, Diego Calva realizes his impact on the industry he was so longing for.

The ending scene, with cuts from other movies later in history (beyond the 1950 scene), brilliantly shows Diego's impact and puts a bow on Hollywood history in a way I have never seen done before. Similarly, the 30 minute opening scene is a spectacle, which fulfills everything you thought you wanted in seeing the movie.

152,152,7.0,16 January 2023,"Babylon is a new historical drama comedy directed and written by Damien Chazelle, director of La La Land and Whiplash.

The film begins in 1920s Los Angeles, a time and place where many people used to party and try everything else to become known in the world. Neillie LaRoy (Margot Robbie) is also trying to break through and with the help of Manny Torres (Diego Calva) she manages to get the attention of people in the film world. She hopes to break through to become a world-famous actress like the popular actor Jack Conrad (Brad Pitt). Only during her time in this world she learns that there can also be a dark side to success and fame.

With this film, Damien Chazelle seems to want to pay tribute to his passion for films and the film world. He also seems to be trying to show with this film how this world has changed in a hundred years. This is also a fun and entertaining film for people who are also fans of films and the film world. Older film fans can recognize themselves in this film how the film world has indeed changed. All these changes have been necessary in order to respond better and more to current events in the world. Unfortunately, this has not always been for the better for the film world itself.

Damien Chazelle also knows how to portray this film in different, yet also appropriate and creative ways. In the end, with the film techniques and the editor of this film, he knows how to put everything together properly. He also knows how to provide a suitable soundtrack at the beginning of the final film with the composer Justin Hurwitz.

Unfortunately, Damien Chazelle seems to have lost some of his focus this time around for the final film. He has made this film a bit too big with a running time of just over three hours that is too long. In this time he fills the film with some different characters, each of whom also has its own storylines. All these storylines do not always have something to do with each other and are not always influenced by each other. For example, the film can sometimes remain a bit difficult to follow in order to follow exactly what all the characters are doing and why they are working on this. With a shorter running time and fewer characters, the film could probably have been a bit clearer.

Fortunately, the acting is well done by most of the film cast, but due to the size of the cast, not every actor gets the same amount of time in the film. Brad Pitt again puts in good acting as a well-known actor, who, thanks to his success, has ended up on the dark side of his success as an alcoholic. Margot Robbie also does well as someone who tries everything to break through. She sometimes comes across as a bit crazy and this crazy way of acting can be reminiscent of her famous role from the DC movies as Harley Quinn. Diego Calva knows how to steal the spotlight for an even more unknown actor with someone who also tries everything to become known in the film world. Furthermore, this film contains some short but entertaining cameos from actors such as Olivia Wilde and Tobey Maguire.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",babylon is a new historical drama comedy directed and written by damien chazelle director of la la land and whiplash the film begins in s los angeles a time and place where many people used to party and try everything else to become known in the world neillie laroy margot robbie is also trying to break through and with the help of manny torres diego calva she manages to get the attention of people in the film world she hopes to break through to become a worldfamous actress like the popular actor jack conrad brad pitt only during her time in this world she learns that there can also be a dark side to success and fame with this film damien chazelle seems to want to pay tribute to his passion for films and the film world he also seems to be trying to show with this film how this world has changed in a hundred years this is also a fun and entertaining film for people who are also fans of films and the film world older film fans can recognize themselves in this film how the film world has indeed changed all these changes have been necessary in order to respond better and more to current events in the world unfortunately this has not always been for the better for the film world itself damien chazelle also knows how to portray this film in different yet also appropriate and creative ways in the end with the film techniques and the editor of this film he knows how to put everything together properly he also knows how to provide a suitable soundtrack at the beginning of the final film with the composer justin hurwitz unfortunately damien chazelle seems to have lost some of his focus this time around for the final film he has made this film a bit too big with a running time of just over three hours that is too long in this time he fills the film with some different characters each of whom also has its own storylines all these storylines do not always have something to do with each other and are not always influenced by each other for example the film can sometimes remain a bit difficult to follow in order to follow exactly what all the characters are doing and why they are working on this with a shorter running time and fewer characters the film could probably have been a bit clearer fortunately the acting is well done by most of the film cast but due to the size of the cast not every actor gets the same amount of time in the film brad pitt again puts in good acting as a wellknown actor who thanks to his success has ended up on the dark side of his success as an alcoholic margot robbie also does well as someone who tries everything to break through she sometimes comes across as a bit crazy and this crazy way of acting can be reminiscent of her famous role from the dc movies as harley quinn diego calva knows how to steal the spotlight for an even more unknown actor with someone who also tries everything to become known in the film world furthermore this film contains some short but entertaining cameos from actors such as olivia wilde and tobey maguire,POSITIVE

The whole theater was puzzled by this movie. There is no plot to follow, there are no character traits to be appreciated, it's just a bunch of colourful scenes glued together hoping for the best: to stand out by being edgy and ridiculous.

168,168,1.0,28 December 2022,"Damien Chazelle is the GOAT. Fight me.

When this film was first annonced I got nervous because it seemed too good to be true. A ""behind-the-scenes"" Hollywood picture starring the best young actor, Margo Robbie, the always entertaining Brad Pitt, and a very intriguing Diego Capva, directed by the man that made Whiplash and La La Land? ""Either this will be the best film since 2019s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood/Parasite, or this will be an utterly dissapointing mess that will deminish the once seemingly great Damien Chazzele's legacy"", I thought.

As it turns out, Babylon was my favourite film of 2022, giving me exactly what I wanted ever since the film was announced, a fun time and great filmmaking. The acting was also great, Margo Robbie and Diego Calva were the two standouts, Brad Pitt gave a solid Brad Pitt performance for a very Brand Pittesque character, and I'd also like to mention P. J. Byrne, who really left it all on the stage.

This film is not perfect, but Jesus wasn't perfect eighter. We need to celebrate films such as this so that we may break free of the IP movie hell that us film lovers are currently in. If your looking for a Marvel movie, this aint it, this is a movie movie, strap in your seat bealt, snort yourself a line of that good good, and hang on for a 3 hour pleasure of a film to watch.

It had so much bizarre content that I couldn't keep up, it was chaotic, even hilarious at times.

170,170,3.0,20 January 2023,"This movie pulls no punches showing the darkest depths of depravity and unsettling hobbies the people of Hollywood love to get up to as seen back the 1910s, 20s and 30s. It even exposes Hollywood for what it truly is and that is a highly exploitive business where if you have talent, they'll suck you in, promising you the world and all the riches, making you feel like your important, loved and accepted

But when the time comes that they'll no longer need you or think you are of no use to them anymore, they will discard you like yesterday's trash moving on to their next victim. This doesnt just involve actors, it can can involve anyone from journalist, sound props or production crew If you die? They'll cover it up and again move on

I see why this movie has bad reviews but it isnt warranted because Babylon is an uncomfortable 3 hour movie that by the end makes you feel dirty, sick, horrified and exploited. I certainly felt this way by the end of the movie. By all means this movie can be bordering on horror. Real life horror

171,171,9.0,19 September 2023,"'Babylon (2022)' is, as others have pointed out, basically Damien Chazelle's Quentin Tarantino's 'Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood (2019)' by way of Paul Thomas Anderson's 'Boogie Nights (1997)' and Martin Scorsese's 'The Wolf Of Wall Street (2013)'. Just like those three key inspirations, the movie is far from its director's best work. It's also worth mentioning that the piece kind of plays out like a remake of 'Singin' In The Rain (1952)', not just because it depicts Hollywood's tumultuous transition from silent films to talkies but also because it explicitly references - even recreates - key scenes from that picture. In doing so, it kind of just makes you want to watch that superior picture, which is also the case when it purposefully evokes a number of other movies - most of which are actually far more interesting. In letting his inner film nerd often clumsily roam free, Chazelle accidentally dampens the effect of his own effort.

That's not to imply that the piece is without merit, as it's often an entertaining and dazzlingly spectacular experience that's as technically impressive as it is deliberately idiosyncratic, joining the likes of Robert Eggers' 'The Northman (2022)' and Ari Aster's 'Beau Is Afraid (2023)' as yet another balls-to-the-wall, big-budgeted box-office bomb that will unfairly but almost certainly ensure its director never gets to work on this scale ever again. It's a shame that the apparent financial failure of these types of big swings will give the studio pause when affording previously proven filmmakers more resources to make something that so satisfyingly goes against the typical definition of a blockbuster, and in that regard this sort of bombastic blow-out that cares little about convention really ought to be supported more - particularly by any audience members who have ever complained about superhero fatigue. At the same time, though, you can't really blame someone for not wanting to sit through three hours of something they're not interested in, and the flick's reputation of being nothing more than gonzo excess and self congratulation in the form of an infatuation with old Hollywood doesn't really do all that much to sell the prospect of planting your butt on a cinema seat and not moving for 189 overindulgent minutes.

Although that reputation isn't entirely accurate, it does go some way in explaining the atmosphere and attitude of the feature. Yet, there's certainly a bit more to the flick than its chaotic party scenes and period adoration. For instance, one of its best segments is an unexpected and almost out-of-place descent into truly horrific territory, marked by the appearance of a not-so-friendly Spider-Man and a 'Goodfellas (1990)'-esque spiral into coked out paranoia (interestingly, there's a very similar parallel scene in the aforementioned 'Boogie Nights (1997)'). There are also some quieter moments that come close to saying something quite profound, particularly a dialogue scene between Jean Smart's gossip columnist and Brad Pitt's fading star that succinctly sums up Chazelle's own feelings for the medium without pulling you out of the experience (which is what happens elsewhere in the piece). It's also worth mentioning that the feverish festivities and frenzied film shoots are often genuinely striking in their technical construction, a marriage of beautifully shot long takes and musically timed quick cuts that somehow make the already massive sets seem even more immersive and the already teeming crowds feel even more alive. This is, no doubt, a very well-made movie.

Most of the affair's weaknesses actually lie in its screenplay. Its most obvious flaw is that it seems to desperately believe it's actually saying something, but it isn't really saying anything at all. Despite its micro successes in approaching poignancy (but never quite reaching it), its overall theming falls flat. This is reflected in the ending, which clearly thinks it's bringing things full circle but actually leaves you feeling a little cold. In many ways, it's the equivalent of the Nicole Kidman AMC adverts, actually. To be fair, the ending itself is fairly compelling when it uses footage specifically shot for it, but incredibly underwhelming and distracting when it doesn't (I'll avoid elaborating for fear of spoiling things). Although the picture is filled with lots of fantastic performances, particularly from the three leads, a lot of the characters are somewhat underserved, even those that appear to be key components of certain plotlines. Of the three central characters, only one of them really has an internal arc; the others just respond to their new situations in the same way they responded to their old ones. This isn't inherently bad, but there are some segments that skim over some important character work that may have been interesting to see unfold on screen. Another weakness is the fact that the feature is, at least to me, not funny in the slightest, usually drawing its humour solely from bodily fluids. There are some moments that approach the kind of absurdity that can put a smile on your face, but none of them ever quite reach the point of actually doing that. That isn't a massive issue in the grand scheme of things, as the flick does hold your attention even when it isn't tickling your funny bone (or even trying to).

Generally speaking, the movie is engaging right the way through. Although it does wear a bit thin in places and it doesn't really feel as though it earns its length (sometimes, it gives you the sense that it's over three hours long just because something like 'Spartacus (1960)' is), it's entertaining for its majority and - even at its worst - it's at least interesting. Though it isn't as jaw-dropping as its hype may have you believe, it's definitely a sight to be seen (especially in the current cinematic landscape). It's one of those movies where I appreciate its audacity and its craft far more than I connect with it emotionally. It's enjoyable enough for what it is and it has a handful of really solid sequences, but it sort of leaves you feeling ever-so-slightly underwhelmed and isn't likely to stick with you for too long (although perhaps longer than something more generic). It's a solid effort overall and I definitely do recommend it, but perhaps don't go into it expecting to be totally blown away.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",babylon is as others have pointed

176,176,7.0,5 February 2023,"There's a great film hidden within Babylon somewhere but unfortunately, Damien Chazelle wasn't able to fully realize it. Damien Chazelle is a director that I absolutely love and there's nothing wrong with the directing here at all but this was too long and felt like it didn't really get to a point. There are tons of really great scenes scattered throughout the film but it doesn't flow together very well at all. There are whole sections of the film like Tobey Maguire's section which while interesting doesn't feel like it fits into the film at all. In fact, most of the climax feels kind of forced and the ending scene while interesting also feels weirdly placed. I like the homage to cinema but it feels like a good scene in the wrong movie. Some characters just kind of feel thrown in like Jovan Adepo's character. He has some really great scenes but those scenes don't really affect the story at all. I also feel that watching the trailer beforehand may have given me the wrong expectations. The trailer gave this Wolf of Wall Street vibe to it but the movie is not like that at all. I wish it had more of that intense vibe to it. While this review has been mostly negative so far, I still think that everything around the story is great. The directing is great, Diego Calva is great and so is Margot Robbie. Brad Pitt is good in this but some scenes feel like he was only there for the paycheck. The music and cinematography are absolutely fantastic with the score especially standing out. The music helps keep the pacing feel much faster than it is and it truly elevates the film. The production design and editing are both phenomenal as well and I wouldn't be upset if Babylon won the Oscar for Best Production Design.

The opening half an hour or so promises so much for the film and it achieves this, not in the way you would think, but in completely different ways. There were times when I thought 'how did we get here?' but you just have to go with it and enjoy the ride.

A lot of people criticise the character development, and I can understand since the movie is 3 hours long and we hardly know anyone's backstories. However, I think it shows how people came and go in Hollywood, fading in and out of anonymity. Others will see it differently which is understandable.

The highlight for me was the ending, which felt like a major love letter to cinema and the progress of film up to the modern day. Despite the decadence and excess in the culture, the production was ground-breaking. It even moved me a little bit, which surprised me for a film that is such a hot mess.

But if you dislike the first part of the movie, you will like the rest of it, because while the first 30 minutes goes in a tempo, that says ""BANG, BOOM and BANG BOOM"" all at the same time, the rest of the movie, for the most part,, goes ""okay, this is a marathon, not a sprint"".

I did like the movie overall, and there were some really great things about the movie. The acting is good, Robbie is great, Pitt is good, but it is the lead actor Diego Calva (Manny) who should get the most credit. He does it all, and he does it amazingly. Another thing I liked about the movie, was the costumes. It gave us a good impression of what time in the world we were in. I really did love Margot Robbies dress at the beginning. It looked amazing on her, and I hope to see it on her another time.

But the best thing about the movie, was actually the music. Great music, that also showcases what time period we are in.

There is however some reasons why this movie is not a 10/10. I for one did not really care about the rest of the movie, as much as I did in the beginning, which I did love. The script is decent at best, and bad at worst. The movie is also terrible long, and could easily have been 2 hours and 30 minutes at the most. It drags on at the end.

All these reasons, are why I end up at a 7 and not a 10.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",unlike everyone else i loved the beginning of the movie i found it absolutely amazing but i do understand why a lot of people have a problem with it because it is a lot but if you dislike the first part of the movie you will like the rest of it because while the first minutes goes in a tempo that says bang boom and bang boom all at the same time the rest of the movie for the most part goes okay this is a marathon not a sprint i did like the movie overall and there were some really great things about the movie the acting is good robbie is great pitt is good but it is the lead actor diego calva manny who should get the most credit he does it all and he does it amazingly another thing i liked about the movie was the costumes it gave us a good impression of what time in the world we were in i really did love margot robbies dress at the beginning it looked amazing on her and i hope to see it on her another time but the best thing about the movie was actually the music great music that also showcases what time period we are in there is however some reasons why this movie is not a i for one did not really care about the rest of the movie as much as i did in the beginning which i did love the script is decent at best and bad at worst the movie is also terrible long and could easily have been hours and minutes at the most it drags on at the end all these reasons are why i end up at a and not a,NEGATIVE
180,180,1.0,22 January 2023,"It's genuinely hard to judge this movie, as I have mixed feelings about it all. I really loved the main idea and the characters, well built, touching and rich in deep details. The scenografies, spaces and in general the depiction of 1920s Hollywood is astonishing, truly a great piece of filmmaking that praises the great cinema of the past, through its passage from the silent films to the sound. The acting as well was really top-tier: Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie and Diego Calva were perfect for the roles and delivered outstanding performances, through happy, crazy and heart-breaking scenes. Justin Hurwitz's soundtrack is beautiful and more essential than ever, spacing through different genres of music in a single 3 hours experience.

The whole symbolism and idea of the stars of Hollywood climbing the society and decaying in a few years is simply incredible and on spot.

With these premises it was not hard to have an outstanding movie, however it was the style that didn't work: you have to love this style in order to love Babylon, and for me, it wasn't so. The excesses, the feasts and the loud music were a bit too much, resulting in an unfortunate headache at the end of the movie. During the three hours these parties become heavier and heavier and in the end some parts with free violence and no reason for them were added to disturb even more the audience. I get that Chazelle's intent was to disturb the viewer, and he managed so well in doing so, but it doesn't properly fit my style.

Babylon is undeniably a bold movie that results almost perfect technically, but for my personal taste, it was a bit a wasted opportunity.

If this story had been adapted with a different style and approach I would have certainly loved it.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",its genuinely hard to judge this movie as i have mixed feelings about it all i really loved the main idea and the characters well built touching and rich in deep details the scenografies spaces and in general the depiction of s hollywood is astonishing truly a great piece of filmmaking that praises the great cinema of the past through its passage from the silent films to the sound the acting as well was really toptier brad pitt margot robbie and diego calva were perfect for the roles and delivered outstanding performances through happy crazy and heartbreaking scenes justin hurwitzs soundtrack is beautiful and more essential than ever spacing through different genres of music in a single hours experience the whole symbolism and idea of the stars of hollywood climbing the society and decaying in a few years is simply incredible and on spot with these premises it was not hard to have an outstanding movie however it was the style that didnt work you have to love this style in order to love babylon and for me it wasnt so the excesses the feasts and the loud music were a bit too much resulting in an unfortunate headache at the end of the movie during the three hours these parties become heavier and heavier and in the end some parts with free violence and no reason for them were added to disturb even more the audience i get that chazelles intent was to disturb the viewer and he managed so well in doing so but it doesnt properly fit my style babylon is undeniably a bold movie that results almost perfect technically but for my personal taste it was a bit a wasted opportunity if this story had been adapted with a different style and approach i would have certainly loved it,POSITIVE
181,181,1.0,6 September 2023,"'Babylon' is a 2022 American drama set in 1920s Hollywood by tells the story of a young actress who is trying to make it big.

The film is visually stunning, with lavish sets and costumes that bring the Golden Age of Hollywood to life. However, the film is ultimately empty and shallow, with little to say about the Hollywood dream or the people who chase it.

The film's plot is in a way predictable and derivative, and the characters are one-dimensional and mostly underdeveloped. The film's message about the emptiness of fame is also heavy-handed and unconvincing. Nevertheless, Bread Pitt is maybe the only one that gives a particularly memorable turn as a fading star.

Overall, 'Babylon' is a visually stunning but ultimately empty film. It is a feast for the eyes, but it will leave you feeling cold and unsatisfied.

Like a few other more recent big production movies, there is more production than substance. It's over three hours long and for me would have worked better if it was around two hours and there was a lot of fill in stuff in there not really all that relevant to the story.

As mentioned production was very good, music was good, cast was suitably cast. It was very much carried by Margot Robbie who seems to take whatever part she is handed and manages to pull it off extremely well, even in a poor movie.

189,189,1.0,23 January 2023,"No pun intended - you might have heard a lot about the movie. Good and bad things about it - depending on your moral compass, depending on how easy you can be shocked ... well the movie might be not the right one for you. Good thing is: you will know early on ... although it may have been for you, if the movie just stayed away from the depravities on display - again no pun intended.

The movie starts with our main character on the receiving end of some ... well I don't think I can use the word, but let's just say you wouldn't like the way it smells. And it just proceeds to more nastiness - some people describe it as golden shower. And that is before we get to the gratuitous nudity that is sprinkled all over the place - literally.

But even so, the movie is actually a love letter. A morbid and wicked one for sure - but still a love letter to movies and movie making. You have to be able to take the jokes - some seem superficial - even shallow. Giving us cliches and seemingly 2 dimensional (or even one dimensional) characters ... but there is depth there. And even more so in the performances! One example is Brad Pitt (with a flawless introduction - quite old school with his back to the camera) - when he is drunk ... and then he isn't. Well he is, but he also is able to do stuff ... like find his way to his bed.

Sticking with him, even if he is only one of many main characters, he also is able to be drunk but be there on point when it comes to working. His journey is quite something to behold ... and the things he learns ... again circling back to the love letter thing. Expiration dates may be imminent, but there is also eternity to be earned ... well as far as we can tell.

While I understand that the characters are made up and the stories heightend to say the least, the movie itself does portray a lot of truths. I am again not sure, what words I can use without being seen as offensive. Even if I only describe what the movie is telling us - about the movie industry but also about society. Like when Margot Robbies character is being made to ""play"" a role ... in real life. Which she is not suited for at all.

She is as mesmerizing as eveyone else in this. Some stars are blink and you'll miss them - like Olivia Wilde and many others. And that with a movie that runs over 3 hours ... but is over before you know it. Many incidents and many little stories one could say .. and yet they make a whole movie ... they make up a lifetime of ... stories if you want to call it that.

But is it as bad and ""graphic"" as some have said? Well to a degree - again, especially the beginning is to blame for that ... with the party being as mad as you can imagine. There are other scenes that you may find repulsive ... still, there is romance in the air. Between characters - but also between the audience and the movie(s) ... we get some scenes we may know. Brad Pitts character uses lines from other movies ... well he delivers them differently. A nice tip of the head.

And like that incident there is much to be discovered. Be it dialog wise or visual wise - like a pregnant woman at the party, a lot of nudity and ... love making and god knows what else ... well he may be ashamed by what he sees - that may be an intended pun right there. Anyway, this is on the right side of wrong ... and it knows it very well. So many goodies to be discovered ... I can only recommend it so much. Don't let the run time be an obstacle.

PS: I thought I had written about it, but looks like I forgot to give context to my summary headline. The movie plays towards the end of the silent era ... film era that is. And with that new beginning of sound in movies ... well things change. Some get obsolete, some new stars are born and so forth. The film has so many things that I could write about - things that people surely can do essays about too.

The question is, can you forgive the movie that it has a lot of things that are on the nose? Hopefully you can because it really is worth - as is true with the ""graphic"" scenes! Take it with a grain of salt (rather than drugs). Who wants to live forever indeed ... a song that would be fitting for this movie too ... or party forever I guess.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",no pun intended you might have heard a lot about the movie good and bad things about it depending on your moral compass depending on how easy you can be shocked well the movie might be not the right one for you good thing is you will know early on although it may have been for you if the movie just stayed away from the depravities on display again no pun intended the movie starts with our main character on the receiving end of some well i dont think i can use the word but lets just say you wouldnt like the way it smells and it just proceeds to more nastiness some people describe it as golden shower and that is before we get to the gratuitous nudity that is sprinkled all over the place literally but even so the movie is actually a love letter a morbid and wicked one for sure but still a love letter to movies and movie making you have to be able to take the jokes some seem superficial even shallow giving us cliches and seemingly dimensional or even one dimensional characters but there is depth there and even more so in the performances one example is brad pitt with a flawless introduction quite old school with his back to the camera when he is drunk and then he isnt well he is but he also is able to do stuff like find his way to his bed sticking with him even if he is only one of many main characters he also is able to be drunk but be there on point when it comes to working his journey is quite something to behold and the things he learns again circling back to the love letter thing expiration dates may be imminent but there is also eternity to be earned well as far as we can tell while i understand that the characters are made up and the stories heightend to say the least the movie itself does portray a lot of truths i am again not sure what words i can use without being seen as offensive even if i only describe what the movie is telling us about the movie industry but also about society like when margot robbies character is being made to play a role in real life which she is not suited for at all she is as mesmerizing as eveyone else in this some stars are blink and youll miss them like olivia wilde and many others and that with a movie that runs over hours but is over before you know it many incidents and many little stories one could say and yet they make a whole movie they make up a lifetime of stories if you want to call it that but is it as bad and graphic as some have said well to a degree again especially the beginning is to blame for that with the party being as mad as you can imagine there are other scenes that you may find repulsive still there is romance in the air between characters but also between the audience and the movies we get some scenes we may know brad pitts character uses lines from other movies well he delivers them differently a nice tip of the head and like that incident there is much to be discovered be it dialog wise or visual wise like a pregnant woman at the party a lot of nudity and love making and god knows what else well he may be ashamed by what he sees that may be an intended pun right there anyway this is on the right side of wrong and it knows it very well so many goodies to be discovered i can only recommend it so much dont let the run time be an obstacle ps i thought i had written about it but looks like i forgot to give context to my summary headline the movie plays towards the end of the silent era film era that is and with that new beginning of sound in movies well things change some get obsolete some new stars are born and so forth the film has so many things that i could write about things that people surely can do essays about too the question is can you forgive the movie that it has a lot of things that are on the nose hopefully you can because it really is worth as is true with the graphic scenes take it with a grain of salt rather than drugs who wants to live forever indeed a song that would be fitting for this movie too or party forever i guess,POSITIVE
190,190,1.0,7 May 2023,"I admire Damien Chazelle for wanting it all. He is an ambitious young man whose ""Babylon"" is nothing short of a doctoral thesis on the pre-Golden Age Hollywood era. It contains everything from urban legends, early-Hollywood depravity, privileged critics and, last but not least, the artists themselves whose stars shine as bright as they are brief. It is strange why a director who still has years ahead of him would entangle in such brutal retrospectives. Perhaps he is responding to the critics who said his 2016 ""La La Land""--a more gentile take on the Hollywood machine--was too soft and shallow. Or perhaps he just wants to be taken more seriously.

Whatever his reasoning is, he is struggling to push it to the audience in a manner that would satisfy him. You can tell, first of all, by this movie's three hours runtime and then by the insistence on depravity. Because adrenaline-inducing scenes is what he is all about, each one of them is stretched and insisted upon to the limit. Partially, it works. The depictions of the art of filmmaking are chaotic, stress-inducing for its participants, even life-threatening. These scenes serve to show just how much work goes into making a simple scene and how much can luck influence the final product. It almost justifies the characters' need for the Sodom they indulge themselves in during their many private parties. They are means to survival.

Among the many movie people, three stand out: an emotionally unstable but starstruck young woman, a veteran actor whose time is ticking down and a composed Mexican immigrant whose intelligence and powers of observation allow him to climb the ladder to the top. All these characters rise and fall from grace in different ways, but they never unite to a greater whole. It's almost as if the movie begs to be split into three different ones for each of them.

The actress Nellie LaRoy (another freewheelin' performance by Margot Robbie) succumbs to both her own emotional traumas and Hollywood addictions; the Mexican Manny Torres (Diego Calva), despite being as straight of an arrow as possible in that world, is dragged down by love. But the most powerful story is that of Jack Conrad (Brad Pitt). His story of a has-been actor chewed and spit by the Hollywood machine sounds like a cliché but Pitt plays Jack using his own brand of laidback charm and that really made me warm up to the character. At one point he has a discussion with the magazine writer Elinor St. John (Jean Smart) who explains to him how this world is bigger than him, and that while his time has passed, he will live each time a movie with him is played. It's the singular most powerful moment in an otherwise messy movie, a second of poignancy the truth of which--while I cannot confirm or deny--I can feel it's there even today.

Some argue that Chazelle's depiction on the cruelty of Hollywood as an inhuman machine is cynical and--once again--shallow. While I can't help but feel the same I cannot comment whether he is correct or maybe overdramatizing. But I can argue about the ending. It's a confusing one, which attempts to draw some sort of nostalgia, but Chazelle is simply to young for such a complex and tormenting emotion to truly settle down. He thinks it did, and I understand. At 26 years old, I feel it two.

For the most part, a rich, dazzling toe tapping experience taken forward by 3 excellent performances by the leads. However, it is way too long at 3 hours and strays into long drawn out rather self indulgence sections more than once and the contrasts between light and dark scenes simply don't quite knit together.

Rip off of once upon a time in holywood, except that was a respected effort. Except, when tarantino uses violence, he has really good dialogue to back it up. This movie was CARRIED by sexualizing margot robbie and had no good plot, writing, nor dialogue. Which by the way, what on earth was margot robbie's role? What was she trying to sell?

194,194,8.0,21 August 2023,"This review is intentionally dedicated to all the people that gave this film the bad reviews, rating it with 1 out of 10, and that sadly, are the most voted.

I'm going to be honest, as the title says.

Here it is: To the wannabe ""movie reviewers"" that gave Babylon a bad review, with a 1 star rating, saying that the movie is ""self indulgent"", or ""too long"" and ""boring"".

I want to say to you with all respect, that you disgust me.

It is because of people like you that good cinema is dying. It is because of you that superhero movies just don't come to an end. It is because of you that comedy is not a funny genre nowadays.

You people are basically the cancer of art.

No one is going to read this because it took me too long to watch this movie and realize what a beautiful thing Chazelle created. But a beautiful thing in a time where society wants nothing but capes, sex without erotism, action and fan service.

It is embarrassing, sad, and a disgrace to read your reviews, knowing that people like you work in The Academy and that is why Babylon wasn't nominated for best movie, nor did Margot Robbie as best actress.

It's not about art anymore. It's about being entertained according to what your emotional backlashes accomplished.

You are not a reviewer. You don't watch movies.

You eat popcorn, and expect to be entertained.

198,198,6.0,3 July 2023,"This is a sprawling spectacle, the kind of movie that Hollywood rarely makes any more--a three hour run time, several interlinked plot lines, a cast of thousands, an epic story that spans 25 years, and several spectacular set pieces.

It works for the first hour or so. The opening party scene is over-the-top, garish, ridiculous, fun and engrossing. So is the next major set piece, showing the havoc of various silent films being shot simultaneously on a giant outdoor lot, including a war epic with a live orchestra playing ""Night on Bald Mountain."" By this point I thought that this was shaping up to be my favorite movie of 2022.

But the film loses steam in the second half, and the main reason in my opinion is that the film's central relationship between Margot Robbie and Diego Calva doesn't work. The long scene in the taxicab between Nellie and Manny is painfully devoid of romantic spark or chemisty, and yet we are supposed to believe later on that Manny has loved Nellie all these years? And we are supposed to believe that a savvy, pragmatic film executive like Manny would try to make Nellie into a sophisticated leading lady, when it's obvious that her talent and appeal lies in bawdy comedy? The lack of a plausible relationship between these two characters drags down the whole film.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",this is a sprawling spectacle the kind of movie that hollywood rarely makes any morea three hour run time several interlinked plot lines a cast of thousands an epic story that spans years and several spectacular set pieces it works for the first hour or so the opening party scene is overthetop garish ridiculous fun and engrossing so is the next major set piece showing the havoc of various silent films being shot simultaneously on a giant outdoor lot including a war epic with a live orchestra playing night on bald mountain by this point i thought that this was shaping up to be my favorite movie of but the film loses steam in the second half and the main reason in my opinion is that the films central relationship between margot robbie and diego calva doesnt work the long scene in the taxicab between nellie and manny is painfully devoid of romantic spark or chemisty and yet we are supposed to believe later on that manny has loved nellie all these years and we are supposed to believe that a savvy pragmatic film executive like manny would try to make nellie into a sophisticated leading lady when its obvious that her talent and appeal lies in bawdy comedy the lack of a plausible relationship between these two characters drags down the whole film,NEGATIVE
199,199,1.0,23 January 2023,"Once upon a time in Hollywood would be the obvious title instead of Babylon (but that title was stolen by Tarantino's awful film ) and there lies one of the main influences. Apart from the obvious influence of Austrian directors such as Fritz Lang and Billy Wilder there's a heavy influence from the exceptional work of Sergio Leone especially with musical collaboration with Ennio Morrocone in this case with Justin Hurwitz using the repetitive reprise of City of stars sounding la la land for the on screen romance of Manny & Nellie, Emma stone would have completed the team had she accepted however Margot Robbie was excellent in the role.

Although the film was an epic at over three hours it didn't feel long . It was introspective and like Sunset Boulevard, Chinatown ,The Artist , The Party with Peter Sellers ( hence the elephant in the room) , Hollywoodland, The Player , A star is born, The Jazz Singer and eponymous Singing in the rain.

It was story of rising and falling stars and the fickleness of fame and its seedy side with immoral prohibition breaking parties where anything goes sex drugs and jazz and roll

Brad's Clark Gable type character was the track the film ran on and the stand out star for me was Flea from Red Hot Chili Peppers his casting was excellent can see him as Bond villain in a future movie

There's a beautiful montage to Hollywood and it's changing role over the past hundred years towards the end which lifted the spirits and made the film a really enjoyable experience

It's a film for adults only due to the themes covered and it's pre me too too - but if you enjoyed films such as Baz Luhrmans The Great Gatsby you'll love this

201,201,6.0,21 January 2023,"Babylon by Damian Chazelle is one of the greatest movies of the year 2022, aside of other movies who received much love and appreciation such as Top Gun Maverick and The Fabelmans. This movie is a true cinematic masterpiece.

The year 2022 hasn't been the best for big franchises such as Marvel, DC, or even Star Wars. Many of them were met with disappointment, criticism and weren't fully successful in terms of art and Beaty. The sad reality is that many of these franchises are invested in profit than story.

Luckily for us cinephiles we still have a few writers and creators out there who are devoted to a good story. In this case - Babylon.

Centering around several characters and their demise, during the 20's of Hollywood and the transition from silent films to sound ones. Babylon is a 3 hour concert telling the rise and fall of a somewhat glorious time in Hollywood which may never return (of course it won't).

Aside of the crazy cinematography that accompanies the movie, the editing is great and the soundtrack is funky and uplifting.

Brad Pitt stars in another fantastic role in which he should be nominated for many awards.

Margot Robbie crashes into the film (literally) and steals the show from everyone, her dance scene during the opening sequence at the mansion party is probably one of her most memorable and best moments in her career.

Diego Calva is a wonderful actor who's character is the first to empathize with, he's young and passionate about movies, he wants to succeed in the business and we the audience by empathizing with him want him to succeed. Anyone nowadays can be a Manny Torres (Calva) and love movies.

The connection between the movie's title and the famous ancient city of Persia is quite amusing: both are known to be somewhat of a Euphoria and perfect place, only then for it to be ruined and forgotten.

I believe that aside Whiplash, this is one of Chazeelle's greatest's films yet, and he still has a long way to go. For those who are passionate about cinema and want to see a sort of comedic and outrageous take on one of Hollywood's biggest transitions.

Instead I only made it through the opening scene, the introduction of sound to movies, and the snake fight. Which took one hour.

Even the outstanding acting of Manny and Jack could not carry the story before I grew tired of delays, interruptions, and lack of music. I may take the time to watch the remaining two hours+, but not without fast-forwarding the boring, unnecessary episodes. I would love the movie to be cut to 1 1/2 hours, and skip every repetitive scene.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",waited to see this film until april expecting great action and stunning views instead i only made it through the opening scene the introduction of sound to movies and the snake fight which took one hour seemed like takes on the sound intro with margot as the studio door was opened someone sneezed shoes squeezed etc etc even the outstanding acting of manny and jack could not carry the story before i grew tired of delays interruptions and lack of music i may take the time to watch the remaining two hours but not without fastforwarding the boring unnecessary episodes i would love the movie to be cut to hours and skip every repetitive scene,NEGATIVE

Numerous thoroughly disgusting scenes could have been eliminated with zero affect on the plot or character development of the main characters. Another bad sign.

207,207,1.0,21 January 2023,"A wild ride through the Hollywood film industry where everything, especially the parties, is done to extravagant excess.

209,209,1.0,21 January 2023,"Movies about making movies is a subgenre at this point. Several adaptations of the making of Godfather, Jaradowsky's Dune and even Spielberg's The Fablemans came out just recently. Babylon deals with the era of transition from silent cinema to sound and like Tarantino's Inglorious Bastards it mixes real event with fiction to create a dopamine effect in the cinema.

Babylon is very similar to Wolf of Wall Street and Boogie Nights in depicting the excess party culture of a high pressure work environment. The movie doesn't shy away from being unapologetically bonkers. The opening scene before the title reveal is a wild cocaine and booze fueled party with wild animals wrecking havoc while Margot Robbie dances in trance.

Despite it's 3 hour+ runtime, the movie doesn't have a low moment even for a minute. The first hour shows the rise of our 2 central characters and Brad Pitt. The second hour introduces the the transition to sound in filmmaking and how it impacts the careers of our characters. The final hour closes the character arcs and depicts the brutal reality of pop culture fame and downfall.

Justin Hurwitz's score is pure adrenaline. Unlike La La Land and First Man, the music in the movie is loud and blasts through the speakers. The final 15 minutes of the movie is a tribute to cinema itself on the whole. It was the best theatrical experience I had in my lifetime.

214,214,1.0,5 February 2023,"The past decade has seen writer/director Damien Chazelle go on some type of hot streak run that started with 2014's indie smash Whiplash, moved to musical behemoth La La Land, flew to the moon with the underappreciated but brilliantly realised Neil Armstrong biopic First Man and has now danced its way to one of the most unfortunate box office bombs of recent memory Babylon, a huge swing of a film that takes a no holds barred approach in its journey through early Hollywood of the 1920's and 30's.

For anyone under any illusions, Babylon explores the golden era of Hollywood the same way in which Boogie Nights delved into the adult film industry and Wolf of Wall Street threw us into the financial whirlwind of New York City, meaning that Chazelle's ambitious adrenaline rush of a studio picture is an unrelenting movie going experience that will absolutely not be for everyone tastes but right now as it stands, its a mighty shame critics seemed to have taken too Chazelle's spectacularly staged epic, that one suspects will face major revaluations in the years to come.

Opening with what can only be described as one of the most eye-popping pre-title beginnings one would ever hope (or not hope) to see, Elephants and pogo sticks included, Babylon's first hour is a sugar rush of unrivalled proportions as Chazelle's ensemble of characters enjoy Hollywood partying at its most carnally minded, frantic movie sets that may have bypassed OHS protocols and some of Chazelle's trademark writing genius that perfectly combines with Linus Sandgren's breathtaking cinematography and Justin Hurwitz's jazz infused score that is unlikely to leave your brain for sometime following the conclusion of the film.

It's a cinematic arrival that's hard to put into words but one thing for sure is its unlike anything we've seen quite like it before and while its hard for the film to ever truly reach the same level of unexpectedness and wildness there's not many moments of this 3 hour plus epic that don't engage in some way and Chazelle's ability to have Babylon work as a genuinely hilarious comedy, a touching drama, a musing and tribute to the art-form of movies, expose of the often unspoken underbelly of Hollywood and even in one nerve shredding sequence an out and out horror, is a feat only few directors could ever hope to accomplish.

Throughout all of this mayhem it's easy to forget that Babylon also features some noteworthy turns from both its proven stars and its up and comers, with Brad Pitt as ageing leading man Jack Conrad and Margot Robbie as uncontrollable up and comer Nellie LaRoy standouts, with Mexican actor Diego Calva getting a major break as wide-eyed dreamer Manny Torres with Jovan Adepo much the same as African American musician Sidney Palmer, with Chazelle once more proving to us all that he's an actors director, able to draw out the best from his cast amongst his own dreams and ambitions.

Since Whiplash burst onto the scene almost a decade ago it was clear Chazelle (then still aged in his 20's) was a superior talent and his done nothing since that would suggest anyone should've thought otherwise at the time and while Babylon may have its flaws and may miss a few of its swings, overall Chazelle's high reaching and ambitious ride is the exact type of rare big budget feature we should be thankful to see in a sea of films reaching for low hanging fruit and hoping to appease the masses.

After all this is Hollywood, warts and all, strap in and enjoy the ride before everyone else realises they missed their chance in the years too come.

Final Say -

At times insane, other times heartfelt and at all times taking its audience on a journey they've unlikely been on before, Babylon makes no excuses for what it is and while it might not stick all its landings across its multiple story threads and ideas, Damien Chazelle's spectacular effort is an ambitious modern masterpiece of madness and creativity.

215,215,6.0,1 January 2023,"There's a lot to like about Babylon, especially the on-set scenes of early film-making, and the score is fantastic. And the three leads are great. Ultimately, however, despite the best efforts of its stars, the movie tries too hard to be everything, everywhere, all at once, and can't quite decide what it wants to be. Is it a dark comedy, a satirical commentary, a serious melodrama, or a gratuitous freak-show? Or does it want to be all of them all at once? I don't mind a multi-layered movie, but over 3+ hours, this lack of coherence really grates. One moment a scene is being played as quirky, tongue-in-cheek, almost slap-stick comedy, only to swing to over-wrought, over-done drama in the next breath. One moment a scene is subtly and effectively satirizing Hollywood, only to shift suddenly and wildly into pontificating with all the subtlety of a fire truck. I suppose one could claim that being all over the place may be part of the point, but i think that gives the filmmaker's intentions too much credit. Part funny, part brilliant, part bloated, part reminiscent of exploitative trash, this movie is just a bit too much of a mess for more than 6 stars.

My wife gave up on it early on, but I continued to hang in to see if it would get better, to see what my friend saw to lead him to recommend it.

It gave me hope that this tiresome tale might make a turn for the better. But alas, that was just wishful thinking. There wasn't but one remotely likable character and he was a doormat.

221,221,7.0,5 February 2023,"Babylon has extravagance oozing in all directions, and yet, it somehow makes you feel occasionally disgusted at the happenings. I think it's a classic example of incorrect marketing, where the trailer basically told you that it's an invitation to a giant Hollywood party in the 1920s. That's it. But the film is SO MUCH MORE! Damien Chazelle's tribute to the world of filmmaking in Hollywood LA is incredibly fast-paced for a 189-minute long feature. Margot Robbie is at her wild, sultry best as Nellie, while Brad Pitt enacts a star Jack Conrad whose actions brings about his downfall. Diego Calva essays Manny, an immigrant with a love for cinema, and is smitten by Nellie from the get-go.

The film begins, as promised, with the party of all parties. That's purely a setting for Chazelle to introduce his key set of characters and indulge in those long shots. The proceedings swing between awe-inducing and repulsive, and Chazelle seems to be revelling in it. Once we get to know the protagonists a little better, Babylon deep dives into the process of film-making from a hundred odd years ago. This paves the way for some hliariously wacky scenes, laced with Justin Hurwitz's immersive score. Linus Sandgren's cinematography is persistently busy capturing the superfluity of the indoors and outdoors. Mary Zophres' work on the costumes and Florencia Martin's production design are magnificent.

There's some level of commentary on systemic racism and sexism within Hollywood's elite, and while it's not razor-sharp satire, the film keeps you reasonably engaged. It's in the final hour that Babylon lost me a little, when it sidesteps its protagonists in an attempt to constantly make us go ""WHAT?!"". This even includes a very bizarre segment in the dark underbelly of LA with alligators, kinky sex, disfigured people, and what-not. At one point, it feels like the writer in Chazelle had no idea what all of this was leading to, and he was fully trusting his cast to keep it drifting. A special shout-out goes to Li Jun Li, who steals every little scene she's in. If the idea was to make an excessively chaotic picture, Chazelle should've just stuck to doing that. Why build characters up like this and end the film in such a pretentious way?","December 23, 2022 (United States)",babylon has extravagance oozing in all directions and yet it somehow makes you feel occasionally disgusted at the happenings i think its a classic example of incorrect marketing where the trailer basically told you that its an invitation to a giant hollywood party in the s thats it but the film is so much more damien chazelles tribute to the world of filmmaking in hollywood la is incredibly fastpaced for a minute long feature margot robbie is at her wild sultry best as nellie while brad pitt enacts a star jack conrad whose actions brings about his downfall diego calva essays manny an immigrant with a love for cinema and is smitten by nellie from the getgo the film begins as promised with the party of all parties thats purely a setting for chazelle to introduce his key set of characters and indulge in those long shots the proceedings swing between aweinducing and repulsive and chazelle seems to be revelling in it once we get to know the protagonists a little better babylon deep dives into the process of filmmaking from a hundred odd years ago this paves the way for some hliariously wacky scenes laced with justin hurwitzs immersive score linus sandgrens cinematography is persistently busy capturing the superfluity of the indoors and outdoors mary zophres work on the costumes and florencia martins production design are magnificent theres some level of commentary on systemic racism and sexism within hollywoods elite and while its not razorsharp satire the film keeps you reasonably engaged its in the final hour that babylon lost me a little when it sidesteps its protagonists in an attempt to constantly make us go what this even includes a very bizarre segment in the dark underbelly of la with alligators kinky sex disfigured people and whatnot at one point it feels like the writer in chazelle had no idea what all of this was leading to and he was fully trusting his cast to keep it drifting a special shoutout goes to li jun li who steals every little scene shes in if the idea was to make an excessively chaotic picture chazelle shouldve just stuck to doing that why build characters up like this and end the film in such a pretentious way,POSITIVE

223,223,7.0,6 April 2023,"I nearly turned this film off after the first half an hour - 30 minutes which could've easily been edited down to 10 minutes with no loss of content. Those 30 minutes were unnecessarily lewd, devoid of emotion and lacking any sense of character development.

However I'm glad I stuck it out, as this film has some moments of entertainment, and you do get into the characters and (frequently bizarre) story. There are at least a few other moments where one can't help but feel the editing could've been more concise and helped reduce the film's obscene running time.

Disappointingly the soundtrack features at least 5 numbers which sound as though lifted directly from La La Land. Struggling to imagine how it won a golden globe for best score. Some great trumpet playing, though.

There is an unnecessary amount of expletives and topless women in this film. There is the occasional phalus to even things out, but it's all very unnecessary and not remotely fitting of the 20's.

224,224,1.0,26 December 2022,"Before reviewing overall questionable parts of the film, there are undeniably outstanding aspects of Babylon.

The costumes The set designs The cinematography

But you don't need to watch the entire movie to appreciate those things: simply watch all available trailers and promos for the film. They put the best parts in the trailers anyways.

As for the entire 3 hour film-What a waste of time. THREE HOURS of (my opinion!) the most obnoxious, over-the-top, toxically masculine sex, drugs, and booze fueled disaster of a ""movie"". Movie in quotes because it felt more like it was one long bender that was edited to feel like a story/movie. What a bunch of crap. What kind of artist would have made this project? The ones that just want a quick buck $$. This movie felt like a big ""hey! Watch how I can make a movie and i'm gonna claim it to be a love letter to hollywood/movies!"" while in reality it's just to prove who can roar the loudest and attract the most attention, via cinema of course.

The score was absolutely bollocks as well, I will count myself amongst the viewers who were fighting headaches during the movie. Yes, music is powerful, but there are so many blaring horns and head-spinning motives that one starts to feel dizzy and uncomfortable. Silence, while extremely rare in this film, seemed to work best against the film.

The editing was also questionable. Some scenes felt way too fast paced for being in a three hour movie. Why make the movie so long just to rush certain scenes? Lol

Save your money, for real. I wanted to walk out but I didn't want to miss the opportunity to experience the film. Holy moly I wish I had walked out, could've had the rest of the day to myself instead of being razzle-dazzled until I wanted to drop dead.

225,225,6.0,20 January 2023,"I had the pleasure to attend a press screening (thanks @ParamountMexico), and this time nobody left the room due to the misdeeds of a psychopathic clown (yes, we mean you, Art The Clown).

The three hours and eight minutes of duration go away quickly only if you click on this cinematographic experience, which tells the story of various characters who live the splendor of Hollywood silent cinema, as well as the evolution towards movies with sound.

This is the kind of movie that radically polarizes opinions. However, the prudent thing to give it a try is to stay away from the negative comments that circulate in large numbers. And it is also worth mentioning that if you enjoy the Director's work (with the exception of the script he wrote for ""The Last Exorcism Part II"", 2013), you will surely enjoy what he has to offer on this occasion.

""Babylon"" is loud, excessive, dynamically edited, colorful and dark when it has to be it. It has hope, humor in different forms, decadence, awkward moments, and even a little bit of horror (and not just because of Tobey Maguire's looks).

The music created by Justin Hurwitz is capable of moving you, making your heart beat (even if you resemble the frivolous character of Jean Smart), and will stay in your mind for a long time.

Margot Robbie, simply amazing and addictive, always engaged in the characters she plays; is the soul of this story. We gladly follow her to the bacchanalia, to heaven, and to the underworld. Her introduction scene, her first appearance on a set, and her breakdown at a ""posh"" event (among others), are already memorable.

Brad Pitt chews his character nicely, while Diego Clava came to Hollywood to stay (no, he's not from Madrid).

The ending is sure to be considered iconic in a few years. Only time will tell.

226,226,1.0,23 January 2023,"Damien, I like you, but this movie is way too long. I appreciated a lot about Babylon: the music is the best thing about it, the way that every scene has a melody, a specific soundtrack, the hyped-up almost electroswing-y score during the parties, the way the music stops and resumes suddenly in transition with the different plots and characters. I also loved a lot of the visuals. The editing for the most part is very energetic and engaging, although it becomes kind of nauseating especially past the 2:30h mark. The visual aspect is very artificial but well crafted. Now the performances: Margot steals the show, not necessarily because of the quality of the performance but because of how much exhausting things she had to do (this movie is her Revenant). Pitt plays the same character DiCaprio plays in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, so he's good but kind of unremarkable. The main character of the story, Manny, is backed up by a good performance but he's also extremely bland and uninteresting as a protagonist. McGuire did pretty good, his role was sort of ""easy"" to pull off, considering how off putting and well done his scenes were. All in all, the biggest issue in the film is the writing behind it, which felt very unmemorable. We've all seen like 1000 movies about how Hollywood is messy and corrupted but also movies are great. We've seen movies about parties and cocaine and sex scenes. This movie wants to be a movie about Hollywood's chaos and evil but also about these three characters and their lives, and it ends short for both ideas. The characters are underdeveloped, their story feels like it's been going on too long. The pacing of the story, that sometimes stops for half an hour on a specific event and then does time skips to tell the tragic decline of these characters, is very disorienting and inconsistent. And last but not least, the ending sort of pissed me off: that sequence went on for way too long, it was so pretentious and self serving and vane, and one of the biggest examples of how tiresome it is to watch hollywood movies that glorify themselves by virtue of being movies. It also was extremely inconsistent with the rest of the film, it felt like a cheeky attempt to win over a nostalgic audience and to wake people up after a long and boring ending to the boring character stories. So yeah. It's not poorly made, but it felt like 3 hours of spectacle and self-aggrandizing hype with no soul, and nothing new to say.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",damien i like you but this movie is way too long i appreciated a lot about babylon the music is the best thing about it the way that every scene has a melody a specific soundtrack the hypedup almost electroswingy score during the parties the way the music stops and resumes suddenly in transition with the different plots and characters i also loved a lot of the visuals the editing for the most part is very energetic and engaging although it becomes kind of nauseating especially past the h mark the visual aspect is very artificial but well crafted now the performances margot steals the show not necessarily because of the quality of the performance but because of how much exhausting things she had to do this movie is her revenant pitt plays the same character dicaprio plays in once upon a time in hollywood so hes good but kind of unremarkable the main character of the story manny is backed up by a good performance but hes also extremely bland and uninteresting as a protagonist mcguire did pretty good his role was sort of easy to pull off considering how off putting and well done his scenes were all in all the biggest issue in the film is the writing behind it which felt very unmemorable weve all seen like movies about how hollywood is messy and corrupted but also movies are great weve seen movies about parties and cocaine and sex scenes this movie wants to be a movie about hollywoods chaos and evil but also about these three characters and their lives and it ends short for both ideas the characters are underdeveloped their story feels like its been going on too long the pacing of the story that sometimes stops for half an hour on a specific event and then does time skips to tell the tragic decline of these characters is very disorienting and inconsistent and last but not least the ending sort of pissed me off that sequence went on for way too long it was so pretentious and self serving and vane and one of the biggest examples of how tiresome it is to watch hollywood movies that glorify themselves by virtue of being movies it also was extremely inconsistent with the rest of the film it felt like a cheeky attempt to win over a nostalgic audience and to wake people up after a long and boring ending to the boring character stories so yeah its not poorly made but it felt like hours of spectacle and selfaggrandizing hype with no soul and nothing new to say,NEGATIVE

229,229,1.0,4 February 2023,"Written and directed by Academy Award winner Damien Chazelle, Babylon tells Hollywood's early days of silent film transition to the world sound era in the late 1920s, and the rise and fall of a bunch of individuals struggling to strive working in the industry.

I'm very nervous going into this movie since the reviews are a mixed bag, so I lowered my expectation and just try to enjoy it. It is a pretty tough one to watch especially within the first 30 minutes, lots of people said it's too much, etc. But I think it was perfect for the context of the story and a great introduction for the characters, also Writer/Director Damien Chazelle wants to give the audience a heads-up about what's to come.

With 189 minutes of runtime, this movie would've been better if the plot is more focused on the characters considering there are 3 or maybe even five of them. Manny Torres, excellently played by Diego Calva is the only character who has depth, you can feel his emotions and tears at the end. And his dream of being involved in moviemaking finally comes to fruition but suddenly goes away just because he helped a lover Nellie LeRoy, who is an ill-fated aspiring actress wonderfully portrayed by Margot Robbie. Brad Pitt's Jack Conrad demise is the most tragic after he discovers a hard truth about how his career has come to an end. The main point of the plot is a tale of broken Hollywood dreams

The production is grand and massive, the original score by Justin Hurwitz is a jazz feast and a total blast (my favorite part about this movie), also the cinematography by Linus Sandgren is simply gorgeous.

Babylon is a wild ride and an absolute spectacle that depicts the Golden Age of Hollywood. It's a hit-and-miss at the same time, but worth to watch for the experience. The ending scene is one of the most unexpected, it's literally breaks the fourth wall like cinematically.

This is basically Damien Chazelle love letter to cinema

231,231,7.0,24 December 2022,"LIKES:

The Acting -Oscar worthy performances for sure, these performances are elevated roles that tackle realistic problems.

-Smart takes the sassy nature of Designing Women, but then adds the hostility of the Hollywood beast. She has one of the best monologues ever, and I liked the PR she played -Diego Calva is the man when it comes to my favorite actor of the movie. His character evolves the most and he tears into so many characters, adapting them to the changing nature of the character and doing it so naturally.

-Robbie is a shoe in for award nominations, the way she play the starlet so engaging in both physical and mental aspect of the movie. She is fluid, she is wild and she works the scenes and I love her raw talent in her acting.

-Pitt is the same and yet different, still playing the caveat role that launches so many things. The evolution is less entertaining, but this performance seems like a love letter to himself and the actors of old. He's very classy and executes well, and again has Oscar roles.

-Must say, the chemistry is very dynamic, sometimes sharing insanity in the obscure language, others being fun and endearing as they celebrate, and some so emotionally connected it's as if it was real.

The Setting/Technology to make thing come to life -I'm a sucker for bringing us into the moment with sets and costumes and this movie shines.

-Costumes alone sell the moment and really tell the times, the personality, and even the image being crafted. They tell a story themselves and that is an art for me ladies and gentlemen.

-The visual props and seeing the evolution of the industry in the set is amazing for a cinephile like myself. It too helps sell the emotional material of the movie.

-Makeup helps with the passing of time and the emotional distraught that comes with each passing year. Loved the impressive marks they formed and the life they brought.

-Add the feel of the movie and the editing, and you really get that set piece that shows how the film industry developed in the tech department. Solid work in using visuals to immerse and capture the moment of the movie.

The Emotions -You'll feel something in this movie as the various acts bring a bevy of emotions that will hit many hearts in some form or manner.

-A yearning and infatuation fills one part and is that true love itch that needs to be scratched and the rooting of the heroes who are unlikely.

-Others are going to fall into the hardworking story and feeling the frustrations and triumphs of working up the system for the characters that they will have to balance.

-Some are going to get lost in the euphoria of watching the movies made, feeling like a kid in a comic store watching their moments come to life and reliving the happiness/excitement of the walk through history.

-There will be those who will enjoy the seedier side of things, and get caught up in the dramatic personae equipped to handle the harder moments.

-It's powerful and a true kiss to the theatrics that proceeded the entertainment industry of Hollywood.

The Character Development To An Extent -It's a movie that is not only about the parties, politics and crafting of movies, but several characters that go through the journey of the industry.

-As the times change, so do they and seeing the various responses to the times and the challenges really brings a wonderful arc to follow.

-The pressures of the starlet and what is expected of the expectations of the people who run the movie world.

-A legend who does discovering to find out just what he is made of and if he can get face the tide with the success he knows.

-And another is about the newbie coming in and discovering so much in the industry, incorporating everyone else in his life, perhaps chasing a dream.

-Dynamic, engaging, and artistically crafted to be real and relevant, it fits so well in this movie environment and I absolutely find it worthy of the award hype.

The Messages -Life lessons come in many forms, and certainly this movie does the trick with setting up important lessons to make you think.

-Metaphors are perfect, an elevation of allegory usage to drive the point home, seldom using direct lines to deliver it. Even those are crafted and time beautifully to sell the moment.

-With relevance and engaging characters, you will find yourself lost in the moment and have the impact settle hard like me.

-It's relevant to much of the story and helps pull it out of the documentary mode instead, again, smart storytelling.

The Fact That We See Culture -We see the nature of the beast come in all forms and learn how risky and rewarding it can be.

-The dreams at the start that lure so many in with the promise of paradise, but find hardships remain is the perfect introduction to this film.

-Soon, the chaos of the movies in the past, combined with the soirees that followed added the partying atmosphere that was the exciting and humorous realms of entertaining.

-Then comes the politics and the darker side, providing just how hungry an industry the world is and what many do to just survive in the fleeting nature of fame.

That element is dramatically classy and again the part that pulls us in and gives us the culture that was common in the past.

The Fact That We Get the History Of movie making -Nerds, geeks, and big fans like me are going to love the first two hours, and seeing just how movie filming turned from bloody fields of rough and tumble antics and became the finely tuned studios that shows made famous long ago.

-The struggles, the torment, the ever changing hands of overactive greed shaped so many lives, and you see how each moment drives the next big thing for American Cinema.

-This was the biggest highlight and again a solid two hours that pulled so much into the gravitational pull of the film, making for a great uniting factor that should also please Hollywood's ego.

DISLIKES:

Pace I Uneven And a Bit Slow -No butts about it, the movie has slower parts, mainly the third act that felt like slogging through the mud.

-The bouts of character development sometimes gets in the way and leaves us with extra time with little benefit, which means boring for this reviewer.

-The extra attempts at elevating things makes for some pretentious presentations and again does little for the common audience no matter how amazing the literary devices are used.

The Language/Lazy Writing -Not a fan of ranting and cursing as much as they do in the movie.

-Loses the spice of the words and eventually lost the comedic flow even more when the joke runs on and on.

-Embarrassing at times then funny.

Predictability -So much foreshadowing set up in the first hour easy to figure out the ending -The second act places things out too easily that again you get much closer to figuring out what is going to happen.

-The third act essentially reveals everything, but takes forever to drop the hammer and show us.

-This again drags the movie out and throws off the pace, when you are certain you know what is right and just want the 3 hours to come to an end.

Loses The Theme Of The First Two Acts Of The Movie -I mentioned that the first two acts focus so much on making movies and progressing them with the times, and how much that ties the movie together.

-By the third act though, the drama essentially took over and the film making was lost to the drama and shifts gears majorly to their stories.

-While this is a plus for drama and character closure, that loss of the production phase robbed the fun element and with it the magic and wonder of the movies for the usual depression that comes with the dark tale.

-At that point the main drawing point was robbed and I just wanted to go home.

Was Not a Fan of the Last Ten Or So Minutes -The last ten minutes are trying to then take the director's vision of what movies seemed to motivate them and cram them in this odd way.

-It tries to end on a positive note, but seems to still lose that direction for another semi-dark, though beautiful, illustration of the challenges of the times.

-And then kind of goes modern, abstract art, and flashes for like three minutes this odd display with booming loud sounds that again did little for me, but might please those who love symbolism.

The VERDICT: Babylon is artistic as heck, and is an Oscar quality movie that is loaded with kisses to the industry that made the movie. All the references and story building are brilliant in so many levels, a true artistic approach to a tale that we know much about. The settings, the costumes, and clothes certainly immerse you into the moment and help you dance through the decades of Hollywood's growth. Yet, it's not some emotionless shell of a movie, but rather holds merit and stakes for characters that are traversing through it as well. I loved the movie making elements and that incorporation of so many pieces to give these actors the best world to work in, and for great performances to shine in as well. However, the movie may be a bit too impressed with itself and that leads to the problems I had with the movie. The pacing is uneven, and the third act takes much of what I love of the movie and tosses about seventy-five percent of it away to amplify other elements. Relevant and emotionally investing? Yes, but also bloating the movie and leading to an abstract ending lost on fans like me. Oscar's can certainly delight in this movie, but I have to say it's not my favorite movie for the theaters this year. Best left for home, this movie's artistic nature is okay for me and my scores are:

233,233,6.0,23 December 2022,"Babylon is Damien Chazelle's latest movie and it's... ambitious. It's mostly enjoyable, pretty funny, somewhat investing, and you can really tell how much work went into making it. With the exception of some really bad audio dubbing, I found it to be well-made in all technical aspects. And it's filled with long single-take shots involving so many people.

There are a couple reasons I didn't give it a higher score. First, period pieces aren't my favorite genre. Second, there are three different times where I was completely disgusted by what I saw on the screen. And that's coming from someone who's extremely desensitized. It's just gross.

Third and most important, I don't see myself ever watching this again. And this is coming from someone who rewatches movies all the time, my favorites as many as 10+ times.

It's not entertaining at all from start to finish, and one scene after another is just more of the same in an endless and predictable jerk off by a director who cares nothing about entertaining a paying audience.

235,235,7.0,4 February 2023,"Fourth film from director Damien Chazelle.

I'm not lying when i say that this might be my favorite from him.

Beautiful and crazy love letter to cimema.

Story set in early days of Hollywood when transition from silent films to talkies was happening.

It's told mainly from perspective pf three characters.

Up and coming film star, filmmaker and already famous actor.

Their rise to fame, struggles of keeping up with changing industry and downfalls.

Huge parties and filmmaking in different eras.

Many hilarious moments, but also some quite touching ones.

This film really is wild ride.

I'm kinda impressed how this film has almost every possible body fluid in it from tears and sweat to blood and feces.

Quite long film, but it never felt boring to me.

Fast paced with every scene being more crazy than another.

Amazing performances from main three Diego Calva, Margot Robbie and Brad Pitt.

And even more impressive and amazing ensemble as supporting cast.

So many great names.

Really amazing score.

Music in this really made me dance little bit in my cinema seat many times.

Also visually really beautiful film with great cinematography.

I definitely teared up little bit at the end during that tribute to films and filmmaking.

238,238,6.0,27 December 2022,"Talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference.

I love, love, love, love Babylon and Damien Chazelle's genius mind.

Margot Robbie is a star. Her best role to date. Nellie is crazy. She is free, she is talented, she is herself, she is sad, she is tragic. Her whole life was a big tragedy. I don't want to spoil anything. All I am gonna say is, it's written in the stars, Nellie LaRoy is a star and so is Margot Robbie. I don't care about critics reviews, this woman is insanely talented and deserves all the awards in the world.

Diego Calva. Wow. What an actor! Hollywood needs this man. He is going to be a big star. I am in love with Manny Torres. What a character. A man with big dreams, huge heart and a huge love for Nellie.

Brad Pitt, he basically is playing himself. When you watch the movie and know the history of Brad Pitt, you will know what am I talking about.

Katherine Waterston made me laugh every time she showed up on screen. What a show stealer, just like Li Jun Li.

Li Jun Li stole the show every time she appeared on screen. She is a heart and soul of the film in my opinion. I needed more of her, Tobey Maguire and Samara Weaving. Especially Tobey and Samara. I'd love to see more of Phoebe Tonkin too.

Jovan Adepo and Jean Smart are genius. I loved every second with them.

I wanted to punch Eric Roberts every time I saw him on screen and it ain't insult to him. His acting was great and it made me want to punch him.

I want to say more, so many things, but I can't do it without spoilers. I'll just say, I love Damien Chazelle and his brilliant, genius mind. Yet, I don't know how I feel about ending. I didn't hate it like so many people. I just don't know how I feel about it.

I highly recommend this film. Genuine question to all the people who hated it. Did we watch the same movie? Cause I don't understand the hatred to it. Not liking the movie is one. Hating and talking shit about it is another. I can understand those people who disliked it, but can not understand those who hated it.

Not everyone loves long movies. As for me, I wish I could see the whole cut that is more than 4 hours long. 3 hours wasn't enough for me. But of course, not everyone loves it.

239,239,1.0,3 February 2023,"I was fascinated by this portrayal of early Hollywood, also known as The Roaring Twenties. It was a time when women were more liberated after they got the vote and were able to dress as they liked, and the peak of silent cinema.

The film opens up with an elephant defecating copiously on a handler while being shoved up a hill in the middle of the desert. But this is not for a film set. It's for one of the wildest parties I've ever seen put on film. I at first thought, were people really that crazy and out there in Hollywood at that time?

Then it cuts to the next day at work, when things are just as chaotic, exhilarating and dangerous as the party they all attended in the secluded mansion. Play hard, work hard. It's insane the way they used to make silent movies. It was also more egalitarian, as there were more female directors present, and more overt sexuality.

This is all before the Hays Code and the Talkies. Once the talkies came and made more money, the fat cats took over, cast the women out of positions of power and controlled every aspect of the buisness, including the actors' personal lives.

But also, in the case of some of the characters in the film, the immense drug taking, gambling and inability to transition to sound, took a massive toll on their lives and were unable to move on.

I've never seen Singing In The Rain, which is a similar story to this film, only far tamer and well-behaved. Which was not exactly the case in real life. Though I'm not sure it was quite on the level of debauchery as seen in this film.

Overall, though it missed its mark in a few places, it's a fascinating film to witness, and I recommend it.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",i was fascinated by this portrayal of early hollywood also known as the roaring twenties it was a time when women were more liberated after they got the vote and were able to dress as they liked and the peak of silent cinema the film opens up with an elephant defecating copiously on a handler while being shoved up a hill in the middle of the desert but this is not for a film set its for one of the wildest parties ive ever seen put on film i at first thought were people really that crazy and out there in hollywood at that time then it cuts to the next day at work when things are just as chaotic exhilarating and dangerous as the party they all attended in the secluded mansion play hard work hard its insane the way they used to make silent movies it was also more egalitarian as there were more female directors present and more overt sexuality this is all before the hays code and the talkies once the talkies came and made more money the fat cats took over cast the women out of positions of power and controlled every aspect of the buisness including the actors personal lives but also in the case of some of the characters in the film the immense drug taking gambling and inability to transition to sound took a massive toll on their lives and were unable to move on ive never seen singing in the rain which is a similar story to this film only far tamer and wellbehaved which was not exactly the case in real life though im not sure it was quite on the level of debauchery as seen in this film overall though it missed its mark in a few places its a fascinating film to witness and i recommend it,POSITIVE
240,240,8.0,4 January 2023,"From somebody who really loves cinema. I have to say that this is definitely one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time. Not only does it capture the attention of the viewer, but It's a dramatic tale of debauchery and a tale of the rise and fall of movie stars in the era of its setting. It's sad, funny and dramatic all at the same time. I personally think that the movie was amazing Margot Robbie and Brad Pitt did a fantastic job. For the people that did not enjoy this movie I can understand why they did not. It does seem overdramatized at some spots, but almost every movie you see whether that be fiction or nonfiction that's how it is. Movies are meant to be dramatized versions of life. Yes, there are movies that are true to the fact, and there's nothing dramatized about it, but movies are meant to be seen as an escape from reality and this movie truly was that. A dramatized version of what it's like to be living in Los Angeles between the 1920s and 1930s in the film industry. And it showcased what it was like to transition from silent movies to talkie movie in such a interesting way that I was hooked from the moment the movie started. There are some people who will see this movie as a overzealous representation of Hollywood. But I think that if you let yourself truly escape into the movie that you will be entertained by the acting, direction and story that is presented. If you love cinema and/or movies or stories, there's no way you can't at least somewhat be entertained by this film.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",from somebody who really loves cinema i have to say that this is definitely one of the best movies ive seen in a very long time not only does it capture the attention of the viewer but its a dramatic tale of debauchery and a tale of the rise and fall of movie stars in the era of its setting its sad funny and dramatic all at the same time i personally think that the movie was amazing margot robbie and brad pitt did a fantastic job for the people that did not enjoy this movie i can understand why they did not it does seem overdramatized at some spots but almost every movie you see whether that be fiction or nonfiction thats how it is movies are meant to be dramatized versions of life yes there are movies that are true to the fact and theres nothing dramatized about it but movies are meant to be seen as an escape from reality and this movie truly was that a dramatized version of what its like to be living in los angeles between the s and s in the film industry and it showcased what it was like to transition from silent movies to talkie movie in such a interesting way that i was hooked from the moment the movie started there are some people who will see this movie as a overzealous representation of hollywood but i think that if you let yourself truly escape into the movie that you will be entertained by the acting direction and story that is presented if you love cinema andor movies or stories theres no way you cant at least somewhat be entertained by this film,POSITIVE

First was the acting, Margot Robbie and Brad Pitt did good and other actors were also good. The presentation of some scenes was nice and entertaining for sure. The music in the movie by Justin Hurwitz was nicely done. He made sure the whole soundtrack was done justice to. The actor playing the trumpet acted very well in the movie. Now all of this isn't enough at all when the story/plot is so weak, simple and predictable. Many scenes were unnecessarily dragged and prolonged. Then a lot of filler content was there in the movie which extended the length of the movie unnecessarily. Nudity was way to excessive and unnecessary at some points. It could've been done moderately.

It also remind of the multiple memoirs of Hollywood stars of the 1920s, the earnest and direct look at the viewer from the other side of the screen is quite visual.

Give this movie time - it'll earn its right and good reputation.

For example, in the original script, the clara bow-inspired character (robie) slept with manny the night they met... this kind of bonded them more intensely than whats in the film.

251,251,6.0,9 May 2024,"I consider myself a fan of writer/director Damien Chazelle, if not viewing him as one of my all-time favorites. Whiplash is among my Top 5 favorite movies of all time, La La Land is another favorite of mine I still adore after countless viewings, and while First Man was slightly disappointing it still had a lot of great elements to appreciate. (Still need his debut film Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench to be available on a streaming service or physical media here in Taiwan.....) Apart from the common theme of hardships during the pursuit of dreams which always resonates with me deeply, another characteristic of Chazelle's films that appeals to me is how his movies always impresses the most during the ending.

Despite the polarizing reception of the film, I was still interested in seeing Babylon. Apart from my love for Damien Chazelle as a director, I was also hooked by the premise being about the transition of Hollywood from silent films to sound films, aka talkies. (Singin' in the Rain, which depicts the same time period, is one of my all-time favorite movies.)

After finally seeing Babylon for myself, while it wasn't as great as I hoped, at the same time I found it to be better than reputed and don't think it deserves the overwhelming lambasting it got. Its technical aspects are done so well that even if the film didn't do much for me it would still get no lower than a 4/10, and legit effort will be made to recognize its positive aspects rather than focusing on its missteps and overlooking what it did right. As for how Babylon ranks among Damien Chazelle's previous films, I liked it slightly more than First Man without finding Babylon on par with the excellence of La La Land or Whiplash. In terms of 2022 releases, it is nowhere close of deserving to be called one of the worst films of 2022, while also falling short of being one of the best. As for how it compares to the other two 2022 ""cinema love letter films"" with Steven Spielberg's The Fabelmans or Sam Mendes' Empire of Light, Babylon may be nowhere close to reaching the brilliance of The Fabelmans due to its frequent missteps, but Chazelle did manage to capture the magic of cinema fairly better than Mendes did with Empire of Light.

It's not hard to see why Babylon has divided critics and audiences and hasn't clicked with many, with one common aspect subject to criticism being towards the graphic content including the nudity, drug use, and gross-out humor. The opening scene in particular gives off a pretty bad first impression of what the film is actually about, which may rub off viewers the wrong way, myself included. I understand that Damien Chazelle was trying to use the graphic content in this film to highlight the glamor and excess in 1920s Hollywood, but I personally would have preferred to start off the film with something related to cinema history to set up the main story instead of beginning with a lowbrow joke that doesn't contribute to the main theme of the film. A little re-arranging of scenes would have certainly helped, probably by starting the film with a plot point near the end instead.

Many have raised complaints towards the massive three-hour runtime of Babylon, and while I personally wasn't bothered by the length, I can still see where the complaints are coming from. The film did manage to keep my attention throughout the majority of the film, but there were certain parts where I wished the movie would move on towards the next scene, particularly during the wild and reckless party scenes where I wanted the film to focus back on the filmmaking aspect of the story. The snake-wrestling scene in particular I found quite cringy to watch, even if the outcome of the scene did bring up an interesting issue that was left under-explored. Not helping the issue was the overstuffed plot with so many subplots that not all of them were developed properly, while the script also had some interesting themes that were briefly brought up but undercooked by the end. (Treatment of ethnic minorities, toxic working environments during early-day Hollywood, or cutting off ties with workers following personal controversies.)

With a huge cast of main characters, not all of them were able to be developed fully even with the massive three-hour runtime. Li Jun Li's character seemed like she was going to be built up towards something significant by the end, but she was sidelined for a majority of the second half of the film and had little to do during the conclusion. Overlord's Jovan Adepo's character as an African-American trumpet player ran through a major obstacle that provided an interesting highlight towards the treatment of ethnic minorities in early-day Hollywood, but I found the issue too neatly wrapped up by the end without the necessary conflict-solving to make it feel like a satisfying resolution, if not to the extent of being completely forgotten about by the end like Li Jun Li's character was. Which is quite a shame, as Adepo's character had the arc I was second-most emotionally invested in behind Diego Calva's and wanted more development for Adepo.

My last complaint towards Babylon has nothing to do with the film itself and is more about the abysmal marketing strategy that may probably led to audiences having wrong expectations going into the movie, and likely contributed to Babylon becoming such a big box-office flop. The trailers were overly vague in getting out the idea of what the film was about and just marketed it as a Wolf of Wall Street-style wild partying flick, when it was actually about Hollywood's transition from the silent era of films to talkies and the rise and fall of stars during that era.

However, while Babylon had many problems, there were also so many other aspects done exceptionally well, with the first thing I want to praise about being the music score. I have loved composer Justin Hurwitz's compositions for Chazelle's previous films and listened to them multiple times, so it's no surprise that his latest collaboration with Chazelle in Babylon didn't disappoint me either. The catchy ""Voodoo Mama"" theme has been stuck in my head ever since I heard it, the opening track ""Welcome"" captures the wild glamor of the time period depicted, and the more tender musical cue for Manny and Nellie is also memorable while recalling Mia and Sebastian's Theme from La La Land at the same time. (also by Hurwitz) When it comes to the Oscar nominations that year, the award I was most rooting for Babylon was Best Original Score, and I still listen to the Babylon music score on Spotify all the time even if it ultimately lost the Oscar.

Linus Sandgren (Damien Chazelle's go-to cinematographer since La La Land) delivers yet another winner of camera work with Babylon. I love the way he moves the camera through scenes, with a breathtaking unbroken shot moving through the opening party done in one take sticking out the most in my mind, with another sequence where the camera moves swiftly as it follows multiple films in production simultaneously impressing as well while also reminding me a lot of the not-shot-by-Sandgren Whiplash, curiously.

Regardless of whether their characters were fully fleshed out or not, the performances from the actors were strong across the board. In terms of the two leads who get top billing, Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie are solid but have been better in other films. The real standout in Babylon is Diego Calva as Manny, who is a great point-of-view character to follow through this journey of changing times throughout Hollywood. I love Manny's viewpoint towards what makes cinema special to audiences, along with his unconditional kindness towards Robbie's character even with her being a complete mess as both a person and a public figure.

Jean Smart is another highlight of a role as a gossip columnist who follows careers of actors, and she has a monologue near the middle of the film about the nature and lasting legacy of cinema that resonated with me on the same level as Anton Ego's monologue at the end of Ratatouille. Jovan Adepo may have been underutilized but I still loved both his performance and the character arc, while Eric Roberts also had a short but amusing role, and I'm glad to see Roberts in another proper movie instead of stuck in the Z-grade SyFy/The Asylum dreck he has been constantly stuck in recent years. Tobey Maguire makes the most out of his limited screentime during the last portion of the film as well, and I never expected to see him as such a shady and creepy character.

The story deals with a lot of ambitious themes present in the entertainment industry, many of which I was able to get behind since I followed news in the entertainment industry and therefore understood what issues the film was trying to shine a light towards. While not every aspect of the story is successful in its execution, when Babylon hits the mark it really hit hard. The most well-developed theme throughout Babylon is its homage towards the evolution of cinema throughout the years and the legacy of film continuing to resonate with generations of new viewers, to which Damien Chazelle's love and appreciation towards the art form shines throughout, most notably during the previously mentioned monologue from Jean Smart and the ending I'll get to later. My interest and knowledge towards film history also admittedly helped me better get into the story.

The aspect of Damien Chazelle's previous films that leave the deepest impression on me are always the endings, and Babylon is no exception. I love the ending for Babylon mainly for how it wraps up a certain character and how it pays tribute to cinema history in general, which is the best way I could put it without spoiling anything.

Overall, had some major issues but still found a lot to like appreciate, while also admitting that it won't be for all tastes. I found myself enjoying Babylon more often than I hated it, therefore my score stands at a 7.5/10.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",i consider myself a fan of writerdirector damien chazelle if not

the real standout in babylon is diego calva as manny who is a great pointofview character to follow through this journey of changing times throughout hollywood i love mannys viewpoint towards what makes cinema special to audiences along with his unconditional kindness towards robbies character even with her being a complete mess as both a person and a public figure jean smart is another highlight of a role as a gossip columnist who follows careers of actors and she has a monologue near the middle of the film about the nature and lasting legacy of cinema that resonated with me on the same level as anton egos monologue at the end of ratatouille jovan adepo may have been underutilized but i still loved both his performance and the character arc while eric roberts also had a short but amusing role and im glad to see roberts in another proper movie instead of stuck in the zgrade syfythe asylum dreck he has been constantly stuck in recent years tobey maguire makes the most out of his limited screentime during the last portion of the film as well and i never expected to see him as such a shady and creepy character the story deals with a lot of ambitious themes present in the entertainment industry many of which i was able to get behind since i followed news in the entertainment industry and therefore understood what issues the film was trying to shine a light towards while not every aspect of the story is successful in its execution when babylon hits the mark it really hit hard the most welldeveloped theme throughout babylon is its homage towards the evolution of cinema throughout the years and the legacy of film continuing to resonate with generations of new viewers to which damien chazelles love and appreciation towards the art form shines throughout most notably during the previously mentioned monologue from jean smart and the ending ill get to later my interest and knowledge towards film history also admittedly helped me better get into the story the aspect of damien chazelles previous films that leave the deepest impression on me are always the endings and babylon is no exception i love the ending for babylon mainly for how it wraps up a certain character and how it pays tribute to cinema history in general which is the best way i could put it without spoiling anything overall had some major issues but still found a lot to like appreciate while also admitting that it wont be for all tastes i found myself enjoying babylon more often than i hated it therefore my score stands at a,POSITIVE
253,253,6.0,7 July 2024,"It's late 1920s and Hollywood is making the big transition from silent to talkie cinema. Manny through his wits and contacts, gets a job at Kinoscope while growing quickly to become a studio executive. He falls in love with Nellie LaRoy who is a silent era star trying to adapt to the transition while battling her own drug addiction. Jack Conrad is another superstar who is on the verge of losing his stardom. Amidst them, there is a trumpeter Sidney Palmer and a singer Lady Fay Zhu who too go through the highs and lows during Hollywood's transition.

Damien Chazelle has made an ode to cinema and unraveling the dark world of Hollywood, he unleashes the chaos like anything. Apparently the big change demands bigger chaos and through his main characters, he explores the various emotional turmoil they go through while struggling to accept the new reality, driven by drug addiction to staying motivated to achieve big success, to facing rejection and what not. At over 3hrs, the film is definitely long and has a lot of depressing content. The performances however standout whereas Tobey Maguire as a gangster stands apart with his choice of appearance. Circling the story around Manny and how he witnesses the lives amidst the Hollywood's big change, worked well.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",its late s and hollywood is making the big transition from silent to talkie cinema manny through his wits and contacts gets a job at kinoscope while growing quickly to become a studio executive he falls in love with nellie laroy who is a silent era star trying to adapt to the transition while battling her own drug addiction jack conrad is another superstar who is on the verge of losing his stardom amidst them there is a trumpeter sidney palmer and a singer lady fay zhu who too go through the highs and lows during hollywoods transition damien chazelle has made an ode to cinema and unraveling the dark world of hollywood he unleashes the chaos like anything apparently the big change demands bigger chaos and through his main characters he explores the various emotional turmoil they go through while struggling to accept the new reality driven by drug addiction to staying motivated to achieve big success to facing rejection and what not at over hrs the film is definitely long and has a lot of depressing content the performances however standout whereas tobey maguire as a gangster stands apart with his choice of appearance circling the story around manny and how he witnesses the lives amidst the hollywoods big change worked well,POSITIVE
254,254,9.0,25 July 2023,"This movie is a total trash heap of badly written Hollywood history thrown together with garish and over indulgence so you won't really notice that it's not a good film. It's so extravagant in its presentation, it's sets and design that it's almost like look over here, look over there, so you won't notice how bad it is.

Damien Chazelle has taken various aspects from Hollywood's silent era and the tragedies that some of the big stars of that time suffered and conceives a trash heap of inconsistencies and fabrications that truly diminishes what their value was to cinema. Brad Pitt's character is basically John Gilbert, Margot Robbie is Clara Bow or one of her contemporaries and the rest of the circus ensemble is a dozen other people that played out on the fringes of the era.

It's sad that Damien Chazelle couldn't pull together a better screenplay but instead chose to pull from this person's history and that person's sad life but never truly created a full fleshed out character. To compensate for the lack of storyline he instead imposes an over the top picture of the silent era, and the beginning of the sound era that I don't believe is true to that time and true to what actually went on. Yes, there were wild times going on during the silent's but Chazelle turns it literally into a circus of grotesques.

I will give the picture high marks for the soundtrack as that's about all I came away liking.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",this movie is a total trash heap of badly written hollywood history thrown together with garish and over indulgence so you wont really notice that its not a good film its so extravagant in its presentation its sets and design that its almost like look over here look over there so you wont notice how bad it is damien chazelle has taken various aspects from hollywoods silent era and the tragedies that some of the big stars of that time suffered and conceives a trash heap of inconsistencies and fabrications that truly diminishes what their value was to cinema brad pitts character is basically john gilbert margot robbie is clara bow or one of her contemporaries and the rest of the circus ensemble is a dozen other people that played out on the fringes of the era its sad that damien chazelle couldnt pull together a better screenplay but instead chose to pull from this persons history and that persons sad life but never truly created a full fleshed out character to compensate for the lack of storyline he instead imposes an over the top picture of the silent era and the beginning of the sound era that i dont believe is true to that time and true to what actually went on yes there were wild times going on during the silents but chazelle turns it literally into a circus of grotesques i will give the picture high marks for the soundtrack as thats about all i came away liking,NEGATIVE
255,255,7.0,3 January 2023,"Babylon (2022) is a movie that my wife and I caught in theaters last night. The storyline follows two aspiring young people in Los Angeles, one that wants to become a movie star and one a Hollywood elite director. They happen to be trying to rise to stardom during the end of the silent movie age and beginning of the talking pictures. The directors love for the actress, and the actress' dependency issues, may cause them both to miss their rise to stardom unless they can quickly align to the new ways of Hollywood.

This movie is directed by Damien Chazelle (La La Land) and stars Brad Pitt (Fight Club), Margot Robbie (Suicide Squad), Diego Calva (I Promise You Anarchy), Jean Smart (Garden State), Olivia Wilde (Don't Worry Darling) and Jovan Adepo (Fences).

The settings, attire and cinematography for this picture are beautiful. The cast is perfectly selected and deliver tremendous performances top to bottom. The circumstances are over the top, unpredictable and wildly entertaining. The drastic turn of the movie industry mid movies combined with the wild circumstances and unpredictable characters made for a fun ride and the end was sad but felt realistic.

The stories are aimless. Its just not assembled or edited very well.

Diego Calva as Manny Torres from Mexico comes to Hollywood starstruck, timid, no specific talents and is awestruck with exuberant Nellie and does not take long to fall in love with wild Nellie.

259,259,1.0,28 December 2022,"To be fair, the title advises the viewer that it depicts Hollywood as irredeemably fetid and evil, and for that reason despite its overlong run and weak script, it is not an awful flick in an age of mediocrity.

As for highlights, the acting was quite good, and I'd expect both Robbie and Smart to receive Oscar nominations. Brad Pitt is solid as a depiction of, essentially, John Gilbert, a leading man of silent films destroyed by talkies. (Another character is an obvious reference to Anna May Wong, and the actress does a competent job despite the character's limitations.) Robbie's character (an uneven depiction of Clara Bow, who left Hollywood and had a family) is unsympathetic: she's a mess when she appears, and it is obvious that success will only encourage her self-immolation.

Much too much time was spent rubbing the viewer's nose in the hedonistic excesses; for example, the opening party scene could -- and should -- have been five minutes. Also unnecessary were the scenes depicting the difficulty of location shoots, they added nothing to the quality and should have been replaced by more illustrations of intrigue and backstabbing.

Not nearly as bad as the average flick these days, but certainly not worth the either the outrageous standard ticket prices (or, sadly, the discounted ones), or the three hour run time.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",to be fair the title advises the viewer that it depicts hollywood as irredeemably fetid and evil and for that reason despite its overlong run and weak script it is not an awful flick in an age of mediocrity as for highlights the acting was quite good and id expect both robbie and smart to receive oscar nominations brad pitt is solid as a depiction of essentially john gilbert a leading man of silent films destroyed by talkies another character is an obvious reference to anna may wong and the actress does a competent job despite the characters limitations robbies character an uneven depiction of clara bow who left hollywood and had a family is unsympathetic shes a mess when she appears and it is obvious that success will only encourage her selfimmolation much too much time was spent rubbing the viewers nose in the hedonistic excesses for example the opening party scene could and should have been five minutes also unnecessary were the scenes depicting the difficulty of location shoots they added nothing to the quality and should have been replaced by more illustrations of intrigue and backstabbing not nearly as bad as the average flick these days but certainly not worth the either the outrageous standard ticket prices or sadly the discounted ones or the three hour run time,NEGATIVE

263,263,6.0,21 January 2023,"""Babilonia"", Damien Chazelle's new film, brings many aspects of his short and fantastic career: The love for cinema, the love for music, the grandiose long shots and the daring travellings. Damien tells the story of 4 characters with an important historical contribution to cinema, despite the 4 characters being charismatic and engaging, not all of them have a complete development arc, because despite the more than 3 hours of film, the daring shots, sequences and choreography magnificent images take a good amount of screen time, which makes the 3 hours fly by but reduces the screen presence of the 4 main cores. The script, with touches of ""La La Land"", talks about love, ambition, legacy and overcoming obstacles and presents some great subtexts, mainly those involving the character Jack Cornad, played spectacularly by Brad Pitt, even if the nucleus with more development and time of screen is the duo Nellie LaRoy and Manny Torres, which has a troubled second act but has a beautiful final outcome. As already mentioned, Chazelle brings many narrative resources from her most successful film. ""La La Land"" that doesn't work very well here, on the other hand, it comes with its strong musical side, combining a chaotic choreography that works perfectly, and talks with the maddening narratives that will follow, always exploring the excess of drugs, glamor , sex and booze of classic Hollywood. Another cool point, Chazelle makes cinema one of the characters in her feature film, all her changes, developments and evolutions from the 20s to the 30s are very well guided. The script contains good speeches and monologues and travels through the intricacies of the madness of being at the center of the development of a gigantic art that was still less than 40 years old, the deaths, production problems and gigantic constructions of sets are presented, and they are beautiful , Chazelle made the narrative of her film crazy with organization, something that does not seem to have a clear focus, this is due to the point of view that her film narrates, something that goes beyond great producers and great actors, we have a narrative about legacy and love that will be perpetuated, not necessarily because of this film, but because of hundreds of thousands of films that come out and move so many people, and its apotheotic and controversial ending references this. ""Babilonia"" is far from being a perfect film, its direction, despite being grand, has transition problems, its script lacks a bit of depth in some points, such as in the center of Sidney, but we have one more proof of the cinematographic potential which Chazelle is directed, a film with great performances, an uncontrollable and immersive direction and a script with ups and downs. 8.5/10.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",babilonia damien chazelles new film brings many aspects of his short and fantastic career the love for cinema the love for music the grandiose long shots and the daring travellings damien tells the story of characters with an important historical contribution to cinema despite the characters being charismatic and engaging not all of them have a complete development arc because despite the more than hours of film the daring shots sequences and choreography magnificent images take a good amount of screen time which makes the hours fly by but reduces the screen presence of the main cores the script with touches of la la land talks about love ambition legacy and overcoming obstacles and presents some great subtexts mainly those involving the character jack cornad played spectacularly by brad pitt even if the nucleus with more development and time of screen is the duo nellie laroy and manny torres which has a troubled second act but has a beautiful final outcome as already mentioned chazelle brings many narrative resources from her most successful film la la land that doesnt work very well here on the other hand it comes with its strong musical side combining a chaotic choreography that works perfectly and talks with the maddening narratives that will follow always exploring the excess of drugs glamor sex and booze of classic hollywood another cool point chazelle makes cinema one of the characters in her feature film all her changes developments and evolutions from the s to the s are very well guided the script contains good speeches and monologues and travels through the intricacies of the madness of being at the center of the development of a gigantic art that was still less than years old the deaths production problems and gigantic constructions of sets are presented and they are beautiful chazelle made the narrative of her film crazy with organization something that does not seem to have a clear focus this is due to the point of view that her film narrates something that goes beyond great producers and great actors we have a narrative about legacy and love that will be perpetuated not necessarily because of this film but because of hundreds of thousands of films that come out and move so many people and its apotheotic and controversial ending references this babilonia is far from being a perfect film its direction despite being grand has transition problems its script lacks a bit of depth in some points such as in the center of sidney but we have one more proof of the cinematographic potential which chazelle is directed a film with great performances an uncontrollable and immersive direction and a script with ups and downs,POSITIVE

273,273,7.0,30 December 2022,"It's a satirical drama set in Los Angeles, California, from 1924 to 1934, with an epilogue that goes beyond. It follows various fictional actors, producers, and directors as Hollywood transitions from the silent era to talking motion pictures.

The film mainly features three characters. First, Manny Torres (Diego Calva) is a Mexican-American ""fixer"" who starts at the bottom, helping to transport an elephant to a lavish party but later becomes a significant executive. Second, Nellie LaRoy (Margot Robbie) is an actress from New York who is determined to break into the movie business and become a star. Finally, Jack Conrad (Brad Pitt) is an older actor who has been famous and wealthy as a silent movie star and is trying to transition to talking pictures. Jack seems to go through wives about biannually. In addition, there are many significant secondary characters like a famous gossip columnist (Jean Smart), an African American jazz musician (Jovan Adepo), and a film producer (Lukas Haas), who is Jack's best friend.

The film opens with a hedonistic party at a studio executive's home, and we meet all the main and most of the secondary characters. Nellie is ""discovered"" and becomes an instant success. Manny gradually moves up the ladder at Kinoscope Studios. He tries to keep Nellie on the rails with mixed success. Jack discovers his transition to sound movies does not go well. Things gradually become more chaotic in all their lives, and by the film's end, we learn what has happened to each.

""Babylon"" is over three hours long, at least 45 minutes beyond its ""best before"" time. The first two hours were primarily satirical and very engaging. Brad Pitt, Diego Calva, and Margot Robbie are excellent, especially Robbie and Pitt. However, in the last 45 minutes, the script tried to turn ""Babylon"" from an entertaining movie into a commentary on the significance of Hollywood films in American culture. (This was ironic because I was the only attendee at the matinee showing after two talkative young adults wandered off about 20 minutes into the film.)

277,277,9.0,28 December 2022,"Not everyone should see this film. In fact most shouldn't and most won't. This review will help you decide which side you're on.

Babylon is one story of many about pursuing the American dream and the collateral damage that inevitably accompanies it. The story is told from the point of view of multiple main characters and how each deals with the harm caused by their super sized success to those in close proximity to them.

The backdrop is LA during the transition from silent movies to talkies. The movie industry was making a seismic shift in not just sound, but also in culture. The silent era was the infancy of motion pictures when those who participated were considered less than professional -- outcasts from polite society. They worked hard, played hard, and had a pretty much anything goes lifestyle that frequently degenerated into debauchery. At the same time they were accepting of many other lifestyles that were excluded from regular society. They all shareda common goal -- to be a success was all it took to get your ticket stamped.

At various times, the pursuit for cinematic perfection becomes too much for each of the main characters in different ways. The story ends with how each comes to terms with the consequences of their success.

Babylon is not a history lesson, nor is it intended to be a spectacle. It is a story about the dreams of success many of us have at various times in our lives and tries to make us aware they have impact on those around us.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",not everyone should see this film in fact most shouldnt and most wont this review will help you decide which side youre on babylon is one story of many about pursuing the american dream and the collateral damage that inevitably accompanies it the story is told from the point of view of multiple main characters and how each deals with the harm caused by their super sized success to those in close proximity to them the backdrop is la during the transition from silent movies to talkies the movie industry was making a seismic shift in not just sound but also in culture the silent era was the infancy of motion pictures when those who participated were considered less than professional outcasts from polite society they worked hard played hard and had a pretty much anything goes lifestyle that frequently degenerated into debauchery at the same time they were accepting of many other lifestyles that were excluded from regular society they all shareda common goal to be a success was all it took to get your ticket stamped at various times the pursuit for cinematic perfection becomes too much for each of the main characters in different ways the story ends with how each comes to terms with the consequences of their success babylon is not a history lesson nor is it intended to be a spectacle it is a story about the dreams of success many of us have at various times in our lives and tries to make us aware they have impact on those around us,POSITIVE
280,280,9.0,23 December 2022,"I truly enjoyed the ride that is Babylon and the ambition Chazelle had with this. It was successful at coming across as a hate letter to old Hollywood but an ode to cinema as an art. And while the maximalism and ridiculousness was fun it was felt excessive. This was a pleasant 3 hours.

The editing was tight and sharp and the camera work was exquisite. This is a very good looking movie and not just because Brad and Margot are in it. Except for of course, the heinous stuff. This had a gorgeous original score. As you know Chazelle has an ear for it. Costumes are fire.

Brad gives a nice performance (though nothing he's never done before) starting with just comedic relief then coming to a full character with depth. I really connected with this arc towards the end. Margot gives possibly her best performance with her character Nelly in her wild rise and full. Her presence was somewhat of an abstraction, realistic and needed. The trumpet players arc was too, needed to convert the message of the film. I'm not sure how to feel about Diego Calva's character Manny as I did enjoy his performance and character, but I felt as though something of his arc was underwhelming because it feels like he had the most screen time. Though he was essential to emotionally ground the film. It almost redeemed by that amazingly moving final scene. Chazelle loves to throw you for a loop on his endings and I totally connected with this ending, and I know not everyone will. But it helped me connect with the movie more emotionally which was slightly lacking.

There are multiple scenes in Babylon that are masterful including the comic and tense retake scene, the whole first day on a set for Nelly and Manny, and the ending, imo. In 20 minutes chunks, this movie is on fire. I think where this loses a couple points for me is in its overindulgence, at times lack in focus, and overall messiness.

282,282,8.0,18 February 2023,"The rise and fall of the early Hollywood stars is portrayed, although extremely exaggerated, in Chazelle's latest creation. It serves as a double-sided message. One that is a bleeding heart pleading for compassion for those stars who literally give their lives to our entertainment, the other is the absurdity and greed of those celebrities who will stop at nothing to reach a position where they will not be questioned for their debauchery and degeneracy.

Damien said ""You look at what these people went through, and it gives you a sense of the human cost that accompanied the kind of ambition that attracted so many people to Los Angeles at that time. There's a darker side to the story of that transition than I'd seen before.""

Babylon is nothing new, it is a retelling the same story that we know of big movie stars who end up deceased or in rehab. But the editing, the detailed process of making a film in the 1920s, and the delusion that those stars live in is what kept me hooked. Scorsese's style is my favorite but it is sad to see it stolen and downgraded in this manner.

The excellent performance by every member of the cast is what makes this film shine. Especially Brad Pitt still, he still has a lot to give and he is very good at what he does. A 7/10 to honor the casting choice and their performance.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",the rise and fall of the early hollywood stars is portrayed although extremely exaggerated in chazelles latest creation it serves as a doublesided message one that is a bleeding heart pleading for compassion for those stars who literally give their lives to our entertainment the other is the absurdity and greed of those celebrities who will stop at nothing to reach a position where they will not be questioned for their debauchery and degeneracy damien said you look at what these people went through and it gives you a sense of the human cost that accompanied the kind of ambition that attracted so many people to los angeles at that time theres a darker side to the story of that transition than id seen before babylon is nothing new it is a retelling the same story that we know of big movie stars who end up deceased or in rehab but the editing the detailed process of making a film in the s and the delusion that those stars live in is what kept me hooked scorseses style is my favorite but it is sad to see it stolen and downgraded in this manner the excellent performance by every member of the cast is what makes this film shine especially brad pitt still he still has a lot to give and he is very good at what he does a to honor the casting choice and their performance,POSITIVE

286,286,1.0,20 January 2023,"""Babylon"" is Director Damien Chazelle's love letter to a Hollywood that pre-dates both him and me.

A script he says was inspired by the TV series ""Babylon Berlin"". It also has shades of Baz Luhrmanns' ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""The Great Gatsby"".

It's a salute to the origins of Hollywood and LA itself before the old Hays Code banned on screen nudity and drug use and also a commentary on how puritanical modern films are compared to those made almost 100 years ago.

A look at the formative years from the Silent Pictures of the 1920's to the Golden Age in the 60's where it closes on a famous comedy, musical. Romance about a silent film star who falls for a chorus girl.

Just like that film it deals with the difficult transition to talking pictures in late 1920's Hollywood.

And also like that movie it features some of the biggest stars in Hollywood today, including: Brad Pitt, Aussies (the technically skilled thespian) Margot Robbie and Samara Weaving, Lukas Haas, Jean Smart, Olivia Wilde, Jovan Adepo, Tobey Maguire (one of this films Producers) and many more (even Flea from Red Hot Chilli Peppers and Albert Hammond Jnr from The Strokes as an extra).

Originally Robbies character ""?"" was meant to be based on the legendary Clara Bow, but that part was re-written when Emma Stone (""La La Land"") dropped out of the project.

Pitt as ""Jack Conrad"" is old Hollywood, a dinosaur who doesn't know he's extinct yet thrashing about in the tar pool and magic of movies and seems loosely based on a hybrid of John Gilbert, Clarke Gable, Errol Flynn and Cary Grant.

It's much more than a tale of outsized ambition and outrageous excess although the movie opens in a Palm Grove as Diego Calvas' ""Manny Torres"" attempts to transport an Elephant to one of the wildest and most debauched Hollywood parties you'll ever see.

The opening title card don't even appear until 32 minutes into ""Babylon"" into this 3 hours 9 minutes marathon.

In ""Babylon"" they always make a scene...it's their mantra, but sometimes it feels try hard and there are too many gross out scenes for the sake of cheap laughs which spoil the artistic integrity of what could have been an epic, flawless expose of old Hollywood in its growing pains with marvellous, moving performances from Pitt, Robbie and Smart.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",babylon is director damien chazelles love letter to a hollywood that predates both him and me a script he says was inspired by the tv series babylon berlin it also has shades of baz luhrmanns moulin rouge and the great gatsby its a salute to the origins of hollywood and la itself before the old hays code banned on screen nudity and drug use and also a commentary on how puritanical modern films are compared to those made almost years ago a look at the formative years from the silent pictures of the s to the golden age in the s where it closes on a famous comedy musical romance about a silent film star who falls for a chorus girl just like that film it deals with the difficult transition to talking pictures in late s hollywood and also like that movie it features some of the biggest stars in hollywood today including brad pitt aussies the technically skilled thespian margot robbie and samara weaving lukas haas jean smart olivia wilde jovan adepo tobey maguire one of this films producers and many more even flea from red hot chilli peppers and albert hammond jnr from the strokes as an extra originally robbies character was meant to be based on the legendary clara bow but that part was rewritten when emma stone la la land dropped out of the project pitt as jack conrad is old hollywood a dinosaur who doesnt know hes extinct yet thrashing about in the tar pool and magic of movies and seems loosely based on a hybrid of john gilbert clarke gable errol flynn and cary grant its much more than a tale of outsized ambition and outrageous excess although the movie opens in a palm grove as diego calvas manny torres attempts to transport an elephant to one of the wildest and most debauched hollywood parties youll ever see the opening title card dont even appear until minutes into babylon into this hours minutes marathon in babylon they always make a sceneits their mantra but sometimes it feels try hard and there are too many gross out scenes for the sake of cheap laughs which spoil the artistic integrity of what could have been an epic flawless expose of old hollywood in its growing pains with marvellous moving performances from pitt robbie and smart,POSITIVE

For some movie lovers it might seem a bit boring and tedious, due to a great amount of long scenes. But not for me. It kept me on the edge of my seat from the very start to the very end. There is meaning in each detail you notice on the screen. This meaning is deeper than one can imagine.

There is drama and comedy mixed with action and elements of horror.

For an actor the very idea of being thrown away like garbage is inappropriate. Being needed, being needed, being a part of something important is what most actors are looking for to keep the bread on the table. Knowing that there's always going to be someone better hurts. Knowing that you will be replaced and forgotten hurts. Knowing that no matter how much impact you made in this area, it will never be enough.

289,289,1.0,17 February 2023,"I think this movie is a prime example of why editing is so important in film. The editing and story of this filmed turned what could have been an insightful and comedic look at the pre-Hays Code era of cinema into a debacle with the pacing of a skit comedy show.

While this movie had great set and costume design, interesting camera movement (although sometimes a bit aggressive), and pretty good acting, the narrative structure was chaotic and the whole thing felt like a bloated mess with no direction.

This film was a weird mix of Ruben Ostland-esque class satire, Old Hollywood musicals, a DW Griffith style grandiose production, and college party movies.

I honestly think that Damien Chazelle picked a few Old Hollywood themes and stories like the influence of African American music at the onset of the talkies, the difficulty of transitioning for a few actors at the dawn of audio in movies, and the Hollywood ""American Dream"" that turns out to be a mirage and lumped them all together through a vignette of scenes that sometimes drew on for far too long.

This all sounds harsh. The movie was enjoyable and sometimes easy to watch, it just took over 3 hours to tell a 90 minute story. Old Hollywood was fun but a facade. The chaos and excess looks appealing from the outside but it will chew you up and spit you out and no one will bat an eye. We get it.

292,292,9.0,20 February 2023,"From the wunderkind behind Whiplash, La La Land & First Man comes a bold, brash & brazen story of outsized ambition & outrageous excess. Set during the era of unbridled decadence & depravity in early Hollywood, Babylon chronicles the rise & fall of multiple characters during the film industry's transition from silent films to talkies, and is undoubtedly the most divisive film of the year.

Written & directed by Damien Chazelle, the film brims with as much cinematic ingenuity as it is smeared with the loud, chaotic & almost overwhelming energy. The prodigal talent here swings for the fences with nothing held back and is also unrelenting in his pursuit but not everyone will vibe with the film's unrestrained aura. However, in between its manic episodes of debauchery, there is an emotional core that grounds it.

The wild, extravagant & glamorous bits do evoke the unabashed & freewheeling spirit of 1920s Hollywood but it's also overdone to the point where it leaves you numb. The film aptly captures the agony, pains & frustration of moving from silent to sound films and the victims the overhaul created in its wake. Margot Robbie, Brad Pitt & Diego Calva shine in their respective roles while Justin Hurwitz yet again delivers a winning score.

Overall, Babylon is a provocative & polarising piece that both honours & critiques its industry by showcasing the alluring & hideous sides of moviemaking business and is at its finest during the soft, tender & quieter moments amidst all the deranged bits. And though the reckless execution, excessive runtime & final sequence didn't work for me, the technical bravura on display and the unhinged performances from the cast makes it at least worth a shot.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",from the wunderkind behind whiplash la la land first man comes a bold brash brazen story of outsized ambition outrageous excess set during the era of unbridled decadence depravity in early hollywood babylon chronicles the rise fall of multiple characters during the film industrys transition from silent films to talkies and is undoubtedly the most divisive film of the year written directed by damien chazelle the film brims with as much cinematic ingenuity as it is smeared with the loud chaotic almost overwhelming energy the prodigal talent here swings for the fences with nothing held back and is also unrelenting in his pursuit but not everyone will vibe with the films unrestrained aura however in between its manic episodes of debauchery there is an emotional core that grounds it the wild extravagant glamorous bits do evoke the unabashed freewheeling spirit of s hollywood but its also overdone to the point where it leaves you numb the film aptly captures the agony pains frustration of moving from silent to sound films and the victims the overhaul created in its wake margot robbie brad pitt diego calva shine in their respective roles while justin hurwitz yet again delivers a winning score overall babylon is a provocative polarising piece that both honours critiques its industry by showcasing the alluring hideous sides of moviemaking business and is at its finest during the soft tender quieter moments amidst all the deranged bits and though the reckless execution excessive runtime final sequence didnt work for me the technical bravura on display and the unhinged performances from the cast makes it at least worth a shot,POSITIVE

The basic plot of this film is essentially SINGIN' IN THE RAIN: how the change from silent movies to talkies changed the business and created winners and losers. There are even some lines directly taken from that film but BABYLON delves much deeper in to the characters of these winners and losers. It is important to remember the connection between these two movies otherwise the fantastic final ten minutes won't make much sense. That fabulous, fantasy-like ending is absolutely perfect for this film, it flips all the negatives and all the sadness on its head creating an optimistic explosion of celebration. Without giving anything away, years later a character watches SINGIN' IN THE RAIN and realizes that people have remembered them after all, that they have made a difference and that some people have almost achieved immortality.

Who will enjoy this? 1. Anyone who has ever read any celebrity story in any magazine or website!

This is the ultimate glossy celebrity gossip big reveal. Ostensibly, it first seems a little superficial; style without substance but then you find out who these people really are, what makes them tick and then you're hooked. Unlike with the recent Netflix film MANK, about the 1930s Hollywood writer, Herman Mankiewicz, unless you knew who Mankiewicz, Mayer and Thalberg were, you wouldn't have clue what was going on, BABYLON, set around that same time requires no background knowledge at all. It's a simple story about three people in the movie industry: two trying to work their way up the greasy pole, one sliding down.

Who will enjoy this? 2. Anyone who does know who Mankiewicz, Mayer and Thalberg were!

This could have been made for those of us who love watching motion pictures from the early thirties. If you're thinking that 1932's WHAT PRICE HOLLYWOOD is more similar to this than SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is (or have even watched WHAT PRICE HOLLYWOOD), then this is definitely your sort of movie! If that's you then you will recognize on whom all these characters are based, you will know the stories, heard the anecdotes the scandals and will love being whisked back to the late twenties/early thirties.

Although it doesn't seem 'historical' to me, I suppose it is and the problem with 'historical' films is that the characters have to be relatable to our modern selves. They can't have the attitudes and opinions of the people actually from that time as they would seem too weird for us to be able to sympathise with. They are therefore 21st century people in 1920s clothes, a necessity but it doesn't hurt this picture. What is sadly lacking however is the fast-talking, wisecracking slang which was one of the great things about American movies of the early thirties - especially at Warner Brothers where James Cagney and Joan Blondell were going at it ten to the dozen. Without that, this doesn't seem as authentic, or should that be, this just don't seem on the level. The 21st century script however is very, very funny.

Who will enjoy this? 3. Anyone who would like to see Margot Robbie for three hours looking incredibly hot!

Other than having an unbreakable appointment with the Grim Reaper, I cannot think of any other reason why anyone of sound body and mind would not want to gaze at Margot Robbie for three hours wearing some of the sexist outfits ever seen on this planet. Margot Robbie of course wouldn't be where she is today if she were just a pretty face and her acting in this picture is absolutely outstanding in making Nellie LeRoy someone you will honestly care personally about. Her portrayal reminded me slightly of Béatrice Dalle in BETTY BLUE inasmuch that all we can see (or are allowed to see) at first is the alluring, sexy image that she projects of herself until she allows us to glimpse her real self whom she has locked up deep inside her own personal dungeon in her mind. Nellie LeRoy's journey is not a fraction as dark as Betty's but Margot Robbie still manages to reveal a subtle and restrained sensitivity behind all that noise. Our own journey with Margot Robbie in this story isn't just how we see her change throughout the story, it makes us examine our own perceptions and attitudes we have made of Nellie and makes us realize that these perceptions can be so easily manipulated and moulded.......and she looks incredibly hot!

Are there any negatives?

Just one - it's too long, it should not be three hours long - there's at least one sub-plot too many but that's the problem when you write, direct, and edit your own film - 'none of my precious film gets left on the cutting room floor!' Damien Chazelle has tried to squeeze too much into his film and after three hours your brain starts to overload a little so that however effective Mr Chazelle is at prodding and poking at your emotions he's not entirely successful. Although he creates very real and completely believable characters, there's a little too much to take in so even after three hours they have still not become your friends. You will definitely feel that you know them and you will really like them but not quite enough to shed any tears over.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",this is one of the most entertaining and

295,295,7.0,22 February 2023,"The pre-Code silent-film Hollywood depicted here in the aptly named ""Babylon"", certainly on the evidence of what the film shows, is a place you wouldn't even want to visit, never mind live there. Or maybe you would! While I accept and believe some of the wild stories I've heard and read about this era down the years, my two prime sources being the notorious ""Hollywood Babylon"" book and at least two series in chronicler and blogger Karina Longworth's excellent ""You Must Remember This"" blogging series, even I was shocked at the level of depravity which permeates pretty much the whole feature.

It starts with two revolting acts of defecation and moves steadily downhill from there, ending up in a Dante meets Hieronymus Bosch nightmare descent to the very depths and dregs of human nature.

We're guided through this hellish odyssey by three individuals, new-to-me Manny Torres' young Italian man besotted with the idea of appearing and working on a movie set, Margot Robbie's wannabe starlet, prepared to do anything, the more outrageous the better, to get to the top and lastly, from a different perspective, Brad Pitt's Jack Conrad, living it large and lording it over everyone as the king of the silent era who then finds himself instantly obsolete when the talkies arrive.

I found it impossible not to detect the real-life counterparts of the Robbie and Pitt characters in the likes of Clara Bow and John Gilbert but given that other stars of the day are clearly referenced, like Garbo, Harlow and Gable, kind of wondered why not just make the film about both those real-life charismatic individuals.

Yes, my eyes popped at the bacchanalian orgiastic scenes but I really was repulsed at many of the scenes of lurid, subhuman excess shown at the end. Yes, it was the Roaring Twenties and the time of gangsters, hot jazz and speakeasys but was it really as out of control at its heart as we see here?

I also found the coda puzzling where the only survivor of the three leads cries when getting to look back twenty years later at Donen and Kelly's altogether kinder look back at the silent / talkies crossover in ""Singin' In The Rain"". Were they just having an ""I was there"" moment or regrets for those who didn't get to live through it?

Despite some great music and an amazingly energetic performance by Robbie, I found the movie to be too much of a stylistic and narrative mess to really engage with me. I'll take ""Singin' In The Rain"" or John Schlesinger's ""The Day Of The Locusts"" over this wildly over-the-top extravaganza any day of the week.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",the precode silentfilm hollywood depicted here in the aptly named babylon certainly on the evidence of what the film shows is a place you wouldnt even want to visit never mind live there or maybe you would while i accept and believe some of the wild stories ive heard and read about this era down the years my two prime sources being the notorious hollywood babylon book and at least two series in chronicler and blogger karina longworths excellent you must remember this blogging series even i was shocked at the level of depravity which permeates pretty much the whole feature it starts with two revolting acts of defecation and moves steadily downhill from there ending up in a dante meets hieronymus bosch nightmare descent to the very depths and dregs of human nature were guided through this hellish odyssey by three individuals newtome manny torres young italian man besotted with the idea of appearing and working on a movie set margot robbies wannabe starlet prepared to do anything the more outrageous the better to get to the top and lastly from a different perspective brad pitts jack conrad living it large and lording it over everyone as the king of the silent era who then finds himself instantly obsolete when the talkies arrive i found it impossible not to detect the reallife counterparts of the robbie and pitt characters in the likes of clara bow and john gilbert but given that other stars of the day are clearly referenced like garbo harlow and gable kind of wondered why not just make the film about both those reallife charismatic individuals yes my eyes popped at the bacchanalian orgiastic scenes but i really was repulsed at many of the scenes of lurid subhuman excess shown at the end yes it was the roaring twenties and the time of gangsters hot jazz and speakeasys but was it really as out of control at its heart as we see here i also found the coda puzzling where the only survivor of the three leads cries when getting to look back twenty years later at donen and kellys altogether kinder look back at the silent talkies crossover in singin in the rain were they just having an i was there moment or regrets for those who didnt get to live through it despite some great music and an amazingly energetic performance by robbie i found the movie to be too much of a stylistic and narrative mess to really engage with me ill take singin in the rain or john schlesingers the day of the locusts over this wildly overthetop extravaganza any day of the week,NEGATIVE

By the third act, however, things started to slow down, and this is not a good thing to happen for a 3 hour film, the story decided to start a new sub plot that not only took away from the rest of the elements of the movie, but what also unintersting.

302,302,9.0,22 January 2023,"I have never enjoyed the film as much as I enjoyed Babylon. It quickly became my favorite, replacing Once Upon A Time In Hollywood.

Margot Robbie is a star. Brad Pitt is a legend. Diego Calva carried the film like a real lead man he is. Diego Calva says thousands of words with his eyes. Hollywood needs Diego Calva. What an actor. And insane chemistry between Diego and Margot. Both of them are natural born actors!

Jean Smart, Li Jun Li, Jovan Adepo, all of them were great. I needed more of Tobey Maguire. He was so creepy and funny. Olivia Hamilton was so hilarious.

P. J. Byrne cracked us up. We all were trying not to laugh out loud, but we couldn't stop. Everyone in the audience was laughing.

Nobody has left the theatre until the very end.

I laughed, I cried, I felt every possible emotion. Damien Chazelle is a world class genius. If you don't understand geniuses and don't love the real cinema, this film is not for you.

It does divide audience, but I am happy I belong to those people who enjoyed the film. I'd watch another 3 hours of it.

Damien, give us the full cut and I will watch every second of it. Can't wait to watch it again.

I hate how underrated this film is. It deserves every award in the world. How sad is that Academy sucks now. Or they'd give award to Margot Robbie and Diego Calva and of course Damien Chazelle. Sad, Academy won't even nominate them.

303,303,6.0,6 February 2023,"""Babylon"" is a historical drama film set in the vibrant and decadent world of 1926 Hollywood, directed by the talented Damien Chazelle. The film takes place at a wild industry party in Bel-Air, California, where the guests are filled with excitement and anticipation as they wait to see the latest Hollywood spectacle.

The film's main characters include Margot Robbie as Nellie LaRoy, a Jersey girl with a big dream of breaking into show business. She is determined, ambitious, and willing to do whatever it takes to make it in the industry. On the other hand, Brad Pitt stars as Jack Conrad, a famous silent movie star who is a womanizer and boozer. He represents the typical Hollywood star of the time, a person who is rich and famous but lacks stability and responsibility.

The film also explores the careers of two aspiring actors, Manny Torres, and Sidney Powell, both of whom are trying to make a name for themselves in the industry. Manny, who is of Mexican descent, dreams of working in the movie business but is faced with the challenges of discrimination and prejudice. On the other hand, Sidney is a talented jazz trumpeter who is building a career as a black performer on screen, despite the challenges he faces because of the color of his skin.

The film is said to be a tribute to the early days of Hollywood and the transition from silent films to talkies. With influences from the classic film ""Singin' in the Rain"" (1952), ""Babylon"" offers a nostalgic look at the golden era of Hollywood and the challenges that the actors and filmmakers of the time faced. The film's technical aspects, such as the cinematography, set design, and costume design, are truly excellent, immersing the viewer into the glitz and glamour of the 1920s.

The story of ""Babylon"" is overly ambitious with a weak love story. While the film offers a glimpse into the lives of the Hollywood elite, the convoluted plot and uneven pacing detract from the overall viewing experience. Nevertheless, ""Babylon"" remains a stylish and visually stunning tribute to the early days of Hollywood, and is a must-watch for fans of the golden era of cinema.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",babylon is a historical drama film set in the vibrant and decadent world of hollywood directed by the talented damien chazelle the film takes place at a wild industry party in belair california where the guests are filled with excitement and anticipation as they wait to see the latest hollywood spectacle the films main characters include margot robbie as nellie laroy a jersey girl with a big dream of breaking into show business she is determined ambitious and willing to do whatever it takes to make it in the industry on the other hand brad pitt stars as jack conrad a famous silent movie star who is a womanizer and boozer he represents the typical hollywood star of the time a person who is rich and famous but lacks stability and responsibility the film also explores the careers of two aspiring actors manny torres and sidney powell both of whom are trying to make a name for themselves in the industry manny who is of mexican descent dreams of working in the movie business but is faced with the challenges of discrimination and prejudice on the other hand sidney is a talented jazz trumpeter who is building a career as a black performer on screen despite the challenges he faces because of the color of his skin the film is said to be a tribute to the early days of hollywood and the transition from silent films to talkies with influences from the classic film singin in the rain babylon offers a nostalgic look at the golden era of hollywood and the challenges that the actors and filmmakers of the time faced the films technical aspects such as the cinematography set design and costume design are truly excellent immersing the viewer into the glitz and glamour of the s the story of babylon is overly ambitious with a weak love story while the film offers a glimpse into the lives of the hollywood elite the convoluted plot and uneven pacing detract from the overall viewing experience nevertheless babylon remains a stylish and visually stunning tribute to the early days of hollywood and is a mustwatch for fans of the golden era of cinema,POSITIVE
304,304,9.0,17 January 2023,"I can see why this movie failed. It is a big mouthful of stuff to chew. BUT it is great! The characters are well written and acted. The art direction is great. The sets and colors are beautiful and recall the time and vibe of the time period they are meant to represent. Even more, the art direction helps to underscore the many themes this movie takes on.

But center stage is the director, Damien Chazelle. He directed the hell out of this movie. There is so much going on all of the time. It can be a little overwhelming, like Terry Gilliam's Brazil or Coppola's Apocalypse Now . But that's a good thing and it is clearly meant to quote those films in that way. The character arcs are well written and the scenes come rapid-fire one after the other. There are so many layers to each scene that help tell, not only the stories of the lead characters, but simultaneously the story of Hollywood. There are casts of hundreds recreating scenes that you haven't seen since the days of Lawrence of Arabia or Gone with the Wind. Huge crane shots. Oner's that dizzy the mind. This movie quotes heavily from Singing in the Rain. In fact, it's almost a remake of that film. It also quotes from Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights with it's heavy handed camera movements and a special scene that recalls the coked out Alfred Molina and some firecrackers.

This film is long but never boring. I thoroughly enjoyed it from beginning to end and it is much better than most films in the last 5 years. It's very ambitious and it's smart. It is a film that offers a warning about the excesses of today and is reflective upon what is coming out of Hollywood and other media creation outlets and why. While it is a love letter to the film industry, ultimately it is harshly critical of that industry.

307,307,1.0,24 July 2024,"A tale of outsized ambition and outrageous excess, it traces an original epic set in 1920s Los Angeles led by Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie and Diego Calva. A tale of outsized ambition and outrageous excess, it traces the rise and fall of multiple characters during an era of unbridled decadence and depravity in early Hollywood. In the early and mid-1920s, wild parties, sex, alcohol, drugs, and other behaviors caused a series of scandals. Its begins with Nellie LaRoy (Margot Robbie) , a streetwise nobody and brassy wannabe starlet, who crashes an orgiastic, sex-and-drug-fuelled Hollywood party. There she meets ""Manny"" Torres (Diego Calva) meets a truck driver set to help him transport an elephant to a party being thrown by studio executive Don Wallach (Jeff Garlin). Manny is instantly dazzled and falls in love with Nellie. Arriving at the party is veteran actor Jack Conrad (Brad Pitt), whose wife Ina (Olivia Wilde) demands a divorce after he keeps speaking to her in Italian and not taking her seriously.

Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie and Diego Calva with an ensemble cast including Jovan Adepo, Li Jun Li and Jean Smart all of them star in this wild, extravagant, overwhelming, excessive and uninhibited (among many other adjectives) film. Hollywood epic from the late 1920s, years in which the emergence of talkies began. Told in the form of an epic comedy-drama, it is surprisingly directed by Damien Chazelle. In 'Babylon', excess, depravity and decadence follow the thunderous lives of a motley group of people in the bonfire of the vanities of a Hollywood marked by sex, drugs and ambition. Developing through endless feists, wild shoots, and with artists willing to do anything to achieve their dream: get a big role in order to achieve fame and fortune. The film depicts the extreme excesses of the early film industry, just before the Hays Production Code. In the early and mid-1920s, wild parties, sex, alcohol, drugs, and other behaviors caused a series of scandals. The major studios wanted to to control actors and actresses outside the filming sets and present a more respectable, distinguished, elegant image to the audience. Will H. Hays, a prominent right-wing politician and Presbyterian deacon, designed the Hays Code after the 'Fatty Arbuckle scandal', the latter is re-enacted in some scenes at the beginning of the film. The movie covers the harsh and delirious portrait of the great bacchanal that was Hollywood. Having as a common thread Manny Torres, a young Mexican who fights to reach the highest levels and leave his mark in cinema. One ridiculous and absurd situation after another adds to the high-speed fun. The film successfully brought together famous stars and earned a moderate gross at the box office, being panned by a lot of critics. Despite good and some hilarious intentions, the film takes itself too seriously as a tribute to film pioneers. But with Damien Chazelle's wistful nostalgia partially lacking in perspective, this uneven reenactment becomes entirely a work of times past; there's certainly enough wit, rhythm or verve to suggest it's alive. There are fun sketches and cute sets about the silent filming with a series of anecdotes highlighting the mistakes, failures and upheavals. However, in some scenes, several actors are completely exposed, mugging in a clumsy and charming manner. Throughout all its outlandish incidents, this wacky drama/comedy about early silent films rarely manages to elicit laughs. Filmmaker Damien Chazelle's pacing seems a mistake at times and his actors could be acceptable when trying to record real roles. There are acceptable actors paying silent film clichés and especially paying homage to ¨Singin' in the rain¨ and other films. And the main roles are based on real people: Margot Robbie as Nellie to be based on Clara Bow, the original ""It Girl"" who scandalized the United States by being open about her sexual desires; the character of Lady Fay Zhu is loosely based on Anna May Wong (1905-1961) the first Chinese-American actress in Hollywood whose career spanned both silent and sound films; Olivia Hamilton's character is Dorothy Arzner, one of the first female directors in early Hollywood; Jean Smart is inspired by two real-life people: Louella Parsons, Hedda Hopper, the two biggest gossips of the golden era of Hollywood and the rol Jack Conrad/Brad Pitt is inspired by actors Douglas Fairbanks and John Gilbert.

The film was nominated for three Oscars in 2023, although I didn't get awards .The motion picture was well though eccentrically directed by Damien Chazelle and following the style of Ken Russell. Chazelle packs his ordinary trademarks: his films often revolve heavily around jazz music, often revolve around people who are defined by their potential talent and ambition, Whip pan, as well as rapid-fire edits. Damien is an expert director of actors who bring out the best in themselves, in fact he directed 3 Oscar nominated performances: J. K. Simmons, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone; Simmons and Stone won for their performances in his films. This director is known for his hits: La La Land (2016), Whiplash (2014) y First Man (2018). Rating Babylon (2022): 6.5/10. The film will appeal to Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie fans.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",a tale of outsized ambition and outrageous excess it traces an original epic set in s los angeles led by

312,312,9.0,3 January 2023,"Director Damien Chazelle really has made an epic and in depth film with ""Babylon"" which looks at the start and the very early days of ""Hollywood"" in the 1920's, as the picture spans thru the roaring decade when cinema was just getting afloat. Historic and revealing and telling was seeing how the 35mm camera was introduced to record on film sets, also the transformation of silent film to talkies then on to sound and music is shown as you see it go all the way up to ""Singing in the Rain""! Actually it's like I felt I was back in cinema history class in college.

However aside from all of the big substance the film is plenty of style on the eyes as the costumes, cinematography, and make up captures the moment and times of the era so well, the film is also bold and brash with raw looks at how the characters lived their lives with excess of alcohol, drugs, and dealing with life while rising to fame all before having tragic falls.

You see Jack Conrad(in another wonderful turn from Brad Pitt) as he tangles with love, stardom, and the bottle as life is a whirlwind as he transitions with the discover of sound in pictures before he's yesterdays news. Also in a spitfire and free spirited carefree performance is from Margot Robbie we she her shine as the sexy and go against the grain actress Nellie LaRoy who lives it up in a wild and outrageous oversized way.

Yet the wild card and most touching character of the film is young Manny Torres(Diego Calva) who came to the city with nothing only wanting his foot on a stage set, and as he gets his wish he rides the wild and wicked roller coaster of Hollywood seeing the games, and ins and outs of the business all combined with luck, and talent, and hard work. Also the film has notable supporting performances from Jean Smart(""Hacks"") as Elinor St. John a gossip reporter and look for some funny moments from ""Flea""(""Red Hot Chili Peppers"").

315,315,6.0,8 January 2023,"It seems that Babylon has sparked some debate online. It is being hailed as both a masterpiece by some and complete self indulgent trash by others. I try to not let the chatter influence my desire to see or what I think about a film bit I knew I was in for an experience.....

To be honest I got almost exactly what I thought I would get. It is a 3 hour and 10 minute celebration of debauchery and filmmaking but it is not as daring and original as many might think. Damien Chazelle is a very talented director and has an energetic style but he can't overcome his self indulgent script that seems to want to say many things and actually says nothing.

The film is set in 1928 and follows a group of characters through the end of the silent film era to the transition to talkies. The best scenes in the film deal with how silent films were producesld and some with the difficulties in filming films with sound in the infancy of the format. There truly is no main character but the character we follow most is Nellie LaRpy played by Margot Robbie. She is a wild aspiring actress that becomes the Hollywood "" it girl"". There is Manny played by Diego Calva that plays a film assistant that wants to grow within the film industry. And Brad Pitt plays John Conrad. A big silent film star that is having problems transitioning to films with sound. The film focuses very much on the lavish and wild parties of the day which are pretty much mass orgies. All of this is done with great cinematography and set design and there is an emphasis on being as raunchy as possible but the film isn't really as daring in it's presentation this. It's been done before. The film is really long and though not boring it does get tedious in is outrageousness. There is a switch in tone in the last couple ofi Utes that is so unearned that it feels like it's from a completely different film.

The film wants to put a mirror to Hollywood with its excess but it's been done before. As good as the film is made and acted it just has nothing new to say that hasn't been said before about Hollywood and filmmaking.

320,320,8.0,24 December 2022,"Babylon is Damien Chazelle's latest movie and it's..... ambitious. It's mostly enjoyable, pretty funny, somewhat investing, and you can really tell how much work went into making it.

With the exception of some really bad audio dubbing, I found it to be well-made in all technical aspects. It's filled with long single-take shots involving so many people. And Margot Robbie gives her best performance to date.

Having said all that, I don't see myself ever watching this again. And this is coming from someone who rewatches movies all the time, my favorites as many as 10+ times. It's not because of the long runtime. It's just something that I can enjoy but would never crave.

Also, there are multiple times where I was completely disgusted by what I saw on the screen. And that's coming from someone who's extremely desensitized. It's just gross. And there are some weird scenes where I questioned why they were in the movie.

323,323,7.0,28 December 2022,"Bear with me here. This might be tough to explain.

Director Damian Chazelle is a conundrum. He directed a film about Hollywood's excesses in the Twenties and Thirties. And in doing so he created 'Babylon', a film containing many scenes that themselves suffer from excesses; Sewage-pipe parties, Hollywood orgies, filmed battles, snake battles, rat-digesting, women wrestling, bodily eliminations, and more. Much More. Some (but not all) of these scenes actually do 'work'. They are, if nothing else, eye candy. But none of them work for the excessive amount of screen time, and likely production time, devoted to them. I wanted to holler, Ok. Enough. I got it. An example is a relatively sedate scene during which Margot Robbie's aspiring film-star character has to repeat her lines again and again. And then, again. And once more. Or twice. The point (assuming there was one) was made after the fourth or fifth attempt. But no. On we go. And even when the scene is finally shot, and the director says, 'Cut', still there is more. In 'Babylon' 'more' is always more.

My sense is that a two hour version of this three hour film (with those excesses trimmed) might have been a real winner. There are moments when the film presents the story in a more deeply personal way, and in those scenes the story's poignancy gets across. A quiet conversation between failing movie star Jack Morgan (Brad Pitt) and a gossip columnist (Jean Smart). Another between Toby McGuire as a Hollywood hoodlum and Diego Calva (playing Manni Torres, the film's hero). If nothing else these scenes demonstrate the talent of Director Chazelle.

Now for a personal gripe. The film's music. It's, it's .... all wrong. The late Twenties and early Thirties was a time of distinctive music; a jazz which, when heard, brings one back to that era (even those who never lived through it). Think of the Warner Brothers musicals of that era. 'Gold Diggers', 'Forty Second Street'. But 'Babylon', in its party scenes (and there are plenty) the music provided by live musicians is nothing like that era's. In fact the music has a tribal beat, an African sort of hysteria. Now I could imagine this at one of the parties. But at all of them? Why? What was Chazelle's idea?

The story itself is relatively simple. We've got two main characters; Margot Robbie's who is hopefully on her way up, and Brad Pitt's whose best days are behind him. Pitt commands the screen. He is as true a movie star here as was the character he played (supposedly John Gilbert). Margot Robbie as a Clara Bow movie type is a powerful presence. But I found her character hard to hold onto; perhaps it was her diction, it seemed to change at various times over the film's course.

So. Six stars out of ten. A bit on the generous side. But a lot of work went into this film, this 'Babylon'.

It's the least I could do.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",bear with me here this might be tough to explain director damian chazelle is a conundrum he directed a film about hollywoods excesses in the twenties and thirties and in doing so he created babylon a film containing many scenes that themselves suffer from excesses sewagepipe parties hollywood orgies filmed battles snake battles ratdigesting women wrestling bodily eliminations and more much more some but not all of these scenes actually do work they are if nothing else eye candy but none of them work for the excessive amount of screen time and likely production time devoted to them i wanted to holler ok enough i got it an example is a relatively sedate scene during which margot robbies aspiring filmstar character has to repeat her lines again and again and then again and once more or twice the point assuming there was one was made after the fourth or fifth attempt but no on we go and even when the scene is finally shot and the director says cut still there is more in babylon more is always more my sense is that a two hour version of this three hour film with those excesses trimmed might have been a real winner there are moments when the film presents the story in a more deeply personal way and in those scenes the storys poignancy gets across a quiet conversation between failing movie star jack morgan brad pitt and a gossip columnist jean smart another between toby mcguire as a hollywood hoodlum and diego calva playing manni torres the films hero if nothing else these scenes demonstrate the talent of director chazelle now for a personal gripe the films music its its all wrong the late twenties and early thirties was a time of distinctive music a jazz which when heard brings one back to that era even those who never lived through it think of the warner brothers musicals of that era gold diggers forty second street but babylon in its party scenes and there are plenty the music provided by live musicians is nothing like that eras in fact the music has a tribal beat an african sort of hysteria now i could imagine this at one of the parties but at all of them why what was chazelles idea the story itself is relatively simple weve got two main characters margot robbies who is hopefully on her way up and brad pitts whose best days are behind him pitt commands the screen he is as true a movie star here as was the character he played supposedly john gilbert margot robbie as a clara bow movie type is a powerful presence but i found her character hard to hold onto perhaps it was her diction it seemed to change at various times over the films course diego calva as our hero manni is dynamic when he has to be and lovingly soft when he can afford to be perhaps here is a starmaking performance so six stars out of ten a bit on the generous side but a lot of work went into this film this babylon its the least i could do,POSITIVE

People need to keep in mind that 1920s hollywood was crazy with minimum restrictions, as it is portayed in the movie. But its not only about that. Its about the people who actually don't want that, but who instead want something to be remembered for.

As we follow Jack Conrad, Nellie LaRoy and Manny Torres as well as Sydney Palmer, Babylon tells a thrilling and amazing story about excess, glory, relations and the meaning of movies.

As the people in it want to be, Babylon is a movie for the ages in my opinion.

The first major section of the story stands above the rest, and I can only imagine this is because editors took a closer eye to the opening of the movie and quality assurance kinda fell off as it went. The core premise of the three protagonists at different points of moving through Hollywood life is fascinating, but it often hyperfixates on unnecessary aspects of that life or just goes on insane tangents about even more characters. Tobey Maguire's scenes, the opening, and the ending seem like the feeling of decadent insanity the film wanted, and I just want it to find a way to stick to it and remain watchable. Babylon deserves to be re-made into a more effective story by cutting ~15-20 minutes and re-editing some scenes, because as is all that's really holding it up is the undeniable love the cast and crew has for the people and time it's depicting. 🌟","December 23, 2022 (United States)",babylon is an extremely passionate love letter to old hollywood creatives but its practically incoherent sometimes the first major section of the story stands above the rest and i can only imagine this is because editors took a closer eye to the opening of the movie and quality assurance kinda fell off as it went the core premise of the three protagonists at different points of moving through hollywood life is fascinating but it often hyperfixates on unnecessary aspects of that life or just goes on insane tangents about even more characters tobey maguires scenes the opening and the ending seem like the feeling of decadent insanity the film wanted and i just want it to find a way to stick to it and remain watchable babylon deserves to be remade into a more effective story by cutting minutes and reediting some scenes because as is all thats really holding it up is the undeniable love the cast and crew has for the people and time its depicting,NEGATIVE
329,329,2.0,8 February 2023,"I remember hearing things about Babylon long before it came out that made it sound amazing. A three-hour epic with a fantastic cast about an interesting period in Hollywood history, and written/directed by Damien Chazelle. It sounded too good to be true, and when the critical reception ended up mixed, I feared it might be. Turns out I'm an idiot, but so are the critics, because Babylon is brilliant.

There's nothing better than a 3+ hour movie that flies by and doesn't feel like it wastes any time at all, and I can say that about Babylon. It constantly finds ways to top itself and continue pushing boundaries. Every scene is entertaining and adds something. It's all just filled to the brim with style, fun, tension, and heartbreak. It's overflowing with emotions and all of them hit. I think I felt everything Chazelle wanted the audience to feel at every individual moment.

It all builds to another fantastic ending for the director. The guy knows how to end a film, and how such a dark and disgusting movie can conclude with something so sentimental (and so ridiculous sounding on paper) is remarkable. It borrows heavily from Cinema Paradiso's climax, the same way Babylon's entire structure borrows heavily from Boogie Nights. But it borrows things well, and ends up being self-aware about how it's recycling tropes, motifs, and movies in general... and on top of that, it successfully argues that that's okay, brilliantly justifying its self-indulgence and excesses through the closing scenes.

I can't say enough good things about Babylon. If I'm allowed one more hyperbolic statement, it would be that this the music score is one of the best ever written for a movie. I'm serious. It's truly one of the greatest I've ever heard, and feels instantly iconic and memorable.

The movie's a masterpiece. I think time will be kind to it, and that much of the criticism thrown at it is ridiculous. I fear they're not going to give Chazelle a budget like this again (it's underperformed apparently), but at least we've seen what he can do with such immense resources at his disposal: make one of the greatest movies of the 2020s so far.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",i remember hearing things about babylon long before it came out that made it sound amazing a threehour epic with a fantastic cast about an interesting period in hollywood history and writtendirected by damien chazelle it sounded too good to be true and when the critical reception ended up mixed i feared it might be turns out im an idiot but so are the critics because babylon is brilliant theres nothing better than a hour movie that flies by and doesnt feel like it wastes any time at all and i can say that about babylon it constantly finds ways to top itself and continue pushing boundaries every scene is entertaining and adds something its all just filled to the brim with style fun tension and heartbreak its overflowing with emotions and all of them hit i think i felt everything chazelle wanted the audience to feel at every individual moment it all builds to another fantastic ending for the director the guy knows how to end a film and how such a dark and disgusting movie can conclude with something so sentimental and so ridiculous sounding on paper is remarkable it borrows heavily from cinema paradisos climax the same way babylons entire structure borrows heavily from boogie nights but it borrows things well and ends up being selfaware about how its recycling tropes motifs and movies in general and on top of that it successfully argues that thats okay brilliantly justifying its selfindulgence and excesses through the closing scenes i cant say enough good things about babylon if im allowed one more hyperbolic statement it would be that this the music score is one of the best ever written for a movie im serious its truly one of the greatest ive ever heard and feels instantly iconic and memorable the movies a masterpiece i think time will be kind to it and that much of the criticism thrown at it is ridiculous i fear theyre not going to give chazelle a budget like this again its underperformed apparently but at least weve seen what he can do with such immense resources at his disposal make one of the greatest movies of the s so far,POSITIVE

332,332,9.0,21 January 2023,"I approached my viewing of BABYLON with mixed feelings given the wildly differing opinions about it. As it turns out, it was exceptional. The ancient city of Babylon was known for its opulence and decadence, and the film is an apt reflection of its namesake. BABYLON, the movie, tells a captivatingly gripping story of ambition, excess, and depravity in Hollywood during the transition from silent films to sound films. The characters are fleshed out incredibly well; you understand their motivations for acting the way they do, and you root for them even as they make poor decisions. The cinematography is superb, with a focus on glamour and opulence. The soundtrack is fittingly decadent and jazz-influenced, adding to the atmosphere of the film.

Margot Robbie, who plays Nellie LaRoy, the lead character, delivers an excellent performance. She perfectly captures the contradictions of Nellie's ambition and insecurity as she makes her way through a world of characters who are out to capitalise on her talents.

Brad Pitt, portraying Jack Conrad, is also particularly good. His portrayal of a morally bankrupt yet charismatic figure is spot on. Rather than being actual historical figures, Nellie LaRoy and Jack Conrad are fictional composite characters and serve as allegorical figures to illustrate the excesses of Hollywood during this era.

The director, Damien Chazelle, brings the story to life with an expertly crafted script and powerful performances. He clearly loves cinema but is brutally honest in his portrayal of the ruthlessness and decadence of Hollywood. He artfully juxtaposes ambition and excess with morality and integrity. It's a captivating tale that helps us to understand how the movies of old were made, and why they still have such a lasting impact.

I can understand why some people hate the movie and even walk out. The opening scene is an over-the-top party that is one big orgy of gluttony, sex, gross behaviour, drugs, and excess - and it goes on for an extended period before the main title of the movie comes on screen. But once you get past this, it becomes obvious that this scene is a microcosm of what BABYLON is about - and it sets the tone for the rest of the movie which settles into a fascinating story of ambition, excess, and morality.

For those who stick with it to the end, there's a great payoff. This is a warts-and-all, no punches pulled, exploration of a very dark Hollywood in the late 1920s and 1930s. It's a story that is at once engrossing and thought-provoking.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",i approached my viewing of babylon with mixed feelings given the wildly differing opinions about it as it turns out it was exceptional the ancient city of babylon was known for its opulence and decadence and the film is an apt reflection of its namesake babylon the movie tells a captivatingly gripping story of ambition excess and depravity in hollywood during the transition from silent films to sound films the characters are fleshed out incredibly well you understand their motivations for acting the way they do and you root for them even as they make poor decisions the cinematography is superb with a focus on glamour and opulence the soundtrack is fittingly decadent and jazzinfluenced adding to the atmosphere of the film margot robbie who plays nellie laroy the lead character delivers an excellent performance she perfectly captures the contradictions of nellies ambition and insecurity as she makes her way through a world of characters who are out to capitalise on her talents brad pitt portraying jack conrad is also particularly good his portrayal of a morally bankrupt yet charismatic figure is spot on rather than being actual historical figures nellie laroy and jack conrad are fictional composite characters and serve as allegorical figures to illustrate the excesses of hollywood during this era the director damien chazelle brings the story to life with an expertly crafted script and powerful performances he clearly loves cinema but is brutally honest in his portrayal of the ruthlessness and decadence of hollywood he artfully juxtaposes ambition and excess with morality and integrity its a captivating tale that helps us to understand how the movies of old were made and why they still have such a lasting impact i can understand why some people hate the movie and even walk out the opening scene is an overthetop party that is one big orgy of gluttony sex gross behaviour drugs and excess and it goes on for an extended period before the main title of the movie comes on screen but once you get past this it becomes obvious that this scene is a microcosm of what babylon is about and it sets the tone for the rest of the movie which settles into a fascinating story of ambition excess and morality for those who stick with it to the end theres a great payoff this is a wartsandall no punches pulled exploration of a very dark hollywood in the late s and s its a story that is at once engrossing and thoughtprovoking,POSITIVE

334,334,9.0,3 February 2023,"It's pretty much everything good and bad you can imagine about Hollywood.

As Damien Chazelle said, this film is his love letter to the movies, or may I add, to the film lovers, and a hate one to the very industry.

The remarkable scores, throughout the entire thing, kept reminding me of La La Land, which it surely should. They did their jobs, create the unsettled, suspenseful, and rather gripping feelings in most of the sequences. In some scenes, the Jazz straight-up gave me glimpses of the director's 2016 award-winning film. These might as well be my favorite aspect of this piece of art.

The casts are just phenomenal. I meant, how are you going to make a movie about the 20s, or 30s Hollywood if you're not going to star Brad Pitt? The old guy just did it again. His character was, without a doubt, lovable and unexpectedly, piteous. Now for Margot, I believe she really just went ""all in"" for this one. Hers and the memorable performance of her partner, Diego Calva, whom I've seen on the screen for the first time, were what kept me invested throughout the middle and near the end of the film. After all, this is most likely that one ""lovely"" part of Babylon.

In conclusion, even though I, myself very much love this movie, I believe it's not going to be an easy watch. But if you consider yourself a film lover you should go watch it.

337,337,1.0,7 March 2023,"If there's one thing in common with Damien Chazelle's films, it's how they center on the sacrifices people endure to pursue their dreams. Whiplash (2014) focused on the physical limits someone might endure to become a successful drummer. La La Land (2016) highlighted how relationships and careers might need to take a second seat to pursuing a dream. First Man (2018) showed how a family might suffer to pursue something greater. Following this trend, Babylon (2022) gives light to the inability of some who have attained their dream-sometimes at great personal cost-to keep it in an ever-changing world.

I can succinctly state the problem with Babylon as ""I didn't need to see that."" Clocking in at over three hours long, there were plenty of storylines that could have been cut. For instance, we've already seen Brad Pitt's story of a famed silent film star struggling to find relevance in the talkies through the Best Picture, The Artist (2011). In fact, the whole of Babylon comes off as a gritty remake of Singin' in the Rain (1952). Additionally, within the first five minutes, there's elephant defecation and a woman urinating on a man-and this is well before Margot Robbie has projectile vomiting later in the film.

It's tragic that Babylon could have been better. There are significant moments that worked really well and highlighted the differences and difficulties working with sound. There's also excellent subtext about making it in this era of Hollywood through hard work (if you're non-white) or just plain luck (if you're white). Topping everything off is the ear-worm-worthy score by Justin Hurwitz, which should win all the awards it deserves. I wanted to like Babylon more, but there's only so much that can recommend it without having to also suggest fast-forwarding through other bits.

A bloated, if not occasionally poignant look at the Hollywood transition to talkies, I give Babylon 3.5 stars out of 5.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",if theres one thing in common with damien chazelles films its how they center on the sacrifices people endure to pursue their dreams whiplash focused on the physical limits someone might endure to become a successful drummer la la land highlighted how relationships and careers might need to take a second seat to pursuing a dream first man showed how a family might suffer to pursue something greater following this trend babylon gives light to the inability of some who have attained their dreamsometimes at great personal costto keep it in an everchanging world i can succinctly state the problem with babylon as i didnt need to see that clocking in at over three hours long there were plenty of storylines that could have been cut for instance weve already seen brad pitts story of a famed silent film star struggling to find relevance in the talkies through the best picture the artist in fact the whole of babylon comes off as a gritty remake of singin in the rain additionally within the first five minutes theres elephant defecation and a woman urinating on a manand this is well before margot robbie has projectile vomiting later in the film its tragic that babylon could have been better there are significant moments that worked really well and highlighted the differences and difficulties working with sound theres also excellent subtext about making it in this era of hollywood through hard work if youre nonwhite or just plain luck if youre white topping everything off is the earwormworthy score by justin hurwitz which should win all the awards it deserves i wanted to like babylon more but theres only so much that can recommend it without having to also suggest fastforwarding through other bits a bloated if not occasionally poignant look at the hollywood transition to talkies i give babylon stars out of,POSITIVE

340,340,1.0,25 February 2023,"Intrepid and brave work by Damian Chazelle. The debauched and hellish depiction is presented as a Hollywood 'in times gone by piece'. But isn't this Hollywood, then and now too?

348,348,6.0,30 August 2023,"A new champ has arisen to take the crown of Worst Movie I've Ever Seen--Babylon. What a waste of money and talent, to come up with this bloated, excessive, heavy-handed mess. This movie starts with someone being pooped upon by an elephant, immediately followed by someone being peed upon during sex, then going into a way too long full-blown orgy scene--I guess the director was trying to grab our attention. But the effect was the opposite--I was looking at my watch about 10 minutes into the movie, wondering when the plot would start to develop. When you start out over-the-top like that, it's hard to keep up the level. To do it, the director must have given his cast instructions to scream at the top of their lungs in almost every scene, because that's what they did. Margot Robbie went overboard in her portrayal of an aggressively vulgar sexpot, which eventually wore a bit thin, to the point where you wanted to just change the station. In a crescendo moment, Brad Pitt delivers a passionate defence of the movies to his more 'theatre arts' type wife, claiming that movies are the art of the 'real' people, not the 'phony' New York snobs. But a crescendo is something that builds to peak: like everything else in this film, it's all one great plateau of loudness and screaming. You can almost sense the director prompting, 'Brad, scream louder, so they'll know you're really Acting!"" Poor Brad Pitt, after the subtle and wonderful performance he gave us in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, to be involved in this mess. I will just mention that there is a ridiculous scene of Margot thrashing around with a rattlesnake, its fangs embedded in her neck, which also went on far too long. For your added entertainment, the F word was used in all its variations--as a verb, noun, adjective, adverb--in almost every sentence. All this would maybe be forgivable if you were left with some real feeling, some depth, some emotion. But it's flat. If everything is at the same volume, there's nothing that stands out. It's all Eleven.

352,352,9.0,3 February 2023,"As a non-American who grew up mostly watching American movies and dreaming of someday being a big shot in Hollywood (which never happened and at this point never will), I can completely understand Damien Chazelle's nostalgia-driven love letter to the cinema of old.

A sobering view of all the things we lost in today's American cinema: politically correct, franchise-based, boring, predictable, multi-platform CONTENT.

They just don't make them as they used to.

Except for this one, an unapologetic three-hour epic, with lavish, exuberant, and daring visuals, clearly influenced by Robert Altman constructed of several smaller storylines intermingled to create a story of a place instead of an individual and featuring a group of well-written characters.

Damien Chazelle looks at Hollywood of old in a respectful but sobering view, he's not shying away from racism, privilege, or the way Hollywood cannibalizes its tragedies for profit, but even when showing Hollywood at its worst, the movie is filled with pure love for cinema and the people behind it.

If anything the movie ends with a pretty optimistic view that cinema will survive and thrive despite Hollywood dying.

Like Quintin Tarantino before him (""Once upon a time in Hollywood"") it's clear Damien Chazelle notices Hollywood coming downfall and Babylon is his loving well-crafted Requiem.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",as a nonamerican who grew up mostly watching american movies and dreaming of someday being a big shot in hollywood which never happened and at this point never will i can completely understand damien chazelles nostalgiadriven love letter to the cinema of old a sobering view of all the things we lost in todays american cinema politically correct franchisebased boring predictable multiplatform content they just dont make them as they used to except for this one an unapologetic threehour epic with lavish exuberant and daring visuals clearly influenced by robert altman constructed of several smaller storylines intermingled to create a story of a place instead of an individual and featuring a group of wellwritten characters damien chazelle looks at hollywood of old in a respectful but sobering view hes not shying away from racism privilege or the way hollywood cannibalizes its tragedies for profit but even when showing hollywood at its worst the movie is filled with pure love for cinema and the people behind it if anything the movie ends with a pretty optimistic view that cinema will survive and thrive despite hollywood dying like quintin tarantino before him once upon a time in hollywood its clear damien chazelle notices hollywood coming downfall and babylon is his loving wellcrafted requiem,POSITIVE

355,355,7.0,16 June 2023,"I saw Babylon and to my surprise it is not as bad as some say. Perhaps because I am a frustrated filmmaker, I immediately connected with the plot covering the transition from silent to talkies in Hollywood in the 1920s.

The film written and directed by Damien Chazelle presents the rise of three Hollywood celebrities: John Conrad (Brad Pitt), Nellie LaRoy (Margot Robbie) and Manny Torres (Diego Calva), among others, and how pressure and excesses destroy them .

While watching the movie, I felt like I was at a party where liquor, drugs and lust reign, so it maintains a fast pace that doesn't get boring. However, sometimes it tries to cover too much by cutting from one story to another and one gets lost and takes several seconds to reconnect with the plot.

For me Margot Robbie steals the movie in every scene that comes out (as she did in the first Suicide Squad movie).

Did I mention it's three hours long? Perhaps that is why by the end I was already tired of so many turns and twists, and this is the reason why many did not like it.

I was very attentive to everything related to filming at that time, but I don't know if this element appealed to the general public. Something like what happened with the Puerto Rican movie ""I am a Director.""

Another point in Babylon's favor is that it has an R rating for sexual content, violence, and is not afraid to take advantage of it.

356,356,2.0,4 August 2024,"I had my doubts about diving into this movie, after seeing the trailer and reading the reviews. The attacks against the movie because of the decadence and depravity onscreen are understandable - before the title card appears 32 minutes into the film, audiences are treated to what best can be described as a pornographic Fellini film merged with The Wolf of Wall Street. It's as if writer/director Damien Chazelle wanted to separate the casual viewers from the curious ones immediately. After the first 8 minutes, you'll either give up on the movie or proceed. And if you proceed, you probably won't be disappointed.

The movie turns into a deranged love letter to early Hollywood and focuses on the transition from silent films to sound films. Singin' in the Rain instantly comes to mind and Babylon turns out to be the twisted three-headed stepchild of that classic musical.

Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie, reunited from the previous love letter to Hollywood directed by Quentin Tarantino, are the headliners but really this movie is about the journey - to hell and back - by the quiet, observant Manny, who starts as an errand boy during the silent era, and then after making a bold suggestion about making movies spotlighting an immensely talented Black jazz trumpeter, becomes a powerful studio head. Mexican actor Diego Calva plays Manny and he takes us on quite a journey.

Pitt plays the biggest male star of the silent era Jack Conrad, and Robbie's New Jersey to the bone character Nellie LaRoy is first spotted crashing the nearly X-rated party that opens the film. She and Manny become unexpected friends during the opening party. Following the title card, the movie is on its twisted way.

Was early Hollywood really like this? Full of drugs, sex (both straight and gay), perverse use of animals, and nonstop swearing by everyone (and I mean everyone utters the F word every 2 minutes in the first half of the movie)? Probably not. It's like some fever dream. But to accomplish the Dante's Inferno-like tone of the movie, this is meal we are served.

This movie received some of the worst reviews of a big budget movie since Heaven's Gate, and as the case with Heaven's Gate, some rare positive reviews. It will probably end up with a cult following. At least an hour could've been trimmed but Chazelle clearly wanted to take his audience on a rollercoaster ride. And since so many movies are becoming 3-hour marathons anyway, its run time doesn't seem to excessive in this day and age.

Movie buffs will probably get more out of this film than the average viewer. The final 10 minutes of the film are probably the most satisfying 10 minutes of a movie about the movies since Cinema Paradiso. And that was probably Chazelle's direct inspiration.

It gets even more annoying when the interesting, more subtle elements of the story are undernourished just so we can have more scenes of body fluid humor and other nonsense.

364,364,9.0,22 January 2023,"I have been waiting for a long time for Babylon to come out in the UK and unlike some I was very much not disappointing. The movie was an emotional roller coaster and I sympathise with people who did not enjoy it or even somehow hate it. Everything about this movie was perfect, the acting performances were phenomenal by every single actor on the screen, with a stand out mention to the small but very impressive part by P. J. Byrne and of course the main characters, 3 of whom, unsurprisingly raked in award nominations. The film's music was another brilliant job performed by Justin Hurwitz who is yet to disappoint but i doubt he ever will. The cinematography of the film was just as impressive, the single long shot from the opening scene of the party as the camera makes its way around the whole place still baffles me. I loved the theme as it covered the highs and lows of life in Hollywood of the 1920's which many of us are really not aware of what life looked like back in the 'roaring 20s', as well as the messages and social issues that the film managed to cover during this chaotic and intense masterpiece. The plot of the movie for me personally was easy to understand despite the complexity and messy nature of the movie, when the movie got gross, i felt sick, where the movie got energetic, i felt like partying with them, when the scenes got deep, i could relate and when the scenes got intense so did I but unfortunately where i think the movie lacked was in the connection with the characters, although Chazelle could argue that this was intentional but i feel like it didn't hit me enough during the sad scenes of the movie which I won't name in order to keep this spoiler free. Now this 'lack of connection' is the only reason I am lowering this movie to a 9 from a 10. I believe this movie is not for everyone especially at the graphic nature of certain scenes although there was a warning before the movie started and it is a R-rated movie. I feel like this movie is really misunderstood as it is deep, hilarious, creative, and it was truly the most entertained I have ever been during a film. Where the movie really hit for me was the ending, I have heard very mixed opinions on the ending but for me it was magical, really confirmed that this movie is Chazelle's attempt at a love letter to cinema and for me it was. The homage to the many, many legendary films and shots over the last century to get to where we are now was a very powerful ending to the movie for me.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",i have been waiting for a long time for babylon to come out in the uk and unlike some i was very much not disappointing the movie was an emotional roller coaster and i sympathise with people who did not enjoy it or even somehow hate it everything about this movie was perfect the acting performances were phenomenal by every single actor on the screen with a stand out mention to the small but very impressive part by p j byrne and of course the main characters of whom unsurprisingly raked in award nominations the films music was another brilliant job performed by justin hurwitz who is yet to disappoint but i doubt he ever will the cinematography of the film was just as impressive the single long shot from the opening scene of the party as the camera makes its way around the whole place still baffles me i loved the theme as it covered the highs and lows of life in hollywood of the s which many of us are really not aware of what life looked like back in the roaring s as well as the messages and social issues that the film managed to cover during this chaotic and intense masterpiece the plot of the movie for me personally was easy to understand despite the complexity and messy nature of the movie when the movie got gross i felt sick where the movie got energetic i felt like partying with them when the scenes got deep i could relate and when the scenes got intense so did i but unfortunately where i think the movie lacked was in the connection with the characters although chazelle could argue that this was intentional but i feel like it didnt hit me enough during the sad scenes of the movie which i wont name in order to keep this spoiler free now this lack of connection is the only reason i am lowering this movie to a from a i believe this movie is not for everyone especially at the graphic nature of certain scenes although there was a warning before the movie started and it is a rrated movie i feel like this movie is really misunderstood as it is deep hilarious creative and it was truly the most entertained i have ever been during a film where the movie really hit for me was the ending i have heard very mixed opinions on the ending but for me it was magical really confirmed that this movie is chazelles attempt at a love letter to cinema and for me it was the homage to the many many legendary films and shots over the last century to get to where we are now was a very powerful ending to the movie for me,POSITIVE

Its a parody of extremes in the industry of film making set back when it all began. Is it historically accurate? Not even close, and its not trying to be. This is a full tilt in your face dialed up to as high as it can be for every scene in this long movie. Its outrageously interesting all throughout!

If you never worked in this industry, or have any idea how films are made, then most of this will just go well over your head. I could count the numerous little details that went into this that only an gaffer would know! But with that said, I'm sure there are many more things I missed.

Could they have cut this down into a 2 hour movie? Probably. Got to learn to 'kill your babies'. Story is King, and the story is not that strong. The characters are playing a flamboyant version of some stereotypes throughout their short career. Not any one moment is so significant, yet each moment is capturing something in tune to that of a skit for this Parody Movie. I think they tried to put in so many insider moments that as a Story, its not really there.

And that is what your going to see. So for those that know the inside, you might appreciate this. For everyone else, it might be too much. A 1 Time Watch movie for me.

It gets a 7 because it is a very predictable epic.

372,372,1.0,30 January 2023,"I loved this film so much it inspired me to endure the mild administrative inconvenience of creating an IMDB account.

In my opinion this film is an incredible artistic achievement and a wonderful experience. There is an interview with composer Justin Hurwitz where he says people who love the film will feel like it was made for them. This is true for me. It has a particular style - it is heightened and often hilarious, but at the same time it is emotionally truthful and heartfelt. It also evokes the feel of the period without being strictly historical or confined to its setting. For me, the elements of pastiche/ homage to many different genres and eras of film worked very well. The cast are all brilliant in their roles.

Hurwitz's score is exquisite. It is clear from reading about his processes that so much work and care has gone into it from him and the other performers. It's a gift to the listener.

It is dispiriting to see so many negative reviews from critics who, even if they didn't personally enjoy it, should at least acknowledge its originality, creativity and vision.

The story isn't interesting enough at the time to carry the length in my opinion, however, the end was deeply poignant, and you can see what the director was building toward

So, I was interested but...

First, I was sometimes disappointed with Brad Pitt's acting. I thought in some scenes supporting actors were more convincing.

Then, why was Margot Robbie cast in this part ? She's not a bad actress, that's not the point, but I don't find her, at all, the looks of an aspiring star in this period.

So, I didn't get into the movie and got bored halfway through it.

And in the end, I thought it was too long and the director didn't know how to finish it. What were these last 10 minutes about ? Getting an Oscar by quoting better movies ?

A tale of outsized ambition and outrageous excess, it traces the rise and fall of multiple characters during an era of unbridled decadence and depravity in early Hollywood.

Babylon is definitely my favorite surprise of 2022, for being overhated and under-appreciated, I mostly had bad expectations for it , but it was an absolute masterpiece, a messy one.

In fact, Babylon is one of the few movies that could tell a story about the begging of the art of Cinema, without making me bored, they went right through the mess in Hollywood back to the 19's and they presented the evolution of the cinematic technology and industry in the best possible of ways .

The first two hours were chaotic with a very high rhythm, It was fabulous ... When it comes to the final and third hour, it was slow-paced all of a sudden, which they could handle it better However, I was interested until those great finak scenes were brought to the screen, what an ending !

I can't finish my review without talkin about the new discovery of Diego Calva, this man delivered more than I could imagine and he's such a great actor, the crazy silly Brad Bitt, I can watch this man for the rest of my life for just being that way , Inglorious Basterds way...he's hilarious no matter how ridiculous he looks .

Margot Robbie did a wonderful job, her being an electric character has to be her best roles , she was a truly wild girl...

393,393,8.0,7 February 2024,"A Captivating Journey into the Heart of Hollywood.

From the moment the opening credits roll, Babylon immerses viewers in a mesmerizing world of glitz, glamour, and gripping drama. Director Damien Chazelle's masterful storytelling weaves together a rich tapestry of characters and narratives set against the backdrop of 1920s Hollywood.

The film's visual splendor is matched only by its profound exploration of ambition, power, and the price of success. Led by a stellar ensemble cast, including standout performances from lead actors, each character is brought to life with depth and nuance, making their triumphs and tribulations feel both personal and universal.

Chazelle's direction is nothing short of genius, seamlessly blending stunning cinematography, evocative music, and meticulous attention to detail to create a cinematic experience that is as emotionally resonant as it is visually breathtaking.

At its core, Babylon is a love letter to the golden age of Hollywood, but it also serves as a timely reflection on the industry's past, present, and future. Through its compelling narrative and unforgettable characters, the film offers a thought-provoking exploration of fame, fortune, and the pursuit of artistic excellence.

In the end, Babylon is a triumph of storytelling and filmmaking, earning its place as one of the year's most unforgettable cinematic experiences.

396,396,9.0,27 July 2023,"""Babylon"" takes audiences on a daring journey through the chaotic and excessive world of early Hollywood. Director Damien Chazelle's ambitious approach to storytelling is evident in this big and messy portrayal of the late 1920s and early 1930s film industry. The movie's outstanding visuals and attention to detail in sets and costumes make it a visual feast from start to finish.

From the moment the film begins, ""Babylon"" captivates viewers with its stunning cinematography and production design. The sets and costumes transport us back in time, fully immersing us in the glitz and glamour of old Hollywood. Every frame is meticulously crafted, and the attention to detail is simply mesmerizing. The film truly transports you to another era.

The strength of ""Babylon"" lies in its exceptional cast, who bring the characters to life with their flawless performances. Margot Robbie delivers a career-best performance as the ambitious and determined protagonist. She perfectly encapsulates the spirit of the era and carries the film with her magnetic presence. Brad Pitt, as Jack Conrad, gives a nuanced performance, adding depth to the storyline and providing a compelling counterpoint to Robbie's character.

One of the film's few drawbacks is its narrative structure. At times, the story feels disjointed and overwhelming, making it challenging to fully engage with the plot. The film jumps between multiple characters and storylines, leaving some threads unresolved. While this approach attempts to capture the chaos of the era, it may leave some viewers longing for a more coherent narrative.

Nevertheless, ""Babylon"" effectively serves as both a love letter to and a condemnation of the golden age of cinema. It masterfully explores the lives of multiple characters who were shaped and irrevocably changed by their experiences in Hollywood. This unflinching portrayal showcases the dark side of the glitz and glamour, shedding light on the sacrifices and challenges faced by those in the industry.

While the film boasts impressive moments and showcases the hard work and dedication that goes into filmmaking, it occasionally falls short in capturing the emotional surge and power that defines truly captivating cinema. Some pivotal moments lack the emotional resonance they need to truly resonate with the audience, leaving them somewhat detached from the characters' experiences.

In conclusion, ""Babylon"" is an ambitious and visually stunning film that is worth watching for its unique approach to Hollywood history. Despite its chaotic execution and some narrative flaws, it remains an intriguing and fascinating watch for cinephiles interested in exploring the glitz and glamour of early Hollywood. The outstanding visuals, impeccable performances, and thought-provoking themes make ""Babylon"" an unforgettable cinematic experience, though not without its imperfections. With its daring depiction of a bygone era, the film showcases the highs and lows of early Hollywood, leaving its mark as an important addition to the cinematic landscape.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",babylon takes audiences on a daring journey through the chaotic and excessive world of early hollywood director damien chazelles ambitious approach to storytelling is evident in this big and messy portrayal of the late s and early s film industry the movies outstanding visuals and attention to detail in sets and costumes make it a visual feast from start to finish from the moment the film begins babylon captivates viewers with its stunning cinematography and production design the sets and costumes transport us back in time fully immersing us in the glitz and glamour of old hollywood every frame is meticulously crafted and the attention to detail is simply mesmerizing the film truly transports you to another era the strength of babylon lies in its exceptional cast who bring the characters to life with their flawless performances margot robbie delivers a careerbest performance as the ambitious and determined protagonist she perfectly encapsulates the spirit of the era and carries the film with her magnetic presence brad pitt as jack conrad gives a nuanced performance adding depth to the storyline and providing a compelling counterpoint to robbies character one of the films few drawbacks is its narrative structure at times the story feels disjointed and overwhelming making it challenging to fully engage with the plot the film jumps between multiple characters and storylines leaving some threads unresolved while this approach attempts to capture the chaos of the era it may leave some viewers longing for a more coherent narrative nevertheless babylon effectively serves as both a love letter to and a condemnation of the golden age of cinema it masterfully explores the lives of multiple characters who were shaped and irrevocably changed by their experiences in hollywood this unflinching portrayal showcases the dark side of the glitz and glamour shedding light on the sacrifices and challenges faced by those in the industry while the film boasts impressive moments and showcases the hard work and dedication that goes into filmmaking it occasionally falls short in capturing the emotional surge and power that defines truly captivating cinema some pivotal moments lack the emotional resonance they need to truly resonate with the audience leaving them somewhat detached from the characters experiences in conclusion babylon is an ambitious and visually stunning film that is worth watching for its unique approach to hollywood history despite its chaotic execution and some narrative flaws it remains an intriguing and fascinating watch for cinephiles interested in exploring the glitz and glamour of early hollywood the outstanding visuals impeccable performances and thoughtprovoking themes make babylon an unforgettable cinematic experience though not without its imperfections with its daring depiction of a bygone era the film showcases the highs and lows of early hollywood leaving its mark as an important addition to the cinematic landscape,POSITIVE

399,399,8.0,17 February 2023,"Damien Chazelle's latest film is an enjoyable, and sometimes intense, ride through the early days of Hollywood. It packs a complex plot, many fun characters and a fantastic production design that really adds to the immersion, while also highlighting the foundations of modern cinema.

The film feels like a mix between ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" and ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"", due to the Hollywood-based historical setting and some intense and explicit scenes. It also feels like Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie are reprising their roles from ""Once upon a time..."" as the characters they play are somewhat similar.

The strength of the film, in addition to its visuals and sets, is a complex plot that provides both laughter, tears and contemplation. Although I found most of the film funny, there are certain scenes that add a serious and emotional tone to the film.

It does, however, go on for a little too long. Although it doesn't get boring, I found myself expecting the film to end several times. The runtime serves the plot, but it also makes the film heavy to digest and sometimes tiring.

That all said there were aspects of this movie that really were disturbing. OK, I am a recovering addict so Miss La Roi's behavior and descent into a complete batsh!t drug fiend is hard to take. But there are other scenes that are just as haunting . (no spoilers) A BIG SHOUT OUT to. Tobey Maguire , that was some acting !! This entire sequence of descending into the bowels of hell was something else , Again, hats off to the director / writer in dreaming up this Ken Russell homage.

402,402,6.0,17 August 2023,"There have been quite a few movies about Hollywood of the bygone era. Two which come to my mind are ""Once upon a time in Hollywood ""and ""Mank"". This movie covers the period 1926 --32 in Hollywood and depicts the carefree life of movie makers and artists of that time. With 3 hours 8 minutes run time the narrative gives us a picture of the life at that time. The movie starts off with scenes of a loud party with live music ( with some excellent camera work) to give you an idea of what will follow and the director does not disappoint as the scenes unravel. We are then shown the ad hoc approach to film making at that time with crude technology available then. There is a long and interesting scene to show the frustration of the crew as they shoot a scene without a sound proof set and finally get take number 8 right. Another scene with the rattlesnake in the desert is done well.

Brad Pitt plays a top star who is not able to handle failure. He has been there and done that earlier in "" Once upon a time in Hollywood"". Margot Robbie has a meaty role which gives her an opportunity to essay a range of emotions and she has done well. Diego Caliva also has acted well as the rookie turned professional. The director has a wide canvas to deal with ( Hollywood transiting from silent to talkies) but appears to have lost track and direction of the plot midway though individual scenes are impressively shot.( I however find that his La La Land and Whiplash are much superior movies).

405,405,2.0,30 January 2024,"""Babylon"" is a movie that with its irony brings you inside the mechanics of the showbizIt is a deep journey into a manipulating world that ruined several lives, especially the ones of vulnerable and non experienced people, such as Nellie LeRoy. It is a portrayal of the rise and the fall of the famous fictional actor Jack Conrad that knew his success during the 20s, in the era of mute cinema, but was not able to keep up with the times, becoming irrelevant. It is the sad representation of a successful Studio Executive that after all his efforts decided to throw it all away for a false promise. And these are just a few elements that characterize this three hour piece. Damien Chazelle told of a time where Hollywood was experiencing big changes due to the big technological advancements between the 20s and the 30s, with the introduction of microphone and sounds, the first color cameras that completely changed the way to perceive the pictures.

It is a movie that manages to build a lot of tension on some instances that is relieved by effective comedy sequences that are so well placed and that made me genuinely laugh. The director managed to keep a good rhythm for the entire length, achieving a good balance between dynamic sequences and slow paced dialogues that deepened the different characters. The cast conveyed so many different emotions, but with big names such as Margot Robbie and Brad Pitt, I was not expecting otherwise. The photography is amazing and there are many shots that in my opinion will be iconic. Give it a few years. The first 30 minutes alone are memorable. The intro set perfectly the mood of the film and it immediately put the audience in the middle of the action. Great filmmaking there. The ending is truly a love letter to the Cinema, that in my perspective lasted way too long and it required some trims, in order to reach perfection. Other than that, this for me is a solid 8 and I strongly recommend watching ""Babylon"" if you are a movie goer.

""Babylon"" (2022) just might be have been one of the most uneven and mixed movies i've ever seen. In its long runtime 2 h 48 min (and you will feel every minute of it) it had a lot to show. It's a highly ambitious movie that at the end of the day collapsed, in my opinion.

""Babylon"" had a great idea, but on paper it sounded better I think. It had some great looking individual scenes but not a good movie overall. It is expertly paced yet it took be more then a week to completed in small dozes. It has great actors doing good work but no memorable characters. It has good lines but not a good screenplay. It has great scenery but at the same time it had a lot of scenes which are discusting to watching. And most important, ""Babylon"" has a great and highly talented director who two previous films were instant classics doing his most convoluted and bizarre work yet.

Overall, ""Babylon"" is a messy, highly uneven movie with pretty bad and generic ending I think (the T2 and Avatar scenes at the end incorporated into this movie is telling you just how uneven and bizarre this movie really is). It collapsed because of uneven screenplay and story. Yet individual scenes are so well done that its worth the watch - maybe, once.

It is not perfect and it is not for everyone. The story set in the early times of Hollywood is fabulously chosen and presented, however it does not really have a plot. This is the bit where viewers are separated into either truly enjoying the art behind cinema or leaving confused the theatre.

You can defiantly appreciate how the picture was captured, the story telling can be seen as influenced of Tarantino's early movies. The scenery was more than beautiful. However, the music and the sound directing were so perfectly placed and composed, they were the true superstars of the movie making.

Although most was in the making, almost anything seemed to be possible. To set the tone, there is a wild scene of a party with loud music and anything which goes.

Something mainly to be attributed to the incredibly high standard of acting. The characters and what happens to them take the audience into the plot and not the other way around.

Perhaps some elements don't merge so well with the times like the dancing moves of the parties attendees which seem to be incredibly modern or the ending which is a bit too long.

413,413,1.0,30 January 2023,"Cinema is greater than life. Cinema brings poetry and music together in a visual spectacle of megalomaniac proportions. Be it Citizen Kane, be it Modern Times, The Jazz Singer, Singin in the Rain, Ben-Hur, La La Land or even the brand new Avatar. Every single frame of a movie carries within itself a brand new unknown, yet familiar world.

As it is mentioned through the movie, cinema is a form of escapism, of achieving royalty without being rich and of seing your true self displayed in the big screen and feeling like you're worth something, like you're remembered - even if you're a mere spectator.

Babylon doesn't only portray the transtion from silent films to talkies, it portrays cinema as way of evolution and as a way of achieving immortality. When you're part of the industry you'll never die, you're always ruthlessly dancing with the ghosts of your past.

Decadence, depravity and disproportional excess led to the rise and fall of many ambitious dreamers in 1920s Hollywood. Through the lens of three different main characters, Nellie, Manny and Jack, the beauty and the uglyness of fame in Hollywood are depicted to the viewer.

Chazelle's coke-fueled epic isn't as much of a love letter to Hollywood as it is a critique to its everlasting years of abuse, prejudice and cash-grabbing.

414,414,6.0,10 February 2023,"Babylon

Babylon is Chazelle's contribution to the recent cinema movement of directors hiting back against modern 'amusement park' films. The film takes you on a three hour, often incoherent, journey thorugh multiple character's paths and experiences in early hollywood, ultimately ending with the message that cinema is whatever you want cinema to be. In Chazelle's case it would seem that cinema should be oppressively fast paced across a monalithic time scale, with pulse raising sequences filled with debauchery. Perhaps the copius amount of cocaine on screen was a hint to audience that a line or two in the bathrooms before the film, is how it was meant to be viewed. Despite the negative tone of the review so far, painting a clear picture of my displeasure, I couldn't help but enjoy some of the films madness. The epic scale of scenes, especially in the opening hour, left me smilling, wondering if... Maybe this is what I want cinema to be.

It is in the unremarkable characters and sheer length of the picture that this film lets itself down. Brad Pitt's character Jack Conrad was the only story thay held any interest for me. Its Ozymandian nature, reflecting the age of cinema the film is set was an enjoyable watch.

The overall reception of this film is reflecting in its lack of nominations. We are left with a fairly average film with moments of excitement which quickly fade into memory as we pass through at the speed of light. Its like an all you can eat buffet.

415,415,1.0,26 January 2023,"I saw that American people on another website reviewed badly this movie, and I can understand why. This is, by far, Damien Chazelle's most exaggerated direction, it's something that I could wait from Baz Luhrmann from the ""Moulin Rouge!"" times. It didn't bother me at all, I like Baz. He goes too far sometimes, true, but, at least for me, 70 to 80% of the humour worked.

The soundtrack is ""spectacular, spectacular"" (I promise, no Moulin Rouge references from now on), the best of 2022, and by far. The period reconstruction is perfect, and the film sucessfully surpassed my worst fear: that it could potentially be a ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"" rip-off.

Quentin Tarantino is my favourite director, and an unpopular opinion here, ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"" is his weakest film. Due to the production design, the tone of the trailer, especially one sentence, and the presence of Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie in both productions, the comparisons are inevitable. The only one I can really do is the narrative structure.

The cast is excellent, the SAG nomination was fully deserved. Diego Calva, who I met here, is one of the most charismatic protagonists of 2022, he has the biggest arc of the entire film. Margot Robbie here is the complete opposite of her character in Tarantino's movie, she is the only actress who could do this character. Li Jun Li is great, but she always remembered me of Jessica Rabbit, but less femme fatale. Jovan Adepo is cool, even passing 70% of the film only playing trumpet (that trumpet was so hypnotizing, maybe the most hypnotizing one for me since ""Pinky Dinky Doo"") And Brad Pitt has the star power that no one else has in the entire Hollywood. I won't say anything, but alongside the protagonist, the best character is Tobey Maguire.

I hope Chazelle do the same that Tarantino did with ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"": take this script, expand it and adapt it for a book. I would be the first to buy. Despite having 3 hours, this film begs for more content, and sometimes it can feel insufficient. I would love to spend a lot more hours in this universe, even not being a big fan of the old cinema.

417,417,6.0,23 July 2023,"The 'history' obviously by the title, seems cribbed from Kenneth Anger's Hollywood Babylon books. Sensationalized fragments of certain events shown in the most lurid and unsubstantialized ways. But that's the foundation of the mythology of this movie.

From the first sight of the first person you can see that any attempt to actually capture an authentic period appearance and ambiance are casual at best. It was rare to see grossly overweight men with full beards in that locale and era. Throughout this movie multiple men sport full beards.

And where are the hats!

Men and women rarely were seen in public without hats. You hardly see any here. And the hair. Where are the bobs and bangs! The Marcel wave? The dances obviously don't reflect the realities of the time either.

The silent films usually had chamber music trios or classical ensembles accompanying filming. Not jazz. Obviously a compromise for one of the subplots, but artificially forced.

So many other movies have done better recreating the look and feel of period pieces. But that clearly wasn't considered important. A subtle thing that subliminally adds a degree of immersion.

Something that maybe younger audiences would be interested in. Rather than being afraid that they couldn't empathize beyond their own familiar expectations.

The main protagonists are exaggerated characterizations of real people. With a few lines dropped for reference.

Clara Bow obviously as the lead actress. With the most lewd stories referenced. Sex with the entire USC football team for instance. The fact that she settled down with Rex Bell into a rural ranching life wasn't sensationalistic enough for the story arc.

Jack was a synthesis, though John Gilbert seems most probable. The real actor had an entirely different history. His big romance was with Greta Garbo. The polar opposite of Clara Bow personality wise. And his downward spiral was largely a result of Louis B Mayer sabotaging his career.

My favorite character was Elinor. She was written as a Hopper or Parsons gossip columnist. But her name was a combination of Elinor Glyn and Adela Rogers St John. Both were popular novelists and popular magazine writers.

Appearance wise, the look is totally based on Glyn. A flaming redhead with exotic taste in style. She was a British best selling novelist of Three Weeks and other risque novels, married into minor nobility. She moved to Hollywood in her mid fifties and reinvented herself as an expert on culture and etiquette. She worked at MGM and elsewhere as an advisor and writer as her books were turned into films. Her magazine articles shaped opinion, and were where she announced Bow as the 'It Girl.' and did become her personal advisor for a time. But she moved back to England before talking pictures became dominant.

The best scene in the movie is her pontificating about fame and legacy with Jack. An actual serious, subdued, quiet scene. Maybe the only one.

The vignettes about film making were exaggerated but generally ok in the context of showing the changes over time from silent to sound. A little more explicit reference to pre code issues might have added depth to the story.

The parties and debauchery were modern interpretations of Hollywood Babylon's versions of history. The excessive over the top pornographic ensemble scenes look like choreographed calisthenics rather than anything erotic.

The torture and vomiting scenes seem intended to evoke shock. Nothing more. Gratuitous.

The trumpeter saga as a subplot seems a concession to modern sensibilities rather integral to the world of old Hollywood as it actually was. Popular mainstream music did not have thumping bass lines or the blaring tonality of this soundtrack. More Paul Whiteman, who actually was in early sound pictures. A nice story for a different context.

Irving Thalberg begging an actor to star in an acknowledged crappy movie? That really is a deviation from history. Thalberg fought for quality and prestige films. A bit irreverent to gratuitously use his name for a cheap reaction.

The movie itself was far too long. It should have been more about character development than imagery and cliches. More focus and fewer subplots.

The stories about unknowns becoming stars and then fading have been around forever. Show People came out in 1928. What Price Hollywood, and A Star is Born in the early thirties. Amongst so many more over the years.

The ending seems very artificial. As if they realized that nothing was cohesive and tacking on historical clips somehow meant that Babylon too was part of the cutting edge historical stream.

I was originally excited about the premise. I bought the 4k video and watched it in my theater room with a big screen and sound. Quality look, disappointing result. But credit at least for actually trying to deal with an era many are unfamiliar with. Maybe it will get some to delve further into the actual sources.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",the history obviously by the title seems cribbed from kenneth angers hollywood babylon books sensationalized fragments of certain events shown in the most lurid and unsubstantialized ways but thats the foundation of the mythology of this movie from the first sight of the first person you can see that any attempt to actually capture an authentic period appearance and ambiance are casual at best it was rare to see grossly overweight men with full beards in that locale and era throughout this movie multiple men sport full beards and where are the hats men and women rarely were seen in public without hats you hardly see any here and the hair where are the bobs and bangs the marcel wave the dances obviously dont reflect the realities of the time either the silent films usually had chamber music trios or classical ensembles accompanying filming not jazz obviously a compromise for one of the subplots but artificially forced so many other movies have done better recreating the look and feel of period pieces but that clearly wasnt considered important a subtle thing that subliminally adds a degree of immersion something that maybe younger audiences would be interested in rather than being afraid that they couldnt empathize beyond their own familiar expectations the main protagonists are exaggerated characterizations of real people with a few lines dropped for reference clara bow obviously as the lead actress with the most lewd stories referenced sex with the entire usc football team for instance the fact that she settled down with rex bell into a rural ranching life wasnt sensationalistic enough for the story arc jack was a synthesis though john gilbert seems most probable the real actor had an entirely different history his big romance was with greta garbo the polar opposite of clara bow personality wise and his downward spiral was largely a result of louis b mayer sabotaging his career my favorite character was elinor she was written as a hopper or parsons gossip columnist but her name was a combination of elinor glyn and adela rogers st john both were popular novelists and popular magazine writers appearance wise the look is totally based on glyn a flaming redhead with exotic taste in style she was a british best selling novelist of three weeks and other risque novels married into minor nobility she moved to hollywood in her mid fifties and reinvented herself as an expert on culture and etiquette she worked at mgm and elsewhere as an advisor and writer as her books were turned into films her magazine articles shaped opinion and were where she announced bow as the it girl and did become her personal advisor for a time but she moved back to england before talking pictures became dominant the best scene in the movie is her pontificating about fame and legacy with jack an actual serious subdued quiet scene maybe the only one the vignettes about film making were exaggerated but generally ok in the context of showing the changes over time from silent to sound a little more explicit reference to pre code issues might have added depth to the story the parties and debauchery were modern interpretations of hollywood babylons versions of history the excessive over the top pornographic ensemble scenes look like choreographed calisthenics rather than anything erotic the torture and vomiting scenes seem intended to evoke shock nothing more gratuitous the trumpeter saga as a subplot seems a concession to modern sensibilities rather integral to the world of old hollywood as it actually was popular mainstream music did not have thumping bass lines or the blaring tonality of this soundtrack more paul whiteman who actually was in early sound pictures a nice story for a different context irving thalberg begging an actor to star in an acknowledged crappy movie that really is a deviation from history thalberg fought for quality and prestige films a bit irreverent to gratuitously use his name for a cheap reaction the movie itself was far too long it should have been more about character development than imagery and cliches more focus and fewer subplots the stories about unknowns becoming stars and then fading have been around forever show people came out in what price hollywood and a star is born in the early thirties amongst so many more over the years the ending seems very artificial as if they realized that nothing was cohesive and tacking on historical clips somehow meant that babylon too was part of the cutting edge historical stream i was originally excited about the premise i bought the k video and watched it in my theater room with a big screen and sound quality look disappointing result but credit at least for actually trying to deal with an era many are unfamiliar with maybe it will get some to delve further into the actual sources,NEGATIVE

Babylon is a movie about the filmaking industry of the early 30s era. It shows the struggles of different people that work in the business in their road to sucess. On a deeper level it uses the setting to expose the sins of the human nature, the pleasures of the flesh and shows how the grinding machine exploits those actors or directors the moment their shares start dropping. It is packed with many crazy and intense visuals.

Plot is really thin, simple and common for a 3 hour movie. Except maybe from Brad Pitts character the rest are undeveloped, serving the bigger picture as caricatures (only the great acting saves it for me). What makes up for the missing deep and narrative storytelling is the non stop intensity and momentum there is. Some may get dizzy but i got along. It starts with good vibes, partying, showing the lifestyle. As it progresses you eventually see the bad side. What i liked is that it got me threw all the spectre of emotions. From extreme laugh to depression and horror. Trust me there are some horror and disturbing stuff ( its not R only cause of nudity). Finally i wanna highlight a few scenes that i thought were pure diamond. 1st there is a comedy scene that is the most funny sht i have ever witnessed and second theres an impactful discussion towards the end.

420,420,7.0,27 December 2022,"This movie starts with low brow humor and continues on for an entire 3+ hours of self indulgence. The debauchery of the first 30 minutes alone are meant to appeal to the new age audiences that can't focus without something shocking happening to draw their attention every moment.

The only aspects of substance in this entire plot are ironically in the subtext of 3 core narratives that are marred by repeat moments of disgust or violence.

The leads of this movie do shine, and they are charismatic and capable of pulling the story by their charm alone. However the characters that Margot Robbie and Brad Pitt play are far too ignorant for real world scenarios.

There are many moments of striking visuals, coincidental comedy and emotional intensity that are notable. But sadly this movie overall is just too much, all at once, for no good reason at all. Which is very evident by the bloated length and the unease that is exhibited in the last 40 minutes. Not to mention the music sounds like a redux of the La La soundtrack, which made me very sad because I loved that movie.

422,422,7.0,26 January 2024,"This movie had parts worthy of 10's 9's and 8's. It also had parts worthy of 3's and 4's. Within the 189 minutes worth of movie about 8 1/2 stories were told and could've had their own movie. In my opinion it could've and maybe should have been constructed in a show format and distributed as such. It shoots itself in the foot with the length, the first 2/3rds of it went by fairly fast good pacing and then it just turns into quicksand the rest of the way. That is in no part to the actors just the story itself. The faster parts of the movie were interesting and drew you in with how the characters stories would go, they'd separate and meet again under certain circumstances then some would stay in the same within the same story as the other would stray and eventually their paths would cross again if only for a brief moment or at a meaningless party. The slow part was surprising in that there was action climaxes closures of stories yet its hampered by the pacing in which it does occur and the 2 hours you would've already put in. The actors, music, cinematography were fantastic throughout and I think deserve a 10. The way the story can convolute itself and in the 3rd portion of the movie have no real direction or logical reason for the things to be occurring really knock it down. It's 3 hours that you have to sit and put in just for the last hour to not be on par with the first two. The last hour is helped and hampered by the last 10 minutes of the movie with one character coming back and going to the movies to complete a full circle yet in the middle of this emotional and very beautiful scene is a brief loose montage of cinema progressing. The montage is very nostalgic and also fails to completely make sense. It ends up showing matrix and terminator 2 along with some other modernish movies that don't fit into the plot of progress. Yes terminator 1-2 were massive steps in movie magic and matrix was a big step into something new for the time they don't fit entirely into the theme of this movie in which ends in I believe 1952 (don't knock me for the year). I believe the last 10 minutes of the movie truly encapsulates the whole review. It is a beautiful scene with a montage that continues the beauty only to unfortunately add extra that ends up taking away from it.

424,424,6.0,7 March 2023,"Only a well established director could pull of a 3-hour movie about making movies! All hail to Damien Chazelle!

Interestingly, there are two movies this year about making movies, who received Oscar nominations. The one is 'The Fabelmans' directed by Steven Spielberg, and then this one, 'Babylon'.

'Babylon' is an ambitious movie, to say the least. It's a period film, set in Hollywood in the 1920's during the silent movie era, and the transition to talkies - or movies with sound, if you like. Brad Pitt stars as Jack Conrad, the most successful and highest paid actor of the silent era. The film follows his life, as well as the lives of Nellie LaRoy (Margot Robbie), who wants to be an actress; Manny Torres (Diego Calva), who wants to work on a film set; and jazz musician Sidney Palmer (Jovan Adepo), who becomes a music sensation.

Nellie is a very determined opportunist who will do whatever it takes to succeed. She uses way too much drugs, and is maybe over-ambitious. In contrast, Manny doesn't believe there is a future for him in the film business. When these two meet, however, their lives change irrevocably. In the midst of everything is Jack, whose career - and personal life - is in a downward spiral.

There's so much happening in this film. There's drama, humour, action, adventure, an interesting look into silent films and the transition to sound, and a fantastic, thumping, vibrant score! The production design is incredible, and the film's editing is so well done, I can't believe it did not receive an Oscar nomination for Film Editing. The costumes are also fantastic.

'Babylon' reminded me of 2011's 'The Artist' - also a film about the silent movie era. Only, 'Babylon' is a lot more detailed and twice the running time. The film's first 25 minutes are dedicated to a party at a mansion. But this party was sensational! Over the course of three hours, there's great character development for every character. For a film this long, I was actually never bored or watching the clock. I found it rather exciting. There's a lot to read between the lines as well. The film also makes excellent use of music, and silence. This is definitely a score-driven movie.

'Babylon' is an incredible production, and certainly entertaining from beginning to end. The 'underground' scenes featuring Tobey Maguire as gangster James McKay were so different to the rest of the movie - almost like a completely different film, complete with freaks, and even horror elements. The film takes many unexpected turns...just like life itself.

A serious depiction of this era would be interesting and when I first heard about this, I thought Chazelle was the man for the job, but could no one tell him during filming that he was going too far?! I had a hard time appreciating the performances because I found the characters so unrealistic particularly Margot Robbie's. I felt similar to Brad Pitt and his character, though as the film progressed both he and the part he is playing improved. The only character with any connection to reality seemed to be the dashing Diego Calva and he has a terrific moment near the very end appreciating the magic of moviemaking. Pitt and Jean Smart also have a special moment later in the film while facing facts. There are a ton of actors in this, some well known, and nobody is bad.

429,429,8.0,12 March 2023,"Margot Robbie is a talented A-list actress, the current ""it girl"" for leading roles. Unfortunately in 2022 she is mixed up in two very elaborate productions in a row that are not only boring and disappointing, but complete flops at the box office.

Ironically, what the film is trying to showcase, excess and decadence, are exactly what the film suffers from. Nobody wants to sit through a three-hour movie nowadays with repetitive scenes. Somehow the production crew forgets that less is more, and instead crams as many disjointed scenes in the movie as much as possible, making it into a jumbled mess.

432,432,9.0,24 February 2023,"I approached this movie with trepidation. The trailer combined with initial reviews from the IMDb community led me to believe this would be a pretentious funhouse glory piece on par with Wolf of Wall Street. I considered not watching it altogether. Decided to click it on after watching a youtube channel explain how the marketing team really failed the movie.

The movie is really good. I was fully immersed and engaged learning about the transition from the silent film era to ""talkies"". I thought it was especially touching when one studio exec quipped something like ""the audience seems to like having sound in the movie"". Of course from our vantage point, this seems like ""duh, of course sound is important in a movie"". The trials and tribulations of sound engineering was definitely interesting.

It was very satisfying watching how ""the movies"" get made, although, I'm still befuddled to think that a movie set from the 1920's was essentially a life/death affair.

The performances were well done, also. I've been falling out of favor with Brad Pitt recently but he brought an excellent emotional range to his character. There was a scene in particular looking into his eyes where you can feel that he resonates with the character of Jack Conrad.

In close, if you're thinking about watching it, just watch it. You won't find anything better to do with the 3 hours ;).

The 7 rating is a tad biased by admission. The night before I had watched Brokers by Kore-eda Hirokazu.

Margot Robbie commands the screen effortlessly with a boundless energy that never lets up across the films 3 hour run time. Diego Calva is a real standout as the calm amongst a storm of chaos, keeping the film from completely spiralling out of control.

436,436,6.0,9 March 2023,"Babylon is a movie that depicts excess and the high lifestyle of rising actors from the 1920s. We get to see a rise and fall of the main characters but I feel like this could've been told in a two hour movie rather than an extra hour to shove the lavish excess lifestyle in your face. Like the first 20 minutes or so is just there to show the lavish overindulgence of the guests in the mansion like it's a New Year's party.

I'd compare this movie to Boogie Nights, except it's about 1920s Hollywood rather than the 1970s rise in the p*rn industry. The main actor rises as a big star then crumbles upon their own ego. I did enjoy Babylon, especially the part where the actors had to do multiple retakes. It's a nice gag but the rest feels so dragged out.

Why am I giving this movie 6/10? Because the movie's run time just feels dragged out it becomes distracting and not as incapsulating as other movies.

439,439,7.0,5 September 2023,"Another movie that is too difficult to rate. Lots of upsides, lots of flaws.

First of all, it should have been shorter. 189 minutes duration time is an artistic suicide if your movie is not a masterpiece. And this isn't a masterpiece. There are too many subplots/scenes that could easily skipped. Furthermore, it should be full comedy. When it's comedy, it's almost excellent. When it's drama, it's not that good. This movie was too superficial and shallow for a drama. The only great dramatic moment was the at the end, when Robbie was talking to Diego Calva and realised some things. This was an entertaining movie . There was no reason for all that drama. But, if you want to add some drama, do it correctly. Drama here seemed like a parody. Viewer didn't empathize with these characters in order to feel their struggles. At least, that was the case for me. I didn't care much about anyone's fate.

However, this was so enjoyable that i can't give it less than 7 stars. First 1/3 of this movie is a pandemonium, hilarious and frenetic. A feast for the eyes, as long as you are ok with a bit debauchery. Excellent editing, excellent acting. There were times i was laughing hard. A lot of time since i 've watched some good slapstick comedy, it reminded me kinda of THE PARTY (1968), not so great of course.

After these crazy sequences, i can't say that i got boring because it kept my interest until the end. The scene with Robbie struggling due to the transition to sound movie, was delightful. But, something felt off. It kinda dragged.

440,440,9.0,30 January 2023,"Babylon is a three-hour movie that follows multiple characters during the early years of Hollywood.

This movie takes place during the transition from silent to sound films in 1926, going through six main characters, and the movie ended in the early 1930s. Each character had their journey, but all of them seemed to intertwine with each other at some point.

Movie Screenplay Babylon is a chaotic three hours movie, both in the merit and demerit of chaotic films. And we can say the first hour and 25 minutes was spectacular; this chaos was done in the movie's favor and was appropriately used to emphasize the debauchery, the mess, and the power the mega movie stars had this time, and how the transition to this new genre of cinema was difficult for the system and has its ""victims"" literally.

And How Sound films brought new opportunities for people who weren't actors and actresses and allowed musicians to be in the spotlight more than usual. Job opportunities were also opening up for new and improved directors and producers.

On the other hand, After this, the movie didn't know where our story would go and how it would end, and how we will end this movie. Then, many unconvincing sequences occur according to our introduced charcters in the movie's first half. Contrary to this, ""Brad Pitt"" has the best storyline, and his acting in this role was to the point, as always, which leads us to talk about Acting in this movie.

Acting The movie starts with an extravaganza party that goes on, and we are introduced to all of the main characters within the film.

Manny Torres (Diego Calva) is a determined studio employee that wants more out of Hollywood. His acting was okay, nothing special, and he was not bad at all, but we didn't know throughout the film how and when these transitions happened to him. So, I lost interest in the character and began not to be invested in everything that happened to the character, which is a massive problem in the screenplay.

Nellie LaRoy (Margot Robbie) is a poor woman that will do anything to live out her dreams as an actress. The same problem as Manny; we could copy it and say about Margot here. In addition, the movie never introduced us to the idea that she is always mad. We saw that she was somehow restive but loved herself more than anything else. Also, what happened to her in the second half wasn't introduced properly.

Jack Conrad (Brad Pitt) is an alcoholic, a womanizer and an incredibly famous actor. And his storyline and acting was the highlight of this movie.

Sidney Palmer (Jovan Adepo) is a talented musician who performed for over 12 hours at the party and may even live the life he always wanted. Also, he gave the 2nd best performance in the movie and had moments that showed how good Sidney palmer's acting is.

Directing Damien Chazelle is responsible for the mess found in the movie's second half. The first half wasn't slow, and our characters were introduced within a scene's central theme, whether a party, silent or spoken movie set. The scene was the hero, and our characters served to make the idea valid and reach the audience.

But then, the scenes became weak, and without a proper context to be there, so the movie became really slow and even though there were parties and super chaotic scenes felt unnecessary. And the question was Why this scene was there, how it happened and why the characters were doing this. We are left with many questions, and the answers aren't reaching the level of the movie's first half. I also wanted to learn more about the characters with less screen time compared to the main two characters of the movie. Also, huge props should be given to the production and costume design team. Moreover, Justin Hurwitz made another ""masterpiece"" score that could compete with ""LaLa Land"" in its uniqueness and authenticity.

Conclusion I have ended the movie, and the primary thought is that Damien did not know how to end it and when and what story could be exciting and what couldn't be so. Here, the movie idea wasn't authentic, It was done at movies before, and this is not bad. But the disappointment came that this is a movie by the director of Whiplash and LaLa Land. And we have a cast with Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie, with a special appearance for Tobby Maguire ( I didn't talk about him on purpose).

But the movie left me disappointed for a movie that could be far better than what we got, and it had all the chances to become a masterpiece. Still, it failed in many of these and left me asking how a movie can have so much debauchery and still be uninteresting.

442,442,1.0,2 February 2023,"Without a doubt this film was created to be something special. There are many love and hate letters to Hollywood, Babylon is both combined, but raised to 11 even though it cannot support such levels all the time.

In this film, Damien Chazelle is a good director. He pulls off a lot of directing tricks and techniques, which luckily he was able to squeeze into the limited 3 hour time frame. Now, as a screenwriter, I don't know. The script and the edition are a frenetic machine of events without a certain rhythm. They are an orchestrated disorder in the purest style of jazz. This doesn't do a good favor to a film that, had it gotten another tone, would have been much better. The story has a very good development, the characters evolve in an incredible way, but the rhythm of the film is so chaotic that many times it feels overwhelming.

The performances are in line with what Chazelle wants for the tone of her film. All the actors put their name very well in the final credits, but the one who steals the show is Brad Pitt. Great execution of a troubled character, who, although he also falls into the implausible satire that Chazell wants to pose, manages to emerge with great ease.

Another strength of the film is its production design. This is a giant film that knew how to make the most of its settings, its general aesthetics and its locations, which, correctly combined with the photography, raised the level of the film a bit.

Further proof that this movie could have been a legend if it found its right tone and pace. But it only earns the label of a ""good"" film, because there are elements of irrefutable excellence, but other very important ones that looked very weak.

I have read some of the reviews calling out gratuitous debauchery, but have to disagree. It is no secret that the 20's and 30's were as raunchy as one could imagine, making the depiction likely accurate, if not sensationalized a bit.

The story is a good one. The cast is great. The acting is very good.

The issue I had with the movie, besides some technical flaws (vehicles that weren't made yet, etc...), was the somewhat shallow and juvenile approach to many of the scenes. It felt like an attempt at Stanley Kubrick collapsing into Jack Ass.

Overall, I enjoyed it. I would recommend it.

444,444,5.0,4 February 2023,"The best way to describe this movie is big. It feels like a lot. And this isn't just cause of the rare 3 hour long run time although that obviously is one of the factors. But there's always something happening, something big and important, so you don't ever feel bored. Always something interesting. Even though most of the story never really adds up to a lot, in the end it sends the message I think Chazelle was trying to send. The cinematography and acting is without a doubt, masterclass. At times it can be disgusting and uncomfortable to watch, especially in the first third and one scene towards the end. And they're definitely not just a bit disgusting, there's some stuff where you're just like ""wow"". The comedy in the film reminds me a lot of the comedy in The Wolf Of Wall Street (which is a very good thing).

Brad Pitt and Diego Calva are great in this tribute to early Hollywood, a tale of outsized ambition and outrageous excess, which traces the rise and fall of multiple characters during the uneasy transition from silent films to talkies.

BUT too much, too many, too long, unnecessary convoluted scenes and dialogue with overzealous and pointlessly outlandish scenes, that are all style with very little substance.

Overindulgence, bloated, and, ultimately, pointless!

Overindulgence doesn't make a good movie.

458,458,7.0,7 September 2023,"Damien Chazelle's Babylon is an intimate look at what Hollywood may have looked like in the late 1920's during the transition from the end of the silent film era to the advent of the ""talkie,"" starting with Al Jolson's The Jazz Singer. The grand majority of the characters are fictional but are based on the lives of real-life personalities from this time period. The movie is a love letter to movies themselves and showcases how painstaking of a process it was making them during this period. A fun, diverse, unforgettable cast of both new and familiar faces plus a well-written plot makes this a fresh and exciting movie that achieves what it sets out to do.

The movie follows Manuel Torres (Diego Calva), a somewhat timid, well-mannered Mexican immigrant who starts out as a lackey of sorts for big-shot producers at MGM Studios. He falls in love with Nellie LaRoy (Margot Robbie), a beautiful, free-spirited aspiring actress from New Jersey. They both have larger-than-life aspirations of making it big in Hollywood and soon start climbing the ranks: LaRoy as an actress and Torres as a producer himself. They both eventually find out the hard way that they may be in over their heads in the corruption of the behind-the-scenes world of the movie-making industry.

Brad Pitt plays a much less interesting character named Jack Conrad, an actor who enjoyed great success during the silent film era but struggles to find his footing in the world of ""talkies."" Jack is your standard cookie-cutter Brad Pitt character: cocky, a sharp dresser, somewhat of a womanizer, but ultimately insecure deep down. While Brad Pitt is a good casting choice for this character, I am getting kind of tired of seeing him in this same role all the time. It is interesting to note he also starred in the movie Babbel, the multilinguistic masterpiece from Mexican director Alejandro G. Iñárritu.

That being said, Margot Robbie makes up for Brad Pitt's lackluster performance. While this movie has several similarities to Quintin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, which both actors also starred in, Margot Robbie's character is much more fun and interesting in this movie. She feels very authentic in this role, and her depiction of Natalie LaRoy has a lot more depth than her depiction of Sharon Tate from a writing perspective. I feel Chazelle gives Robbie a lot more room to shine in this film than Tarantino does in his.

Another thing this movie really does an excellent job of when compared to Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is minority portrayal. Tarantino heavily marginalizes minority populations in his movie and seems to glorify the whole notion of the white male protagonist. Chazelle flips this upside down and instead marginalizes the white male protagonist (Pitt) himself.

The cast diversity is really what makes this movie shine. Sexism and racism are major themes throughout the story. Chazelle tackles these sad but true aspects of Hollywood history head-on in a tasteful manner. For example, the character Sidney Palmer (Jovan Adepo), an African-American trumpet player who starts out as an orchestra musician, finds himself in a tight spot for not being ""black enough"" in comparison to his bandmates after getting the chance to have his likeness projected on the silver screen.

Speaking of which, the soundtrack is a banger. Justin Hurwitz deserves a special shoutout for his (mostly) era-accurate, Academy-Award-nominated score. It is everything one could want for a 1920s period piece and feels authentic but is still highly enjoyable. Hurwitz's use of the baritone saxophone in particular is delectable.

There seems to be one word that comes up time after time with this movie: ""debauchery."" The definition of which, as per Merriam-Webster, is ""extreme indulgence in bodily pleasures and especially sexual pleasures: behavior involving sex, drugs, alcohol, etc. That is often considered immoral."" Indeed, certain scenes of this movie are reminiscent of painter Hieronymus Bosch's famous oil painting The Garden of Earthly Delights. This is definitely NOT a movie for the kiddos, but I honestly found it rather tame as far as nudity and sex scenes go. These scenes give us an idea of where the modern-day rave may have gotten its beginnings and are the very heart and soul of the movie.

Overall, Babylon is a homerun. It is a brutally honest take on the phrase ""Be careful what you wish for."" Watching these characters try to build a tower to the stars out of their careers, only to have it come crashing down on them against the backdrop of a multicultural 1920s Hollywood makes for an exhilarating experience. In addition, it is wonderful to see a positive representation of the Mexican community for once, and the Spanish sprinkled in makes it more believable and is a nice change in a historically English-centered industry.

463,463,8.0,30 January 2023,"If there were any doubts about what to expect from Babylon, Chazelle immediately lets audiences know just what kind of film they have sat down for. It opens with three characters having to drive an elephant up a hill in a truck designed to transport horses and resorting to pushing the truck to prevent it from tumbling downhill. But what at first seems like a classic Laurel & Hardy sketch quickly devolves into something more akin to a Farrelly brothers gag with one of the men stuck in the line of fire of a defecating elephant. Following this in the next 30 minutes of the film follows a massive party involving mountains of cocaine, dead hookers and an orgy graphic enough to make the attendees of an Eyes Wide Shut orgy blush. Needless to say, if you feel like you may find this hard to sit through this may not be the film for you.

For those who do stick around, the rest of the film offers a look into the rise and fall of several characters during Hollywoods silent era and its transition into the talkies. The first of these characters is Manny played by Diego Calva. He's a hard working immigrant who wants to be part of something bigger and is willing to do anything asked of him to be a part of the filmmaking process. This includes detaching himself from his foreign roots and 'Americainise' himself as a means to climb Hollywoods social ladder. He quickly grows feelings for Nellie LaRoy, played by Margot Robbie bringing her strong physically comedic charms to the role. Unlike Manny she is not content at playing some small role and instead believes that she was born to be a star and is just waiting for Hollywood to realise.

Alongside this duo we also have Jack Conrad, played by Brad Pitt. He's the aged silent star who is everything that Nelie wants to be. A name that everyone knows and spends his days between film shoots, constant partying and several marriages that often struggle to outlive his film shoots. But just like many other silent stars he inevitably has difficulties adapting to the new challenges of the talkies and being taken seriously by audiences. It's a great comedic but poignent performance that almost feels like we get a glimpse at what would have happened if Brad Pitt had switched roles with Leonardo DiCaprio in Once Upon a Time In Hollywood. And there is also Sidney Palmer, a jazz trumpeter played by Jovan Adepo. Out of all the characters he certainly gets the least amount of screen time leaving many of his story beats to feel rushed and many aspects of the difficulties of black performers in that era of filmmaking unexplored. But it does still offer a different perspective on the limited and exploitative of black performers throughout classic Hollywood.

Just like his other ode to a different era of filmmaking with La La Land, it's clear that Damien Chazelle has a strong love-hate relationship with Hollywood. He showcases the true magic of the industry where all the cards align and the crew get to celebrate that final beautiful shot to end the day. But he will also let us know the full extent of pain that everyone had to go through to pull off that shot and that by its constantly evolving nature nobody's role is ever secure.

Another place where the film strives is with its party sequences, which are frantically shot with the same kinetic energy Chazelle always brings to his films. When you combine this with Justin Hurwitz jazz infused score, these sequences are so intoxicating that just like our leads we feel we just want to keep this style of life going forever.

Unfortunately these sequences do eventually end and the film does lose momentum towards the last hour of the film. Especially with the strange detour that the film takes to show us Hollywoods underbelly. In something that feels like a version of Dantes Inferno, Manny is led deeper and deeper into what can only be described as a strange sex dungeon filled with people that would be assembled for a P. T Barnum show. The satire in this segment ends up feeling out of place to the rest of the film and other than a fun performance from Tobey Maguire as a creepy debt collector, a lot of the humour in this segment really falls flat.

On top of this at times the film can feel like a clustered mess of ideas trying to tug our attention in too many ways and sometimes a bad gag just goes on for too long. But when Babylon comes together it can be hilarious, tragic, sentimental, cynical and everything in between. Chazelle spends 3 hours showing us the unbearable pressure that the film industry puts on people behind the scenes, but still somehow showcases a true love of his art that makes it feel like maybe all that blood and sweat may have been worth it.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",if there were any doubts about what to expect from babylon chazelle immediately lets audiences know just what kind of film they have sat down for it opens with three characters having to drive an elephant up a hill in a truck designed to transport horses and resorting to pushing the truck to prevent it from tumbling downhill but what at first seems like a classic laurel hardy sketch quickly devolves into something more akin to a farrelly brothers gag with one of the men stuck in the line of fire of a defecating elephant following this in the next minutes of the film follows a massive party involving mountains of cocaine dead hookers and an orgy graphic enough to make the attendees of an eyes wide shut orgy blush needless to say if you feel like you may find this hard to sit through this may not be the film for you for those who do stick around the rest of the film offers a look into the rise and fall of several characters during hollywoods silent era and its transition into the talkies the first of these characters is manny played by diego calva hes a hard working immigrant who wants to be part of something bigger and is willing to do anything asked of him to be a part of the filmmaking process this includes detaching himself from his foreign roots and americainise himself as a means to climb hollywoods social ladder he quickly grows feelings for nellie laroy played by margot robbie bringing her strong physically comedic charms to the role unlike manny she is not content at playing some small role and instead believes that she was born to be a star and is just waiting for hollywood to realise alongside this duo we also have jack conrad played by brad pitt hes the aged silent star who is everything that nelie wants to be a name that everyone knows and spends his days between film shoots constant partying and several marriages that often struggle to outlive his film shoots but just like many other silent stars he inevitably has difficulties adapting to the new challenges of the talkies and being taken seriously by audiences its a great comedic but poignent performance that almost feels like we get a glimpse at what would have happened if brad pitt had switched roles with leonardo dicaprio in once upon a time in hollywood and there is also sidney palmer a jazz trumpeter played by jovan adepo out of all the characters he certainly gets the least amount of screen time leaving many of his story beats to feel rushed and many aspects of the difficulties of black performers in that era of filmmaking unexplored but it does still offer a different perspective on the limited and exploitative of black performers throughout classic hollywood just like his other ode to a different era of filmmaking with la la land its clear that damien chazelle has a strong lovehate relationship with hollywood he showcases the true magic of the industry where all the cards align and the crew get to celebrate that final beautiful shot to end the day but he will also let us know the full extent of pain that everyone had to go through to pull off that shot and that by its constantly evolving nature nobodys role is ever secure another place where the film strives is with its party sequences which are frantically shot with the same kinetic energy chazelle always brings to his films when you combine this with justin hurwitz jazz infused score these sequences are so intoxicating that just like our leads we feel we just want to keep this style of life going forever unfortunately these sequences do eventually end and the film does lose momentum towards the last hour of the film especially with the strange detour that the film takes to show us hollywoods underbelly in something that feels like a version of dantes inferno manny is led deeper and deeper into what can only be described as a strange sex dungeon filled with people that would be assembled for a p t barnum show the satire in this segment ends up feeling out of place to the rest of the film and other than a fun performance from tobey maguire as a creepy debt collector a lot of the humour in this segment really falls flat on top of this at times the film can feel like a clustered mess of ideas trying to tug our attention in too many ways and sometimes a bad gag just goes on for too long but when babylon comes together it can be hilarious tragic sentimental cynical and everything in between chazelle spends hours showing us the unbearable pressure that the film industry puts on people behind the scenes but still somehow showcases a true love of his art that makes it feel like maybe all that blood and sweat may have been worth it,POSITIVE
464,464,1.0,25 December 2023,"If I know in advance that a movie is going to last 3 hours, I'm extremely skeptical that I'll be able to sit through it. It's out of the question for me to split it up, so I watch it in one go and take my time. With Babylon, I waited a while and then treated myself to it, with the result that I wasn't bored for a minute. Damien Chazelle surprised me, because I was expecting an acid trip à la Baz Luhrmann. But that wasn't the case. The scene with the elephant was a successful introduction to the film's drastic humor, which at the same time takes the absurdity of early Hollywood to the extreme, reaching its first climax in the battle scenes of the monumental film shot later. And it doesn't really end there. I can't agree with some of the things that have been written here about the sexual permissiveness, but maybe that's because I'm European and I'm more upset by violence.

I really wish this had been changed into a longer form mini-series where there could've been more time spent developing the characters and digging a little deeper into an era that isn't known to so many of us.

This is nothing more than a bunch of intoxicated adults occasionally making bad choices. It was like going to the bar scene watching people at closing time get silly. The writers had decent ideas however someone should have ran them by other skilled writers before putting them in the final script to make it interesting to the viewer.

Diego Calva had very few lines in the first half of the movie which made it kind of weird. He barely spoke. I didn't understand it. He did more staring than talking.

Way too many scene fillers in this movie! A lot of scenes started out great then drug on too long.

The last half of the movie showed Margot Robbie's character Nellie Leroy falling apart from her coke and gambling addiction. It was a pretty dumb script.

Very powerful.

Over all this a simple movie. It's about a star (sensational Brat Pitt) who's career is ending and his slow realization that his slip into irrelevance is unalterable and, a talented, if a little rough around the edges actress (the amazing Margo Robbie) who arrives in Hollywood at the tail end of the silent era and who is ill equipped to handle the new ""talkies"". I must also mention Diego Calva and the ever reliable Manny who's efforts to rehabilitate Nellie (Robbie) were never going to be enough to save her.

486,486,9.0,27 January 2023,"Babylon is a big loud chaotic feature from Damien Chazelle. It is over the top and full of excess. It is also a true love letter to cinema.

Margot Robbie is great as 'the wild child' Nellie LaRoy and has some explosive scenes that a lot of actresses wouldn't dare touch. Brad Pitt is also on form and has the best arc in the movie going from great movie star to washed up by movies end.

The movie's biggest flaw appears to be the treatment of Sidney Palmer. Jovan Adepo is wonderful as the musician and the scene with the boot polish is heartbreaking. I wish the movie had given him more of an arc and showed us more from the band.

There are some fun cameos from the likes of Flea, Tobey Maguire, Samara Weaving and even Ethan Suplee pops up.

The runtime is long and there may have been parts that could have been trimmed down for a more audience friendly runtime. It's clear that Chazelle was allowed full reign and the vision is fully his.

The movie follows Diego Calva and his ascend in 1920s Hollywood. I don't know if Calva is a strong enough presence for the role, never more so than at the end when he is crying in the cinema watching Singin' In The Rain. I think he may be the weakest link in a movie where everyone plays it so big. He gets lost in the shuffle somewhat.

Right out of the gate the F-bombs try to be more frequent than any previous shows with excessive F-bombs. What a goal!

488,488,8.0,26 January 2023,"A nicely ambitious film about an interesting era of Hollywood that was never visible in their films of that time.

Its a film from a cinema lover to cinema lovers and while we had similar projects like this during the year (The Fabelmans, The Offer) this one is the most different wildest and in many ways bravest.

There are unfortunately issues with it. I wasnt fond of the direction by Damien Chazelle, as his direction was all over the place. The film never really knew what it wanted to be: Comedy? Drama? Thriller? Romance?

There were many segments that could have easily reduced the very long running time of 3 hours and increased the quality of the film. Generally editing was another issue. There are so many meaningless moments in the film when the camera films steady on a face or item without reason.

But there are many goods as well. First of all the film had probably my favorite final scene of any movie this year. Very well done and surprising in a way too. The acting was very solid. Margot Robbie was great, I think I would have loved Emma Stone, the original choice, even better, but Robbie added something very raw to it what Stone probably wouldn't have been capable to do. In a weaker year for female performance she could have easily stabbed an Oscar nomination for this. Brad Pitt was absolutely outstanding and gives one of his best and most nuanced performances. He is very underrated for this turn as there are many ways this character could have been played and Pitt chose the right one. Great performance, funny and tragic. Jean Smart was very good too, I especially loved her monologue. Was not the biggest fan of Tobey Maguire as he overacted his role too much. And last but certainly not least Diego Calva is a fantastic discovery and I am looking forward to see more of him. He really carried a huge junk of the film on his own shoulders.

The music was great, the cinematography fantastic, the production design absolutely top notch.

489,489,9.0,26 January 2023,"Wow.. Babylon blew me away. I genuinely wasn't sure whether I would like this movie, let alone love it after catching wind of early reviews. It's a films for dreamers, those wishing to obtain or hang on to them.

To explore this theme Damien Chazelle transports us to the 1920s movie Industry, a place of excess, deluge and rapid change. This is the perfect setting to witness the rise and fall of stars and how things are 'make or break' based on talent, luck and other factors at play.

We meet Nellie LeRoy (Margot Robbie) Manny Torres (Diego Calva), Sidney Palmer (Joavan Adepo) and Jack Conrad (Brad Pitt) and a massive cast of support characters over 3 hour and 9 minutes . Nellie is a wannabe actress who believes she is a star, Manny wants to work in movies which he sees as the ultimate destination as it can transport you to another place, Sidney Palmer is someone who enjoys playing trumpet and Jack Conrad is the #1 Movie star in Hollywood.

We witness the movie industry adapt from silent black and white, to talkies, to colour pictures and how this impacts the individuals that we follow. Although in some instances, the more things change, the more they stay the same! To that end the movie industry is both the protagonist and the antagonist with the ability to thrust people into the limelight, pull them out of it and treat support workers as faceless commodities required to do whatever It takes to reach the ultimate goal which is to developing a film that movie goers will enjoy. Viewers will see eerie similarities between treatment of individuals in 1920s Hollywood and what we see today with the 'Rust' incident and tight deadlines faced by VFX's artists.

It's all backed by an amazing Oscar nominated new school jazz score by Justin Hurwitz which propels every scene. This shouldn't be surprising when you consider what Justin Hurwitz and Damien Chazelle achieved with Whiplash, La La Land and First Man.

Babylon is a beautiful film which says it's okay to dream but be careful what you ask for as it's only a matter of time before change brings in new dreamers, movers, shakers. Those with the purest intentions are best set up to navigate the dangers of Hollywood but there are no guarantees. However, regardless of your relationship with Hollywood, film will ensure that you are immortalised.

This movie has split audiences and I can see why. Not necessarily because of the excess in some scenes but because it's a movie that focuses heavily on its themes. Therefore you don't get short, sharp quickfire scenes that continuously pulls the plot forward. Instead you get poignant scenes which speak to the overall themes and if you aren't on board or don't care for the themes, the movie will turn into a boring drag. This is the same with La La Land, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and Nope. I have fallen of both sides of this fence over the years but I'm glad that I was able to enjoy every moment of Babylon in the cinema.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",wow babylon blew me away i genuinely wasnt sure whether i would like this movie let alone love it after catching wind of early reviews its a films for dreamers those wishing to obtain or hang on to them to explore this theme damien chazelle transports us to the s movie industry a place of excess deluge and rapid change this is the perfect setting to witness the rise and fall of stars and how things are make or break based on talent luck and other factors at play we meet nellie leroy margot robbie manny torres diego calva sidney palmer joavan adepo and jack conrad brad pitt and a massive cast of support characters over hour and minutes nellie is a wannabe actress who believes she is a star manny wants to work in movies which he sees as the ultimate destination as it can transport you to another place sidney palmer is someone who enjoys playing trumpet and jack conrad is the movie star in hollywood we witness the movie industry adapt from silent black and white to talkies to colour pictures and how this impacts the individuals that we follow although in some instances the more things change the more they stay the same to that end the movie industry is both the protagonist and the antagonist with the ability to thrust people into the limelight pull them out of it and treat support workers as faceless commodities required to do whatever it takes to reach the ultimate goal which is to developing a film that movie goers will enjoy viewers will see eerie similarities between treatment of individuals in s hollywood and what we see today with the rust incident and tight deadlines faced by vfxs artists its all backed by an amazing oscar nominated new school jazz score by justin hurwitz which propels every scene this shouldnt be surprising when you consider what justin hurwitz and damien chazelle achieved with whiplash la la land and first man babylon is a beautiful film which says its okay to dream but be careful what you ask for as its only a matter of time before change brings in new dreamers movers shakers those with the purest intentions are best set up to navigate the dangers of hollywood but there are no guarantees however regardless of your relationship with hollywood film will ensure that you are immortalised this movie has split audiences and i can see why not necessarily because of the excess in some scenes but because its a movie that focuses heavily on its themes therefore you dont get short sharp quickfire scenes that continuously pulls the plot forward instead you get poignant scenes which speak to the overall themes and if you arent on board or dont care for the themes the movie will turn into a boring drag this is the same with la la land once upon a time in hollywood and nope i have fallen of both sides of this fence over the years but im glad that i was able to enjoy every moment of babylon in the cinema,POSITIVE

494,494,1.0,15 June 2023,"Babylon is a film that perfectly finds the middle point between comedy and drama. This is a story about the history of cinema, especially how cinema further developed after films with sound evolved, and not gonna lie i didn't laughed this much in all of my eighteen years. That scene where they make a sound film for the first time had me laughing so much I couldn't breath. I thought about that scene for days.

This film has many various things that it does great, the actors are doing there best, the humor had me laughing the whole night after seeing it, the score gave me goosebumps, the whole 1920s glamorous Hollywood setting is incredibly grand and epic, but most importantly is what this film is about.

It's about passion, the love for films, people were going crazy during the filming of those movies, they scream, they laugh, they cry, in those moments, you really feel that nothing else matters, besides doing that film. All things in their life suddenly doesn't matter, only if the film will be worth it in the end. That sunset scene of Brad Pitt's character Jack Conrad, is pure cinematic magic.

There a dialogue where a character summed up says that no matter what happens next in your life, the films you did will be there forever, a child in 50 years could see that film and you could be his inspiration. He'll look up to your face, even if you took your last breath way before he breathed his first.

That dialogue, that is what ultimately cinema means to me. And especially for me, someone that maybe sometime wants to be an filmmaker, it hits hard.

I love everything about this film, during that final scene every film that I've ever saw flashed before my eyes.

Hollywood is portrayed as a dirty and corrupted place, but on the other hand also the most magical place for movies in the world. It becomes a double sided sword, that can be inspiring and magical, but also cruel and dirty.

It's about the heaven and hell of giving up your life in pursuit of ""something bigger than you."" It's about creativity, fame, approval, money etc and it neither romanticises or demonises the process - it just turns it into a wild ride.

Everything in this film is intentionally overblown and relentless, so that when someone does actually take a breather to be honest with themselves or with others, it lands.

There are several compelling storylines to follow here but that of Jack Conrad (a pitch-perfect Brad Pitt) probably captures the film's tone best.

504,504,9.0,21 February 2023,"Some like it when characters are used as dummies to prove some philosophical point or navigate through a certain period's turmoil. This movie is not about an aspiring actress, a Mexican that wants to become a studio exec, or a star that cannot find his place during the sound revolution. It is about the futility of Hollywood - and of making movies or art in general. It is about what drives us forward - the desperate will to be remembered, the anxiety that everybody forgets who we were and what we did once we die.

This point is made very explicitly in a scene toward the end of the film. And well, it's a good point and it's craftily enforced with the help of the dummy characters that populate the movie. It's not that the characters are too shallow, it's that they are typical, like in Balzac's works. Anyone could be Nellie, anyone could be Manny.

The point is that life takes you in, chews you and spits you out. In Hollywood, it happens faster and more intensely than anywhere else. So I gather the film is about the vanity of people wanting to become immortal, just like when they set off to build the Babylon tower.

A love story between a director, and its art, the cinema. The movie is messy, a lot is happening at the same time, and it is filmed like a Damien Chazelle movie (very fast camera moves). I spent most of the movie trying to understand what was happening, until the very end, when I finally connected the dots. The story has been done multiple times, it is about how the cinema went from silent to the talkies. But also about Hollywood's drama, and excesses with drugs and parties in the 1940s. The movie is funny, heartfelt, and sad. If you have seen Damien Chazelle movies before, you know that love is never the big winner, as art is always higher in the eyes of the characters. Though I'd argue that this time, the love story does win, with Chazelle showing us exactly what made him fall in love with the cinema, and giving us all that we need to actually fall in love with it too.

Brad Pitt's scenes were pretty funny, but didn't make me want to watch more. (Hearing Shania Twain in my head).

516,516,9.0,1 January 2024,"The movie will leave a lasting impression, despite its sometimes longer cuts and marauding plot. This is not a feel-good theatrical production, but it's very much a cynical celebration of cinema and it's dreamers, with all the theatrical flair you can imagine. Crazy unexpected moments in the movie, ranging from extreme ostentatious and depravity to extreme vulgarity and sentimentality.

It subtly turns a lense on the industry, and exposes how it has dehumanised and objectified people by exploiting every person's vulnerabilities, and how that in turn changes the people, and that in turn changes cinema, which in turn changes people again. And what is particularly good, is that the audience is also brought into the telling as well

The cycle of emotions is felt throughout the film. The promise of the American Dream never fails to deliver on that emotional rollercoaster, even if the dream results in failure.

518,518,1.0,1 February 2023,"Fame can do insane things to people. It can distort your personality, warp your sense of reality and make you do things you would never even previously dream of doing. This is the tale of the movie of how the life of super stardom in the film industry can corrupt even the best of us, and how the 1920s Hollywood film industry is portrayed here, how decent and humble people are sucked in and are mentally exhausted and ruined by the ruthless and greed driven process of talent acquiry.

It really is funny seeing A list actors like Margot Robbie and Brad Pitt being put into these roles as people who have become ruined from the inside out by this dramatised depiction of the early film industry. I really hope it was, because I can't imagine it being this brutally callous in reality. I mean really.

But that's why I loved this movie so much. Chazelle has become extremely good at creating tension in his movie to an uncomfortably and sometimes even unbearably good level. His skill already shine through in Whiplash which made me seriously reconsider whether pursuing music classes was the right choice, aswell as turning JK Simmons's into one of the most terrifyingly distasteful movie villains I've ever seen on screen.

The way this movie looks is amazing, the film is incredibly well shot and dressed with beautiful cinematography and some really incredible shots, many coming from the desert shoot scene in the first act of the movie. The intro party scene was also insane.

Talent is a topic that is brought up a lot in this movie, and really shows you why saying ""you have no talent"" or worse yet ""you had talent, but you lost it"" really is the worst thing you could possibly say to another human. Showing how Brad Pitt's character was utterly traumatised by hearing this, and how this is a real form of abuse that needs to be talked about more.

The movie also shows why people who consume film eventually want to cross over to the other side to make movies themselves. Why they become inspired and how they make the transition from consumer to creator. It's just a shame that the way the industry was shown in this movie was so cutthroat and psychopathic.

524,524,1.0,18 July 2023,"Babylon stands as a remarkable masterpiece, paying homage to the exhilarating and pivotal era of filmmaking in the first half of the 20th century. The film skillfully captures the tumultuous journey of the cinematic world, shedding light on its struggles, addictions, discriminations, evolutions, and the lives of those deeply immersed in it. This tragic yet authentic portrayal evokes a whirlwind of emotions, delivering both tears and joy simultaneously in a spectacle rarely achieved in cinema.

The movie emerges as a true work of art, resonating deeply with anyone passionately involved in the film industry, be it creators or audience. It's an unforgettable experience that should not be missed by those who hold a genuine love for the cinema. Babylon succeeds in transporting its viewers to the past, where every detail of mid-20th-century cinematic life is brought to life on the screen in a commendable and applause-worthy manner.

The acting performances in Babylon are nothing short of extraordinary. Each actor shines brilliantly, earning a solid 10/10 for their portrayals. A special mention must be made for Diego Calva, whose performance was nothing short of perfection, leaving a lasting impression on the audience.

The cinematography skillfully captures the essence of the era, enveloping the audience in a visually mesmerizing journey through time. The portrayal of the mid-20th-century cinematic world is truly praiseworthy, effortlessly immersing viewers in the world of filmmaking and its trials and triumphs.

While Babylon excels in most aspects, there were a few moments that could have been streamlined to enhance the overall pacing. The prolonged depictions of raving and partying related to Hollywood, though relevant to the time, occasionally felt dragged out. Trimming these scenes would have made the movie even more impactful and polished, perhaps shaving off 15-20 minutes from the runtime.

In conclusion, Babylon is an extraordinary tribute to the evolution of cinema, painting a vivid and heartfelt portrait of a bygone era. Its ability to evoke a wide range of emotions, along with impeccable acting, cinematography, and attention to detail, makes it a true gem. While some scenes could have been trimmed for a smoother experience, the core message of the movie remains powerful and resonant: being part of something great, like cinema itself, is what truly matters.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",babylon stands as a remarkable masterpiece paying homage to the exhilarating and pivotal era of filmmaking in the first half of the th century the film skillfully captures the tumultuous journey of the cinematic world shedding light on its struggles addictions discriminations evolutions and the lives of those deeply immersed in it this tragic yet authentic portrayal evokes a whirlwind of emotions delivering both tears and joy simultaneously in a spectacle rarely achieved in cinema the movie emerges as a true work of art resonating deeply with anyone passionately involved in the film industry be it creators or audience its an unforgettable experience that should not be missed by those who hold a genuine love for the cinema babylon succeeds in transporting its viewers to the past where every detail of midthcentury cinematic life is brought to life on the screen in a commendable and applauseworthy manner the acting performances in babylon are nothing short of extraordinary each actor shines brilliantly earning a solid for their portrayals a special mention must be made for diego calva whose performance was nothing short of perfection leaving a lasting impression on the audience the cinematography skillfully captures the essence of the era enveloping the audience in a visually mesmerizing journey through time the portrayal of the midthcentury cinematic world is truly praiseworthy effortlessly immersing viewers in the world of filmmaking and its trials and triumphs while babylon excels in most aspects there were a few moments that could have been streamlined to enhance the overall pacing the prolonged depictions of raving and partying related to hollywood though relevant to the time occasionally felt dragged out trimming these scenes would have made the movie even more impactful and polished perhaps shaving off minutes from the runtime in conclusion babylon is an extraordinary tribute to the evolution of cinema painting a vivid and heartfelt portrait of a bygone era its ability to evoke a wide range of emotions along with impeccable acting cinematography and attention to detail makes it a true gem while some scenes could have been trimmed for a smoother experience the core message of the movie remains powerful and resonant being part of something great like cinema itself is what truly matters,POSITIVE

528,528,8.0,27 June 2023,"This movie is much like the Superman ride at Magic Mountain. You are instantly propelled into a world of depth and imagination surrounded by chaotic amounts of insanity! Somehow it all makes sense because we all at somepoint have had that week or month or year of life that was constantly 5 hours of sleep and non stop entertainment. I easily give this 9 stars and it deserves 10, but we ended up watching it in 4 different sittings. This movie REQUIRES, its own night of dark shutout curtains, turn up the surround sound and live the characters as they come to you. Having grown up watching old noir movies thru the Abbot and Costellos, visiting the old west movie sites as a kid, and being a movie buff, if you open up to this movie it will definitely hit a certain way towards the end.

Margot Robie continues to suprise and shine with her ability to adapt and go from crazy to buck wild and back to civilized, while being stellar hot the entire time.

Brad Pitt, what can I say, he kills it as the pre Clark Gable of the early era actor. His portrayal of the modern man in 1920s/1930s was done very very well...and his characters arc is very tangible.

Overall, I feel like all of these characters lives were probably very real or an enactment of similar lives of people. Toby Maguire...dude...scary as hell...LOL. You killed it man....damn fine work 👍.

All in all, this movie offers up a rush and grabs you by the lapel and takes you with it.

Wow there is so much to unpack in this film. Everyone was on their A game. I feel like I didn't watch the same film as others did based on other reviews I've read, but Margot Robbie is a beast. This was the first I've seen Diego Calva, and I'm looking forward to seeing more from him as he was excellent and awards worthy. I think this is actually one of Brad Pitt's best performances. Supporting performances from Jean Smart, Li Jun Li, and Jovan Adepo were also great, just wish there was more background into the characters. Incredible production design from Florencia Martin and Anthony Carlino (can definitely see them taking the Oscar) and costume design from Mary Zophres. Justin Hurwitz's score was great and brought some familiarity from some previous scores, especially La La Land.

This was a film about the film industry. At first the glamour and exclusivity of being apart of it and then the ruthlessness of the business once it's used you up and as the film industry changes and grows. One of the scenes that I'm sure speaks to a lot of actors is the talk between Pitt and Smart's characters about how Pitt and other actors ghosts will be together again on the screen after well long gone when someone plays the film. The end of the film is also extremely satisfying watching everything come together as Calva's character wanted to leave his mark on the industry and did just that: he and the other industry leaders of the era paved the way to aspire upcoming industry leaders to make well made films highly regarded and successful today and will be in the future and to continue to evolve the filmmaking process.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",watched on february th wow there is so much to unpack in this film everyone was on their a game i feel like i didnt watch the same film as others did based on other reviews ive read but margot robbie is a beast this was the first ive seen diego calva and im looking forward to seeing more from him as he was excellent and awards worthy i think this is actually one of brad pitts best performances supporting performances from jean smart li jun li and jovan adepo were also great just wish there was more background into the characters incredible production design from florencia martin and anthony carlino can definitely see them taking the oscar and costume design from mary zophres justin hurwitzs score was great and brought some familiarity from some previous scores especially la la land this was a film about the film industry at first the glamour and exclusivity of being apart of it and then the ruthlessness of the business once its used you up and as the film industry changes and grows one of the scenes that im sure speaks to a lot of actors is the talk between pitt and smarts characters about how pitt and other actors ghosts will be together again on the screen after well long gone when someone plays the film the end of the film is also extremely satisfying watching everything come together as calvas character wanted to leave his mark on the industry and did just that he and the other industry leaders of the era paved the way to aspire upcoming industry leaders to make well made films highly regarded and successful today and will be in the future and to continue to evolve the filmmaking process,POSITIVE

533,533,3.0,29 January 2024,"I had high expectations for this film. A three hour long big budget movie starring Brad Pitt. It must be good or at least a decent movie? Unfortunately, that's not the case here. After I have been struggling to get through the film I wondered, what was this film really about, what was the story, more than a depiction of the decadent 1920's in Hollywood? The main character in the film is Manny a Mexican migrant who ends up in the Hollywood party scene after transporting an elephant to a party in a Hollywood mansion. At the party he meets the wannabe star Nellie. Brad Pitt's character is a director, but his character plays a less prominent role in the plot. Most of the film is devoted to Manny and Nellie. So there isn't much of a story. Things just happen in the film. Someone gets an overdose, some bad guys wants to collect a gambling debt from Nellie, etc. There isn't much story that gives depth to the events that takes place although there is certainly enough time for it. There is also an overuse of shock-value in the film, such as in the beginning when Manny's Mexican partner gets pooped on by the elephant they are transporting or when Nellie is bitten in the neck by a rattle snake that doesn't want to let go. There is also an overuse of curse words, particularly the ""f word"", which I wonder if it's usage was so widespread at that time. The acting is pretty poorly executed as well, it's more emphasis on screaming and cursing than to give a complexity to the characters. In general, this film doesn't give me a feeling of how life in Hollywood was in the 1920's, it feels more like a contemporary setting. That together with that film is really long and boring makes the experience to be just a waste of time.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",i had high expectations for this film a three hour long big budget movie starring brad pitt it must be good or at least a decent movie unfortunately thats not the case here after i have been struggling to get through the film i wondered what was this film really about what was the story more than a depiction of the decadent s in hollywood the main character in the film is manny a mexican migrant who ends up in the hollywood party scene after transporting an elephant to a party in a hollywood mansion at the party he meets the wannabe star nellie brad pitts character is a director but his character plays a less prominent role in the plot most of the film is devoted to manny and nellie so there isnt much of a story things just happen in the film someone gets an overdose some bad guys wants to collect a gambling debt from nellie etc there isnt much story that gives depth to the events that takes place although there is certainly enough time for it there is also an overuse of shockvalue in the film such as in the beginning when mannys mexican partner gets pooped on by the elephant they are transporting or when nellie is bitten in the neck by a rattle snake that doesnt want to let go there is also an overuse of curse words particularly the f word which i wonder if its usage was so widespread at that time the acting is pretty poorly executed as well its more emphasis on screaming and cursing than to give a complexity to the characters in general this film doesnt give me a feeling of how life in hollywood was in the s it feels more like a contemporary setting that together with that film is really long and boring makes the experience to be just a waste of time,NEGATIVE
534,534,1.0,19 April 2023,"Babylon is a dazzling, ambitious, and beautifully made film that tells a fascinating story about the birth of Hollywood, while striking an uncanny relevance to the current moment in filmmaking history. Set in the late 1920s, the film follows a diverse ensemble of characters as they navigate the cutthroat world of Tinseltown amidst a paradigm shift in entertainment. Babylon is a celebration of inclusivity, shedding light on the cultural struggles faced by people of color, the elderly, the LGBTQ+ community, and women in 1920s Hollywood.

Damien Chazelle's masterful direction, combined with stunning cinematography and breathtaking production design, creates a rich tapestry of stories that are both personal and universal. The film serves as a tribute to the resilience and resourcefulness of every member of the production staff, reminding us of the collective efforts that make filmmaking a truly human endeavor.

Babylon not only captures the glamour and grit of early Hollywood but also serves as a fitting metaphor for the potential disruption and innovation brought about by AI technology. As AI-driven NLP tools like Google's Bard and OpenAI's ChatGPT begin to revolutionize the way we create and consume content, they have the potential to democratize filmmaking, making it more inclusive and accessible to everyone.

In this new era, the traditional constraints and struggles of the Hollywood medium may become obsolete. The future of filmmaking could see individuals or small groups collaborating with their AI friends and companions to create their own custom blockbusters. This shift has the potential to create a more inclusive, diverse, and egalitarian future for storytelling.

In a fitting tribute to the film's themes and the technological advancements it foreshadows, this review itself is a collaborative effort between a human and two AI NLPs, Bard and ChatGPT. As we step into this new era, it is essential to remember the importance of balance, using AI as a tool to complement and enhance our creativity while not allowing it to corrupt the core of what makes storytelling a human endeavor.

Overall, Babylon is a brilliant film that is both entertaining and thought-provoking. It serves as a reminder of Hollywood's tumultuous past and a harbinger of the exciting possibilities that lie ahead in the age of AI-assisted filmmaking. A must-see for anyone who loves movies, Babylon is sure to become a classic for years to come, and a beacon of hope for a more inclusive and innovative future in filmmaking.

Original human only review (for some context):

It might take a while, but this movie was absolutely perfectly timed. This movie has me even more hyped for what we're going to be seeing everywhere, and soon. Movies whose entire production crew are one person and some NLPs, and they're going to be better than anything we've created to date and almost overnight, they will demolish Hollywood, not unlike what sound does in this film to the people involved in the silent film industry, but much more completely and much more thoroughly. Through the lens of this film, and many other Hollywood stories, this is absolutely exciting because anyone will be able to create their own custom blockbuster films without a budget (except for distribution and marketing perhaps) with help from their AI friends and nothing that happened in this film will ever have to happen to anyone ever again, and we're on the precipice of that new medium right now. That medium can create anything we can imagine, while simultaneously improving upon it, with Metahuman for UE5 like technology we can create custom actors, we can mix the genetics of our favorites and create a whole new actor, performed and voiced entirely by AI in a film of any style with compositions by the only piece of movie making that is no longer obsolete; the writer/director/producer and their AI companions.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",babylon is a dazzling ambitious and beautifully made film that tells a fascinating story about the birth of hollywood while striking an uncanny relevance to the current moment in filmmaking history set in the late s the film follows a diverse ensemble of characters as they navigate the cutthroat world of tinseltown amidst a paradigm shift in entertainment babylon is a celebration of inclusivity shedding light on the cultural struggles faced by people of color the elderly the lgbtq community and women in s hollywood damien chazelles masterful direction combined with stunning cinematography and breathtaking production design creates a rich tapestry of stories that are both personal and universal the film serves as a tribute to the resilience and resourcefulness of every member of the production staff reminding us of the collective efforts that make filmmaking a truly human endeavor babylon not only captures the glamour and grit of early hollywood but also serves as a fitting metaphor for the potential disruption and innovation brought about by ai technology as aidriven nlp tools like googles bard and openais chatgpt begin to revolutionize the way we create and consume content they have the potential to democratize filmmaking making it more inclusive and accessible to everyone in this new era the traditional constraints and struggles of the hollywood medium may become obsolete the future of filmmaking could see individuals or small groups collaborating with their ai friends and companions to create their own custom blockbusters this shift has the potential to create a more inclusive diverse and egalitarian future for storytelling in a fitting tribute to the films themes and the technological advancements it foreshadows this review itself is a collaborative effort between a human and two ai nlps bard and chatgpt as we step into this new era it is essential to remember the importance of balance using ai as a tool to complement and enhance our creativity while not allowing it to corrupt the core of what makes storytelling a human endeavor overall babylon is a brilliant film that is both entertaining and thoughtprovoking it serves as a reminder of hollywoods tumultuous past and a harbinger of the exciting possibilities that lie ahead in the age of aiassisted filmmaking a mustsee for anyone who loves movies babylon is sure to become a classic for years to come and a beacon of hope for a more inclusive and innovative future in filmmaking original human only review for some context it might take a while but this movie was absolutely perfectly timed this movie has me even more hyped for what were going to be seeing everywhere and soon movies whose entire production crew are one person and some nlps and theyre going to be better than anything weve created to date and almost overnight they will demolish hollywood not unlike what sound does in this film to the people involved in the silent film industry but much more completely and much more thoroughly through the lens of this film and many other hollywood stories this is absolutely exciting because anyone will be able to create their own custom blockbuster films without a budget except for distribution and marketing perhaps with help from their ai friends and nothing that happened in this film will ever have to happen to anyone ever again and were on the precipice of that new medium right now that medium can create anything we can imagine while simultaneously improving upon it with metahuman for ue like technology we can create custom actors we can mix the genetics of our favorites and create a whole new actor performed and voiced entirely by ai in a film of any style with compositions by the only piece of movie making that is no longer obsolete the writerdirectorproducer and their ai companions,POSITIVE
536,536,1.0,26 January 2024,"This is another great film with my favourite Australian actress - Margot Robbie - who is the shooting star in Hollywood currently - and fully deserved, of course :)

In fact, both Margot Robbie and Brad Pitt are superb in this fine film, highlighting that an actors fame and success in Hollywood is very fleeting and superficial (especially if they are drug addicts and alcoholics) unlike great revolutionaries and human rights activists - who are remembered in history much longer. Even though the really great revolutionary Peacemakers - like yours truly, Moses and Jesus - have no money at all, because they are disliked by the establishment for their purity and virtue, and are therefore crucified by corrupt and ignorant politicians.

However, actors and artists certainly also have great merits - as this fine film shows - and often compliment and complete Human Rights Activists and Revolutionaries - like Yin and Yang, cat and dog, America and Mexico, cocaine and beer bottle, trumpet and saxophone - as well as music and freedom.

I also liked the cool elephant in this film, who crashed into the Hollywood Party - who in many ways is symbolic of America, I think.

In fact, Americans are quite different from us Europeans, being not the most intelligent species, but having picked up quite efficient war strategies from their Native American brethren :)

So in all humility, I would like to inform the Putin regime and the Kremlin, that I do not control America fully - as some Americans do not regard me as their President yet - but rather as a revolutionary, who is supposed to get his butt out of America again - or so I have heard.

Also, the US Congress is currently dominated by the Republicans. So should the American elephant be unleashed in Europe - just like in WW2 - the US under my leadership, would push this time for a lasting Peace between America and Russia.

In other words, Russia and the US must finally bury the hatchet, and work together on International Peacebuilding.

It should also be noted, that UN chief Antonio Guterres said that it was time for Russia to end their absurd war in Ukraine, declaring the conflict unwinnable.

Guterres added that the only outcome to more fighting was more suffering, more destruction, and more horror as far as the eye can see.

Hence we are strongly encourage all Russian troops to withdraw from Ukraine and engage in Peace Talks; so that Diplomacy and Dialogue can be restored and Human Rights (UDHR) can be restored in the International Community.

On that note, we encourage all Global Citizens to join us in Meditation and Prayer to manifest Peace on Earth.

Love and Light / Peace Profound.

538,538,8.0,6 February 2023,"A film that has been unfairly battered by critics and certainly deserves much more recognition than it has received on its way through movie screens. Damien Chazelle's new is an excessive ode to the Hollywood of the 20s and the change it has undergone with the birth of talkies.

A powerful film that intentionally exaggerates him behind the scenes of a film industry that as a whole, with all the good and bad that runs through its veins, continues to entertain and dazzle us to this day.

Damien Chazelle allows himself to create his most ambitious film to date and the result can be divided into two parts. A first hour and a half where what Babylon gives us is a true work of art, it is a film that takes us to the maximum excesses and a fabulous presentation of characters and world. With the use of comedy as an initial kick and with two great, very long sequences that place the film within almost absolute perfection. And a second part where the drama and bad decisions are present to drop us abruptly to a second hour and a half where the decisions made by its director are a little more questionable.

That division that we can make with Babylon in no way detracts from what a great movie it turns out to be. It is rather the shock of sensations that can generate one as a spectator.

The reason is as simple as understanding that its director tries to cover too many aspects in which to count and nourish us with an evolution of cinema hand in hand with technology and the new generations.

Now another big highlight is the cast's interpretations of him. Margot Robbie is amazing in the skin of Nellie LaRoy and is the great center that has all this work created by Chazelle. A Brad Pitt who also overwhelms her accompanied by a Diego Calva who try to be the artistic triangle of the work of her director.

Beyond the brilliant interpretations, it is also to frame that these characters also suffer a bit from the excess placed on everything that Babylon means. At times the characters are very close to being great caricatures and lose the most natural authenticity of said characters.

We are in the presence of a film that gives us a clear message of what cinema means and what cinema is at its root. With its excesses and its defects, it is the most conquering art with which we are impregnated and that leaves it Of course, a script that transports us to remove those masks that an industry usually has that at times is very satisfactory for those who are inside it, but it is also a very cruel journey due to the reality that everything happens and everything is renewed for both the big faces like the smaller ones that make up this industry.

Technology and changes are the great villains that Damien Chazelle presents to us in an industry that gives you everything and also quickly leaves you empty if you don't know how to understand it. Wonderful is the dialogue that Brad Pitt has with Jean Smart and that perfectly synthesizes what Babylon is in its central matter.

A film that paradoxically has suffered from the excesses that compose it, but that makes me think that it is the great satisfaction of its director and perhaps what gives him a smile at the end of the day.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",a film that has been unfairly battered by critics and certainly deserves much more recognition than it has received on its way through movie screens damien chazelles new is an excessive ode to the hollywood of the s and the change it has undergone with the birth of talkies a powerful film that intentionally exaggerates him behind the scenes of a film industry that as a whole with all the good and bad that runs through its veins continues to entertain and dazzle us to this day damien chazelle allows himself to create his most ambitious film to date and the result can be divided into two parts a first hour and a half where what babylon gives us is a true work of art it is a film that takes us to the maximum excesses and a fabulous presentation of characters and world with the use of comedy as an initial kick and with two great very long sequences that place the film within almost absolute perfection and a second part where the drama and bad decisions are present to drop us abruptly to a second hour and a half where the decisions made by its director are a little more questionable that division that we can make with babylon in no way detracts from what a great movie it turns out to be it is rather the shock of sensations that can generate one as a spectator the reason is as simple as understanding that its director tries to cover too many aspects in which to count and nourish us with an evolution of cinema hand in hand with technology and the new generations now another big highlight is the casts interpretations of him margot robbie is amazing in the skin of nellie laroy and is the great center that has all this work created by chazelle a brad pitt who also overwhelms her accompanied by a diego calva who try to be the artistic triangle of the work of her director beyond the brilliant interpretations it is also to frame that these characters also suffer a bit from the excess placed on everything that babylon means at times the characters are very close to being great caricatures and lose the most natural authenticity of said characters we are in the presence of a film that gives us a clear message of what cinema means and what cinema is at its root with its excesses and its defects it is the most conquering art with which we are impregnated and that leaves it of course a script that transports us to remove those masks that an industry usually has that at times is very satisfactory for those who are inside it but it is also a very cruel journey due to the reality that everything happens and everything is renewed for both the big faces like the smaller ones that make up this industry technology and changes are the great villains that damien chazelle presents to us in an industry that gives you everything and also quickly leaves you empty if you dont know how to understand it wonderful is the dialogue that brad pitt has with jean smart and that perfectly synthesizes what babylon is in its central matter a film that paradoxically has suffered from the excesses that compose it but that makes me think that it is the great satisfaction of its director and perhaps what gives him a smile at the end of the day,POSITIVE

540,540,9.0,4 February 2023,"Whilst I hadn't read any specific reviews, I knew going in that ""Babylon"" wasn't particularly well received, as well as being quite the financial flop. I nearly didn't go and see it, despite being intrigued by the trailer, but it worked out timewise, so I took the plunge. So glad I did because I really enjoyed it.

In the late 1920's, at a debauched party thrown by Hollywood producer Irving Thalberg (Max Minghella), five characters, at very different stages of their careers, are in attendance. Manny Torres (Diego Calva) is working as a fixer for the studio, but wants to get involved in production. Jack Conrad (Brad Pitt) is the most celebrated leading man of the silent era. Nellie LaRoy (Margot Robbie) is young face looking for a first break. Sidney Palmer (Jovan Adepo) is a jazz trumpeter trying to earn enough money to keep a roof over his head and Fay Zhu (Li Jun Li) is a cabaret singer, celebrated for raunchy act. As they rise to various levels of the industry, increased conservativism, and the arrival of talkies threatens their futures.

Not only did I really like ""Babylon"", if I'm honest I'd struggle to see what you would find to dislike about it. It is, admittedly, a bit chaotic. The party is only the first of several long-frenzied scenes of interplaying action, all of which is wonderfully shot by Chazelle and though there's a sense of tension to it, I didn't ever struggle to keep a handle on what was going on. The performances are really good, with only a couple of moments of the film, both involving Robbie, going further than I really wanted them too. I didn't struggle with the length of the film either, as the three hours went by pretty easily for me.

There are some excesses indulged though, for me that wasn't the overall length as much as the occasional scene. For example, I'm not sure that the scene of LaRoy's reintroduction as a sophisticate needed to go quite as ""Meaning of Life"" as it does do.

Admittedly, with films about Hollywood I'm usually in the pocket anyway - but I came away from this one having felt that this sprawling love letter to movies in general, and not just the silent era, was an equal of something like ""Boogie Nights""","December 23, 2022 (United States)",whilst i hadnt read any specific reviews i knew going in that babylon wasnt particularly well received as well as being quite the financial flop i nearly didnt go and see it despite being intrigued by the trailer but it worked out timewise so i took the plunge so glad i did because i really enjoyed it in the late s at a debauched party thrown by hollywood producer irving thalberg max minghella five characters at very different stages of their careers are in attendance manny torres diego calva is working as a fixer for the studio but wants to get involved in production jack conrad brad pitt is the most celebrated leading man of the silent era nellie laroy margot robbie is young face looking for a first break sidney palmer jovan adepo is a jazz trumpeter trying to earn enough money to keep a roof over his head and fay zhu li jun li is a cabaret singer celebrated for raunchy act as they rise to various levels of the industry increased conservativism and the arrival of talkies threatens their futures not only did i really like babylon if im honest id struggle to see what you would find to dislike about it it is admittedly a bit chaotic the party is only the first of several longfrenzied scenes of interplaying action all of which is wonderfully shot by chazelle and though theres a sense of tension to it i didnt ever struggle to keep a handle on what was going on the performances are really good with only a couple of moments of the film both involving robbie going further than i really wanted them too i didnt struggle with the length of the film either as the three hours went by pretty easily for me there are some excesses indulged though for me that wasnt the overall length as much as the occasional scene for example im not sure that the scene of laroys reintroduction as a sophisticate needed to go quite as meaning of life as it does do admittedly with films about hollywood im usually in the pocket anyway but i came away from this one having felt that this sprawling love letter to movies in general and not just the silent era was an equal of something like boogie nights,POSITIVE

550,550,9.0,25 January 2023,"To me Babylon had to meet high expectations for me to leave the theater satisfied and it did, mostly.

Chazelle manages to combine charming as well as grotesque scenes into one big homage to early Hollywood. He does so by creating scenes one might call obscene (the whole opening sequence) but at the same time manages to include a vast amount of very slow and even intimate parts asking big questions about the importance of once legacy as well as life itself.

All of this is brought together by four characters which all are connected but at the same time tell their own stories. Be it Nelly LaRoy (Margot Robbie) a young woman with the wish to become a big movie star; Manny Torres (Diego Calva) a man trying to fit in and work his way up; Jack Conrad (Brad Pitt) a movie star maybe at the top of his career yet not satisfied; or Sidney Palmer (Jovan Adepo) a musician dreaming big they are all well-acted and have one thing in common: They want to be famous and loved.

551,551,1.0,17 September 2023,"Stopped watching this film at about the 50 minute mark and I think that was pretty generous considering there wasn't much going on. The plot and much of the acting is rather flat and boring. Yes, boring.

The film opens with a party sequence that is intended to titillate the audience but it's literally just an attempt to titillate. It doesn't actually work. The camera does not get placed within the party but is pedestrian; a camera that is just taken around to look at people and stuff rather than actually being engaged/invested in the scenes. So boring, so ordinary when the sequence is supposed to present a set of scenes out of the ordinary. Weird.

I guess the writer/director has mistakenly assumed that his audience has never seen an out of the ordinary film before?

Even Margot Robbie doesn't find the correct tone for her character even though she's taken on a role that affords her, literally, plenty of freedom. Did Robbie actually consider her character is supposed to exist in the 1920's? I think not. She plays the party scenes as if her character lived just last week.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",stopped watching this film at about the minute mark and i think that was pretty generous considering there wasnt much going on the plot and much of the acting is rather flat and boring yes boring the film opens with a party sequence that is intended to titillate the audience but its literally just an attempt to titillate it doesnt actually work the camera does not get placed within the party but is pedestrian a camera that is just taken around to look at people and stuff rather than actually being engagedinvested in the scenes so boring so ordinary when the sequence is supposed to present a set of scenes out of the ordinary weird i guess the writerdirector has mistakenly assumed that his audience has never seen an out of the ordinary film before even margot robbie doesnt find the correct tone for her character even though shes taken on a role that affords her literally plenty of freedom did robbie actually consider her character is supposed to exist in the s i think not she plays the party scenes as if her character lived just last week,NEGATIVE

554,554,1.0,5 February 2023,"I got first introduced to on of Damien Chazzles latest work and it's called La La Land thanks to my big sister. Anyways when I watched as a new audience to on of Damien Chazzles film I realised how unique his writing and directing point of view was and how he appreciated the ""old fashioned Hollywood cinema"". You can really see how much work he puts on his fictional characters to make them as realistic as possible and even make them realable. With Chazzles passion of cinema which I understand have inspired me as a writer and understand what's the point of siting and looking at a movie on the big screen.

Back in 2020 Damien Chazzle announced that he was going to start production on a new film called Babylon. He was set to direct it and even write the script. Since then I was on the edge of my seat every day of waiting for this film to come out, because i have understood how great Chazzle as a filmmaker is. When it came out three years later it lived up to my expectations and once again Damien Chazzle does a excellent job with the movie, especially with the characters.

Babylon is set in early Hollywood 1920s where we can see a big evolution in cinema. From film pictures to sound pictures that we have today. The film is full of great actors such as Margot Robbie, Brad Pitt and a newcomer called Diego Calva.

When you as an audience watch this movie, it's like watching Wolf of Wall Street but on high steroids. The movie was fast paced with bombastic and disgusting scenes, but the film self centres in a romantic-all aspects between two characters. The two characters that the film focuses around is Manny and Nellie both played by Diego Calva and Margot Robbie. These characters are much like Mia and Sebastian in La La land where their love clashes together at the wrong time.

I loved how Damien Chazzle Implanted such a beautiful romantic story arc between Manny and Nellie and you can really understand and appreciate how much they love each other even in the wrong time and place.

Brad Pitt's character is called Jack Conrad. Jack Conrad was an interesting character. In the story he was a belloved and famous actor. In the progress we could slowly see his downfall as an actor because cinema evolves every decade and the audience grows ever larger. His story arc is very similar to the actor himself Brad Pitt where he once was a belloved actor when he was young, but as soon as he got older he has gotten a major downfall in his career. Which I love that Damien Chazzle adapt that in his own story of Babylon to really understand what these old actors go through.

This whole movie was also very comedic most of the times and I haven't laughed so hard on cinema in a long time, because the writing in these comedic moments were amazing.

The ending was very unexpected as always with Damien Chazzles film and a great tribute to cinema. The whole point of the movie is Damien Chazzles answer to the big question, Why is cinema so important. In the movie we learnd that cinema is important to us because we feel no anxiety or feelings when we watch movie on the big screen. We are living trough the screen. At the credit it shows shots of different movies, because the movie is trying to explain how the audience have evolved cinema ans even shows a breif shot of avatar.

The only negative about the movie is that some parts in the movie feels like they were miss placed and should switch order.

Another masterpiece of my favourite director Damien Chazzle.

Thanks for reading my thoughts on Babylon.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",i got first introduced to on of damien chazzles latest work and its called la la land thanks to my big sister anyways when i watched as a new audience to on of damien chazzles film i realised how unique his writing and directing point of view was and how he appreciated the old fashioned hollywood cinema you can really see how much work he puts on his fictional characters to make them as realistic as possible and even make them realable with chazzles passion of cinema which i understand have inspired me as a writer and understand whats the point of siting and looking at a movie on the big screen back in damien chazzle announced that he was going to start production on a new film called babylon he was set to direct it and even write the script since then i was on the edge of my seat every day of waiting for this film to come out because i have understood how great chazzle as a filmmaker is when it came out three years later it lived up to my expectations and once again damien chazzle does a excellent job with the movie especially with the characters babylon is set in early hollywood s where we can see a big evolution in cinema from film pictures to sound pictures that we have today the film is full of great actors such as margot robbie brad pitt and a newcomer called diego calva when you as an audience watch this movie its like watching wolf of wall street but on high steroids the movie was fast paced with bombastic and disgusting scenes but the film self centres in a romanticall aspects between two characters the two characters that the film focuses around is manny and nellie both played by diego calva and margot robbie these characters are much like mia and sebastian in la la land where their love clashes together at the wrong time i loved how damien chazzle implanted such a beautiful romantic story arc between manny and nellie and you can really understand and appreciate how much they love each other even in the wrong time and place brad pitts character is called jack conrad jack conrad was an interesting character in the story he was a belloved and famous actor in the progress we could slowly see his downfall as an actor because cinema evolves every decade and the audience grows ever larger his story arc is very similar to the actor himself brad pitt where he once was a belloved actor when he was young but as soon as he got older he has gotten a major downfall in his career which i love that damien chazzle adapt that in his own story of babylon to really understand what these old actors go through this whole movie was also very comedic most of the times and i havent laughed so hard on cinema in a long time because the writing in these comedic moments were amazing the ending was very unexpected as always with damien chazzles film and a great tribute to cinema the whole point of the movie is damien chazzles answer to the big question why is cinema so important in the movie we learnd that cinema is important to us because we feel no anxiety or feelings when we watch movie on the big screen we are living trough the screen at the credit it shows shots of different movies because the movie is trying to explain how the audience have evolved cinema ans even shows a breif shot of avatar the only negative about the movie is that some parts in the movie feels like they were miss placed and should switch order another masterpiece of my favourite director damien chazzle thanks for reading my thoughts on babylon,POSITIVE

567,567,9.0,19 February 2023,"""Ain't life grand"" is what you will think if you let yourself sink into this excessive, emotional story of ups and downs and the development people go through during their lifetime. We follow many people who risked it all to live the life they always dreamed of, to be part of something larger on movie sets in the Hollywood of the 1920s/1930s. Apart from it going good or bad for them the movie manages to show us what I think are pretty realistic emotions and decision-makings by the main characters during a time in which their whole industry changes dramatically.

As you already know this movie doesn't come short of controversial, excessive scenes and you may not like some of them or even find them misplaced and inappropriate, personally I always had the feeling that they matched the purpose to show us a world that most of us don't know and can hardly imagine. On the other hand there are many scenes that everybody would agree to be well depicted and choreographed, some scenes were literally the funniest or most emotional I've ever seen. More important in my opinion was the overall impression of this film which was phenomenally thrilling.

Why did I give 9/10 then? I do agree with those who say that the movie is too long, half an hour less would have been equally effective and some plot parts have been unnecessarily lengthened.

Still this picture is a must-see, even if you don't like movies like that or dislike it afterwards - requirement is that you have no problem with excessive and explicit scenes though.

573,573,8.0,21 March 2023,"I read a lot reviews for this film and expected somethign shallow. It's definitely not shallow but its massage may go over your head because of the first 30 mins.

Literally, the opening title pops up 30mins in, before that there is scene after scene of debauchery and chaos. It's not a film that panders to a quick-fix audience because Margot and Brad are in it. I think those actors' fans have left all the reviews.

This is a movie about movies at a period when the silent era ended and talkies arrived. It PERFECTLY encapsulated for me the excitement of the big screen. We seem to forget how huge a shift it was to see moving pictures; it was equal to the iPhone.

The people who found their way into the movies were wild-childs, ramblers, hobos and unhinged spirits looking for their place, and found it in Hollywood (and in many ways that is still the case today).

I gave it 10 stars because it told that story to perfection. Margo is superb if a little typecast in the wild-child Jersey girl role. Brad did Brad, but again given his age and his character's arc, it worked really well.

At over 3 hours, I felt it was a perfect length to capture a couple of decades of experimental movie-making. Any shorter and it would have felt lacking in something. Those who say it's too long didn't get the movie.

If you loved the Wolf of Walls Street and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, and are willing to just let the first 1/2 hour take you somewhere wild, this is the movie for you. I'm waiting anxiously to watch it again. There were so many great scenes and performances, it warrants multiple viewings.

575,575,3.0,7 January 2024,Babylon is an overlong film at 3 hours plus with an identity crisis. The only saving grace is the cast elevates the material as best as they can. Without this cast the film would have been an even bigger trainwreck. The film focuses on multiple character storylines all in the backdrop of early 1920's Hollywood. On paper it seems like an interesting concept but on screen it's not as interesting. Margot Robbie and Brad Pitt try their hardest to save this so called Epic but in the end there is only so much screen prescence that they can bring. I almost feel that if they Director would have went in the musical direction with this film it would have been better. The visuals are one of the better areas for this movie.

576,576,8.0,4 February 2023,"It may or may not have been but Damien Chazelle envisages Hollywood in the 1920's as a modern day ""Babylon"" with parties that might have been engineered by Hieronymus Bosch. In the first few minutes of his film an elephant defecates on his handler and a starlet urinates on a naked fat man. This Hollywood isn't a place for prudes or, you might say, 'decent' people. If Cecil B. De Mille had directed this picture the entire cast would be thrust down to Hell by Chuck Heston.

They say nothing succeeds like excess and this is one excessive movie, (I mean why open with an elephant and not a horse?), and it's BIG in a way that almost puts Baz Lurhmann to shame. Of course, it's also derivative. There might be more of everything in Chazelle's vision of Hollywood as Hell but we've been here countless times before. Ultimately, then, it depends on just how well Chazelle handles overly familiar material and the answer to that is very well indeed. This may come to be regarded as one of the great movies about old Hollywood but it doesn't come close to a few standards I could mention.

Of course, as befits a movie of this size Chazelle has assembled quite a cast. A near-perfect Brad Pitt is the alcoholic silent movie star, Margot Robbie, the talentless starlet who becomes a talentless star, Jean Smart is the Hedda Hopperish gossip columnist and then there's Jovan Adepo as the black jazz player who breaks into the mainstream, former child star Lukas Hass, Eric Roberts, Olivia Hamilton as a female director, a terrific P. J. Byrne, Max Mingella as Irving Thalberg, Katherine Waterston, a very creepy Tobey Maguire and perhaps best of all, Diego Calva as the gofer who rises to the top.

Like the movie itself they all go over the top. At times I felt that Chazelle imagined himself as a kind of 21st century D. W. Griffith and as pure cinema this is the real deal, maybe too much so. This is a film that draws attention to itself from shot to shot though what it lacks is something resembling a decent script serving up instead one set piece after another. That said, it is hugely entertaining, a kind of malodorous love letter to cinema.

592,592,9.0,11 February 2023,"It is kind of ironic that a movie which has to be seen on the big screen bombed at the box office. Don't be deterred by the seemingly long runtime, it'll pass by rather quickly, but the picture simply must be seen at the cinema because there is so much going on in literally every other frame and this is a film that should be experienced within an audience as its quite funny and entertaining.

Come join the party! I haven't had this much fun at the movies since Knives Out. I like the way Chazelle used an ensemble cast, a lot of extras and long shots to tell a story about a period where excess was a norm. There is so much of everything and it helps to drive the constant feeling of chaos and non-stop craziness, but the biggest contributor to all this is an outstanding score by Justin Hurwitz which for me should be a clear Oscar winner. In addition, I loved a lot of the frames and sequences and altogether it makes for a stunning viewing. The director managed to incorporate a lot of good quality humor into the storytelling all the while following the arcs of several characters.

Margot Robbie steals the show embodying the role of Wild Child perfectly and sowing madness whenever she steps in the frame. Even though Robbie's performance was excellent, Pitt's was even better. Brad's act oozes class and elegance and it's been a long time since I walked out of a movie theater wanting to be like a character I just saw. His demeanor on screen as a star at that time was perfect. Diego Calva might have announced himself to the wider film public with a strong performance.

However, I felt that the ending could have been better and left a little to be desired but overall I would still recommend you to see it, especially if you can catch it in theaters.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",it is kind of ironic that a movie which has to be seen on the big screen bombed at the box office dont be deterred by the seemingly long runtime itll pass by rather quickly but the picture simply must be seen at the cinema because there is so much going on in literally every other frame and this is a film that should be experienced within an audience as its quite funny and entertaining come join the party i havent had this much fun at the movies since knives out i like the way chazelle used an ensemble cast a lot of extras and long shots to tell a story about a period where excess was a norm there is so much of everything and it helps to drive the constant feeling of chaos and nonstop craziness but the biggest contributor to all this is an outstanding score by justin hurwitz which for me should be a clear oscar winner in addition i loved a lot of the frames and sequences and altogether it makes for a stunning viewing the director managed to incorporate a lot of good quality humor into the storytelling all the while following the arcs of several characters margot robbie steals the show embodying the role of wild child perfectly and sowing madness whenever she steps in the frame even though robbies performance was excellent pitts was even better brads act oozes class and elegance and its been a long time since i walked out of a movie theater wanting to be like a character i just saw his demeanor on screen as a star at that time was perfect diego calva might have announced himself to the wider film public with a strong performance however i felt that the ending could have been better and left a little to be desired but overall i would still recommend you to see it especially if you can catch it in theaters,POSITIVE

595,595,5.0,5 August 2023,"I love silent film. Why? Take a look at it. If you haven't seen it, or haven't seen much of it, you might think it's a bunch of wildly gesticulating apes trying to smack the audience in the kisser to struggle to convey the storyline. That is the exact opposite of what silent cinema was all about.

The silents were a matter of subtlety. Look at Garbo's eyes, at Lillian Gish's balletic movements, at the depressed or ebullient posture of John Gilbert or the thousands of delicious nuances of Chaplin. They trusted the intelligence of their audiences that they would notice such things.

""Babylon"" smacked us over the head with a series of blows from a sledgehammer. It lacked class or grace. It had all the subtlety of a spell of elephant diarrhea (depicted near the opening of the film anointing one of the characters).

Did the people in the silents have such bacchanals as depicted. They had wild parties, but, from what I know, not like that. They reenacted the tired rumor about Fatty Arbuckle and Virginia Rappe (a charge hyped by the Hearst press and one that he was proven innocent of committing). The twisted rumors about Clara Bow, in the Margot Robbie character of Nellie LaRoy are too far from truth to go into here.

I am okay with nudity in film. I'm fine with course language and violence, to a point. But ""Babylon"" made me yearn for the return of the Production Code. If you get a chance, don't see it.

597,597,8.0,29 September 2023,"""Babylon,"" the 2022 cinematic offering, takes us on a mesmerizing journey into the heart of 1920s Hollywood, a time when the film industry was undergoing a seismic shift. Director Damien Chazelle's vision is nothing short of spectacular, and the result is a film that stands as a testament to the magic of cinema.

Set against the backdrop of a transforming industry, ""Babylon"" is a dazzling exploration of ambition, artistry, and the pursuit of stardom. The ensemble cast breathes life into this era, with their characters wrestling with their own dreams and desires in the unforgiving world of showbiz.

Chazelle's direction is masterful, from the sweeping camera work that captures the opulence of the era's Hollywood to the meticulous attention to detail in recreating the period. The film's use of both silent and sound sequences is a brilliant homage to the evolving technology of the time, underscoring the movie's central theme of progress and the human cost it often entails.

What truly elevates ""Babylon"" is its profound exploration of the sacrifices artists make in the pursuit of their craft. It delves into the highs and lows of fame, the allure of the silver screen, and the personal toll exacted in this glittering world of illusion.

The score is a symphonic masterpiece that weaves seamlessly through the narrative, enhancing every emotion and resonating with the audience long after the credits roll.

""Babylon"" is a triumph of storytelling and a cinematic tour de force. It not only pays homage to the golden age of Hollywood but also serves as a thought-provoking reflection on the price of fame and artistic expression.

608,608,9.0,13 July 2023,"""Babylon"" is a comedy drama film written and directed by Damien Chazelle (""Whiplash"", ""La La Land"", ""First Man""). Starring Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie, and Diego Calva, it offers the viewer a no holds barred look at an important transitional era in classic Hollywood.

In 1926, young Mexican immigrant Manny Torres (Diego Calva) arrives in Los Angeles where he aspires to become part of the movie business. As he works one night at a party held at a studio executive's large mansion, Manny meets Nellie LaRoy (Margot Robbie), an unapologetically brash up-and-coming actress whose attitude causes him to become smitten with her. Later that night, Manny befriends silent film star Jack Conrad (Brad Pitt), who takes a liking to Manny after he drives Jack's drunken self home from the party. To show his gratitude, Jack gives Manny an assistant job at the studio, which helps him rise through the ranks of the film industry. Meanwhile, Nellie's popularity begins to soar, with her brand of sassiness landing her many starring roles in silent films. As the decade advances, sound films start to phase out silent features and while Manny manages to adapt to the changes, both Nellie and Jack struggle to conform to these new creative demands.

One of the most pivotal eras in the history of cinema was the decade known colloquially as the ""Roaring Twenties"". It was early in this period that silent films reigned supreme with their visual storytelling leaving an impact on audiences worldwide. However, with the release of sound features like ""The Jazz Singer"" in 1927, silent movies were eventually phased out to allow for more open creativity in filmmaking. During this transitional stage, film studios were forced to adapt with the times and many silent film stars who didn't comply were quickly forgotten about by the public. In Damien Chazelle's ""Babylon"", we are shown an overly extravagant and unrelenting chronicle of the Hollywood system during this era, in a film that does not let up on its depiction of debauchery.

The film wastes no time introducing its audience to the wild immorality that was rampant during this time period. In only the first scene, our main character Manny is seen helping transport a large elephant to a party rife with orgies, cocaine use, and excessive drunkenness everywhere he steps. Upon arriving, we notice that there's barely a place where Manny can walk that isn't a graphic, debaucherous experience for both him and the viewer. Since the film's title alludes to ""Babylon"", an ancient city infamous for its sin and depravity, it makes sense for it to open with such shocking content, as it is clearly intended to show the parallels between this era of Hollywood and the titular biblical city. No doubt the extent of what is going on at this party will be difficult to stomach for many unsuspecting audiences, but for those who can appreciate this clever comparison in a creative context will understand its necessity in setting the tone for things to come.

Something else that should prove challenging to some viewers is the film's lengthy runtime of over three hours (189 minutes to be precise). Although the film is never boring, the sheer scale of its story means there is a lot of content to cover, focusing primarily on the dire consequences of living a hedonistic lifestyle. Though I do appreciate the film for not holding back with its epic showcase of the degeneracy of that time, even a seasoned viewer like myself found it hard to sit through many scenes that essentially serve the same purpose. Once you've witnessed hordes of people doing drugs during a mass orgy, you tend to become desensitised to the other depraved scenes shown over the course of three hours. By the time the film reaches the final act, we are treated to even more disturbing scenes, some of which I cannot even write here out of fear of being censored. Most of these parts felt like they were inserted for shock value and don't really contribute anything useful to the story. With that in mind, some of these moments appear to be played for macabre laughs so depending on how twisted your sense of humour is, you could consider it the film's attempt at comic relief.

Through its three lead characters, director Damien Chazelle shows us the different ways the shift from silent to sound films affected the various people employed in the industry. For example, Manny is required to learn the importance of working on a quiet set, as even the slightest noise can undo an entire day's worth of setting up a scene. Due to the then-primitive technology available at the time, one otherwise simple scene can lead to several takes just to get it right. In Nellie's case, she is unable to properly speak her lines at an audible volume, as she is not used to acting using her voice in addition to her appearance. Her frustrations reach a boiling point, quite literally, when she finds the temperature of the set is too hot because air conditioners cannot be used during filming due to noise. Being a veteran in the business, Jack assumes he can easily adjust to the times in sound films but audiences are unable to take him seriously due to his inability to act beyond his physical limitations. As a result, his popularity quickly fades, causing him to sink into a deep depression. What I enjoyed about this film was the clever way Chazelle featured all three characters' stories intertwining with each other at certain points, sometimes incidentally and sometimes deliberately. In doing so, he gives us a wider scope of the changes going on during this period, and how they necessitated everybody's acquiescence to this new style of filmmaking, no matter how insignificant.

Despite being billed lower than his better known co-stars, I think Diego Calva was the true highlight of the film as Manny. The reason for this is that Manny is the character with the most room to grow, essentially starting out as a blank canvas with only his uncertain future in the film industry to paint it for him. I really enjoyed watching how Manny changes throughout the course of the story, going from a mild mannered immigrant to a powerhouse figure in the business of filmmaking, transitioning near seamlessly from silent to sound movies. It isn't easy to upstage two A-list actors, but Calva somehow managed to pull all of this off with flying colours.

Margot Robbie also shines as Nellie, a woman whose distinct personality helped make her a star in the world of motion pictures. Though her character arc isn't anything new (she comes from a broken home like most of these starlets), it is Robbie's performance that helps elevate Nellie above what could have been another depiction of Hollywood conditioning. Her diva behaviour coupled with her personal insecurities mirrors real life silent film star Clara Bow, who notably struggled to keep up with the advent of sound pictures taking over the medium she was already so familiar with. You can't help but feel a bit sorry for Nellie, even if half the time she brings her problems on herself throughout the story.

The most tragic character in the film has to be Jack, played in a sympathetic light by Brad Pitt. At first, I half expected Pitt to play Jack as a cocky womaniser, but he is actually relatively good-natured for the most part, at least by famous celebrity standards. Here is a man who knows his star is fading, often reduced to the butt of many jokes by gossip columnists and audiences alike. All around him, new and younger faces are emerging to take his place in the spotlight, viewing him as nothing more than a product of a bygone era. No matter how hard he tries to adjust to change, Jack just cannot seem to find a way to remain relevant in this new world of talking pictures. Like Nellie, he too is a victim of the Hollywood system.

For those who take a particular interest in film history, ""Babylon"" provides an uncompromising view of how things really were during a crucial changeover period in the world of cinema. It may not be easy for many to sit through, but anyone brave enough to endure on can view it as an important parable about what Hollywood has always done to those who have ""made it"" in their cutthroat industry. The film's limited appeal is perhaps its biggest downfall, as I cannot really see anybody beyond a curious film buff taking an interest in wanting to watch it. On that note, I just so happen to be one of those viewers so I suppose there is a audience out there for it after all.

isnt a graphic debaucherous experience for both him and the viewer since the films title alludes to babylon an ancient city infamous for its sin and depravity it makes sense for it to open with such shocking content as it is clearly intended to show the parallels between this era of hollywood and the titular biblical city no doubt the extent of what is going on at this party will be difficult to stomach for many unsuspecting audiences but for those who can appreciate this clever comparison in a creative context will understand its necessity in setting the tone for things to come something else that should prove challenging to some viewers is the films lengthy runtime of over three hours minutes to be precise although the film is never boring the sheer scale of its story means there is a lot of content to cover focusing primarily on the dire consequences of living a hedonistic lifestyle though i do appreciate the film for not holding back with its epic showcase of the degeneracy of that time even a seasoned viewer like myself found it hard to sit through many scenes that essentially serve the same purpose once youve witnessed hordes of people doing drugs during a mass orgy you tend to become desensitised to the other depraved scenes shown over the course of three hours by the time the film reaches the final act we are treated to even more disturbing scenes some of which i cannot even write here out of fear of being censored most of these parts felt like they were inserted for shock value and dont really contribute anything useful to the story with that in mind some of these moments appear to be played for macabre laughs so depending on how twisted your sense of humour is you could consider it the films attempt at comic relief through its three lead characters director damien chazelle shows us the different ways the shift from silent to sound films affected the various people employed in the industry for example manny is required to learn the importance of working on a quiet set as even the slightest noise can undo an entire days worth of setting up a scene due to the thenprimitive technology available at the time one otherwise simple scene can lead to several takes just to get it right in nellies case she is unable to properly speak her lines at an audible volume as she is not used to acting using her voice in addition to her appearance her frustrations reach a boiling point quite literally when she finds the temperature of the set is too hot because air conditioners cannot be used during filming due to noise being a veteran in the business jack assumes he can easily adjust to the times in sound films but audiences are unable to take him seriously due to his inability to act beyond his physical limitations as a result his popularity quickly fades causing him to sink into a deep depression what i enjoyed about this film was the clever way chazelle featured all three characters stories intertwining with each other at certain points sometimes incidentally and sometimes deliberately in doing so he gives us a wider scope of the changes going on during this period and how they necessitated everybodys acquiescence to this new style of filmmaking no matter how insignificant despite being billed lower than his better known costars i think diego calva was the true highlight of the film as manny the reason for this is that manny is the character with the most room to grow essentially starting out as a blank canvas with only his uncertain future in the film industry to paint it for him i really enjoyed watching how manny changes throughout the course of the story going from a mild mannered immigrant to a powerhouse figure in the business of filmmaking transitioning near seamlessly from silent to sound movies it isnt easy to upstage two alist actors but calva somehow managed to pull all of this off with flying colours margot robbie also shines as nellie a woman whose distinct personality helped make her a star in the world of motion pictures though her character arc isnt anything new she comes from a broken home like most of these starlets it is robbies performance that helps elevate nellie above what could have been another depiction of hollywood conditioning her diva behaviour coupled with her personal insecurities mirrors real life silent film star clara bow who notably struggled to keep up with the advent of sound pictures taking over the medium she was already so familiar with you cant help but feel a bit sorry for nellie even if half the time she brings her problems on herself throughout the story the most tragic character in the film has to be jack played in a sympathetic light by brad pitt at first i half expected pitt to play jack as a cocky womaniser but he is actually relatively goodnatured for the most part at least by famous celebrity standards here is a man who knows his star is fading often reduced to the butt of many jokes by gossip columnists and audiences alike all around him new and younger faces are emerging to take his place in the spotlight viewing him as nothing more than a product of a bygone era no matter how hard he tries to adjust to change jack just cannot seem to find a way to remain relevant in this new world of talking pictures like nellie he too is a victim of the hollywood system for those who take a particular interest in film history babylon provides an uncompromising view of how things really were during a crucial changeover period in the world of cinema it may not be easy for many to sit through but anyone brave enough to endure on can view it as an important parable about what hollywood has always done to those who have made it in their cutthroat industry the films limited appeal is perhaps its biggest downfall as i cannot really see anybody beyond a curious film buff taking an interest in wanting to watch it on that note i just so happen to be one of those viewers so i suppose there is a audience out there for it after all i rate it,POSITIVE
609,609,1.0,28 March 2023,"Honestly, when the movie opened with a poop joke, I was afraid. I thought this was the humor we were going to get for the rest of the movie. And I was right... sort of. There is an abundance of crude humor in this film, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but a lot of it is the typical adult comedy gross out humor or excessive profanity. Defecating on people. Throwing up on people. The usual stuff. At this point, that kind of humor is just really boring to me. But the audience in my theater was having a blast with the jokes, so who am I to say it's not funny.

But there were a fair amount of good jokes for me too. Though, they were more like side jokes rather than the longer gags the movie does.

But even though this movie is advertised mainly as a comedy first, there is luckily so much more to this film.

This movie has a very long prologue. But it is a blast. The set and choreography at the party is extremely loud and chaotic, but it's entertaining and establishes our main characters perfectly.

The movie seems like director Damien Chazelle took The Wolf of Wall street and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, mashed them together and seasoned it with a touch of Cinema Paradiso (and obviously singin' in the rain). Except that ""OUATIH"" and ""Cinema Paradiso"" are more of a love letter to classic cinema. This movie does not shy away from showing how disgusting, arrogant and shallow the film industry can be. Though it does ultimately end on a positive note in my interpretation.

The story follows an aspiring filmmaker, an aspiring actress and a superstar at the end of his career. All these characters are great and obviously played amazingly by this all star cast. The standout for me being Diego Calva, who I didn't even know before this movie. But his character is super likeable, and he does surprisingly hold his own against Brad Pitt and Margot.

More than once the movie kind of leaves you hanging with its story. It jumps from one crazy and over the top scene to the next. But it doesn't lose focus of our protagonists and develops them alongside the mayhem going on around them.

Somewhere around the middle part of the movie, things almost slow to a halt, and it makes you wonder where the heck they will go from here. Because it has a runtime of about 3hrs, I knew there was more to come. But surprisingly enough, it picks up again with the introduction of Tobey Maguires character, who is hilarious. Maybe I'm biased because I've never seen him in a role like this, and it threw me off. But from there on out it gets even crazier.

As you may be able to tell, the movie does a lot of things, and it does balance them well. Even though, like mentioned before, it does leave you hanging with where the movie is going more than once.

As usual in a Damien Chazelle Film, the soundtrack is amazing. It underscores the craziness of this film perfectly, and sometimes just goes all out with its speed and volume.

So that's Babylon. I'd say if the first part of my review didn't scare you away, you're going to have a great time with this film. There is so much here for film lovers and, generally, is just a really good time. Too bad that the marketing failed the movie, because I do think it does have a wider appeal than what the box office shows.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",honestly when the movie opened with a poop joke i was afraid i thought this was the humor we were going to get for the rest of the movie and i was right sort of there is an abundance of crude humor in this film which isnt necessarily a bad thing but a lot of it is the typical adult comedy gross out humor or excessive profanity defecating on people throwing up on people the usual stuff at this point that kind of humor is just really boring to me but the audience in my theater was having a blast with the jokes so who am i to say its not funny but there were a fair amount of good jokes for me too though they were more like side jokes rather than the longer gags the movie does but even though this movie is advertised mainly as a comedy first there is luckily so much more to this film this movie has a very long prologue but it is a blast the set and choreography at the party is extremely loud and chaotic but its entertaining and establishes our main characters perfectly the movie seems like director damien chazelle took the wolf of wall street and once upon a time in hollywood mashed them together and seasoned it with a touch of cinema paradiso and obviously singin in the rain except that ouatih and cinema paradiso are more of a love letter to classic cinema this movie does not shy away from showing how disgusting arrogant and shallow the film industry can be though it does ultimately end on a positive note in my interpretation the story follows an aspiring filmmaker an aspiring actress and a superstar at the end of his career all these characters are great and obviously played amazingly by this all star cast the standout for me being diego calva who i didnt even know before this movie but his character is super likeable and he does surprisingly hold his own against brad pitt and margot more than once the movie kind of leaves you hanging with its story it jumps from one crazy and over the top scene to the next but it doesnt lose focus of our protagonists and develops them alongside the mayhem going on around them somewhere around the middle part of the movie things almost slow to a halt and it makes you wonder where the heck they will go from here because it has a runtime of about hrs i knew there was more to come but surprisingly enough it picks up again with the introduction of tobey maguires character who is hilarious maybe im biased because ive never seen him in a role like this and it threw me off but from there on out it gets even crazier as you may be able to tell the movie does a lot of things and it does balance them well even though like mentioned before it does leave you hanging with where the movie is going more than once as usual in a damien chazelle film the soundtrack is amazing it underscores the craziness of this film perfectly and sometimes just goes all out with its speed and volume so thats babylon id say if the first part of my review didnt scare you away youre going to have a great time with this film there is so much here for film lovers and generally is just a really good time too bad that the marketing failed the movie because i do think it does have a wider appeal than what the box office shows,POSITIVE

612,612,8.0,21 March 2024,"Not enough words could adequately describe the misery inflicted on sane viewers by this over-everything work. Some years back, this movie would have killed the careers of all associated with it (and rightly so) - but with today's low-grade expectations, we will sadly see them all again. Apart from some slick technical achievements nothing could redeem this low life trash-fest. Of course, certain 'critics' seem to think it's trendy to go with the 'Awards' set, but then look at the low ticket sales for genuine public opinion; It's a Bomb.

If early movie making and lifestyles went halfway like this, very little would have been made, and more people would have ended in early graves than actually did. Writer/director Damian Chazelle (La La Land) is another classic example of the overindulgence and stupidity of this modern day industry. Because one of his earlier movies was a hit, the studio honchos and foolish producers gave him a blank cheque --thinking he can't go wrong-- but he does, in a very $BIG way. Here, he totally goes overboard with everything, proving himself incapable of creating a worthwhile project, and dragging everyone else down the sewer with him.

From the moment the Elephant defecates all over the truck driver within the first 5 mins you know it's heading to being a stinker. For a film made on an outlandish Super Budget, there are so many bad technical moments that actually make this picture worse than those it sets out to lampoon. Just one example is the main star that runs out of a door with blood covering 98% of his face but comes out the other side with a clean face! Not even a 'B' pic would allow that to remain in the final cut.

This is crammed with so many ludicrous, drug-fuelled grotty orgies that the editors have difficulties matching scenes with any continuity; the end result is just a headache inducing, nauseating left-over dogs dinner. There are just too many other flaws to list.

Big money, big stars and a poor script, do not a good movie make, and filling it with nonstop sickening low-life perversity of every persuasion kills it even further. It's played too straight to be successful satire and too repugnant for mainstream, 99% of characters are unlikeable, and it goes on interminably. This moviemaker has foolishly fallen into the same trap he's supposedly exposing.

615,615,8.0,20 July 2023,"The opening scenes of 'Babylon' show an orgiastic party during Hollywood's period of excess just prior to the arrival of the 'talkies'. Amidst the debauchery, Mexican studio gofer Manny spots starlet Nellie and falls in love, and their tepid romance is utilized as an intermittent thread running through this marathon movieland saga by writer/director Chazelle.

From the outset the film dispels any notion that old Hollywood was all glamor, with episodes depicting an incontinent elephant and Fatty Arbuckle receiving a golden shower, followed by a display of projectile vomiting from Nellie. The movie then busies itself portraying some real-life Hollywood scandals mingled with invented ones. The love affair fizzles like a damp squib just as it did in Cazelle's previous big success 'La La Land' - Margot Robbie wears out her welcome with over-acted tantrums and meltdowns, while Diego Calva as her suitor Manny is limited to expressions of unrequited longing. Providing some relief from the histrionics, Brad Pitt does contribute a nuanced turn as a silent star confronting his fading career, but everything else is immediately forgettable.

621,621,2.0,22 January 2023,"Rarely have I experienced such a horrible way to waste 3 hours and 10 minutes. This supposed homage to Hollywood at the time of its transition from silent film to talkies is in reality director Chazelle's embarassingly stupid vanity project. Whiplash was excellent, La-La Land was hit-and-miss, but this is all a downhill-crashing debacle. We get everything but the kitchen sink thrown in at us in a heap, and in a particularly offensive way, especially to any true film lover with any knowledge of Hollywood in the 1920s to the 1950s. Kenneth Anger's Hollywood Babylon, Fellini clowns, Tod Browning circus freaks, Orson Welles camera angles, a grotesque final montage that preposterously attempts to sum up over a century of cinema in 3 minutes, from Méliès to Avatar... There is no end to the ridicule here.

The director's gross fascination with body fluids is another embarrassment -- and as repulsive as can be, as we are treated to a non-stop avalanche of feces, urine, fake semen, vomit, spit, blood, sweat and (justifiably) tears. It is a sorry affair indeed, when a director shows his inner world to be so repulsive.

The three main characters are totally one-dimensional and don't evolve in any discernible way throughout the narrative. Brad Pitt as a Douglas Fairbanks / John Gilbert analogon is his old reliable self and does the job, with no particular intensity though. Margot Robbie is pretty good, in a hysterical sort of way. Tobey Maguire's performance seems so out-of-control one wonders how he managed to get away with this. The other performers are all very much bland and no secondary characters stand out or even seem to have any depth, thanks to dull, superficial writing.

624,624,9.0,28 February 2023,"Babylon is one of the most dazzling over-the-top movies I've watched from the 2022 releases, and I love it!

We often watch movies that are made as glamorous love letters to cinema and filmmaking but how about shedding light on the darkness and misery behind it, which is exactly what Damien Chazelle does with Babylon traveling back in history to the highs of the wild era of silent cinema.

He gives us a contrasting reflection between glamour and dark insights of Hollywood told through various sceneries of a golden time of the 1920s exploring the bloom of a transitional film industry direction and the artistic adaptation journey of it with redefining purposes and deeper meanings both artistically and personally.

Each sequence gets you invested in it differently, while some manage to absolutely amaze you, some felt rather underwhelming and overstuffed, but altogether in the mix it works under one ultimate profound premise, there is a unique depth in each storyline that leaves you to question it further.

And yes, it can feel quite intimidating with the messiness of the narrative and visuals but this is something I actually liked to my surprise, it's a beautifully chaotic and brilliant masterpiece that charms you. Also a little long of a runtime, though you wouldn't feel it if you're fully engaged.

I like how the director chose to give us 3 different perspectives and their leveled experiences within the same industry exploring shifts between the male and female gaze, the ideas of eternal legacy and self-esteem as an artist, the passion for creating lasting cinema vs empty egoistic desires for fame, and the lengths you're willing to go to in the times of your rise and facing what awaits you by the end at your downfall as a natural result of life's cycle with a forever-lasting mark of your own you leave behind.

The cinematography was a major compelling element of the movie, it was magical.

Cinematographer Linus Sandgren camera language was dynamic and full of realism in its visual exploration and observation of the story, capturing the curiosity and intensity of the environment in dreamy imagery complemented by his choice of shooting anamorphic on film which created the right visual textures combined with the rich colors, bold contrast, and grain.

This is by far my top favorite soundtrack of any 2022 movie, the score is a blasting epic. Justin Hurwitz did amazingly, I hope he wins for it this awards season. I also liked how music was smartly utilized as a transitional element in the visual storytelling, it made the transitions feel smooth.

I love the range Margot Robbie can go to, her ability and talent to embody complex characters is outstanding, she can easily pierce through your mind and let you engage with her. I may see a bit of a reiteration of her past roles, I personally like how she pulls it off despite that.

Diego Calva was the perfect addition to the cast with a natural felt and charming performance, and his chemistry with Margot was beautiful. I really loved his role, he's such an underrated actor I definitely want to see more of him.

As for Brad Pitt, I think this is one of his best roles in a while, he was shining in his performance in the way he knows best.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",babylon is one of the most dazzling overthetop movies ive watched from the releases and i love it we often watch movies that are made as glamorous love letters to cinema and filmmaking but how about shedding light on the darkness and misery behind it which is exactly what damien chazelle does with babylon traveling back in history to the highs of the wild era of silent cinema he gives us a contrasting reflection between glamour and dark insights of hollywood told through various sceneries of a golden time of the s exploring the bloom of a transitional film industry direction and the artistic adaptation journey of it with redefining purposes and deeper meanings both artistically and personally each sequence gets you invested in it differently while some manage to absolutely amaze you some felt rather underwhelming and overstuffed but altogether in the mix it works under one ultimate profound premise there is a unique depth in each storyline that leaves you to question it further and yes it can feel quite intimidating with the messiness of the narrative and visuals but this is something i actually liked to my surprise its a beautifully chaotic and brilliant masterpiece that charms you also a little long of a runtime though you wouldnt feel it if youre fully engaged i like how the director chose to give us different perspectives and their leveled experiences within the same industry exploring shifts between the male and female gaze the ideas of eternal legacy and selfesteem as an artist the passion for creating lasting cinema vs empty egoistic desires for fame and the lengths youre willing to go to in the times of your rise and facing what awaits you by the end at your downfall as a natural result of lifes cycle with a foreverlasting mark of your own you leave behind the cinematography was a major compelling element of the movie it was magical cinematographer linus sandgren camera language was dynamic and full of realism in its visual exploration and observation of the story capturing the curiosity and intensity of the environment in dreamy imagery complemented by his choice of shooting anamorphic on film which created the right visual textures combined with the rich colors bold contrast and grain this is by far my top favorite soundtrack of any movie the score is a blasting epic justin hurwitz did amazingly i hope he wins for it this awards season i also liked how music was smartly utilized as a transitional element in the visual storytelling it made the transitions feel smooth i love the range margot robbie can go to her ability and talent to embody complex characters is outstanding she can easily pierce through your mind and let you engage with her i may see a bit of a reiteration of her past roles i personally like how she pulls it off despite that diego calva was the perfect addition to the cast with a natural felt and charming performance and his chemistry with margot was beautiful i really loved his role hes such an underrated actor i definitely want to see more of him as for brad pitt i think this is one of his best roles in a while he was shining in his performance in the way he knows best,POSITIVE

Babylon is 3 hours of movie love, an exposé and recall to Hollywood's transition from silent to sound films. With a diverse cast, Babylon fully shows how its characters navigate through the pivotal change in movie making.

The first half of Babylon is an overwhelming and dazzling display of what that time period was. But, as the movie stretches into its concluding half, the beautiful chaos that preceded quickly dwindles and the direction becomes lost, giving off the feeling that the director became too ambitious or indulgent and didn't know how to properly move his story along.

The themes of Babylon are explored without hesitance. Babylon brings a mix of identity, social mobility and climbing, and capitalistic greed with as much nudity, violence and drugs it can get away with.

If the exploration of movie making in the 1920s and 1930s isn't enough reason to see Babylon, the cast should be. Margot Robbie and Brad Pitt seamlessly weave through with a nuanced portrayal of their characters, in such a way that only well seasoned acts can. Diego Calva also delivers a revelatory performance as Manuel 'manny' Torres. The score, cinematography and locations of Babylon are also fitting.

Babylon would have been a masterpiece with restraint from its director, needing a few cuts and edits, nonetheless, it is a thrilling and entertaining piece of cinematic magic.

629,629,1.0,29 March 2023,"Jumping from one crazy scene to another, Babylon paints a fairytale of the Hollywood movie making industry from the 20's to the 50's and the move from silent movie to talking colored films. As a fairytale it does not try to depict real life events but rather loosely presents characters and stories that might have existed in that era.

Babylon is obnoxious, loud, colorful, and unapologetic. It is an artistic masterpiece rather than a film, and rightfully owns its R rating due to a generous use of drugs, nudity, and other non family-appropriate spectacles such as bodily excrements. It is also 3 hours long, so when I say it is not for everyone, you start seeing what I mean.

One must note that the production quality here is top-notch. Acting is phenomenal all-around, as well as the soundtrack. Some of the scenes are very hard to produce due to lighting, number of stand-ins and choreography. Alas, those are performed perfectly and from this perspective, Babylon is a masterpiece.

With its impressiveness also lies its weakness. It is a heavy creation and does not hold back to accommodate more casual movie goers, all the way up to the end where everything just blows up on the screen with no particular closure. However, if you can stomach a 3 hr long of being pounded with the most peculiar and colorful scenes you most likely ever saw on the big screen, this might be a must watch for you. Otherwise, if you are just interested in Hollywood history, watch ""one upon a time in Hollywood"" which tells a much more coherent story.

I can safely say that Babylon takes on a long, crazy ride with a story that takes the time to set the backstory and the psychology of each character and does not fall into the easy trick of making a shorter film to please the rushed crowd.

The movie evolves around many themes: exploring the rise and fall of the hungry and ambitious men and women in hollywood, set at turning point of cinema history (showing its impact on the industry and on the actors that lived it in a funny, deep and realistic way), and Babylon turns out to even be a great tribute to cinema.

The crazy scenes filled with drugs, sex and depravity are astonishing, and set greatly the scene to all the story that is depicted and to the morale that is explored and tackled throughout the movie.

This director to my mind has made his last bizarre movie costing millions of dollars in the process and quite frankly wasting everyones time on a personal indulgence, will someone wise up in Hollywood and make sure this guy is cancelled.

This movie was total rubbish from start to finish with no redeeming features. There was no discernible story, little character development or indeed believable characters you could invest in. A silly freneticism throughout with a wholly gratuitous element of sensationalism.

There were derivative elements stolen from Quentin Tarantino & Monty Python. What possessed some of these great actors to wreck their careers on this project, but then we must never forget Judi Dench in Cats!

Margot Robbie, tried to fill the arid script with some extraordinary ""large"" acting, however 10 minutes in watching this selfish and self absorbed character it really began to grate. Brad Pitt merely played himself, and Diego Calva seemed to have been to the AB school of acting and used the same two faces for everything. I can't bring myself to speak about Toby McGuire, dire, but Jovan Adepo was a real find, I was convinced.

The movie seemed to fixate on body fluids, excrement and unnecessary nudity, none of these elements added anything to the movie and I questions the director's motivations for them being present at all.

I won't repeat what a lot of folks talked about already, the Singin'in the rain sync (down to Nellie's pronunciation of Pi-erre... a la Jean Hagen!).

I think I really enjoyed Babylon because of all the points of reference I have as a die hard old Hollywood fan. The tear scene where Nelly can cry at will from either eye was very much Joan Crawford's story where she could, at will, control her tearducts. The Brad Pitt character obviously built around John Gilbert and his death reminds me of Lionel Barrymore's suicide in Dinner at 8... I could go one because Babylon is full of those references. So maybe, without those, it might not ring as real or true as it does.

639,639,5.0,10 June 2023,"""Babylon"" is a stitched-together motion picture made up of wonderfully produced scenes connected to one another only by the presence of the same actors/characters.

Pitt and Robey are quite good, and there are a few terrific performances by lesser known actors, such as PJ Byrne and Olivia Hamilton. It's the schizophrenic plot that's the problem.

I wanted the film to have some connection to the historical Hollywood that I've read about. But, to say the film is ""loosely based on"" real events or people is being far too generous.

The sexual excesses were also all of a piece with the absurd production faults depicted in the movie's stories about movie making in that time and place.

Contrapuntal accents in movie making vignettes expressing hope and humanity, for example the audience's reaction to. Al Jolson's The Jazz Singer, and in the Jovan Adepo character Sidney Palmer's glorious jazz artistry, were accentuated that much more by the background of a maximally debauched culture.

Having written these thoughts, I am now getting a David Lynch-ian read off of the mix of perfect flaws in Babylon's Production Design.

Its interesting because i never realised Hollywood was so wild and messed up during the silent 20's era, and you wouldn't think these days how much ""talkies"" changed everything back then.

After a gross opening (which may put many off) the movie gets alot better when the plot kicks in and shows the rise and fall of these characters. Its original, funny, shocking, and even has a suspenceful bit like something out of a horror movie. Starring Tobey maguire.

Margot Robbie is fantastic in the movie. Which really reminded me of ""Wolf of Wall street."" In that its about a horrible lifestyle thats successful for a while, until its not.

647,647,8.0,28 July 2023,"The first time I started watching Babylon, I gave up after an hour and a half. I felt that it was needlessly overblown and could only appeal to anyone who'd been a star in the 20's and was now crying in their whiskey over glories past.

By the grace of the movie Gods, I had the good fortune to sit down and fully watch it with a clear head. What a brilliant, brilliant film this was.

Chizelle is essentially offering commentary not only on the nature of Hollywood itself, but on peaking and falling into obscurity/irrelevance and how we deal with it. Your character will determine whether you retire gracefully or whether you will disappear into a maelstrom of disgrace and humiliation.

It's divided into roughly three acts. The first, is excess and champagne vain glory. Whilst visually and technically dazzling, this is by far the emptiest part and the one most likely to turn a viewer away, thinking that this is some pretentious flop.

Stay the course though and you will be rewarded by incredible second and third acts, that truly reach for the heart of show business. Extra props for the virtuosic depiction of Hell in Los Angeles and the Kubrick-inspired final montage.

Don't get me wrong, the story was a good one but it was a familiar one. However, in the past 15 years or so there has been a dearth of original story telling and Babylon felt fresh and vibrant and most importantly it will stay with me for quite a while.

653,653,1.0,9 February 2023,"But for those who can enjoy this kind of movie it is a glorious insane ride.

If you plan to see with this your parents, or anyone with a self sense of decency that may be disgusted by animalistic behavior, don't, it will be too long for them and will probably not be able to see the point of the movie at all other than the excess and insanity going on, which is fantastically honest in my opinion, but some people don't like seeing ulgy truths.

Is the movie perfect? No, but is certainly one of the most enjoyable films of 2022 and it easily makes top 5 for me from that year, though it's obvious why it was not nominated for an Oscar. The film either critiques or promotes the hollywood insanity behind the scenes that existed since it was born and will continue to exist after we are all gone.

654,654,1.0,23 February 2023,"To be clear, the first minutes involve feces, urine, other bodily fluids and anatomy, and significant nudity and sexuality. I'm not saying any of this as a reflection on the quality of the picture (nor are these constants), but only to say that this isn't necessarily what I was expecting, and potential viewers should be aware of both this - and the fact that the ""opening sequence,"" prior to the appearance of the name of the movie on the screen, is one-sixth the total length. This is in addition to (or perhaps part and parcel of) the picture being a hair over three hours long, often frenetic pacing, and the fact that for whatever discrete narrative or character arcs may present, this is above all a bit of a free-form fictionalized portraiture of a time, a place, and a decadent dream of never-ending splendor and cinematic wonder. Therewith, there are also fragments of behind-the-scenes glimpses of movie-making, marketing, and the private lives of major film figures, dovetailing in with the press and public perception, and all woven into the approximate setting of the advent of talkies, and the nuances of how everything changed, for everyone. All this is to say that, figuratively and literally, 'Babylon' is a bit of a kaleidoscope and a cacophony, whipping together the Coen brothers' 'Hail, Caesar!,' Quentin Tarantino's 'Once upon a time... in Hollywood,' and Michel Hazanavicius' 'The artist,' but with significantly more bombast, even more self-indulgence, and raucous, almost vulgar flavors of sex, language, and comedy laid over top of sincere storytelling.

Does all this sound like A Lot? It is, especially as the vibe alternates irregularly between zesty and soft-spoken. There is, truly, meaningful and impactful story here, the telling of the rise and fall of various persons in Hollywood at this moment in time. Along with everything that the picture is and entails, some of the zip and bluster is overwhelming (the opening sequence is a prime example); some of the dramatic beats are extra ponderous (the sequence in which a character films their first sound scene is monstrously tense); sometimes the zip and bluster overwhelms what would be ponderous dramatic beats (note a character's response when a director asks them how they achieve the desired effect in a scene, and how nonchalantly the film moves on); sometimes the earnest drama peeks through the inane grandiosity (one figure's ascendancy, paired with others' decline, is almost a gut punch). With all this having been said, for everything here that goes so very right, filmmaker Damien Chazelle struggles to maintain a consistent tone in either his screenplay or his direction. There are so very many characters, and dialogue of such wildly opposed flavors, filling scenes that dance across so many ideas and story threads, in a narrative that spans several years. 'Babylon' is fabulously ambitious, with expansive breadth, yet the depths that it explores vary substantially from ""impressive"" to ""just right"" to ""insufficient""; some beats land like heavy blows, others don't quite cut it. Such oscillation is not helped by additional garnishes of content throughout: LGBTQ themes and homophobia, racism, sexism, classism, haughtiness, otherwise prejudice, drugs and alcohol, and still much more, all feeding into the comedy or the drama in turn.

This 188-minute feature is overfull, self-indulgent, overlong, and in some ways uneven and inconsistent. It is also, however, brilliant, and superbly well made in all regards. It's an enormous and stellar cast assembled here, and from the huge stars to the lesser known players, everyone gives outstanding performances of range and nuance. Just glancing at the credits is a journey: Margot Robbie, Samara Weaving, Diego Calva, Olivia Hamilton, Li Jun Li, Jovan Adepo, Ethan Suplee, Jean Smart, Brad Pitt, Jeff Garlin, Eric Roberts, Katherine Waterston, and so many more, all exceptional from one to the next. While Chazelle has difficulty attaining the exact perfect Feel for his feature, from a technical standpoint of orchestrating shot and scenes his direction is impeccable. While sometimes overzealous as it's employed, Tom Cross' editing is sharp and lively; Linus Sandgren's cinematography is crisp, vibrant, and exquisite. The production design, art direction, costume design, and hair and makeup work are exemplary, to say nothing of stunts, effects, and props - all a tremendous feast for the eyes across the board, and an immense credit to those behind the scenes. And as if all this weren't enough, the sound design is pristine - allowing Justin Hurwitz's rich, dynamic, grabbing, electrifying, phenomenal original score to ring through with utmost gratifying clarity. While the music in a movie can sometimes help to set it apart, and elevate scenes to new levels, sometimes it's extraordinary entirely on its own, and I think this is absolutely true for Hurwitz. Far be it from me to emphasize the point, but ""Voodoo mama"" is surely one of the best individual themes to appear in a movie in recent memory.

I understand why 'Babylon' crashed with audiences and met with mixed reception from critics. From the moment the first trailer dropped it seemed like it was effectively being marketed as the next Best Picture winner, and intended as such, with assumption that it would be. Sights unseen it seemed full of itself, and this is to say nothing of the considerably prohibitive three-hour runtime; I readily admit that while I was interested in the title in passing, as it was set to open in theaters I took one look at its length and knew I couldn't sit through it without being able to pause. Factor in the nature of some of the content and it's no wonder why the project didn't meet with the anticipated results. Having now watched for myself I can safely say that it unquestionably falls short to at least some measure (personal experience will vary), especially as the tone ranges so widely. Furthermore, the third hour in particular goes in directions that seem excessive - unnecessary, superfluous, and maybe even a tad detached from what the picture has otherwise been building - and for all the strength that the various threads possessed earlier, it feels as though they generally resolve with unequal results. And still, for whatever flaws and problems trouble the production at one point or another, by and large this is far more than not an excellent movie. At its worst it's too much, imbalanced, and unsteady; at its best, the self-confident musings that posited the upcoming release as worthy of awards was no mere jest; as one last incredible example, the ending is equal parts phenomenal and overdone. It's a bumpy ride and a long journey, but ultimately, I do firmly and heartily believe 'Babylon' is fine, engrossing, enjoyable, and strongly satisfying. Would perhaps that its faults weren't as evident as its advantages, but one can only take the sweet with the sour, and at (towering) length, this is a marvelously delicious viewing

656,656,1.0,3 August 2023,"Unlike what a lot of critics have said, it's not an escapade nor is it exhausting. It is a rebellious look at the revelries of the Silent-era in Hollywood. Countless stories run their course, unhurried, each with an end that stays with you and colours the dichromatic screens.

It is beautiful and haunting in equal measure. Pensive and celebratory too. It is an ode to the love for cinema and the fleeting boats, those that work on it, are on. An absolute classic that people will keep coming back to, to be ensnared by it's beauty, to praise the work of Damien, Brad, Margot, Calva and the team. It is a tribute to all the Conrads and Nellies that had their meteoric highs and deathly lows, but will always be remembered, dining at the table of apparitions for eternity.

In the decadent Hollywood that Chazelle presents to us, everything is a pretext for excess and debauchery. Welcome to ""Babylon"", the director's new madness, a monumental fresco on the beginnings of talkies. A three-hour odyssey, between demented Hollywood parties and chaotic shootings, ""Babylon"" is a cinematic experience as we rarely see. The production and photography are stunning, and combined with the impressive sets and costumes, offer dazzling visuals.

As for the scenario, it is chaotic but very gripping. In three hours, we go through all the emotions, from laughter to sadness, passing through emotion and euphoria. ""Babylon"" is a very immersive film. The acting performances are excellent, special mention to Diego Calva, revelation of the film, and to Margot Robbie. Finally, Justin Hurwitz's music is phenomenal. It's simple, since I saw the film I listen to it on repeat.

I also enjoyed the witty and sharp dialogue, the satire, the extreme, the musical score that blended jazz and modern influences, and the performances of the cast that were charismatic and nuanced. A lot of it maybe too extreme for general audiences. It contains a humor that is based on shock value. A lot of explicit scenes.

Yet the film also had a lot of depth and emotion behind its humor and spectacle. It explored themes such as ambition, fame, artistry, love, betrayal, racism and sexism that were relevant both then and now.

The story is incredibly well crafted. It is an epic tale following 3 characters who fortunes rise and fall through a transformative era in Hollywood. The setting is just perfect and allows for a great exploration of so many brilliant themes.

For a 3 hour film it feels incredibly well paced which is never an easy feat. The story never feels like it loses direction, partly because all of the characters are so interesting.

I can't go any further in this review without mentioning Margot Robbie. She is ridiculously magnetic in this film and is a true star in every way. Her physicality, the emotion she brings, the power and energy. It is a performance that I can't get over. Just magnificent. All of the performances are good, particularly Diego Calva, but Robbie is the star of the piece.

The direction from Damien Chazelle is class as you'd expect. He balances the drama, humour and emotion effortlessly and fills every frame with rich details. The love of cinema comes through in so many brilliant ways, it is just such a joy to watch.

But if you want to watch a movie about Hollywood with Margot Robbie and Brad Pitt, watch Once Upon A Time In Hollywood : The craziness is better directed and you actually get attached to the characters.

And if you want to watch a movie about the end of silent movies, watch The Artist : It is shorter yet more emotional and meaningful.

682,682,1.0,15 February 2023,"Let me start by saying I didn't expect much from this film due the to initial reception it recieved on release in the states so I ended up skipping the cinema and waiting for a home release and now I wish I didn't.

Firstly, hats off to Margot Robbie, her portrayel of Nellie LaRoy was nothing short of extraordinary. She brought to life a complex and deeply flawed character, making her both relatable and captivating. Despite Nellie's toxic behaviour, Margot's performance had me rooting for her until the very end, I highly recommend this film to anyone who appreciates great acting and storytelling.

Now onto the film itself. Babylon does and excellent job at highlighting the exploitative history of the film industry and the impact it can have on rising stars and behind the scenes workers. Slowly we see characters change into almost unrecognisable versions of themselves as they try to stay afloat in a pool full of sharks. It shines a light on the often hidden realities of the entertainment industry, though at times it is a little much but that's Hollywood I guess.

What sets Babylon apart is it's ability to do all of this whole still delivering a compelling and entertaining story. The characters are richly drawn and the performances are outstanding. The film manages to be both a powerful critique of the industry and a thrilling work of cinema in its own right.

TL:DR - Margot did an excellent job as usual, great film would recommend.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",let me start by saying i didnt expect much from this film due the to initial reception it recieved on release in the states so i ended up skipping the cinema and waiting for a home release and now i wish i didnt firstly hats off to margot robbie her portrayel of nellie laroy was nothing short of extraordinary she brought to life a complex and deeply flawed character making her both relatable and captivating despite nellies toxic behaviour margots performance had me rooting for her until the very end i highly recommend this film to anyone who appreciates great acting and storytelling now onto the film itself babylon does and excellent job at highlighting the exploitative history of the film industry and the impact it can have on rising stars and behind the scenes workers slowly we see characters change into almost unrecognisable versions of themselves as they try to stay afloat in a pool full of sharks it shines a light on the often hidden realities of the entertainment industry though at times it is a little much but thats hollywood i guess what sets babylon apart is its ability to do all of this whole still delivering a compelling and entertaining story the characters are richly drawn and the performances are outstanding the film manages to be both a powerful critique of the industry and a thrilling work of cinema in its own right tldr margot did an excellent job as usual great film would recommend,POSITIVE

701,701,8.0,1 November 2023,"Ah, ""Babylon,"" a film that captures the essence of a bygone era, yet speaks volumes about the human condition today. Directed by Damien Chazelle, this opus takes us on a journey through the labyrinthine world of 1920s Hollywood, a place where dreams are both made and shattered.

The film's protagonist, Manuel ""Manny"" Torres, is a Mexican immigrant who finds himself entangled in the web of Hollywood's allure and excess. His character arc, from a humble assistant to a director navigating the seismic shifts of the industry, is a microcosm of the American Dream, albeit one tinged with the darker hues of reality.

The ensemble cast, led by the effervescent Nellie LaRoy, is a tapestry of characters who embody the zeitgeist of their time. From the ambitious to the fallen, each character is a brushstroke in this intricate painting of Hollywood's Golden Age. The film doesn't shy away from the complexities of race, sexuality, and societal norms, making it a period piece that resonates with contemporary sensibilities.

The narrative is a rollercoaster of emotions, from the highs of stardom to the lows of personal and professional ruin. It's a story that could have easily been penned by F. Scott Fitzgerald, had he turned his gaze westward to the land of celluloid and sunshine.

The film's technical aspects are nothing short of a marvel. The set designs, the costumes, and the cinematography are a visual feast that transport the audience back in time. It's a love letter to the days when films were shot on film, not digital, and every frame was a work of art.

702,702,1.0,2 January 2023,"It's hard for me to decide what to say about Babylon. It's partly a movie about movie-making (like La La Land, or Singing in the Rain) but director Damien Chazelle ultimately seems more interested in exploring what all those movie people in the 1920's did behind the scenes, and showing it off in the most flamboyant way possible. I have no idea how realistic any of this is. Did they really hold this many parties that were this debauched? Scenes range from fascinating all the way to flat-out disgusting. I didn't need to see a fair bit of what he put on the screen. At a 3:10 run time, I found it way too long and was silently pleading for it to wind up -- Chazelle could have got his point across in an hour less. But I'm guessing that what's on the screen is just what he intended. Not to my taste, I guess.

But I'll have to compliment the actors. Margot Robbie absolutely burns up the screen as the ambitious uninhibited starlet Nellie LeRoy, showing that she's capable of more than the lightweight fare she's done before this. Brad Pitt is his usual smoothly uber-competent self as romantic/action lead Jack Conrad, who somehow can't transition from the silent-film era to the talkies. I didn't know Diego Calva before, but as the third parallel lead character Manny Torres he's almost equally good.

There are two or three really interesting long scenes that show movies in production -- first in the silent era, then at the very beginning of the picture-and-sound era, then later. These are fascinating. It really drives home the point that the introduction of sound completely revolutionized movie studios with the need for more staff, more technology, more resources, more careful control over everything. But the rest of it -- i.e. The stuff that Chazelle seems obsessed with -- left a bad taste for me.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",its hard for me to decide what to say about babylon its partly a movie about moviemaking like la la land or singing in the rain but director damien chazelle ultimately seems more interested in exploring what all those movie people in the s did behind the scenes and showing it off in the most flamboyant way possible i have no idea how realistic any of this is did they really hold this many parties that were this debauched scenes range from fascinating all the way to flatout disgusting i didnt need to see a fair bit of what he put on the screen at a run time i found it way too long and was silently pleading for it to wind up chazelle could have got his point across in an hour less but im guessing that whats on the screen is just what he intended not to my taste i guess but ill have to compliment the actors margot robbie absolutely burns up the screen as the ambitious uninhibited starlet nellie leroy showing that shes capable of more than the lightweight fare shes done before this brad pitt is his usual smoothly ubercompetent self as romanticaction lead jack conrad who somehow cant transition from the silentfilm era to the talkies i didnt know diego calva before but as the third parallel lead character manny torres hes almost equally good there are two or three really interesting long scenes that show movies in production first in the silent era then at the very beginning of the pictureandsound era then later these are fascinating it really drives home the point that the introduction of sound completely revolutionized movie studios with the need for more staff more technology more resources more careful control over everything but the rest of it ie the stuff that chazelle seems obsessed with left a bad taste for me,NEGATIVE

708,708,3.0,22 February 2023,"I just got done watching Babylon on Paramount+ and wanted to give my thoughts on it. Babylon is hands down, one of the craziest pictures I've probably seen in the last ten years. There is so much stuff that is happening throughout this film, that it's hard to look away from it. Brad Pitt is fantastic as always as Jack Conrad. Definitely one of the highlights of the film. Margot Robbie absolutely steals the show as Nellie LaRoy and shows just what kind of actress she can be. She also shows in this role just how far she is willing to take her character. The character the movie mostly follows throughout though, is Diego Calva as Manny Torres. He absolutely owns this character as a man trying to make it in show business and make something of himself. The chemistry with his and Margot's characters are some of my favorite scenes in this movie. This movie wouldn't be what it is without that chemistry. What I liked also about this film, is how they captured filming movies back then and showing us a different age of film making, which they do perfectly. I will say, this film will not be everyone's cup of tea as this film also shows a little more to sexual acts than most motion pictures has in the past as well as other elements in this film that are violent and disturbing. Overall, this is definitely in the top 10 of my favorite films of 2022 and I can't wait to relive this film once more.

715,715,9.0,1 March 2023,"Brilliant, absolutely ten star brilliance. Over-the-Top from beginning to end, this is a primal, perverse tribute to the way America embraces Hollywood-clutching her tight like a hopped-up lover but keeping just enough distance from her smells and fumes.

Who doesn't love the movies? And who doesn't carry their own capsule history of the gossip and glitz and dirt and splendor, along with the stars and inventions and careers and scandals? This is the movie that weaves all these threads into a full color tapestry depicting the rise and fall of Hollywood's iconic characters against the evolving background of our nation's true medium.

There's plenty for everyone here-wild orgies, love stories, tales of ambition, of artistic innovations, thrilling jazz, gangsters and corruption, moving idealism, and on and on. Some will complain there is too much, that viewers will become overwhelmed. But I submit it is time for a change of pace, from the bang-bang effects of meaningless ""action"" movies and the ""less is more"" aesthetic of many recent art-filmmakers to Writer/Director Damien Chazelle's bold immersionist vision. Those who claim ""Babylon"" has no plot or is ultimately incoherent should pay closer attention to what Jean Smart's character tells Brad Pitt's fading star.

716,716,1.0,22 February 2023,"From the explosive beginning to the godardian ending, this film is full of various events and characters that line up like a high-speed train. It is a very vivid picture composed of parts that are comic, sad, exciting, dark, loud, grotesque, satirical, scary, strange. A creative mess that is fun and wonderful to watch.

All the pieces needed for great film (screenplay, acting, cinematography, editing, art direction, production design, costume design, music & sound) are perfect. Even the elephant and the snake!

Some sequences are pure cinematic poetry (e.g. The sequence when Nellie disappears into the darkness). With this work, Damien Chazelle confirms himself as an uncompromising author in the world that does not respect authors and only cares about the numbers.

Considering that it is not a typical mainstream film, it will probably cause a division among the audience like all other films of this type.

717,717,1.0,20 February 2023,"Babylon, the latest film from the talented director Damian Chazelle, boasts an incredible cast featuring the likes of Margot Robbie and Brad Pitt, and the performances do not disappoint. The direction is also top-notch, with Chazelle's signature style elevating the film's aesthetic to new heights. However, the plot lacks the necessary depth to truly engage the audience.

Set in 1920s Hollywood, Babylon follows the story of a young actress named Nellie LaRoy (Robbie) who dreams of making it big in the film industry. She soon finds herself caught up in the glitz and glamour of the era, rubbing shoulders with the likes of movie star, Jack Conrad (Pitt) and aspiring studio worker, Manny Torres (Diego Calva) whom she forms a complicated relationship with. As their relationship develops, tensions begin to rise as they navigate the complex power dynamics of the industry.

The performances in Babylon are stellar, with Robbie and Pitt delivering standout performances that showcase their range as actors. The chemistry between Robbie and Calva is electric, and they elevate the material to a higher level. Additionally, Chazelle's direction is masterful, capturing the opulence of 1920s Hollywood with precision and care.

However, despite these strengths, the plot of Babylon feels shallow. The characters are engaging, but their arcs lack the necessary depth to truly engage the audience. The film also suffers from a lack of focus, with subplots that feel underdeveloped and detract from the central story. This results in a film that is more style over substance, and one that ultimately leaves the audience wanting more. I however truly love Chazelles style which is why i rate the movie as high as seen above (9/10).

In conclusion, Babylon is a well-made film that boasts incredible performances from its talented cast and top-notch direction from Chazelle. However, the lack of depth in the plot ultimately holds the film back, resulting in a movie that feels like it is missing something. While it is still worth watching for the impressive visuals and strong performances, it may not be the standout film that some viewers were hoping for.

'Babylon' goes all the way top - luxury, pleasure, lust, and ecstasy - and then brings down to the bottom to display how vain and ephemeral money and fame can be. (The Wolf of Wall Street). At the same time, it is dedication to Golden Age Hollywood. I could empathize with Manny's longing and yearning for cinema especially at the ending. The collage of Georges Méliès's 'A Trip to Moon' to today's CGI technique used in sci-fi movies sums up Chazelle's respect and passion for cinema. (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood).

Babylon is such a great metaphor that wraps up the core of Hollywood industry. Jack Conrad self-righteously believed that he built the industry and the glory of it all when he can be easily replaced as anybody else. The funny thing is that he said the movie 'means something down on the ground where people live - maybe not for you up in the ivory tower' to Broadway star wife. I thought at first it is a great paradox, but -come to think of it more - there is always another Babylon even for the people high up there floating: theater artists for Jack and investors or capitalists (whoever with the money) for Nellie.

723,723,8.0,14 February 2023,"If it was edited to 2.5 hours. Now it is just a pretty damn good movie with great character development, great music, an intriguing story and phenomenal acting.

I agree with the criticism of the runtime. The movie would have benefited from trimming away 30 minutes. Unfortunately, with the +3 hours I couldn't help looking at my watch a couple times longing for the end. That's not the feel of a cinematic masterpiece. Sorry.

What I do not agree with, is the criticism of the hedonism and debauchery. ""Is that really necessary?"" (Sobb) If you are so incredibly sensitive stick to watching Walt Disney. You won't get offended there. To me, the fast pacing and the craziness is one of the main attractions of the film.

What I don't get at all is the Oscar nominations. How on earth can they not nominate Margot Robbie for best actress in a leading role??!! It blows my mind. She is giving a stunning performance. I'm also puzzled, that Avatar and Top Gun qualifies for Best Picture, while this remarkable film does not. Maybe it is the hedonism in combination with the criticism of Hollywood chewing up talent and afterwards spitting people out. Must be political reasons of some kind.

724,724,4.0,20 January 2023,"This was legitimately the WORST movie I have ever seen. The storyline wasn't creative, there were scenes that left me literally confused as to what the point of them was, and there was one particular scene that repeated itself so many times that in the end just got frustrating.

Also, I'm now convinced Margo only knows how to act one way. You could have confused her role in this movie with her roles as Harlequin. Dead-set, same persona, same voice, same everything.

I do wonder if there was some true story elements to it though, for example, there's this concept that the actors were done, on their way out, and I was left wondering if that was in regards to the actual actor. Brad Pitt, for example, I have never seen in a movie so bad, except if he is now realising that he is on the way out and any movie will do if his name helps promote the film.

It was just... horrible.

725,725,8.0,12 April 2023,"I for one loved this movie. It's outrageous, and crass, and a bit indulgent by the end...but I still really, really liked ""Babylon"" and it kept my attention. (OK, it also helps that I'm a big Margot Robbie fan!)

Did it need the full 3 hour and 9 minute runtime? Not strictly. ""Babylon"" tackles a lot at once, but it's mostly coherent. It does go off the rails a bit after Tobey Maguire's drug lord character shows up (no further spoilers), and some intense stuff occurs in ""the underground"" of Los Angeles...that whole sequence/tangent was off-putting for me, to say the least. But in terms of the film overall, I loved everything from the characters to the plot lines. Margot Robbie shines, and Diego Calva, a relative newcomer, is just as mesmerizing playing opposite her. His character Manny is a film PA who dreams of making it big one day, and more.

The music is a standout as well - and though they weren't favored, Babylon actually did win during awards season for their soundtrack and costuming.

728,728,8.0,1 September 2024,"What a ride! I don't have time to research writers, directors, or whatever. If you know film history, you'll love it or at least appreciate it. If you don't, you may not understand and may even hate it. The movie is a culmination of film and Hollywood history. It shows the excess and depravity of Hollywood and how it devours the actors and actresses, while showing the impact of movies to audiences.

The film is perfect as it is, because it creates the rise and fall experienced in an exciting movie, as well as the disjointed and uncomfortable feeling we have about the reality of the people and situations involved.

Many techniques, symbolisms, and themes that were popular at different time periods in film were used. They even go as far as to have the scenes look the same quality as it used to in the 50s or 60s at the start of the film. One of my favorite incorporations into films or books is color symbolisms, which was used. For example, red was used for passion, danger, and extreme. Sound, lighting, contrast, and different environments were thrown in there. We got the beautiful sunsets and dark gloomy shady streets. It's as if someone read the required film history book and said, hmmm...how can I use all of it?

If I could explain it in one sentence; it's a nod to everything film, while simultaneously shunning Hollywood or what encompasses it. The 20s, were perfect because it was a colorful time. The roaring twenties with the nice costumes seem so glam, but it was also the time of mobsters, the great depression, and wars.

Also, many actors and singers who had difficulty in the U. S. went to Europe, so showing trends was added. In other words, the film was a modgepodge of everything that has happened to several movie stars during the transition from silent films to talkies and also from the changes in time, culture, and age. However, instead of having it occur in several characters, they focused it in about 4. And even though some history spanned over several decades, the movie retold or used the techniques anyway in the main 2 decades it showcased. Which emphasize the importance of film in general.

Ultimately, the main character is film, the supporting characters are the actors who are technically faceless because they represent multiple people in show business past and present. No, it's not my favorite movie. I appreciate what it did, and I understand it. I also understand most people don't know film history and why certain scenes were critical. That's why I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who wasn't into film history. It's an artistic film with a deeper meaning like Mother, I'm Thinking of Ending it All, or Donnie Darko.

It's an emotional ride, with hard drops, and almost every major cinematic experience or tool possibly created. Things that even Hitchcock was known for. It's a nod to the great films that made monumental changes in filmmaking, while exposing the darkness of the process or people associated, such as addiction, deaths on set, rapid turnover, obsessions, crime, bias, stereotypes, perception vs reality, and facades or flaws hidden by parties and fake smiles. We get to enjoy these pictures, decades after the people in it have died, but the damage that took place is unknown, as we sit, sleep, or Netflix and chill our way through it.

Overall, the movie did what it was supposed to in an artistic way. I doubt anyone could've put everything in one movie to show their love of it, while simultaneously creating the different emotions, ups, downs, sideways, and pretentiousness involved with the people. Kudos times 10 for such a complex, nuanced, multilayered story.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",what a ride i dont have time to research writers directors or whatever if you know film history youll love it or at least appreciate it if you dont you may not understand and may even hate it the movie is a culmination of film and hollywood history it shows the excess and depravity of hollywood and how it devours the actors and actresses while showing the impact of movies to audiences the film is perfect as it is because it creates the rise and fall experienced in an exciting movie as well as the disjointed and uncomfortable feeling we have about the reality of the people and situations involved many techniques symbolisms and themes that were popular at different time periods in film were used they even go as far as to have the scenes look the same quality as it used to in the s or s at the start of the film one of my favorite incorporations into films or books is color symbolisms which was used for example red was used for passion danger and extreme sound lighting contrast and different environments were thrown in there we got the beautiful sunsets and dark gloomy shady streets its as if someone read the required film history book and said hmmmhow can i use all of it if i could explain it in one sentence its a nod to everything film while simultaneously shunning hollywood or what encompasses it the s were perfect because it was a colorful time the roaring twenties with the nice costumes seem so glam but it was also the time of mobsters the great depression and wars also many actors and singers who had difficulty in the u s went to europe so showing trends was added in other words the film was a modgepodge of everything that has happened to several movie stars during the transition from silent films to talkies and also from the changes in time culture and age however instead of having it occur in several characters they focused it in about and even though some history spanned over several decades the movie retold or used the techniques anyway in the main decades it showcased which emphasize the importance of film in general ultimately the main character is film the supporting characters are the actors who are technically faceless because they represent multiple people in show business past and present no its not my favorite movie i appreciate what it did and i understand it i also understand most people dont know film history and why certain scenes were critical thats why i wouldnt recommend it to anyone who wasnt into film history its an artistic film with a deeper meaning like mother im thinking of ending it all or donnie darko its an emotional ride with hard drops and almost every major cinematic experience or tool possibly created things that even hitchcock was known for its a nod to the great films that made monumental changes in filmmaking while exposing the darkness of the process or people associated such as addiction deaths on set rapid turnover obsessions crime bias stereotypes perception vs reality and facades or flaws hidden by parties and fake smiles we get to enjoy these pictures decades after the people in it have died but the damage that took place is unknown as we sit sleep or netflix and chill our way through it overall the movie did what it was supposed to in an artistic way i doubt anyone couldve put everything in one movie to show their love of it while simultaneously creating the different emotions ups downs sideways and pretentiousness involved with the people kudos times for such a complex nuanced multilayered story,POSITIVE

Babylon is a bad epic period comedy drama film that is about the silent films era as it goes into talkie films and rise and fall of the producers and stars fame.

The plot is good showing the filmmakers and producers and stars rise to the top and fall. It has a few characters narrative following Brad Pitts, Margot Robbie, and Diego Calva.

All three were great with there performances. The film suffers from everything else. Such as poor pacing. It has a three hour long run time. It drags and it gets boring and loses it pacing.

The film is like Wolf of Wall Street raw with its sex, nudity, and drugs. As celebrites have hardcore parties and orgies. The direction tries to cross many boundaries. The direction falls uneven with its story structure and trying to balance the pacing.

In the main cast we can see Brad Pitt as Jack Conrad, a very famous and success Hollywood actor, but with the time his movies are not important anymore, showing the anomie that a person can suffer if the only institution with sense in his live doesn't consider him important, showing how the public have a strong power ""stop following"", promising eternity only in the memories. On the other hand, there is Nallie Laroy played by Margot Robbie, a new talented actress who shows many people fate, whit a innate talent but little prepared for became as a new bourgeoisie where the aristocracy circle is very shut, her frenetic behaviors exhibit what a voracious institution can make in a person who tries to be different. To end, we can see Diego Calva as Manny Torres, a Mexican who wants to stay in the production of movies and Sidny Palmer played by Jovan Adepo, a musician who suffers from racism.

As we can see the cast is awesome, but this is not the only important thing. Babylon makes a very strong social critic with concepts as status, racism, love, anomie and much more; you can see the structure not only cinematography industry but also any institution, that's why the social and critical eye is important to understand the film, if you don't have the open mind the movie could be boring and meaningless for you.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",babylon is an astonishing film but unfortunately underrated this film directed by damien chazelle tells the story of the cinematography industry in for some people babylon shows the excess of this industrie is for that because some can think babylon as a disorganized film however this is precisely what makes this film more thoughtprovoking than others putting in the spotlight the frenetic disorder from s hollywood movies but with the modern film structure following four main characters very different between them but with one thing in common hollywood in the main cast we can see brad pitt as jack conrad a very famous and success hollywood actor but with the time his movies are not important anymore showing the anomie that a person can suffer if the only institution with sense in his live doesnt consider him important showing how the public have a strong power stop following promising eternity only in the memories on the other hand there is nallie laroy played by margot robbie a new talented actress who shows many people fate whit a innate talent but little prepared for became as a new bourgeoisie where the aristocracy circle is very shut her frenetic behaviors exhibit what a voracious institution can make in a person who tries to be different to end we can see diego calva as manny torres a mexican who wants to stay in the production of movies and sidny palmer played by jovan adepo a musician who suffers from racism as we can see the cast is awesome but this is not the only important thing babylon makes a very strong social critic with concepts as status racism love anomie and much more you can see the structure not only cinematography industry but also any institution thats why the social and critical eye is important to understand the film if you dont have the open mind the movie could be boring and meaningless for you,POSITIVE

747,747,8.0,4 March 2023,"First I would like to say the movie Babylon is one of the best I've seen in a very very long time. It's one you have to see and what's more one that explores so much more than what's on the surface. The whole plastic world of Hollywood and the losing battle we call fame. In the movie Jean smarts speech at the two hour five min mark is EXACTLY what I've been TRYING to explain forever..To get the chance to live forever with angels and ghosts.. it was BRILLIANT.. she was superb. The speech was magical and onenof the most true things I've ever heard verbalized regarding anyone who has ever stepped on a stage or picked up a pen, sung a song.. put a piece of themself out there with the hope of being liked, and the secret desire to be immortal..

Toby McGuire it seems, has learned a little about THAT, and was given a second chance in THIS very movie.. and if you're a person who has ever stepped one foot over the line of sanity and safety and found yourself surrounded with terrifying people in a sketchy situation only to live to tell the tale.. you yourself a little addicted to the adrenaline and sickness that comes with the dark, you will understand his character. Kudos to the director because he really went for it. The scenes were some of the most disturbing I've seen.. maybe ever or at least since 1934's banned FREAKS, but at the same time couldn't stop watching, because like so many of you, I too kept one foot over the line of sanity for decades. It makes you appreciate the mundane so much more when you flirt occasionally with the insane. You just can't live there, and I suggest you have a great partner to pull you back from that edge else you tumble over.

Brad Pitt finally gets it, he finally understands the game, and there is something so sad when you know he realizes that he did 82 pictures and he thought they mattered, only to find out they all meant nothing but more money for people who would never understand anything but the endless cycle of replacing the old with newer exact models, shinier faces and regurgitated stories. Then there is Margot Robbie. She is a revelation. She became the broken Frances farmer character who had the chops but never got a break because she refused to play their game. You could feel her heat and her pride and her pain with every frame she was in. God knows she had a long list of role models to choose from.. from Paulette Goddard, Ms. Farmer, to the Bombshell Jayne Mansfield who lost her head for Hollywood... A masterpiece of a movie.. and I don't give that praise lightly or often. Left me thinking about it long after it had finished.. for many reasons.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",first i would like to say the movie babylon is one of the best ive seen in a very very long time its one you have to see and whats more one that explores so much more than whats on the surface the whole plastic world of hollywood and the losing battle we call fame in the movie jean smarts speech at the two hour five min mark is exactly what ive been trying to explain foreverto get the chance to live forever with angels and ghosts it was brilliant she was superb the speech was magical and onenof the most true things ive ever heard verbalized regarding anyone who has ever stepped on a stage or picked up a pen sung a song put a piece of themself out there with the hope of being liked and the secret desire to be immortal toby mcguire it seems has learned a little about that and was given a second chance in this very movie and if youre a person who has ever stepped one foot over the line of sanity and safety and found yourself surrounded with terrifying people in a sketchy situation only to live to tell the tale you yourself a little addicted to the adrenaline and sickness that comes with the dark you will understand his character kudos to the director because he really went for it the scenes were some of the most disturbing ive seen maybe ever or at least since s banned freaks but at the same time couldnt stop watching because like so many of you i too kept one foot over the line of sanity for decades it makes you appreciate the mundane so much more when you flirt occasionally with the insane you just cant live there and i suggest you have a great partner to pull you back from that edge else you tumble over brad pitt finally gets it he finally understands the game and there is something so sad when you know he realizes that he did pictures and he thought they mattered only to find out they all meant nothing but more money for people who would never understand anything but the endless cycle of replacing the old with newer exact models shinier faces and regurgitated stories then there is margot robbie she is a revelation she became the broken frances farmer character who had the chops but never got a break because she refused to play their game you could feel her heat and her pride and her pain with every frame she was in god knows she had a long list of role models to choose from from paulette goddard ms farmer to the bombshell jayne mansfield who lost her head for hollywood a masterpiece of a movie and i dont give that praise lightly or often left me thinking about it long after it had finished for many reasons,POSITIVE

749,749,1.0,5 March 2023,"Babylon, Chazelle's newest is very similar to La La Land in that it transports the viewers to an era long forgotten and the film essentially delivers a retrospection of that era too.

This movie takes the viewers back by a century - to the era of silent movies, blossoming Hollywood and the start of the sound movie era. The characters are amazingly written and the story with its pacing, music and cast takes you through the lives of actors beyond the screen. The acts and pacing are very drama like and most of the time, this is very enjoyable. The movie also maintains a subtle humor throughout and shows what entertainment of the elite in that era meant - a little too bitterly.

With all this being said, the movie has its fair set of short comings too.

Makeup, clothes, hair? Seriously? This was a very distinct and well documented era. So much effort and expense was put into the scenes of the wild parties and the chaos of early film sets, but no one took the time to make sure the clothing, makeup, and hairstyles were somewhat accurate.

I love period pieces when they are done well and I am especially drawn to the 1920s. I watched this movie in spite of the many negative reviews, because I thought it was going to really capture 1920s Hollywood. Great cast and so much talent, but it clearly was a wasted opportunity.

As a result, Babylon has become a story of those who faced challenges during this period of change. As a fan of Damien Chazelle's La La Land, I had high expectations for his latest film, Babylon.

About Influence, Role-Models, and Art Reflecting Lifes Broad Range of People and Their Guiding Lights as Personified by Celebrity, Religion, and the Human Condition.

757,757,1.0,12 February 2023,"All the raving positive, as well as the scorching negative reviews, are in some way right: this movie has it all. It's totally over the top and excessive, but at times there are some very poignant and intimate moments; there's sex and debauchery galore, but there's also the endearing and unceasing love of Manny for Nellie; there's almost slapstick fun (the first hour) but there are also many deep and sensitive scenes. In the end all the impressive and the banal are more or less weighed out, and when I came out of the theater I felt like I had underwent some sort of larger than life experience.

Yes, it's definitely way too long, with an hour less they still could have made their points, and some scenes (like the descent into an orgiastic inferno with Tobey Maguire as guide) are almost mini-movies in itself, but don't really add to the main story. The photography however is wonderful, and the acting by all major characters is brilliant, with Margot Robbie as dazzling, indefatigable central character. Brad Pitt is equally impressive, and Diego Calva was (at least for me) a real surprise.

The message, as I have felt it, is that the movies as a form of art, in spite of all the hoo-ha around it, is totally volatile, all persons involved coming up and unavoidably going down again; but at the same time movies make history and create immortality. In that regard the monologue that gossip-writer Elinor (Jean Smart) holds to Brad Pitt's character is spot-on and in my opinion the crux of this film.

Well, she is the She-King, clad in the royal purple... we know where this image ultimately comes from: the Book of Revelation of St John. Yes, Nelly LeRoy is that Harlot of Babylon.

767,767,9.0,22 February 2023,"Get ready to be whisked away to a time when flappers reigned supreme and gin was the drink of choice with 'Babylon'. This movie has it all - drama, romance, and of course, Brad Pitt!

Damien Chazelle's latest masterpiece is a roaring good time that will have you laughing, crying, and wondering why on earth you weren't born in the 1920s.

'Babylon' tells the story of two star-crossed lovers, a young actress named Clara and a struggling screenwriter named John. Together, they navigate the cutthroat world of Hollywood, where everyone is trying to make a name for themselves and get ahead.

Not only does 'Babylon' capture the glitz and glam of old Hollywood, it also exposes the seedy underbelly of the industry - and boy, is it juicy. With enough drama, scandal, and backstabbing to make a Real Housewife blush, this movie is like a deliciously scandalous soap opera with better costumes and a killer soundtrack.

Speaking of the soundtrack, let's just say that if you're not tapping your feet and humming along to the jazzy tunes by the end of the movie, we need to have a serious talk. Chazelle and composer Justin Hurwitz have crafted a soundtrack that's equal parts catchy and classy, perfectly capturing the spirit of the era.

But what really sets 'Babylon' apart is its attention to detail. From the painstakingly recreated sets to the period-appropriate slang (trust us, you'll be saying 'bee's knees' for days after seeing this movie), every aspect of this film oozes authenticity. And with a cast that includes heavy hitters like Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie, the performances are top-notch.

In short, 'Babylon' is a deliciously fun romp through old Hollywood that also manages to be smart and thought-provoking. It's like The Great Gatsby meets 'The Artist, but with more drama and fewer problematic characters (looking at you, Tom Buchanan). So grab a gin and tonic, slip on your flapper dress, and get ready to be transported to a world of glitz, glamour, and scandal!""","December 23, 2022 (United States)",get ready to be whisked away to a time when flappers reigned supreme and gin was the drink of choice with babylon this movie has it all drama romance and of course brad pitt damien chazelles latest masterpiece is a roaring good time that will have you laughing crying and wondering why on earth you werent born in the s babylon tells the story of two starcrossed lovers a young actress named clara and a struggling screenwriter named john together they navigate the cutthroat world of hollywood where everyone is trying to make a name for themselves and get ahead not only does babylon capture the glitz and glam of old hollywood it also exposes the seedy underbelly of the industry and boy is it juicy with enough drama scandal and backstabbing to make a real housewife blush this movie is like a deliciously scandalous soap opera with better costumes and a killer soundtrack speaking of the soundtrack lets just say that if youre not tapping your feet and humming along to the jazzy tunes by the end of the movie we need to have a serious talk chazelle and composer justin hurwitz have crafted a soundtrack thats equal parts catchy and classy perfectly capturing the spirit of the era but what really sets babylon apart is its attention to detail from the painstakingly recreated sets to the periodappropriate slang trust us youll be saying bees knees for days after seeing this movie every aspect of this film oozes authenticity and with a cast that includes heavy hitters like brad pitt and margot robbie the performances are topnotch in short babylon is a deliciously fun romp through old hollywood that also manages to be smart and thoughtprovoking its like the great gatsby meets the artist but with more drama and fewer problematic characters looking at you tom buchanan so grab a gin and tonic slip on your flapper dress and get ready to be transported to a world of glitz glamour and scandal,POSITIVE

775,775,1.0,10 February 2023,"""BABYLON""; an outrageously provocative, grandiose, transcendental melodic spectacle of eclectic eccentricity (enthusiastically coming out swinging from the very first round, refusing to withhold a single one of its meticulously placed, passionately delivered punches), symphonically adorned with devastatingly sharp wit & a dry sense of tongue-in-cheek humour, masterfully capturing the bitter-sweet dichotomy of a filmmaker's loving artistry; marvelling at the nigh impossibility of chaotic & spontaneous creation, yet warring against humanities' unavoidable futility, whose fleetingness prevents them from truly understanding the discernible, long-term impact of their work's existence.

This beautifully visualises director & writer Damien Chazelle's inner turmoil & conflict of interest when nurturing a project's development, acting to celebrate the selflessness of a visionary's personal contributions (giving their literal life & soul to a production) as their ideas come in to fruition by providing a reconciliatory acknowledgement that in reality, ""it's so much bigger"" than them - whilst additionally reflecting his own individualistic, selfish desire to understand the meaning of their exhausting collective investments (borne from basic, flawed, primitive human instincts - undeniably carnal in nature, incapable of repression & stereotypically unoriginal - to ""rage against the dying of the light""), whilst he currently remains conscious.

Therefore, with striking sincerity & phenomenal direction, being the courageously talented mind that he evidently is at the helm of such a profoundly vast production (leading with clear intent throughout), the movie's focused enough to navigate its way through the goliath narrative & able to authentically convey the industry in which he operates (depicting the two incomparably illogical co-existing contradictions of beauty & ugliness), maturely analysing the relationship between Hollywood's unhealthy addictiveness (& reliance on corporate profit to sustain its longevity) & the gradual toll that's exacted upon the terminally addicted (who, in truth - are driven by a spiritedness none of us can ever comprehend, but only imagine - & unconcerned by the trivialities of money-making that's of little consequence as the years pass by), examining this wholly unsustainably fractious dynamic under the lense of a microscope to ponder how these cogs of a well-oiled machine (which, in theory should never fit) piece together (maintained by tradition & unconventional reinvention of aforementioned traditions as time progresses) to ensure the ticking continues in their encroaching, guaranteed absence.

In equal parts, this is a love letter to cinema - in others, a resignation or suicide note (revelling in deriving glorious purpose from the resultant ambiguity); in the end, the answer to this mystery is of little significance when considering the possibility that regardless, any & either theoretical response will be remembered & culminate in the same eventuality; resurrection. Hence, he offers himself up at the altar of this silent cultural revolution (perhaps as a sacrificial lamb, towering above the insatiable masses - also dependent upon the unpredictable preservation of a symbiotic connection between a social influencer with the fanatical consumers of their obsessive fixations) in a moment of joy, martyrdom & ecstasy to plausibly burn himself out so the pyre stays aflame. The outcome uncertain, cast, crew, characters all take a gamble & accept that the risks are manifestly worth the high & crushing lows of an eventual downfall in a business that unrepentantly chews people up & then spits them back out again.

Audiences witness the audacious leap of faith or hypothetical plunge thereafter.

776,776,8.0,24 July 2023,"I just saw Babylon for the second time, and I still liked it more than most people (based on the IMDb ratings). In my opinion, it is highly enjoyable, and I caught myself smiling through entire scenes.

Does it have its ups and downs? Yes, definitely. Could the film have been even better by just editing some of the weaker segments down a little? Yes, I think so.

In my opinion, one of Babylon's strengths is that it leans fully into being entertaining, rather than worrying about being realistic. This is certainly more rare for period pieces, than for fantasy or sci-fi movies.

Beautiful sets, fantastic cast, smart quips and great dialogue. And, perhaps most importantly, a few larger-than-life characters, who are flawed enough to be likable, almost relatable.

I may not be Brad Pitt's biggest fan, since he has had a tendency to mix great work with some fairly weak roles. In Babylon, however, he puts in a great performance, his best since Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.

Babylon does it for me because it ticks more of my ""good"" boxes rather than ""bad"" so I'll give it to it for the effort that I cannot overlook and one also that no movie lover or anyone who truly knows a good movie can take away from the movie.

However, it was a little too much at most times. Some scenes were so unnecessary. For example, the scene with the snake fight. What was that for? It did not need to be there and could have saved space for other meaningful scenes that could have added more depth to the story, especially the characters. The Nellie LeRoy outburst scene at the industry party was overdramatized and too prolonged. It could have ended better. Entirely, the movie is too chaotic for me even though I recognize the Director's effort at trying to do something different. I appreciate that.

Some of my favourite scenes are the ones where Brad Pitt (Jack Conrad) talks with Anna May Wong in the hotel lobby and walks up afterwards to his room. That was pure perfection, coupled with that stellar music accompanying it. The second scene was where Elinor St. John tells him the hard truth.

781,781,5.0,4 March 2023,"This has been one of my best cinema experience in my life so far. The film is not perfect: it features excessive trash and sexual references, and is a bit long towards the end.

However, it was an amazingly vibrant energy that I've never seen in any other movie. This movie is unlike any other. It talks about the love for the cinematographic art, the emotions it gives us, the passion of the people who produce it as well as their excesses, debauchery and loneliness.

I believe the goal of the director was to make us feel all these emotions that cinema can give us, all in one movie. And boy, he delivered on that. You'll laugh, you'll be repulsed by some images and situations, you'll fear for the characters or feel for them. You'll see yourself watching the movie and reflect on what it makes you feel.

Lent the movie for 99 ct., without even watching a trailer, because I trusted Brad Pitt having at least enough self esteem, not to choose a script without a story, and not to participate in a very dumb production.

That was a mistake and the trust misplaced.

As always, the first scene already gives a lot of indications, how well produced and intelligent the whole production will be.

Well, it already starts quite absurd, but it lacks intelligence. Subtext. Wow, is that man fat! HA! HA! HA! So funny!

A huge elephant on a truck? HA! HA! HA! So funny!

Elephant sh.tting into a man's face? HA! HA! HA! So incredibly funny!

Or is it a statement of the director and the producers that PRIDE Hollywoke literally means being attracted to feces? I guess not...

I was a bit shocked that Pitt, reading the first pages of the script, wanted to participate, instead of throwing the script into the dustbin.

But some doubts remained: maybe that incredibly disgusting scene was not in the script he read?

It is known, that even A-list actors not always do know, what happens in the whole movie.

Especially when there are many and long scenes, that do not contribute to the story, it's very easy for the production, to put total gargabe into a movie, even turn the movie on it's head, with the final cut.

So I still had some doubts and hoped, when Pitt would appear, the story could improve.

But when he enters the movie, his scenes, his role and his dialogue are simply not good. There is no improvement.

It's an incredibly vulgar, primitive and dumb movie.

Not a single funny scene.

Not a single intelligent dialogue. Well that's not totally true: in the three hours there is one single good dialogue, towards the end, when Pitt confronts the film critic. I would even say, that scene is really good and it feels, like an intelligent adult had written, and a different director filmed it...

Nothing makes any sense storywise.

A director trying to mock historic Hollwood productions as cheap and dumb? Fine!

789,789,4.0,26 January 2023,"I lived in Los Angeles at the time the movie La La Land was set, and I felt that film really captured the feel of the place then. Also, it was a nice story, a touching romance and good jazz. So, I was keen to see Damien Chazelle's next writing/ directing effort, Babylon. The name reminded me of a much-thumbed book in the 60's, ""Hollywood Babylon"", with Jane Mansfield on the cover, which detailed some of the wild goings on of the early Hollywood set and was banned for a time.

The movie Babylon has more in common with the book than La La Land. And it's too much and too long. An awful lot of effort has gone into this, from the first orgy scene, with people everywhere trying everything, sweeping shots, and as a spectacle it is impressive. Or the panorama of the chaotic mammoth diorama that was the shooting of silent movies - (maybe somewhat stylised - as I imagine much of the film may be?) but it's spectacular and I guess that's how they were shot. The trouble was so much was going on it was hard to get too involved in the characters - or even the plot. They were small beer to the chaos, debauchery and ""set pieces"". More Baz than Antonioni.

The actors tried. Brad Pitt was great as usual; Margot Robbie earned her keep. She is good. The drug ridden character she portrayed would not have been easy. A side story of the black trumpeter Sidney Palmer (Jovan Adepo) was interesting but felt tacked on. Good music though.

The struggle to adapt to the intrusion of sound was well done, -irritating repeats -but that's progress. Like popular music - moving from LSD and groupies - to the LA Philharmonic up the back.

BABYLON is another Chazelle ode to Hollywood; this time the story takes place in the Golden years. The problem is, the film tries to show some of the seamier sides of early Hollywood which Chazelle wasn't around for. So what you have is a meandering script that jumps around and isn't interesting to begin with. There is no sympathy for the characters because they are pretty much unsympathetic to begin with.

804,804,1.0,7 March 2023,"One of 2 films of 2022 about what film means to us and the people who make them. This film is set during the transitional period between silent films and ""talkies"". It follows several different characters as they make their way through the changing industry.

Unfortunately, this flick from Damian Chazelle (Whiplash, La La Land) is far from the feel-good charm of The Fablemans (2022) and it's flamboyant cinematography falls short of films like Elvis (2022). In fact, it'll take you just 1 minute to know that this film is a bloated, pretentious mess.

The beginning setup is the worst offender. Why is the first shot an elephant's crack, and why is it defecating on those poor truckers? That's followed up with an extended scene of mass fornication, substance abuse and spray-painted genitalia... To put is as cleanly as possible.

In The Fablemans, this would be the point of the film where we're introduced to the audience viewpoint experiencing film for the first time, discovering his want and meeting the conflict the comes with it. Here, all we get are Robbie and Diego Calva (Narcos: Mexico) snorting cocaine and talking to each other (and the audience) about how movies are so great. Then, it's right back to orgy mansion.

Chazelle is clearly trying to convey a sense of debauchery, but the way it's executed makes is seem like it was an exciting, fun time. In truth, it's pretty gross. It's so jam-packed with vulgarity that you don't feel good watching it, even during the times when it's supposed to be sexy. Margot Robbie's dance number is enjoyable, but I could think of 30 better ways to show the setting and tone of this film than a prostitute pissing in a fat guy's mouth.

After the horrible 15-minute (!) opening, things do pick up a bit with a frenzied multi-layered sequence. The first featuring Robbie on a silent film set, her fake tears crying Phoebe Tonkin (H2O, Tomorrow) out of her job. The other featuring TV actor Robert Morgan (Hacksaw Ridge) as a director desperately trying to complete his war film before losing the light, while Brad Pitt is writing it!

The shenanigans that ensue are quite entertaining. Crew members being chased by legions of extras, actors impaled by flags and total neglect and damage to personal property. Although the self-aware nods to classic films and stars of the era are annoying. The highlight is an absolutely manic episode in which Robbie's character plays her first speaking role and just quite can get it right, resulting in chaos from the crew. Helped by the great performances, especially from P. J. Byrne (Cobra Kai, The Legend of Korra), it's easily the best part of the film.

After that however, things get boring. The protagonist is still unclear and the rest of the characters are so unsympathetic that it isn't engaging enough to stick with it for another hour. The worst thing is how fabricated it all is. It's dependent on deriving various scenes from similar films that are much better than itself. We're even treated to a scene where Toby Maguire (Spider-Man) basically plagiarizes Boogie Nights (1997). But not before Robbie gets bitten by a snake and has her bite wound sucked on! It's all leading up to a movie time warp ending so self-indulgent, it makes NONE of what you saw feel earned.

It's a shame because the film has so much potential. The music and design are top notch and it's super well acted. Robbie, Calva and Pitt are great and Olivia Wilde, Jovan Adepo (Fences) and bassist Flea (Back to the Future 2) all kill it in the one scene they each have.

Instead we got a movie that was farcically vulgar just for the sake of being vulgar. While I wasn't there, I find it hard to believe that anything portrayed in this movie actually happened in the 20s. How in the world did they get actual stars with an actual career in this movie?

I didn't laugh a single time. I felt really nothing except occasional disgust. Was there a point to this movie? For a pointless movie with nothing worthwhile to say, it sure was long.

806,806,4.0,21 July 2023,"I didn't care for any of the characters. What's more, the story is boring. I wouldn't even say it was beautifully shot or that scenes were entertaining.

Margot Robbie is lovely but not quite the ingenue anymore. In fact, her portrayal reminded me of Harley Quinn complete with a crazed look in her eyes set off by uncontrolled, frizzy hair.

As Nellie, Margot Robbie isn't the right fit as the fresh face from Louisiana come to Hollywood because she knows she's a star. She would've been better as Brad Pitt's wife, Ina Conrad.

Now Brad Pitt was well cast and believable as a drunken, fading star.

Oh and somehow Nellie ends up with an East Coast accent in the film?

Set in 1926 Hollywood but with mannerisms and some costumes (Nellie's red party dress) from modern times. Maybe that was the intent to mix these worlds & I couldn't get into it.

At least the fictionalized movie of Marilyn Monroe, Blonde, provided reference to her life experiences. There was a flow to the story I could follow. Plus the costumes, makeup & cinematography were truly beautiful.

Yet many people thought Blonde was too unpleasant to watch. I agree, it was not easy.

Babylon is harder to watch. Chaotic, unappealing, hard to get through, boring.

My sense is everybody came to set for the long, drawn out opening and were directed to let go, take off your clothes, have sex, get out the inflatable penis ... you are having the time of your life.

And if the movie Ghosted rated low, I can't believe this rated higher.

815,815,5.0,28 December 2022,"While films such as Wolf of Wall Street romanticize a lifestyle of excess or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood glorifying Hollywood and making it seem like a dream, Babylon does neither.

To me what writer and director Damian Chazelle was doing here is more taking the excessive lifestyle of early Hollywood and depicting the highs and lows with no filter.

I'm going to take a very ""monotoned"" approach (ha see what I did there... if you see the film you'll get the reference) to this review as this film for me was a very mixed bag...

I'll start with the acting, there is some fantastic performances in this film and obviously Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie were great but who truly stood out to me was Diego Calva as Manny Torres. His character and his story is what garnered the most interest for me in this excessive three hour film.

This films score is amazing, the soundtrack is phenomenal. It's so filled with life it just damn near made me wanna stand up in my theater seat and dance like a depraved maniac! I kid of course, just want to make the point of how much I enjoyed the music.

But like the themes in this film it is just excessive, trying and doing soo much to an end that I already know. The runtime also does not help this film in anyway, while it was not the hardest three hours I sat through it was not the most enjoyable. Admittedly I did look at my phone every once and a while to check the time I must say I was never bored and that is most likely due to the genuine interest I have of the time period, acting performances, and music that I enjoyed so much.

As the credits rolled and I sat in the emptied auditorium I can say I understand, I understand why people can love this film and I can understand why people would not. For me however I neither hated or loved this film, I felt more of a neutral viewer as I watched the decadence of Hollywood unfurl before me.

Maybe I'm missing something, maybe there's something deeper here, or maybe there isn't but whatever it is I can firmly say it's not for me.

827,827,3.0,30 December 2022,"This film is gross and odd and vulgar from the start. There is an initial party sequence which felt to me like I was watching a depiction of the Garden of Earthly Delights painting. It didn't feel like a genuine depiction of a rich Hollywood 1920s party. More like a rich 1960s-present day party. I didn't get a lot of humor from it or poignance. It was a clue for much of what was to come within the movie.

Maybe I'm just an idiot, but the style just felt odd to me. I didn't find it funny. It sometimes felt dramatic. But it didn't seem like we were ever meant to take a dramatic scene as too dramatic or the comedic moments especially didn't seem like they were meant to be too comedic. So it mostly felt uncomfortable and unrealistic in spite of certain issues being real and important deep issues for society.

Maybe if more of it the events depicting actual actors or films, I would have supported the style of the filming and storytelling. But most of the movies and characters were made-up. Yet they still seemed uninterestingly like characters seen in a million other movies about artists trying to make it in an indifferent capitalistic world.

I did like some of the commentary at the end of the film when three timeline made it to the early 50s after skipping about 20 years. But it wasn't enough to salvage the movie. And it didn't seem as clever as they might have been hoping for it to seem.

There was so much going on that it was hard to grasp a message or a clear point to what we were being presented-with.

The busy style made it hard for me to take the overall story too seriously. But it also had all 3 main characters dealing with dramatic narratives and obstacles. Plus a couple smaller side characters also dealing with dramatic obstacles.

I didn't feel that they adequately showed one of the main characters attain his success. He was just suddenly a success. I didn't see much humor or cleverness to the way these different characters existed. Their storylines didn't really come together enough to make it feel like an audience benefited by all of them being explored the way they were presented in this film. Margo Robbie and Diego Calva were good companion characters through the majority of the film. Brad Pitt and especially the two or three smaller side characters didn't seem very meaningful to most the overall story. I enjoyed Toby McGwire's cameo part. But it wasn't going to save the movie.

I think I overall just wanted to feel like I knew what they were doing so I could maybe enjoy and appreciate their intent and execution if it was good.

829,829,3.0,7 March 2023,"From the same mind that brought us Whiplash and La la land, comes this mess of a film, that seems to be drawing elements from Tarantino's style mixed with some high pace Wolf of Wall Street vibes and ends up being a self indulging, chaotic and nonsensical piece of work.

A movie that is suppose to make a satire of the excesses made in the 20s in the American movie industry aka Hollywood, it portrays the story of a wannabe actress and an established actor as they navigate through the insanity that is this movie.

A bunch of over the top and exaggerated characters, in ridiculous and completely insane situations in a movie that extends its stay for 3 hours, I feel it's an accurate description of it.

I laughed zero times during the film, I assume that there are a lot of references and hints to famous folks and events during that era but most of them (if they indeed are present) went right through my head, an all star cast completely wasted with a lot of them having less than 2 minutes of screen time, and even Margot and Brad weren't enough to make this a decent experience.

The insanity just grows more intense and by the end of the movie it feels like the director decided to give up and just made whatever random thing that popped into his head and put it in the film. This macabre, unnecessary gruesome cave scene that I am still trying to understand what was the purpose of it.

If this was suppose to criticize the excess, the violence and the oversexualization going around all those years back, they did an awful job as the movie is guilty of the exact same thing its suppose to be criticizing. A waste of time and talent, I have no clue what was the point of this mess - it feels like it was made by a teenager with a bunch of fetiches that he would like to see on a big screen.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",from the same mind that brought us whiplash and la la land comes this mess of a film that seems to be drawing elements from tarantinos style mixed with some high pace wolf of wall street vibes and ends up being a self indulging chaotic and nonsensical piece of work a movie that is suppose to make a satire of the excesses made in the s in the american movie industry aka hollywood it portrays the story of a wannabe actress and an established actor as they navigate through the insanity that is this movie a bunch of over the top and exaggerated characters in ridiculous and completely insane situations in a movie that extends its stay for hours i feel its an accurate description of it i laughed zero times during the film i assume that there are a lot of references and hints to famous folks and events during that era but most of them if they indeed are present went right through my head an all star cast completely wasted with a lot of them having less than minutes of screen time and even margot and brad werent enough to make this a decent experience the insanity just grows more intense and by the end of the movie it feels like the director decided to give up and just made whatever random thing that popped into his head and put it in the film this macabre unnecessary gruesome cave scene that i am still trying to understand what was the purpose of it if this was suppose to criticize the excess the violence and the oversexualization going around all those years back they did an awful job as the movie is guilty of the exact same thing its suppose to be criticizing a waste of time and talent i have no clue what was the point of this mess it feels like it was made by a teenager with a bunch of fetiches that he would like to see on a big screen,NEGATIVE

831,831,3.0,11 February 2023,"The most astounding thing about Babylon is that it's a film entirely composed of false notes. From the uber-indulgent near-thirty-minute opening orgy to the closing Singing In The Rain-inspired phantasmagoria there's not a single believable moment. The characters are cliches writ large, the comedy is forced to breaking point, every sequence sails past melodrama into overkill, then circles back for another assault on your battered sensibilities. If you know anything at all about Hollywood from the silent to the early sound era, then you know it was absolutely nothing like Damian Chazelle's perverse reversal of Singing In The Rain. Sure, there was debauchery. There was excess. Careers crashed and burned. But Babylon aims Sick And Twisted in biblical proportions, and it quickly becomes ludicrously outlandish. If Chazelle is trying to say something worthwhile here, he's making a giant hash of it. There's a would-be momentous scene toward the end in which gossip columnist Elinor St John tells movie star Jack Conrad that his career is over simply because his time is up, but he will be remembered in a hundred years time. Only we know that there were usually very specific reasons why silent stars failed in the transition to sound (Singing In The Rain knew that), and, actually, most of those stars weren't remembered 20 years later, and they're completely forgotten today. Elinor and Chazelle could hardly be more wrong. The only point at which I was emotionally engaged by Babylon was in one of Brad Pitt's later scenes. Was I moved by his character. No. I was moved by Pitt giving a masterful performance in this empty vessel of a film, to sadly little effect. Margot Robbie gives it everything she has too, but with rather more mixed results, given how her character's arc is from annoying to insufferable. By contrast, Diego Calva as an improbable Latino producer is an utterly blank canvas for most of the movie. And then there's Tobey Maguire giving what must surely be the year's most over-the-top performance in possibly the decade's most over-the-top film sequence. But can anything really be over-the-top when a film is an exercise in excess? Chazelle clearly thinks the way to cinema greatness is Go Big Or Go Home.

834,834,5.0,24 May 2024,"The opening sequence reminded me of the old joke: When a custodian who shovels elephant dung at the circus is asked why he doesn't quit, he says, ""What? And leave show business?""

In Babylon, a truck carrying an elephant stalls and the driver endures a deluge of elephant dung attempting to restart it because he'll do anything to go to the Hollywood party that the elephant is invited to. And he's not the only one. Dignity and self-respect replaced by fawning and yearning.

Damien Chazelle is clearly trying to shock us with nudity and depravity and drugs (oh my!), but it all feels forced and phony. Unfortunately for him, that schtick has played out. According to the MPAA, of the 11,000+ movies released since 1995, only 406 were rated G. By now, our brains have such rugged shock absorbers that we barely bat an eye at climate change, let alone an orgy.

There is something shocking, however, about the Babylon screenplay: it's unconvincing, even implausible. Start with the dialog so rife with profanity that it sounds like the 2020s, not the 1920s. Then consider this line, delivered by Brad Pitt, which is problematic for another, and worse, reason: ""Then he said, 'Frankly, Scarlett, you're a c*** '."" Gone With the Wind was published years later, in 1936, and Clark Gable immortalized the line in 1939. So, is Chazelle being careless, disdainful, ignorant, or (desperate guess:) trying to go meta and be funny?

Babylon lacks not talent, but discipline and dignity. It is three self-indulgent hours trying to satirize self-indulgence. Chazelle doesn't have the chops.

839,839,4.0,9 February 2023,"I was really looking forward to seeing this film, as i like a lot of the cast. Unfortunately it's just a bit of a mess in all honesty. There's a few really good scenes, but overall it's really not up to much.

Some of the performances are excellent, but they're not from who you'd expect. I think this is Margot Robbie's worst ever performance in a film, she just annoyed me in this one. Yes, her character was meant to be 'big' and flamboyant, but it was Margot's acting and interpretation of the character which was annoying, not the character itself.

Brad Pitt was decent, but for some odd reason i kept expecting to see Nick Cage pop up and do his usual over acting, and it wouldn't have looked out of place in this at all. I think that's the biggest problem with this film, it's just overacted. They've tried to make the characters too big in many ways, and as a result we're left with a Nick Cage fantasy film without Nick Cage.

It was way too long too, which really didn't help it cause. The whole dance scene at the start was far too long and self indulgent for its own good, and the scenes where they were shooting a film were also too drawn out. The one where they're shooting Nelle coming into the college dorm room is just stupidly long. They get the scene done after 8 or 9 takes and it genuinely feels like you're there for the entirety of the 8 or 9 takes. I wanted to walk away and have them give me a shout when they got it down.

853,853,4.0,13 June 2023,"Rating: 4.9 Overall, a chaotic mess from a talented director as he fails to direct his poorly constructed narrative cause he tries too hard to go for shock and humor that it goes for grotesque and unwatchable, so much to the point that even the competent performances cannot even save the train-wreck that is over three hours long.

Bad Direction (The whole movie just feels like a mess as everything is super chaotic and the narrative just gets very hard to follow as it goes on; Damien Chazelle really does not get the most out of his actors as he tries to really go for more shock than trying to get powerful performances from them), Decent Acting (Pretty Good from Brad Pitt (Really pulls more from experience to help get through this as his character just feels like a more chaotic version of the one he played in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, but as it tries to get deeper it just misses the mark more), Pretty Good to Good from Margot Robbie (Uses the experience she has playing the socialites to help drive the performance as it just feels like she is playing a combination of characters she has played in the past), Pretty Good to Good from Diego Calva (Does a good job for the most part being the lens of the movie and really holds his own when working with more established actors), Pretty Bad from Jean Smart, Decent from Jovan Adepo (He is pent up to be a very important character but they just do not use him well enough to show what he can do), Decent from Li Jun Li, Bad to Pretty Bad from the rest of the cast (Just chaotic overall and a lot of the performances feel like overacting)), Pretty Bad Story (The actual theme of the movie is somewhat interesting, but the plot itself is just incredibly long and the elements really do not work well off of each other as it feels like the story is progressing but going backwards at the same time (even though it could be argued this is intentional)), Pretty Bad Screenplay (The symbolism just feels very shallow and the foreshadowing is very predictable; the dialogue is also very forced and superficial), Good Score, Pretty Good Cinematography (There were many shots from a grand scale that make the movie look very nice as it helped with establishing the big sets and scenes, but the constant fast moving of the camera to help with making the movie chaotic really got nauseating at times as it felt very amateurish), Pretty Good Sound, Very Bad Editing (It just tries to hard to be shock but ends up just being nauseating; Also the editing towards the end just feels like something a 5 year old would do), Good Visual Effects, Good to Very Good Production Design (Does do a good job in helping establish the time period), Plot Structure was very bad as it was just a chaotic mess of elements trying to movie the story forward (with the resolution basically being unnecessary as the movie could have ended at the climax and still would have been the same movie), Pacing was very bad as the movie drags a lot after the halfway point of the movie as it tries to fit in so much plot that is very unnecessary to tell the story (45-60 minutes of the movie could have been cut and it would have been the same movie), Climax was interesting (but still has elements of shock that are really unnecessary); the ending of the movie was completely unnecessary and the final scene felt really awkward and forced for no reason, Tone was really trying to be comedic with a mix of chaos and black comedy (but there were many awkward silences that just made the movie feel more awkward and grotesque than what it was trying to go for)","December 23, 2022 (United States)",rating overall a chaotic mess from a talented director as he fails to direct his poorly constructed narrative cause he tries too hard to go for shock and humor that it goes for grotesque and unwatchable so much to the point that even the competent performances cannot even save the trainwreck that is over three hours long bad direction the whole movie just feels like a mess as everything is super chaotic and the narrative just gets very hard to follow as it goes on damien chazelle really does not get the most out of his actors as he tries to really go for more shock than trying to get powerful performances from them decent acting pretty good from brad pitt really pulls more from experience to help get through this as his character just feels like a more chaotic version of the one he played in once upon a time in hollywood but as it tries to get deeper it just misses the mark more pretty good to good from margot robbie uses the experience she has playing the socialites to help drive the performance as it just feels like she is playing a combination of characters she has played in the past pretty good to good from diego calva does a good job for the most part being the lens of the movie and really holds his own when working with more established actors pretty bad from jean smart decent from jovan adepo he is pent up to be a very important character but they just do not use him well enough to show what he can do decent from li jun li bad to pretty bad from the rest of the cast just chaotic overall and a lot of the performances feel like overacting pretty bad story the actual theme of the movie is somewhat interesting but the plot itself is just incredibly long and the elements really do not work well off of each other as it feels like the story is progressing but going backwards at the same time even though it could be argued this is intentional pretty bad screenplay the symbolism just feels very shallow and the foreshadowing is very predictable the dialogue is also very forced and superficial good score pretty good cinematography there were many shots from a grand scale that make the movie look very nice as it helped with establishing the big sets and scenes but the constant fast moving of the camera to help with making the movie chaotic really got nauseating at times as it felt very amateurish pretty good sound very bad editing it just tries to hard to be shock but ends up just being nauseating also the editing towards the end just feels like something a year old would do good visual effects good to very good production design does do a good job in helping establish the time period plot structure was very bad as it was just a chaotic mess of elements trying to movie the story forward with the resolution basically being unnecessary as the movie could have ended at the climax and still would have been the same movie pacing was very bad as the movie drags a lot after the halfway point of the movie as it tries to fit in so much plot that is very unnecessary to tell the story minutes of the movie could have been cut and it would have been the same movie climax was interesting but still has elements of shock that are really unnecessary the ending of the movie was completely unnecessary and the final scene felt really awkward and forced for no reason tone was really trying to be comedic with a mix of chaos and black comedy but there were many awkward silences that just made the movie feel more awkward and grotesque than what it was trying to go for,NEGATIVE

Don't even know what Toby Mcguires character brought in to the over all story. From there went downhill fast. I felt sorry for Manny. He ruined his life for sure.

859,859,5.0,7 April 2023,"For example the opening scene, filled with wondrous and horrifying sights, massively overstays its welcome. The film has many pornographic scenes. And that opening scene begins what I viewed as poison-pen letter to Hollywood's silent era, a three-hour-plus extravaganza of debauchery, general misery, and overflowing movie magic that sets the industry aflame and invites the audience to dance around the bonfire. It is just so sad that the Writer, Producer and Director had to include the debauchery along with the magic and yes, the misery of some. Just too much misery. It's a daring thing for a major studio to put out these days, when big budgets tend to be lavished on superheroes, and Babylon's caustic indulgence will likely put many theatergoers off. They may have been trying to make a point with all the excess: that the joy of cinema has always gone hand in hand with exploitation, abuse, and off-screen villainy. But movie goers don't want to pay their hard earned dollars to view misery and pornography. Unfortunately, those tones erase the really great parts of the movie. It took me 4 times to finally not turn the movie off within the first scenes. Could have been a big hit but instead it made a lot of movie goers sick to their stomach and depressed.

It fell rather flat unfortunately and just ended up dragging on, as most films made by Hollywood about Hollywood tend to do. They're incapable of being unbiased I suppose.

What irked me a little too was the disservice they did to some of the stars, Pitt hammed it up as he usually does now so well, like his role in Bullet Train but set in the past, Robbie looked like she'd stepped out of a 1980s music video (with 2008 dance moves) not like a 1920s starlet, and Calva spends most of the film looking gormless.

There's a pretentious pointlessness to this film, it was almost made chaotic in order to discombobulate your mind so that afterwards they can tell you it was art and a masterpiece you didn't get.

I got it, bits were decent, the trumpet players arc was particularly interesting but as for the rest, it's just the usual awful kinds of people doing drugs, drinking to much and endless partying and sex, which is great but why these kinda people are celebrated is beyond me. If this was a love letter to cinema, if I was cinema, I'd not reply.

Brad Pitt was decent, Margot Robbie who I love just got more and more irritating and her nonsensical love story was so poor, manny starts off ok but by the end he's just another blind fool used by a woman and thrown away but too smitten to realise she was more toxic than the drugs.

I imagine it was tough moving from silent to talking, that's actually an interesting story, it wasn't well executed here at all. I'm not was all so shallow and purposefully distracting so you didn't keep thinking what is the point?

It's overly long, needlessly and again pointlessly as there was no point or story it was truly to nail, the ending was a weird mess and really anticlimactic. Even reading the positive reviews they sound the same level of pretentious, it's s thing where when people are told it's artistic and great that like sheep people will blindly follow and praise.

It's not completely awful, it's no 1/10, bits are good but I've seen so many of these kinda films, trying so hard to be random and unique to create this sense of art, technically all cinema is art, this just happens to be extremely long, tedious and arrogant art that'll be enjoyed by the pretentious and those to scared to critique it incase they seem stupid.

The problem (once again): we have seen it all before. In Mr. Chazelle's other films and - much better - in works by actually talented directors like Fellini, Kubrick, Donen/Kelly, Stroheim, Scorsese, Fincher and yes, even Babylon Berlin does make more sense than this forlorn mess of another celebration of Hollywood and not much else.

876,876,5.0,5 February 2023,"The movie Babylon has received criticism for its unnecessary use of vulgar scenes, poorly developed storyline and a weak concept. The film stars several popular actors including Margot Robbie, Brad Pitt, Tobey Maguire, James McKay, Diego Calva and Manny Torres.

The movie's plot revolves around a Hollywood studios in the 1920s and focuses on the rise of talking pictures and the people behind it. The concept is pathetic, also, the execution of the story is lackluster and uninteresting. The characters are underdeveloped, and their motivations are not well explained. This leads to a lack of emotional investment from the audience and makes it difficult to connect with the story.

Additionally, the movie is filled with unnecessary vulgar scenes and crass humor, which is not in keeping with the period setting. The dialogue feels forced and unnatural, and the use of vulgarity serves no purpose other than to shock and offend.

The acting performances are also subpar, with the cast failing to bring their characters to life. Margot Robbie, who is known for her powerful performances, is underutilized in this film and does not deliver a standout performance. Brad Pitt, Tobey Maguire, James McKay, Diego Calva, and Manny Torres all give average performances and fail to elevate the weak script.

In conclusion, Babylon is a disappointing film that fails to deliver on its potential. The poorly developed storyline, weak concept, and unnecessary use of vulgar scenes make this movie a forgettable experience.

880,880,3.0,21 April 2023,"This film goes overboard with visual stylization in order to distract from its lack of substance. The story is predictable and tiresome. The plot, such as it is, is underwhelming. There is next to no character development. The dialog is trite and childish. The acting is horrible. In particular, Brad Pitt, who couldn't act his way out of a paper bag. I really don't see how he keeps getting film roles. He is terrible. Ok if he plays a lunkhead like he did in Once Upon A Time In Hollywood, he isn't too horrible, but if has to display some real emotion, and convey some substance or depth, he fails miserably. Also terrible in the film was Margot Robbie, who turns in a laughably over the top, hysterical performance complete with a pathetic Joisey accent. These two probably thought they were working on a prestige picture which would result in Oscar nods. Think again! The only actor who doesn't embarrass himself is Diego Calva. The actors with supporting roles were pathetic too. Flea? Can't act. Jeff Garlin? Just breezes through it like he does with all his roles. Eric Roberts? Should still be stuck in straight to DVD limbo. Tobey Maguire? So laughably bad it was embarrassing.

The film is also way too long, and there is too much unnecessary vulgarity and crudity.

It seems the previous success this director had went straight to his head. He probably thinks he can do no wrong, and thought he'd gift the world with an early Hollywood epic.

But just like special effects in films, these are largely bonuses that can make a good film a great film. Or, inversely, and as is the case with Babylon, they can make a dull movie a way too expensive dull movie.

It is my suspicion that Babylon has been made for, and can be enjoyed mostly by, two groups of people. First, those who find themselves within the various Hollywood industries portrayed. Second, the I-love-everything-Hollywood ritualists. Nothing wrong with either group, of course, but somebody has to legislate that these movies come with an appropriate warning! Otherwise those gentle souls among us who want our movies to entertain us by an interesting story suffer a precious time loss.

894,894,4.0,27 January 2023,"I was very curious to see ""Babylon"" since I liked a lot both of the previous three film by Damien Chazelle, but unfortunately I was disappointed here. The movie has a lot of great things about it. First of all the score is phenomenal (thank you again Justin Hurwitz), the performances are strong, the scenes are always well shot (even though sometimes Chazelle goes too far to show his abilities) and the cinematography is also very good. All these things results in a large number of memorable and funny scenes that I personally loved and I will remember for sure.

But so, if I liked so much so many things why did I consider ""Babylon"" disappointing? Well, because once considering the movie as a whole and not just like a series of great scenes, ""Babylon"" feels unbalanced, highly chaotic and unsubsequential. First of all the ending is bad: it's too long to the point in which for the last 15 minutes I kept saying to myself ""ok it's finished"", ""oh yes, now it's totally finished"", ""that's the ending"" but it kept going on. And the last five minutes are an insult to the viewer's intelligence since it makes the message too explicit, as if he/she couldn't get it by his/her own. While the rest of the movie, though packed with great things, doesn't lead to almost anything. Characters don't develop, two of the three protagonists are caricatures, the one played by Brad Pitt is a poor man's Rick Dalton/Riggan Thomson and his arc feels too fast in the second part of the movie. Other characters like the black trumpeter and the asian lady are abandoned for large parts of the movie and their potential is partially wasted. Not to mention the very intriguing gangster/horror section in the final act that comes out from nowhere and it's useful only to conclude in a rush the plot. A perfect example to what I said earlier about liking the scenes but not how they fit in the plot is the initial party. It's outstanding and fun, but it's something like 25 minutes long and it has the only scope to introduce to the tone and to have two characters to meet. A lot of super enjoyable wasted time, since some characters, as mentioned, are then forgotten for long portions of the movie.

""Babylon"" is about changing times and how some people reacted and failed to adapt to the newest evolutions. The concepts and ideas are surely interesting but the chaos and its unbalanced nature are not able to properly convey them. Thematically it has something of both ""Once upon a time...in Hollywood"" and ""The wolf of Wall Street"", but even with their excesses Tarantino and Scorsese were able not to lose control of their ambitious creatures. Unfortunately Chazelle did.

898,898,1.0,25 February 2023,"""I was asked by George to come up and see him and talk to him about directing what would be the third Star Wars. And I had next door to zero interest. But I always admired George. George is a guy who does what he loves. And I do what I love. The difference is, what George loves makes hundreds of billions of dollars. So I thought I should go up and at least visit with him. And it was incredible.

I had to go to this building in L. A. first. And I had to get a special credit card, and I had to get special keys. A letter came, and a map. Then I went to the airport, and I flew up. They had a rental car all ready for me. Keys. Everything was set. I was to drive to this place. I came into an office. And there was George. He talked with me for a little bit. Then he says, 'I want to show you something.'

Right about at this time, I started getting a little bit of a headache. You know what I'm talking about (laughs), okay...He took me upstairs. And he showed me these things called Wookies. And now this headache is getting stronger. He showed me many animals and different things. Then he took me in a ride in his Ferrari for lunch. And George is kind of short. So, he had the seat back, and he was almost laying down in the car. And we were flying through this little town up in Northern California. We went to a restaurant. Not that I don't like salad. But that's all they had was salad.

Then I got a really...almost like a migraine headache. And I could hardly wait to get home. Even before I got home, I kind of crawled into a phone booth, and I called my agent and said, 'There's no way! There is no way I can do this!' He said, 'David, David, David...Calm down! You don't have to do this.'

So George, bless his heart, I told him on the phone the next day that he should direct it. It's his film. He invented everything about it. But he doesn't really love directing. So someone else did direct that film. But I called my lawyer and told him I wasn't going to do it. And he said, 'You just lost, I don't know how many millions of dollars.' But it's okay.""

Not the story; as unoriginal and meager as it was, and the same thing having been told countless times before, it could still have served as the base of a well told film .

The topic is somewhat interesting after all .

However, the screenplay, directing , editing , and the efforts of whoever else is involved in the creative part these days , it was inadequate at best.

Is it the decline of competent screen writing in recent years, is it the production houses butting in, is it celebrity actors assuming producer roles they don't have any skills for ?

No scene, no dialogue was credible, neither was any of the characters - card bord cutouts in a paint by numbers play .

Pitt was the most convincing one - which isn't saying much apart from his ability to not get buried by even the poorest of scripts .

Robbie would have been ok to watch, hadn't she been completely miscast for the era, and not been playing a stereotypical 21st century brat taken from one of her other films .

Neither her haggard physique nor her demeanour were fitting the role, even the hair looked out of place .

I only mention her at all as some critics called it a 'Margot Robbie movie' . One needs to be more than a noisy caricature of former roles to get there - it's a bad Brad Pitt movie .

It's a film that desperately trys to be opulent, historical - even epic; edgy - even outrageous , but is none of that by any standard .

901,901,5.0,19 January 2023,"First I do give it five stars.

For me that is an average movie that I do not want to see again but am not regretting having spent time watching. I had a good time. My friend had a great time.

I won't write a resume but instead focus on the good and bad things.

First of all the first two acts of the movie are really well done with a story and characters that one can relate to. The third and last act is just messy and with too many different directions and ideas. The movie have at least three potential endings which would have made a very different and in my humble opinion a much better movie.

The quality of the acting was very mixed.

Robbie seems like she was just redoing her acting from suicide squad. This might be the scripts fault - that I do not know. What we see here is basically the same thing we saw with Kristen Stewart and her first post-twilight acting/casting. I would have liked to see her act less crazy and more like a real person. I think the movie could have gained from that. Both Pitts and Calvas characters were well written and acted. Personally I liked Pitts character more that any other in the movie. Tobey Maguires acting was very interesting and I personally hope someone will cast him as the ""Joker"" or the ""Riddler"" in a batman movie. He would be brilliant in such a role. By far the best mad/crazy acting in the movie although it came in the third act and as such did not add anything to the story or movie.

You could definitely watch this movie but do not expect the grand cinematic evolution/revelation that media are trying to blow it up to be.

I most likely won't watch it again and if I do I will definitely not watch the third act.

904,904,5.0,25 July 2024,"More than an ode to the silent movie era, ""Babylon"" is a masterpiece of Hollywood self-sabotage.

Sure, the cinematography is dazzling, but who cares if the camera dances gracefully and the lighting is impeccable when everything else is a spectacular disaster starting from the main characters?

From the opening scene, you're whisked away on a journey that pretends to be edgy and innovative but it isn't. The plot diligently ticks off all the boxes on the politically correct checklist:

* Female lead who's ""fiercely independent"" in the most clichéd way possible - check.

* Ethnic characters portrayed as holier-than-thou saints compared to their white counterparts - check.

* Rich people painted as the epitome of evil and hypocrisy - check.

Margot Robbie delivers a bravura performance as Nellie La Roy (a laughable attempt at a French surname, which should be LE ROI), an obnoxious gambler and drug addict devoid of subtlety or sophistication. Brad Pitt fares slightly better as the fading star Jack, but it's hard to feel for a character who squanders everything out of vanity.

Then there's Manny, who is too good to be remotely believable. At the end he even permanently dips his pen into Mexican ink, thus avoiding marrying a blonde ""gringa"", which would have been a shameful race-mixing. Can't get holier than that.

The pool scenes, which seem to be shot in the villa from ""Boogie Nights,"" combined with the bizarre costumes, evoke a 70s debauchery vibe that feels out of place. Overlong sequences, like the snake wrangling, lead to abrupt time jumps without any narrative fluidity, and the final act feels clumsily tacked on. Years of minimal contact culminate in Nellie storming back into Manny's life to beg for a fortune to cover her gambling debts. Because, naturally, she has no other friends or money left. Totally believable, right?

In this tale of repulsive characters and grotesque excesses, endearing moments and sophistication are nowhere to be found.

910,910,4.0,23 July 2024,"The main problem with Babylon is its bloated script and uneven pace. In a desperate bid to be inclusive and provocative, it assaults us with endless debauched party scenes featuring every sexual act and orientation, bodily fluids from all orifices, and even a pointless snake attack.

Amazingly, the movie manages to make an orgy boring and overlong, after its start in 1926, with an elephant dumping on a worker who bizarrely doesn't step aside. The 30-minute orgy that follows serves mainly to introduce the Nellie, Manny, and Jack characters in costumes that barely evoke the 1920s.

Next, we endure 40 minutes celebrating silent films, and another 30 detailing the painful transition to talkies in 1927. Unfortunately, after over 90 minutes, when many decent movies would wrap it up, we still have a long way to go. Suddenly, it's the early '30s: Manny fails to refine Nellie, Jack becomes obsolete, and we plunge into a criminal subplot with a terrible Maguire as a pervy mobster before the movie mercifully ends.

The pool scenes echo Boogie Nights, the criminal underbelly feels ripped from Mulholland Drive, and the vomiting is straight out of The Exorcist. Nellie is an aggressive, obnoxious drug addict, who looks like a 70s groupie, but without redeeming (or endearing) qualities. Robbie's beauty and talent can't save the character. Pitt's old glory Jack is slightly more poignant but still unlikable. Manny is too good to be true but he ticks the diversity box, just like the token Oriental and Afro-American characters.

916,916,2.0,5 February 2023,"It might be the most frustrating thing to say ""there is a good film in there.""

I wanted to love Babylon. The first hour had a drive and pace that wasn't only incredibly entertaining but introduced us to an interesting set of characters, beginning their stories and laying out their career paths in an exciting and unique way.

I didn't find the glitz and the glamour to be a distraction, nor did I find that to be the case as the film moved into my less preferred second and third acts.

Chazelle consistently does too much with the camera, and puts shots together on a large scale too well for it to be a case of a flat out failure to tell its story. Visually, the movie never fails to accommodate its character beats, or provoke the thrill required from each individual scene. Linus Sandgren's beautiful use of colours and scope, once again add to the near perfect production design, in a way that seamlessly transfers you back in time. Once again, the visual ambition of the film wasn't ever a problem for the tone it set out to instil, but it couldn't help but see style dominate over any substance it was going for.

A plot where we see our protagonists being chewed up and spat back out by a changing industry works perfectly in mind for what the movie started out being. Throughout its next two hours, it went there, sort of. I almost feel as if it's too generous to say that's is the plot line it actually followed, from what we got.

The film does occasionally taps back into that discipline and focus in its remaining time. Notably, a couple of the scenes featuring the fantastic, Jevan Adepo. Unfortunately, the film ultimately falls back into spending way too long telling its story through a poorly chosen sequence of events.

The arc of Brad Pitt's Jack Conrad, to me, felt the most focussed. A story of an actor struggling to both adapt to the times, and also come terms with a disappointing career. Whilst it couldn't stand out enough as a success in and amongst the rest of the film's protagonists, it certainly felt more withdrawn and disciplined in comparison Whilst it didn't feel like anything new for Pitt, he certainly never fell below his standard and met the movie's brooding ambition well.

Perhaps as a result of poor marketing, I expected Margot Robbie's Nellie LaRoy to be much more of a leading role. She slowly became a motivator for the actions of Manny Torres. Of which began to move further away from sense and focus as the movie blindly sprinted along. Her relevance to the wider storyline increasingly felt lost, and less relevant. Despite it, on paper, following that general arc of the ""hate letter"" to Hollywood and its refuse that came from a constant change. Robbie bought the same energy she has bought to many of her roles; and consistently makes the most of what the script throws at her. Even if it, again, wasn't necessarily entering any uncharted territory for her.

Maybe I was too focused on what I was wanted/was expecting the movie to be, but I felt it just began to fizzle out altogether, sinking with any meaningful moments or motivations that the first act promised for these characters. I felt the movie succeeded in throwing you into this crazy world with a set of characters you immediately understood, without any real back story for any of them. But, perhaps arrogantly of me, I wanted it tone itself down after that. Matching the characters realisations that come from change and that struggle to adapt. Following the characters through that journey, rather than them going through various emotionally driven episodes as their problems increases. I didn't mind the movie shouting at its audience in some scenes. But, it didn't have to do it all the time, especially as it wasn't always clear what it was trying to say.

From what I heard, it sounded like a film that swung for six on every occasion, and required viewers to tune its ears to pace and power. All of which might have enhanced the film on further viewings as the audience become more expecting of what it goes on to do. However, here I worry braving another 3 hours might just reaffirm my existing issues, where that pace and power beautifully charge itself towards very little.

919,919,1.0,23 January 2023,"The most disappointed I've been in a film in some time. Why is it that every movie about excess has to be excessively long? You can feel the writer in the room deftly explaining how deep it is that the runtime and the subject matter are parallels. I can't roll my eyes hard enough. Especially considering how much of this could've easily been left on the editing room floor with no negative impact on the overall story. There are so many little moments here that hint at the potential this project had but it's never more than a backdrop for the cookie-cutter 'excess film' checklist that is this script. Are there drugs, death, orgies, and unsympathetic characters that can't be satisfied despite having everything? Cool, it's like literally every other movie that has ever been made about excess.

Don't get me wrong, there are scenes here that are very well done but even they lose their charm once you realize that the skeleton of the scenes is always the same. The three that come to mind are Brad Pitt's character sharing a romantic kiss above a waging battleground, the brilliant slow destruction of everyone's sanity the first time filming on a sound stage amid no AC and constant interruption, and Diego Calva's character crying in a movie theater as he hears the theme from Singing in the Rain. In all three the setup and takeaway are identical: despite the insane waste of money and resources, despite the very real casualties along the way, and despite asinine characters necessary to get us from point A to point B, when everything aligns perfectly and movie magic is created it is a truly beautiful thing that is...I guess supposed to be worth the price paid? It's most effective the first time we see it with Pitt's scene, but sadly after it's repeated again and again, by the final scene it's impossible to believe there's any sincerity to it.

The real praise here goes to the cinematography and score. While the cinematography is nauseating at times (I think more due to Damien Chazelle's directing style and the subject matter than any fault to DP Linus Sandgren), there are truly beautifully shot sequences here. The aforementioned kiss scene with Pitt is a great example with a single still from that moment being comparable to even the most beautifully filmed movies. And Justin Hurwitz is really in his prime here providing a film score to be held up amongst the greats.

A big problem is that this is a film that doesn't really stand in reality or fantasy, and while that itself can be done well in this case it just makes the narrative feel largely unfocused. As a lover of this time period, an easy example for me is the character that is clearly supposed to be a Roscoe ""Fatty"" Arbuckle of sorts who at the start of the film is a larger man alone in a room with a girl who ultimately ends up dying...except of course the real Arbuckle was found not guilty after it was made clear during the trail that the whole thing was arranged by a well known blackmailer and the dead girl in question had no signs of sexual assault (not to mention greats like Chaplin and Keaton coming to his defense). Yet here we're essentially given a man with the mind of a child who is sexually perverse and helps the girl, who it turns out is underage, to overdose. So it's like Chazelle did enough homework to put nods like this in the film but not enough to make them at all authentic, which makes it feel less like a cool easter egg and more like a lazy slap in the face.

I love far too many filmmakers who have made the occasional disappointingly uninteresting movie to pretend like this hurts my opinion of Damien too terribly, he's a writer who has proven on many occasions that he has raw talent and incredible vision, but A) I feel he took what many people accused him of with La La Land as being too romantic in his depiction of the arts too personally and decided with this project to play against his strengths and do the exact opposite just to prove he could, and B) wish that he surrounded himself with more people unafraid of letting him know when things aren't so good. There's a staggering amount of this movie that could have and in my opinion should have been cut for the theatrical release and no one was there to tell Damien regardless of any personal agendas what could make the movie better?

921,921,3.0,3 February 2023,"""Another giant swing at mediocrity"" - that quote from Brad Pitt's character can sum the movie up.

Pretty big flop, that will take some Oskars for set decorations. Even as some of the things were very inacurate.

Cinematography and editing of this movie were very very good. I love when there are nice long shots (even if they have some inacuraties that i'll explain later). Editing was also good most of the times, that style fitted the movie perfectly. And that's it :D

The movie is based on mid20s early 30s holywood, but many details were very period inacurate. And the director claimed he did a lot of research... yet he left many things that would not happen at that time, because these scene look cool. The worst for me was the very vulgar bar scene. The parties may have been total orgy and vulgarity, but the movies in the mid 20s were NOT. You barely even have a kissing scene in these, so any provocative (or more, as it is) hip movement and hands in the pants would never be on camera for mainstream movie. And that behaviour would never make you a big star. Movies at that time were way too conservative.

And let's not forget the out of place feminism.

Overal, the story is ok, but mediocre. The lives of few people and how it changes with the progress of the cinema. You don't have great acting here but the acting wasn't terrible either. That movie would have been much much better (at least tolerable) , if it wasn't 3h long... You'd think that it's a requirement for the Oscars to be over 2:30h :D Sound was decent, incl Atmos.

I was a bit disappointed, as I wanted to potentially add the film to my list of the ""best movies of 2022."" After watching it, I believe it fits better on the ""worst movies of 2022"" list.

927,927,5.0,25 February 2023,"Despite a paltry 3/10 star ranking, I do not consider ""Babylon"" a bad movie for lack of idea or effort. Showing the Hollywood transition from silent pictures to ""talkies"" is interesting, and there are indeed some valuable lessons that can be applied to the modern day tinseltown. Instead, however, director Damien Chazelle takes the ""Wolf of Wall Street"" approach here--focusing on the utter debauchery and ridiculousness of the situation and completely eschewing much of a coherent narrative whatsoever.

For a very basic overview, ""Babylon"" tells the story of the early days of Hollywood, California, when silent films were all the rage. Jack Conrad (Brad Pitt) is the format's uber-leading man, while Nellie LaRoy (Margot Robbie) & Manny Torres (Diego Calva) are up-and-comers looking to break in to the movie business. Just when the area and format look to be peaking, a new innovation takes the industry by storm: sound. Some adapt--others don't--and both the town and its players are forced to re-invent themselves.

If Chazelle had made an even half-as-much serious film about the exact same topics/subjects, I think I would have really enjoyed that ""Babylon"". I truly was fascinated by an era of Hollywood I had absolutely no knowledge of, and the themes do indeed echo up to the present day. The acting is also solid: Robbie is electric all the way through, while supporting players like Jean Smart & Jovan Adepo steal every scene they are in. Finally, a Chazelle production will always feature a rollicking soundtrack, and that's no different here.

The problem is that Chazelle's ""Babylon"" is nowhere near the one I wanted to consume. If ""La La Land"" was his love letter to Hollywood, then ""Babylon"" is his angry fever dream akin to what ""Wolf of Wall Street"" was for that industry. Those interesting themes and solid performances I mentioned above? All take a far, far back seat to depraved party scenes, crude stunts (of both fecal and vomit nature), and other metaphorical over-the-top antics. I certainly see what Chazelle was getting at--I just don't have much love or respect for that filmmaking approach.

A good litmus test for your enjoyment of ""Babylon"" will be the first 30-or-so minutes before the title card comes up.

935,935,4.0,19 January 2023,"My Review- Babylon

My Rating 5/10

I went through so many emotions with Damien Chazelle's new movie Babylon from loving it at times to then liking it then to sadly loathing some parts of it.

Every Director is entitled to an occasional failure late last year I was also bitterly disappointed by the Director of Call Me By Your Name Luca Guadagnino's last movie Bones and All , however Babylon or ""Babble On ""as I'm choosing to refer to this movie is entertaining and has some funny moments.

Somewhere buried in this three hour nine minute salute to movie excess that would put Baz Luhrmann to shame is probably a good movie .

Damien Chazelle who wrote and directed this movie should part company with this film's editor Tom Cross .

They both have not done any favours to Babylon's two featured stars Brad Pitt who plays a character reminiscent of the famous Silent movie actor John Gilbert or Margo Robbie who also plays a character reminiscent of Clara Bow called Nellie LaRoy.

Both give good performances with the material they have to work with and both their are worth seeing .

I have a good knowledge of the early history of Hollywood and the mid 1960's book that this movie was inspired by written by another avant - garde film director Kenneth Anger and while there certainly were scandals and debauchery in those pioneering days when the Hollywood film community was viewed with disdain by the Orange growing Californian locals as those show people that you wouldn't rent a room to.

Even the New York stage set thought it a huge comedown to appear in a moving picture.

Most Hollywood celebrities not all back then did and many still do live in a fantasy cocoon of self entitled grandeur where excess and sycophantic fandom are responsible for their artificial lifestyles being displayed for all to see .

If Damien Chazelle's intentions were to produce an affectionate homage to the Silent era of movie making he has not achieved his goal.

If his goal was to insult and demean the pioneers of the industry he is such a vital part of today he has succeeded.

I suspect his intention as a movie lover just went in the wrong direction with this overblown overlong salute to vulgarity.

His movie has a good beginning some good content somewhere in the middle and a chaotic ending with a homage to a movie that did pay an affectionate and more accurate homage to the Silent era the classic Stanley Donan Gene Kelly 1954 classic Singin 'in the Rain.

If Toby Maguire wanted a comeback movie he picked the wrong one his role as James McKay a totally repulsive human being I would have cut entirely from this movie his role is vulgar and redundant it's a pity he obviously put his money in this movie as a co - producer and I doubt he will get it back.

I must mention the two most interesting roles for me in Babylon are played by Diego Calva as Manny Torres a young Mexican immigrant who arrives in Hollywood to deliver an elephant to a party in a mansion on a hill resembling the famous Hearst Castle . Diego soon wins over Jack Conrad played by Brad Pitt and begins his climb up the movie producer ladder.

Unfortunately towards the conclusion of the movie Diego is supposed to age nearly 30 years while watching Singin'in the Rain and he hardly looks any older.

Jean Smart is very effective as the dreaded Hollywood gossip columnist Elinor St John and has the best scene in the movie when confronted by yesterdays actor Jack Conrad who's movie stardom has had its day and now is box office poison. Elinor St John tries to placate his anger by explaining great movie stars are immortal she says long after you and I are dead in a hundred years time when movie goers watch our movies we will come alive again our ghosts will live on through our movie .

Ain't that the truth ? That's why I suspect Damien Chazelle wrote that line as an attempt to make an affectionate homage to Hollywood but unfortunately he has failed in my eyes.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",my review babylon my rating i went through so many emotions with damien chazelles new movie babylon from loving it at times to then liking it then to sadly loathing some parts of it every director is entitled to an occasional failure late last year i was also bitterly disappointed by the director of call me by your name luca guadagninos last movie bones and all however babylon or babble on as im choosing to refer to this movie is entertaining and has some funny moments somewhere buried in this three hour nine minute salute to movie excess that would put baz luhrmann to shame is probably a good movie damien chazelle who wrote and directed this movie should part company with this films editor tom cross they both have not done any favours to babylons two featured stars brad pitt who plays a character reminiscent of the famous silent movie actor john gilbert or margo robbie who also plays a character reminiscent of clara bow called nellie laroy both give good performances with the material they have to work with and both their are worth seeing i have a good knowledge of the early history of hollywood and the mid s book that this movie was inspired by written by another avant garde film director kenneth anger and while there certainly were scandals and debauchery in those pioneering days when the hollywood film community was viewed with disdain by the orange growing californian locals as those show people that you wouldnt rent a room to even the new york stage set thought it a huge comedown to appear in a moving picture most hollywood celebrities not all back then did and many still do live in a fantasy cocoon of self entitled grandeur where excess and sycophantic fandom are responsible for their artificial lifestyles being displayed for all to see if damien chazelles intentions were to produce an affectionate homage to the silent era of movie making he has not achieved his goal if his goal was to insult and demean the pioneers of the industry he is such a vital part of today he has succeeded i suspect his intention as a movie lover just went in the wrong direction with this overblown overlong salute to vulgarity his movie has a good beginning some good content somewhere in the middle and a chaotic ending with a homage to a movie that did pay an affectionate and more accurate homage to the silent era the classic stanley donan gene kelly classic singin in the rain if toby maguire wanted a comeback movie he picked the wrong one his role as james mckay a totally repulsive human being i would have cut entirely from this movie his role is vulgar and redundant its a pity he obviously put his money in this movie as a co producer and i doubt he will get it back i must mention the two most interesting roles for me in babylon are played by diego calva as manny torres a young mexican immigrant who arrives in hollywood to deliver an elephant to a party in a mansion on a hill resembling the famous hearst castle diego soon wins over jack conrad played by brad pitt and begins his climb up the movie producer ladder unfortunately towards the conclusion of the movie diego is supposed to age nearly years while watching singinin the rain and he hardly looks any older jean smart is very effective as the dreaded hollywood gossip columnist elinor st john and has the best scene in the movie when confronted by yesterdays actor jack conrad whos movie stardom has had its day and now is box office poison elinor st john tries to placate his anger by explaining great movie stars are immortal she says long after you and i are dead in a hundred years time when movie goers watch our movies we will come alive again our ghosts will live on through our movie aint that the truth thats why i suspect damien chazelle wrote that line as an attempt to make an affectionate homage to hollywood but unfortunately he has failed in my eyes,NEGATIVE
936,936,3.0,11 November 2023,"The intent and the exact message of the writer/director (the same person) aren't clear and just confusing at best. What was he trying to get at? The story takes place in 1920s, but the only parts that were 1920s were the older cars (which are depicted not so impressive covered in dust), and not the people or the fashion or how they were back then (they aren't that direct especially the women). People were too skinny (in other words too modern as people aren't too skinny or obese like in modern America), oozing with fakeness and not the authenticity. I think I know why the movie wasn't successful or didn't really offset the budget of estimated $110 million even from the box office alone, and I saw this on the Netflix just today not even 1 year after the movie release in theaters. They didn't do well as it is not well made, that's why it became available not even a year after the actual release date on Netflix...it was not a hit. I can understand why, the scenes are just too far violent, story unrealistic (in a bad way oozing fakeness) and uninteresting, and nothing revealing or appealing or realistic about them; especially the scenes people supposedly died for real in the making of movies?? Yeah right, that's just murders. Umm, no, people didn't die in reality back then just like that, and not ok to lead the world to think people in poverty from the skid row were ""picked up"" (or recruited) to be treated like their lives were worthless as they either died/horrifically injured on the set...what's the message here?? Like did the director think this is something we wanted to watch and enjoy?? Seriously lacking what we want to watch, we want to be entertained, we do not want to watch horror scenes or depressive scenes one after another. Not fun or thrilling. Nothing. No stunt men back then and people were picked up on the streets to die for the movie making industry?! That never happened in reality, and it is a horrible storyline. The movie scenes look like clips of nightmares of a drug addicted or alcohol dependent movie director of some sorts, it is just not entertaining at all. The scenes aren't appealing, it evoked yuck feeling just by watching half of it. I do not recommend it. The worst part of this?

939,939,3.0,27 July 2023,"Beginning in the mid 1920's and ending in the early 1950's Babylon explores the lives of Hollywood film stars who made their name in the silent era of film before transcending in to talkies. However, this transition proves far from smooth and their journeys are something to behold...

The film begins with a ridiculous elongated pre-title sequence which one feels serves next to no purpose within the context of the surrounding narrative that eventually embodies this film. It screams of excess and indulgence and sadly this becomes a forerunner within the film that barely lets go....

OK to start with the good; director Chazelle has made a beautiful looking film, assembled a wonderful cast, paid wonderful attention to set detail and has captured the era superbly. Unfortunately what he does here is effectively give with one hand whilst effectively taking away with the other....

On the face of it the film seems to be a critique on Hollywood and the early days of cinema and on occasions Babylon gets things right; pressure on the stars, them dealing with said pressure and how the stars deal with said pressure. This is all good, but director Damian Chazelle gets too excited at times and seemingly goes overboard with his own indulgence; the ridiculous parties, ceremonies and god knows what else... It all looks good, but then when we're watching the characters grounded in the real world afterwards trying to offer some kind of catharsis on what has happened the film loses credibility and becomes a bit silly and false.

Oh yeah the film apparently consists of an ensemble cast... right that consists of who exactly? Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie??? Whilst the likes of Jean Smart and Olivia Wilde are hardly Z-listers I struggled to see who were the other ensemble cast members or can an ensemble cast now consist of just 2 people???

The only thing of some interest here is the exploration of the early days of Hollywood, though I will qualify this by saying that this film will probably only interest people who have an interest in that particular era of cinema. If you've come for the 2 person ensemble cast then you will be disappointed.

Going back to the actors then it's fair to say that not a bad show is put on here; Margot Robbie shines and I'm glad to see that she continues to not just be a pretty face. Brad Pitt is OK, but he and his character are part of the problem (excess and indulgence are what are critiqued, but he himself reeks of the same qualities).

Until you watch it that is.

From the moment it opens to the moment it ends this is a three hour roller coaster that doesn't go anywhere but takes three hours to achieve it.

Some scenes zip by while others feel like they will never end.

On the positives the sets are decent, the acting is good and the time it is set in is interesting, which gets it the two stars, but somehow, even with its manic and jumpy fast paced scenes, the film at its core is just plain boring.

I didn't think Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie could do worse than Once Upon A Time In Hollywood, but they certainly managed it with this film.

946,946,1.0,26 December 2022,"Give Damien Chazelle credit for loving movies and Hollywood history. That's what led him down the long and winding road to Babylon. But we all know what the road to hell is paved with, and this movie is a shining example of good intentions gone amok.

The writer-director of La La Land became fascinated with the notion that the same people who perfected an art form in the 1920s indulged in bacchanalian behavior away from work. Hollywood was also a place where a nobody could become a somebody seemingly overnight. That carefree anything-can-happen atmosphere came to a screeching halt with the arrival of talkies. Those are just some of the pieces in this wildly ambitious mosaic, which runs just over three hours.

Some of it works, and it's fun to watch until it starts taking itself too seriously. Even casual film buffs will recognize the source of some story threads. Brad Pitt is ideally cast as a handsome star of silent films (think John Gilbert), while Margot Robbie's uninhibited personality leaps off the screen, like Clara Bow. Chazelle told my USC class that he wanted movie stars to play movie stars and unknowns to play the unknowns who share the spotlight in his epic tale.

Diego Calva portrays a Mexican-American who's movie-struck and, by being in the right place at the right time, climbs the ladder of success. Jovan Adepo is cast as a gifted jazz trumpeter who, as a black man, finds his options limited, even though he can now be heard in talking pictures. (His music, by longtime Chazelle collaborator Justin Hurwitz, is decidedly and deliberately contemporary. No attempt is made to invoke the music of the period.)

The elephantine storyline leads our protagonists toward disaster, each in his or her own way. The handsome movie star, trying to help the female newcomer out of a jam, winds up in the clutches of an underworld figure who-spoiler alert-presides over a private house of horrors, with a real-live freak show in his basement cave. I found this bizarre and baroque and strangely off-putting.

I didn't love Babylon but I can't condemn it, either. How could I when its finale is a love letter to movies and the way they can lift our spirits? Any filmmaker who strives for that ideal shouldn't be dismissed, even if he has made us sit still for more than three hours. Babylon is messy, to be sure, but Chazelle has taken a big swing and that counts for something.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",give damien chazelle credit for loving movies and hollywood history thats what led him down the long and winding road to babylon but we all know what the road to hell is paved with and this movie is a shining example of good intentions gone amok the writerdirector of la la land became fascinated with the notion that the same people who perfected an art form in the s indulged in bacchanalian behavior away from work hollywood was also a place where a nobody could become a somebody seemingly overnight that carefree anythingcanhappen atmosphere came to a screeching halt with the arrival of talkies those are just some of the pieces in this wildly ambitious mosaic which runs just over three hours some of it works and its fun to watch until it starts taking itself too seriously even casual film buffs will recognize the source of some story threads brad pitt is ideally cast as a handsome star of silent films think john gilbert while margot robbies uninhibited personality leaps off the screen like clara bow chazelle told my usc class that he wanted movie stars to play movie stars and unknowns to play the unknowns who share the spotlight in his epic tale diego calva portrays a mexicanamerican whos moviestruck and by being in the right place at the right time climbs the ladder of success jovan adepo is cast as a gifted jazz trumpeter who as a black man finds his options limited even though he can now be heard in talking pictures his music by longtime chazelle collaborator justin hurwitz is decidedly and deliberately contemporary no attempt is made to invoke the music of the period the elephantine storyline leads our protagonists toward disaster each in his or her own way the handsome movie star trying to help the female newcomer out of a jam winds up in the clutches of an underworld figure whospoiler alertpresides over a private house of horrors with a reallive freak show in his basement cave i found this bizarre and baroque and strangely offputting i didnt love babylon but i cant condemn it either how could i when its finale is a love letter to movies and the way they can lift our spirits any filmmaker who strives for that ideal shouldnt be dismissed even if he has made us sit still for more than three hours babylon is messy to be sure but chazelle has taken a big swing and that counts for something,POSITIVE
947,947,5.0,7 February 2023,"The rise and fall of stardom. I do feel the story wasn't explored and exploited enough.

Currently, it draws attention using the decadence parties of movie stars.

Babylon, IMHO should be a mini series or a trilogy with each main story line gets center stage. Brad Pitt's Cary Grant is very good, but it seemed there are more to tell from his character. Margot Robbie's character is excellent but lacking the explanation. And Diego Calvacs story is probably the most compelling and relatable, but in need of expansion.

Overall, Babylon has great potential, but I found it disappointing and unsatisfied because the relatable characters' stories fell short.

However, this movie disappointed me so much. I don't know if I had high hopes or if I was not ready to see this movie but it was quite a mess. We recognize his unique shots, the music is absolutely AMAZING and the actors are quite well chosen. What I didn't like is the beginning of the movie, which also shows perfectly the decadence of the 1950s to be honest, is that it was too much and I don't think that it was that necessary to see this much. I also didn't enjoy how the transitions were made. Sometimes it was plain and boring. The silence was a great chooce but was not always handled properly. The scenes with James Mckay (Tobey Maguire) were so diturbing that I left the cinema before finishing the movie. Useless scenes.

For the cast, Margot Robbie nailed her character and I really think that she was the only one to play this role perfectly, Brad Pitt was also amazing with his character and finally Diego Calva which was so good at his role. Definitely a rising actor.

957,957,4.71,11 January 2023,"I am a huge fan of Damien Chazelle, and I was really looking forward to this ode to Hollywood , especially after loving whiplash and La La Land and first man, and truly wondered if this was going to be a masterpiece or another flop like Amsterdam, which was yet another film that seems to fall into the same category as this one - a bloated confusing script that requires loads of editing.

For some reason it seems like some of these star directors just don't have the ability to edit their scripts/ films in a cohesive manner that removes the messiness does not move the story forward in an entertaining and fulfilling manner to complete the message and journey of the film. Where are the producers to guide the captain in troubled waters when they miss their mark - much like Brad Pitts character that gets laughed at in his last film.

Instead we end up with this overindulgent narcissistic, 3+ hour bloated film that instead of being a master piece it ends up being a missed opportunity and sadly enough - a mediocre clumsy film.

I felt like the Director tried to cover way too many characters and an epic amount of a timeline with a massive goal of trying to make a historical film about Hollywood from the 1920s to the 1960s or modern day for that matter and it was way too much for the writer/director to accomplish in one film.

The film boogie nights was initially a 3+ hour bloated film and it was turned into 2 1/2 hour masterpiece thanks due to the Producer providing proper guidance to reduce the directors vision to a tighter 2.4 hours and it was much more effective and a masterpiece.

Unfortunately this film requires similar direction yet somehow it was allowed to be released in its entirety which is commendable yet it fails in a painful manner where people in the theatre are looking at the time on their phones wondering when it's going to move forward and end the misery of such pointless sloppiness.

The film has many wonderful elements and beautiful moments, and the cinematography is fantastic and the acting is stellar - and the music had some solid moments yet I felt it had too many elements, similar to La La Land that just did not work , but still these are minor issues compared to so many bloated scenes that could've been cut - like the dungeon scene with Tobey Maguire was totally unnecessary, Sidney Palmer's role did not really add much flair to the whole story, the opening scene was almost 30 minutes long that could've been cut down - but overall the one part that really did carry the film was Diego Calvers Manny Torres character was the one surprising element that carries the film from beginning to end - and the love story with him and Nellie Laroys character was reduced to the point that it was meaningless.

I really enjoyed Jean Smart's character Eleanor Saint John scene with Brad Pitt which pretty much depicted the whole film storyline - and the ending was simply a botched attempt to somehow blend it all together yet by this time it feels so out of place with this lame self indulgent reference to the timeline of all Hollywood films even modern ones , which seems a bit far-fetched for a film that is such a flop and missed opportunity that it doesn't deserve to even be in the caliber of the films it's mentioning.

I give it 5 stars because it was such a wonderful attempt to make a Hollywood tribute film but unlike so many other films have done a better job this one just felt like an overbloated complex mess,

960,960,4.71,20 January 2023,"Yes, that's Mark Kermode's joke.

Babylon isn't all bad. If they cut out the bad bits we'd be left with a 100-minute film that was slightly above average. As it is, however, we get a bloated and overindulgent mess.

We start with a Hollywood party where the hedonism and grossness are at a level which would make Caligula think things had gone a bit far. This distasteful opening is partially redeemed by an extended scene on a film set which I found genuinely funny.

After that, however, things go downhill. We get a twisted and perverted version of Singin' in the Rain, more hedonism, a rattlesnake, a ghastly parody of Pygmalion with projectile-vomiting, more hedonism - and then the film takes us into the sewers. Literally and metaphorically. The final montage is absurd in its pretentiousness.

Margot Robbie is good, even though all she's asked to do is Harley Quinn at 100 mph. Brad Pitt is on autopilot throughout. Diego Calva is fine as a guy who breaks into Hollywood by accident. The cinematography and soundtrack are first rate.

961,961,4.71,7 July 2024,"Going in to watching the movie, first thought already was ""pfff more than 3 hours?"" and this for a dramedy, do i really want this?

I decided to go for it, seeing the line up in the cast, could be amazing or at least good.

Well there were actually some parts where you can actually laugh, which was real refreshing, most dramedy and dark-comedy pieces don't make it that far.

The settings and acting was pretty good i think, the pacing was good for such a long movie, but i still think it was way to long in the end.

The lesson Hollywood is pushing on here, that there are no new idea's anymore, they've probably seen alot of critique on all of the remakes thats happening all over the place these last 10-15 years and decided to explain that it's all been done before and before that.

If your short on time, you could also watch the southpark episode, where they come to the conclusion that ""simpson's did!!""

The runtime kills it for me, otherwise it would have been 7 out of then, now it sticks at 5.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",going in to watching the movie first thought already was pfff more than hours and this for a dramedy do i really want this i decided to go for it seeing the line up in the cast could be amazing or at least good well there were actually some parts where you can actually laugh which was real refreshing most dramedy and darkcomedy pieces dont make it that far the settings and acting was pretty good i think the pacing was good for such a long movie but i still think it was way to long in the end the lesson hollywood is pushing on here that there are no new ideas anymore theyve probably seen alot of critique on all of the remakes thats happening all over the place these last years and decided to explain that its all been done before and before that if your short on time you could also watch the southpark episode where they come to the conclusion that simpsons did the runtime kills it for me otherwise it would have been out of then now it sticks at,POSITIVE

In the first half hour I could already see that Babylon was a work full of histrionics, exaggerations, shouting, scatologies and unnecessary things. As it is my personal pleasure to watch all the Oscar nominees, I had to keep watching this film, and as the little over three hours of the film slowly ebbed away I just had to agree more and more with my initial opinion of Babylon . My God, what a terrible movie is this? There is no clear protagonist, there is no quality narrative, there are no reasons for this film to have such an exaggerated duration, there is no need for so much eschatology in a film that could indeed display the exaggerations of a Hollywood in transition, but not in the way that was done.

However, it stands to reason that Babylon shines in technicalities, and its three Oscar nominations are no less than fair. Now, as far as narrative is concerned, this film is far from good.

964,964,4.71,25 January 2023,"Babylon is a paean to the heady days of Hollywood when it was wilder than the wild west, before technicolour and talking got in the way.

It revels in the salacious parties and orgiastic lifestyles of the rich and famous for a good 20 minutes before the titles come up and then takes us on a rather uneven journey through the history of early film.

Our way in to the move is via Manny , a Mexican factotum who gets his break when he falls in with Brad Pitt (who is on luminous form as a dashing silent star) and Nellie (a hopeful wannabe actress played by Margot Robbie).

We follow them as they rise (and fall) but the film is marred by an uneven tone and a frenetic but flabby script that tries to bring in too many storylines with properly serving any of them.

There are moments of slapstick comedy, black humour, tragedy and farce and even some glints of heart and painfully observed insight among the sleaze & glamour.

It is a film with some great moments (usually the quieter ones) but overall it feels too self referential and inward looking to really engage with and for a film that celebrates the art of cinema as a way to connect with people it seems like a bit of a shame.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",babylon is a paean to the heady days of hollywood when it was wilder than the wild west before technicolour and talking got in the way it revels in the salacious parties and orgiastic lifestyles of the rich and famous for a good minutes before the titles come up and then takes us on a rather uneven journey through the history of early film our way in to the move is via manny a mexican factotum who gets his break when he falls in with brad pitt who is on luminous form as a dashing silent star and nellie a hopeful wannabe actress played by margot robbie we follow them as they rise and fall but the film is marred by an uneven tone and a frenetic but flabby script that tries to bring in too many storylines with properly serving any of them there are moments of slapstick comedy black humour tragedy and farce and even some glints of heart and painfully observed insight among the sleaze glamour it is a film with some great moments usually the quieter ones but overall it feels too self referential and inward looking to really engage with and for a film that celebrates the art of cinema as a way to connect with people it seems like a bit of a shame,NEGATIVE
965,965,4.71,10 February 2023,"""Babylon"" is a captivating and visually stunning film set in the vibrant world of 1920s Hollywood. The film takes us on a journey through the rise of Manuel ""Manny"" Torres, a Mexican immigrant who finds himself caught up in the fast-paced and often dangerous world of filmmaking. Manny is a complex and charismatic character, played with remarkable depth and nuance by a talented actor.

The film is a feast for the senses, with stunning set design, costume, and cinematography that transport the audience to the glamorous and decadent world of 1920s Hollywood. The film's eclectic cast of characters is equally impressive, each bringing their own unique flair and energy to the film.

One of the standout performances in the film is that of Nellie LaRoy, a brash and ambitious actress who becomes a star in her own right. The relationship between Manny and Nellie is a highlight of the film, with their dynamic and often tumultuous partnership driving the story forward.

As the film progresses, we see Manny navigate the changing landscape of filmmaking as sound begins to replace silent films. The film does an excellent job of capturing the excitement and uncertainty of this era, as well as the challenges faced by filmmakers as they try to keep up with the rapidly changing technology.

Overall, ""Babylon"" is a rich and immersive film that offers a unique and captivating glimpse into the world of 1920s Hollywood.

Starting as Babylon did, there just wasn't the energy to see it to a bombastic end.

The minutes wasted in the last scenes in the theater we just that- wasted images of weird watercolors to symbolize what?

Although I was entertained by the first 30 minutes, the rest of the film plodded along.

969,969,4.71,4 April 2023,"I didn't think I would like this movie, based on some of the publicity over the months. However I found it to be a really good, interesting movie, if you can get past the decadence and pervasive foul language, a couple of orgies with ample nudity, some projectile vomiting, plus a few murders and a couple of suicides. I watched it at home on DVD from my public library in two sittings on successive days. Watched that way I did not find it to be too long, there was no unnecessary filler.

Babylon, the city on the Euphrates river in southern Mesopotamia, has a history dating back over 4000 years. But in Christianity, Babylon symbolizes worldliness and evil. It is in this context that the movie's title is meant. The worldliness, decadence, and evil that has been part of Hollywood.

The story starts in the 1920s, as most movies were still silent, but the ""The Jazz Singer"" with Al Jolson was the beginning of the end of silent films. Another movie, ""Singing In The Rain"", also has a prominent role, so the speak, as its story arc is analogous to a love relationship in this movie ""Babylon.""

The movie ends in 1952 as one of the characters from the earlier days visits the studio with his wife and young daughter. Outside, ""Just looking.""

970,970,4.71,31 January 2023,"I'm going to tell you exactly why his film bombed at the box office and why it got a RT score of 45% top critic and 52% verified audience. I am an average movie goer. I read the wiki on why it bombed and it blamed anything from Covid, to winter storm Elliiot, to even calling this a prestige film (it is not.) These are called rationalization, or lies we tell ourselves. If Paramount really believe that, they're going to lose more money. Making $40 mil on an $80 mil budget that required $250 mil to break even, ouch.

First, nobody is really interested in movies from the 1920ish time frame. Only genre that would work from those time must have incredible stories of human triumph over adversities, hardship, etc.... like Titanic (1912), Far and way (1892), etc... and good values. Why? Because when we do think of those days, we subconsciously compare them as the ""good old days"" of moral value, character, etc... to the world today of total hedonism, debauchery, and well... dystopia.

We think of those times as innocent times in comparison to today's depraved world. So Babylon is set in 1920 but it focused on these depravities, people do not want to see that b/c they can see them in the news. The other thing is, people are not really interested in Hollywood. This is besides the point of the anti-Hollywood sentiment these days. Fact is, times are hard, and people look upon celebrities and elites living it up, it is like lemon to a wound.

Then there is the length. Nobody wants to watch a movie that is more than 3 hours unless you can provide great scenery, so they feel like they're traveling from place to place. This is why Lord of the Rings world, b/c they are so immersed into the world of Middle Earth that it didn't feel like a 3 hour movie, but a 3 hour adventure. Now, the subject matter of Babylon is not compatible in this regard. So instead, people feel bored and the movie dragged with pointless drama and dialog. Even those who do enjoy the subject matter get worn out. Think about it, a 30 min to 1 hour Jerry Springer may be entertaining, but 3 hours of it will make anyone sick.

Finally, the main point why this failed. It combination of all that described above, this film like most modern film now, tries to force ""the message"" because... well, it is a film about the celebration of depravity, hedonism, etc... of Hollywood, right? In sense, it comes off like Hollywood boasting of itself, completely out of touch with the average movie goers.

Paramount needs to seriously re-evaluate their command structure, who is green lighting these scripts. Otherwise, expect more box office bombs in the future. You have one job, to provide a movie that audience might actually enjoy, not creating a 3 hour long mess celebrating depravity of your own Hollywood with an ensemble cast of big names and then blame the audience or other rationalizations when you made only $40 mil in a $250 mil even break.","December 23, 2022 (United States)",im going to tell you exactly why his film bombed at the box office and why it got a rt score of top critic and verified audience i am an average movie goer i read the wiki on why it bombed and it blamed anything from covid to winter storm elliiot to even calling this a prestige film it is not these are called rationalization or lies we tell ourselves if paramount really believe that theyre going to lose more money making mil on an mil budget that required mil to break even ouch first nobody is really interested in movies from the ish time frame only genre that would work from those time must have incredible stories of human triumph over adversities hardship etc like titanic far and way etc and good values why because when we do think of those days we subconsciously compare them as the good old days of moral value character etc to the world today of total hedonism debauchery and well dystopia we think of those times as innocent times in comparison to todays depraved world so babylon is set in but it focused on these depravities people do not want to see that bc they can see them in the news the other thing is people are not really interested in hollywood this is besides the point of the antihollywood sentiment these days fact is times are hard and people look upon celebrities and elites living it up it is like lemon to a wound then there is the length nobody wants to watch a movie that is more than hours unless you can provide great scenery so they feel like theyre traveling from place to place this is why lord of the rings world bc they are so immersed into the world of middle earth that it didnt feel like a hour movie but a hour adventure now the subject matter of babylon is not compatible in this regard so instead people feel bored and the movie dragged with pointless drama and dialog even those who do enjoy the subject matter get worn out think about it a min to hour jerry springer may be entertaining but hours of it will make anyone sick finally the main point why this failed it combination of all that described above this film like most modern film now tries to force the message because well it is a film about the celebration of depravity hedonism etc of hollywood right in sense it comes off like hollywood boasting of itself completely out of touch with the average movie goers paramount needs to seriously reevaluate their command structure who is green lighting these scripts otherwise expect more box office bombs in the future you have one job to provide a movie that audience might actually enjoy not creating a hour long mess celebrating depravity of your own hollywood with an ensemble cast of big names and then blame the audience or other rationalizations when you made only mil in a mil even break,NEGATIVE

Not realistically, it uses clichés and exaggerated glamor and starts out feeling like a scene from The Great Gatsby, but with more drugs and nudity. Films are supposed to take you out of reality, as one of the characters mentions early on, and Babylon succeeds at that. It's fun and surprising, and the music is great. It's meta at times, like you're watching a film about a person watching a film that's about a film being made kind of meta. But it's a joy and it's never dull, there are moments that will make you laugh and gasp from the sheer absurdity.

In all the madness there are poignant moments, like when a journalist is telling an old actor that although his time is up he will live on forever through his films. They also squeeze in a love story, if you can call it that. It's bittersweet and frustrating to watch as self destructive behaviours dominate and get in the way of success in love and career time and again. Although everything is exaggerated, it's easy to see how Hollywood encourages the behaviour and I imagine many actors have experienced some things seen in the film.
