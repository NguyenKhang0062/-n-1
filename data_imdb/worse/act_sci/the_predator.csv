4.0,30 May 2020,One step above parody. Without question it's the worst in the franchise.
4.0,18 September 2018,"The 'Predator' film series is a mixed bag, with the best being the 1987 film (a great film on its own) and its follow-up, the only great ones from personal opinion. Was actually really intrigued into seeing 'The Predator', despite hearing numerous bad things about it, and saw it anyway with an open mind. Just to make that clear in answer to the condescending accusations made by those defending the film without taking into account that those who didn't did see the film and simply didn't like it legitimately.

Can totally see why many were disappointed and share a lot of the criticisms directed against it. Didn't think it was that bad and it had its moments and decent assets, a 1-star film 'The Predator' isn't. Although towards the weaker end ranking films from 2018 seen, it is not one of the worst, being better than 'The First Purge' and 'Slender Man'. It's not a good film, hugely disappointing in fact, and has a lot of issues. As a Predator film 'The Predator' is a disgrace, but as a standalone film judged on its own terms it also doesn't work.

Before getting on to the faults, 'The Predator' has good points. It looks good, very slick and atmospheric with some of the effects being great and imposing.

At times, the action is fun and edge of your seat, contributing to the occasional glimpses of tension and excitement lacking elsewhere, with cohesive choreography and spectacular stunts. The film also begins promisingly, zippy in pace and quite thrilling.

When it comes to the predator, it is scary and imposing enough, as are the other creatures and their methods, and the gore does disturb and doesn't feel too gratuitous.

However, Shane Black's direction is constantly wayward and fails to generate much momentum, personality or clarity of storytelling. The character chemistry is not very natural and excepting perhaps Jacob Tremblay the acting doesn't seem very engaged or at ease. The characters are sketchy in development, are very difficult to get behind and their credibility is zero. There is effort to develop them, but through very clumsily written, superficially soap-operatic and blatant exposition that doesn't always feel necessary, adding nothing to the story or characters and failing to intrigue.

On top of that, the story, as well as being slight and at times sluggish, is far too complicated and busy which makes some of the film very hard to follow and at worst incoherent. There is lots of chaos and noise on the surface but no brains or soul underneath, while there is very little tension, suspense or surprises, relying on the action to make the film watchable which it marginally does. The atmosphere generally is bland and doesn't evoke enough scares, not enough to bite the nails anyhow. Nothing memorable about the music and the basic concept doesn't feel that much evolved, having not enough freshness, and it is too forgetful of what made the franchise at its best so great and too cheesy and bland to be a tribute or throwback.

It is the script that comes off the worst and nearly single-handedly brings 'The Predator' down, bad enough to warrant its own paragraph. It is far too talky in the exposition, it rambles often pointlessly and sometimes with not much cohesion, plausibility is as non-existent as the credibility, there is excessive sentimentality in spots and muddled moments and worst of all the over-reliance of humour. Next to none of the humour works which is a massive problem, it is eye-rollingly cheesy and not placed or timed very well too often, also being repetitive and distastefully vulgar.

Overall, not awful but mediocre. 4/10 Bethany Cox"
5.0,11 January 2019,"Predator killer? Franchise killer...then again it died after Predator 2. As an original fan that has got to be the biggest, most disjointed load of tripe l have ever witnessed. I don't want to watch Aliens or Predator as a comedy. It's meant to be an action sci-fi horror. I'm not sure what Shane Black was trying to do here but it was awful and he should never be allowed near the Predator movies again. So much potential to be great but sadly a steaming pile of disappointment."
2.0,17 September 2018,
6.0,25 December 2018,"I went into this movie trying my best to stay objective and take it for what it was. And I enjoyed it as a sci fi action movie, it wasn't bad. No where near as bad as some of the more fanatical fans seem to think it was here.

Acting was good, screenplay was good, pacing was good. Story was actually not that bad neither. Unless someone wanted to try and challenge the original in terms of plot, there's not many options that works, this kinda did work.

If you ignore the more crazy fans that like to bash on anything that's not on par with their own opinions, you'll enjoy this film.

People don't seem to understand that rating 5 out of 10 is ""watchable but not for me."" ratings. Yet there's individuals out there that give perfectly alright movies 2 and 3 stars just because they can't give objective opinions even if their lives depended on it.

But I digress.

The movie was a excellent action movie, a great sci fi movie and a questionable Predator movie. So how should we base the rating then?

7/10 action movie. 7/10 sci fi movie. 5/10 Predator movie.

Final verdict = 6/10"
3.0,21 November 2018,It is a parody of Predator. Don't expect science fiction or story line just a poor action comedy film.
6.0,2 February 2019,"I'd heard nothing but bad things about The Predator, wall to wall hatred and mockery. It was even suggested that it was one of the worst movies of 2018 and comparable with the messy AVP movies. Going in I was forced to have low expectations, and I firmly disagree.

Let's make something clear, I am not saying The Predator is a good film because it simply isn't but worst of 2018? Absolutely not. It's just a badly flawed addition to the franchise yet manages to be oddly loyal at the same time.

So a Predator comes to Earth but this time the government is ready for it. Cue lots of action, blood shed but a pretty wafer thin plot that doesn't exactly go anywhere.

With a stellar cast including Thomas Jane, the stunning Olivia Munn and the excellent Keegan-Michael Key it had no problems on that front. Okay actually I retract that, the leading man Boyd Holbrook is less than impressive and just wasn't up to the task.

With an odd amount of comedy and levity The Predators tone isn't exactly in keeping with the original movies yet manages to solidly feel like a Predator film thanks to the original score and franchise tropes. I loved the first movie, I thought the second was passable and hated the third but this right here is underwhelming yet perfectly watchable despite the lashings of Hollywoodness it has.

Sure it's goofy and badly flawed but I'm not sure exactly what everyone expected. There are certainly a lot of problems with the film, I'd have liked it to be darker, I'd have liked it to be longer and I'd liked the original Predator to have gotten more screentime.

Regardless despite it's many many problems it comes under the category of harmless take your brain out fun.

The Good:

Loyal score

Some great nods to previous movies

Quite a few very funny moments

Decent cast

The Bad:

Lacks elements that should be essential for a Predator movie

Naff ending

Much of the cast feel wasted"
1.0,9 October 2018,
7.0,12 September 2018,"So how many Predator sequels have there been? Not counting the ""vs."" films, it's at least two, all of which have tried to re-work a very basic premise that worked cause it was basic.

Now Shane Black, a screenwriter who has written some of the best action comedies ever, and Iron Man 3, tries to do the same in what amounts to a fun action flick, but a pretty average Predator one.

The plot all concerns a rogue predator who escapes his planet with a stolen object, which other predators on his planet want back. The planet where they all crash land of course is Earth.

Sterling K. Brown is a military official who will stop at nothing to acquire the technology first and Narco's Boydd Holbrooke is a decorated soldier who along with a team of misfits tries to stop him.

This is all taking place after the events of Predator 2. There is even a character played by Jake Busey who is playing the son of the Gary Busey character from that movie.

Black tries to swing for the fences in terms of a new story to tell but it's pretty obvious this movie works best when it's working on the hits. Sometimes you just wanna sit back and watch some gore.

Bodies gets severed, people get thrown across the room and clawed in the face, impaled, heads will roll.

What highlights the fun here even more is Black is a funny director who knows a good laugh when he sees one.

A scene with a severed arm, an ongoing dialogue about why we call the predator ""the predator"" in the first place. Just examples of how Black is very adept at visual comedy and snappy lines.

He's very good with characters too, not so much developing them here but giving them a chemistry that is irreverent lunacy.

Holbrooke and his whole crew, particularly Keegan Michael Key, Thomas Jane, Moonlights Trevante Rhodes kinda reminded me of the A-Team. These guys are total section 8's and I loved each one.

In fact better than the A-Team movie. In fact, i'd like to see Black do an A-Team movie with this cast.

Brown gets some of the best dialogue and Munn is actually quite good here too. Jacob Trembley and Alfie Allen are a bit wasted but the cast is having fun.

There's something off about this movie though and it involves the predators. This movie almost seems like a Sterling K. Brown vs. Holbrooke and his crew movie more than a predator film.

There's no real joy in the hunt cause for the most part they seem to just be making periodic appearances into the story of human vs. human.

In fact this movie actually had to reshoot it's entire third act because of poor test screenings and you can tell because the last act does pull a sharp detour, taking us into the woods for some incognito Predator action.

It almost seems like Black wanted to make this such a new concept that the very nature of why people like the predators in the first place sort of gets lost.

I still contend this is a funny, action-packed flick and I liked the characters too. Even the predator action, when its on screen, is good. Just you may not get enough of them as you might want.

1.0,17 September 2018,
8.0,5 October 2023,"Although this is not along the same lines as the original, it is worth a watch. The acting is good, the plot is ok, but what makes this movie work for me is the humor. I found myself laughing out loud at times. They may have been better off billing this as a horror/comedy. It's not Oscar worthy, but for a Saturday night and some popcorn; it's fine. I actually found this movie more interesting than a lot of the other Predator movies. I assume that some will find some of the humor distasteful, maybe even offensive at times; however, most funny things are vulgar to someone. For those that say the plot is not realistic, surprise-it is about a race of aliens that visit Earth to hunt people as trophies. It is a Sci-fi/horror movie, not a documentary."
7.0,12 January 2021,"I first saw this in a theatre in 2018. Revisited it recently.

This is the fourth in the Predator franchise and it has nothing to do with the previous Adrien Brody one.

This time a U.S. Army Ranger sniper disables a Predator and has parts of its armor sent off by mail to prove the existence of extraterrestrial life thereby putting his son's life in danger. The sniper is aided by a group of PTSD-afflicted soldiers and a scientist, who all team up to fight off Predators and discover their plans for mankind.

This one has lots of action n gory moments, some good character development without sacrificing the pace. It is no doubt an entertaining action flick but Predator movies shud have dark n serious tone. I liked the characters but their jokes were silly.

Looking forward for the fifth one which is set during the Civil War. Hope for some good showdowns.

Can someone tell me how Brackett manages to arrive at the crash site n that too so soon?

Can someone tell me what happens to Lynch? The Predator severs his arm with his shoulder cannon. We don't see him get killed by the Predator, and it's interesting to note that the Predator was originally aiming at his head, then moved to sever his arm. If the Predator didn't kill him.....

The Predator's shoulder cannon is known to cauterize wounds?

The scene at Emily's house - the predator kills the agents but dont kno why it spares Emily. Some may say that Emily wasn't armed but so were the scientists. The main problem here is not the sparing of Emily. It is about the editing. The scene darted off to another one without any explanation."
3.0,6 June 2019,"I guess the main question is why. Why did they make this sequel? Why was the story so bad? Why were the characters so bad? Why did they take a classic movie and dump on it? More importantly, why did I watch it?

Everyone believes they need to put a new spin on things as though movies need an upgrade. Shame on you Shane Black. Yeah, you added more flash, more bang, more action, more everything but it lacked other more important things: quality, character, uniqueness.

They tried to incorporate too many characters, too many fields of expertise, and too many variations of the original. It just ended up being a dismemberment orgy of red and green blood with tons of one-liners, quips, and inept government henchmen. It was terrible.

In an attempt to be bigger, badder, better it came off as a cheap cash grab trying to profit off of the sacred name of a legend. I watched. I didn't pay but I watched. I knew better but I thought just maybe... A guy can wish can't he?"
2.0,23 September 2018,"Completely took the beauty away from this graceful monster. In a nutshell, it's so confused. Is it a marvel film is it a kids film or is it a genre film. The script is horrendous even though I did laugh, but that just made me sad. The characters are just, well pointless. There's zero suspense. There is some good ideas in there but nothing to redeem it. Why are studios so scared to just slow down and make a descent horror film. It's the predator fgs how can you screw this up, And a cgi predator that's just the worst way to go. If your not a fan don't bother if you are a fan definitely don't bother. Very very disappointing."
7.0,16 September 2018,
1.0,11 August 2022,"I'm 35 so too young to have been around when the first films came out, but I've always liked them.

This movie is the first one I've wanted to rewatch, multiple times. Am I dumb enough to find it entertaining? Maybe.

But I genuinely do not get the hate! It's a really fun movie. It's great escapism. It's much more fun than the others, but I suppose it's quite a tonal shift. Maybe that's it?"
6.0,17 September 2018,
1.0,24 November 2018,"Am I the only one that actually enjoyed this movie? Was it even in the same league as the original predator? Hell no. But the special effects were great, the predator looked amazing, the action was entertaining, the acting was okay, majority of the attempts at humour were cringy, and there was little to no tension. BUT I enjoyed it for what it was, a B flick monster popcorn movie. I guess my expectations weren't that high, I knew what I was getting into."
7.0,13 September 2018,"Like everybody else back in 1987, I was really impressed by Predator. It was pretty simple and straightforward movie, but it introduced a pretty neat and unique concept and, well, there was something special about the atmosphere. ""...the jungle... it just came alive and took him."" It was awesome. Unfortunately, sequel suffered from some seriously poor writing, while Aliens versus Predator franchise turned out to be a complete disaster. Everybody knows that and everybody wanted Predator franchise to return to its former glory one day. That's why I had some hope for this one. I seriously did. That's why I bought a ticket and went to see it the day one. I really expected to see a good Predator movie. I mean, there was no way they'll make a bad movie after all those big expectations, right? RIGHT? Well... I was naïve...

Long story short, the new Predator is EXACTLY like AvP. Only worse. Wa-a-ay worse. 999x+ times worse. Remember the first AvP movie? Remember how at the beginning it at least tried to create some atmosphere, but ended up with that girl fighting together with Predator in a very silly way? In this movie it's that exact silly stuff from very beginning and until the very end. It's so silly that it doesn't even feel like a real deal. It feels like a cheap comedy. A parody. A B-movie with AAA budget. The movie tries really hard to be like Deadpool, but the problem is... it shouldn't be like that! I mean, come on! Predator was supposed to be a mix between horror and sci-fi. With deep atmosphere. With suspense and a man versus alien in a brutal battle. Add Deadpool-like jokes about genitals and BOOM! The entire thing is ruined. Just like that. The entire audience laughed through the entire movie, can't argue with that. People like Deadpool's jokes. Not me, but... you know... as long as audience love it... If all you want is some cheap laughs, this movie has them. A lot of them. It's literally MADE of them. The entire movie is, like, one... big... JOKE. My problem, though, is that nobody warned me about the fact that this movie is a parody. It was advertised as a real deal, a big comeback, which turned out to be a cheap parody. Why? I mean... WHY???

Also, unfortunately, jokes are not the only problem here. Even though 2/3 of the movie are just that - dirty jokes. The thing is - the entire writing is bad. The entire IDEA is bad. It feels a lot like E.T., only E.T. is Predator now and kid's father is Ash freakin' Williams.

Talking About Evil Dead. Remember Army of Darkness? That's EXACTLY what this movie tries to achieve. And there are three problems with that. First: Boyd Holbrook is not Bruce Campbell. He doesn't have that thing that allowed Bruce to do his thing. He doesn't have that crazy spark in him. And as the result - his character feels absolutely, completely RIDICULOUS. Second: writers have no clue how to be crazy with style. Evil Dead franchise had that. This movie? Nope. It tries. Hard. Way too hard. But still... nope. And, finally, there was no reason to turn good ol' Predator into the Evil Dead. Evil Dead is good. Predator is good. Mix them together and here comes disaster.

The new Predator is something that may work for you at home, when you're way too drunk at your weekend to enjoy something real. When all you want is something on background with some cheap laughs, while you're eating your pizza and drinking your beer... this movie will do. Like any B-movie. Like Sharknado. But as a proper Predator movie... on big screen... for the full price... It's a disaster. Did I tell you that 3D also sucks and pretty much useless here? No? Well, it is. The new Predator is one of the very rare movies that totally made me regret paying for a ticket. Even as one time movie... it doesn't work. Back in the days, I believed that it's impossible to be worse than AvP. The new Predator proved me wrong. Ladies and gentlemen... here comes the very new bottom for the franchise.

P.S. There's one good thing about all that, though. It makes Predator 2 to look like timeless masterpiece."
1.0,16 September 2018,"Saw the movie last weekend. Was surprised about the bad/unfair reviews therefore decided to leave one of my own. It's an entertaining movie, funny, good acting, no glaring plot holes. Was well worth watching. I did not realize there were so many die heart predator fans. Sounds like they wanted more of the same. This movie isn't your typical predator movie, but in my openion it makes it more not less appealing."
8.0,26 November 2018,Feels like a 12 year old wrote and directed this nonsensical rubbish
6.0,12 September 2018,"Keeping my review and simple because I want you to watch yourself.

The Predator is definitely your typical Shane Black movie filled with typical Shane Black writing. However it is definitely not your typical Predator movie. Whether that's good or bad, it's entirely up to you.

I liked it."

7.0,18 September 2018,"It was like watching a sequel in a franchise when there's been 10 previous films and they were out of ideas. The location was wrong, the characters were wrong, the story was wrong, everything was wrong. It was very childish, every line in the film was trying to be funny. A kid had a major role...really? A kid? I thought I was watching a Disney film. The CGI was terrible, I felt I was watching a cheap TV series. It was funny at some points but it really is a bad film overall. The real Predator looked amazing, great suit and animatronics, but the CGI predahulk was terrible. I was gutted watching this😪😪"
1.0,16 September 2018,"People are far too critical here. The acting was decent for the most part. There were just extremely odd characters. The action, why everyone realistically went to the movie, was pretty good. I for one liked the concept and why does everyone say there's no story? The premise has more story than Predator 2 or Predators. What I didn't like, was some of the cgi and the enhancement of the predator(seen in the trailer - not a spoiler) everyone goes to see predator movies to see a big brooding badass kill people. It delivered in that aspect. The humor was funny and fit well considering the group of misfits. The end, I will admit, I didn't care for. Everyone hates on it, and I ignored it but honestly it wasn't great. It does present room to grow. Personally I think they should scale up the story line with not evolving, but a use of more predators. She can grow the story off of the actions of the first predator in the film which would work very well. Long story short, it is an action film you're expecting and if you've seen the trailer, you know what to expect. Just enjoy it. And they can never make one to live up to the hype of the very first film. The first film was stripped down to mercs fighting an alien. People loved it because it was new. So to make something new for fans, it has to evolve. It makes sense. Just watch the movie."
7.0,17 September 2018,Instead of a predator movie all we got is to see a mediocre action comedy movie with the predator storyline being more of a side play instead of the main act. Less than a sixth ( 1/6 ) of the movie is based around the predator while the whole other parts center more around a bunch of two sentence characters fighting generic villain soldiers. The plot is ridiculous out of point and completely unrealistic. A franchise ruined.
1.0,15 August 2022,"Initially rated this a 5 upon first viewing a few years ago. Watched it again today, trying to judge it more on what it IS and not what it ISN'T.

Enjoyed it, much more than I originally did. Give it another chance!"
7.0,18 May 2020,This movie was made to troll predator fans such as myself. Mission accomplished.
3.0,17 September 2018,"The director, actor and actress they all just ruined the whole series. I prefer Predator 1 and 3 most. They were just awesome. 2 is also good. But this one was holy crap! I prefer ""Adrien Brody"", he suited best after Arnold i will say. The actor and actress all of them were so amateur in their acting."
8.0,16 September 2018,
7.0,13 September 2018,"What a train wreck of a movie!! Absolute garbage. Dumbass story, crap actors, one stupid decision after another, really generic and bad background score. This was disrespectful of the predator franchise. Forget the first two movies (this isn't even on the same continent as far as quality is concerned), even the AVP series was better. And the jokes...OH MY GOD THE JOKES...totally forced and lameass.

Anyone with even a shred of attachment to the legit classic that the first Pred movie was, kindly save yourself the trauma and avoid this one.

Shane black - can you please not direct any movie again? Pretty please?

1.0,16 September 2018,"Listen, don't go into this movie expecting a master piece, cause it isn't, but what it does have is hilariously raunchy humor, gratuitous violence, and action throughout. It's just a movie that's so stupid is fun!! So if you want to be boring and play the critic, be my guess, but if you want to have a hell of a good time, go see this movie"
2.0,27 November 2018,"Seriously, all the sequel Predator movies have been far too silly. There is no real suspense, just schlock. So why not make the best of it ? Dark humour, schlock gore, and Olivia Munn.

Grab a beer and enjoy"
7.0,17 September 2018,It is a parody of a great franchise! I went to see it even though it had horrible reviews and I was very disappointed with this trash! I regret not leaving early and asking for my money back! If you are a Predator/AVP/Predators fan this movie will let you down in a big way!
1.0,23 February 2020,"Not a good film by any stretch. A lot of nonsensical action set pieces that are laughably implausible, strung together by a story that really diminished the groundwork set down in Predator. No one, despite massive amounts of money, seems capable of getting close to the trills, scares, and rich tone of the original film. Doesn't really feel like anyone is trying for more than dollar bills at the boxoffice."
7.0,17 September 2018,Obviously no where near the original but very entertaining
1.0,14 September 2018,
7.0,14 September 2018,It's like Shane Black never saw the original let alone star in it. The film looked cheap and the action was predictable. Probably the worse one out of the franchise. How did he manage to get it so wrong?!!!!
2.0,15 September 2018,I am a lifelong Predator fan and believe he original is one of the best movies ever made. I went into this expecting little after reading the reviews where ppl hated it. Most of these people wanted a remake of the original. That is not what this movie is. This was a fun romp. Fred Dekker was involved in creating this (he brought us Monster Squad and Night Of The Creeps... which were both classic horror/comedies from the 80s) so the humor was no surprise. The gore/body count was ample too. The thing that made this even more enjoyable imo was the characters were great. I wanted them to survrive and felt the main characters were not just kill-fodder and the lead character dudna great job. Sure the cgi wasnt the best and the ending (the last 5 minutes after the movie is wrapped up) was pretty stupid but that didnt take away from what I felt was a fun time. If you want the original just keep watching that. I liked this and will watch again. You can do much worse with your time. Dont take everything so seriosuly. Its a movie about aliens!!!
8.0,10 November 2019,"Having written and directed 1986 horror classic Night of the Creeps, Fred Dekker teamed up with Shane Black the following year to give us enjoyable kids monster movie The Monster Squad. Black would go on to write action classics Lethal Weapon, The Last Boy Scout, and The Long Kiss Goodnight. With these guys behind this reboot of the Predator franchise, I figured fans were in for a real treat.

How could I be so wrong? The Predator is an insult to the brilliant Arnie original and easily the worst film in the series so far (and quite possibly the worst mainstream movie I have seen this decade). The film starts off bad, and goes downhill from there.

Fashion model Boyd Holbrook is the star, playing decorated sniper Quinn McKenna, who witnesses the crash-landing of a predator spacecraft. The authorities hush up the incident, capturing McKenna and labelling him as mentally unstable. However, before he is apprehended, the soldier manages to send proof of the predator's existence - the alien's mask and gauntlet - to his autistic son Rory (Jacob Tremblay). As McKenna is shipped off to a secure facility in the company of several other 'crazies', the predator escapes from the lab where scientists have been studying it, and goes in search of its missing equipment...

So what's so bad about this film, I hear you ask? How long have you got?

Not only do we get a pretty boy protagonist, there's the now obligatory feisty female (Olivia Munn as boffin Casey Brackett), that irritating kid (whose autism allows him to operate the alien tech), a comedy relief character with Tourettes (how funny!), and a CGI super predator with his digital space-dogs. Instead of testosterone fuelled action and tense sci-fi horror, the terrible script prefers to play the whole thing for laughs, but it simply isn't funny. Oh, and there's CGI blood. To be honest, it's hard to pick the worst thing about the film - there's simply so much to choose from - but the accidentally lobotomised predator dog that likes to play fetch has to be a contender, as well as the ridiculous scene that sees McKenna and friends standing on the hull of the predator ship as it tries to leave Earth.

About the only positive to come out of this mess is that, when they make the next inevitable film (after a reasonable gap, so that people will forget how bad this was), the only way is up."
6.0,12 September 2018,"I saw this movie at an advanced screening on 9/10/18. I would say this movie was passable for what it was, an action movie. The violence was pleasant, as were the call backs to the past movies. What I did not enjoy was the humor. I normally love Keegan-Michael Key, but his jokes weren't funny, nor were any other jokes in the movie. I guess if you find yo momma jokes, curse words, and the word, ""pussy"" funny then you might have a different opinion than me. My big mistake going into this movie was expecting it to be like the original Predator. That move was suspenseful and filled the audience with anxiety and fear. This was just a fun action romp."
1.0,13 September 2018,"So I am a massive predator fan and I had eagerly booked tickets weeks ago to see this movie opening night. I cannot explain how disappointing this film is. This films forgets what these movies are supposed to be about , there is no intensity or suspense it's all slap stick comedy and poor CGI. I get all the movies can't be alike and they had to go somewhere different but this is a train wreck. Worst of all ,it's likely there will be a sequel to this horror show.

If you're a huge predator fan like me, refrain from paying to see this movieand just wait until it goes on TV!

A film should not have more headshaking moments ( with how crap the movie is ) than actual enjoyable moments! To sum up, It's that bad it's worse than AVP2- literally.

1.0,14 September 2018,"I'm writing this review simply because I am tired of nerds scoring down perfectly good movies because they are different from the original or don't Follow the folk lore to a tee.

This movie is a very enjoyable action romp, great action sequences, loads of gory violence and very very funny.

Is it a typical Predator film no it's 2018, this film isn't an 80's action movie. It doesn't have an in his prime Arnie, a rather hench looking Apollo Creed and it doesn't have Jesse Ventura or any of the other 80's badasses in it.

What it does have is a very fast moving, funny and very enjoyable story that is executed well.

I enjoyed this movie a lot and was not bored for a second in the theatre. What I would suggest is unless you're desperate for a carbon copy of the 80's one or you are a Predator comic book nerd ignore these bad reviews and go in with an open mind and you will enjoy it!!"
6.0,24 November 2019,"Being a big fan of the original film, all subsequent iterations have been mediocre at best, but generally poor. In some ways this film didn't disappoint. If you wanted to be brutal you could tear it a new one every ten minutes, but if you tease the cork out a little what you end up with is a reasonable action flick.

3.0,12 September 2018,"The Predator - One of my most anticipated movies of this year and it didn't disappoint while also subverting my expectations. All the stuff involving the Predators is badass as expected, loads of blood and gore (seriously loads, it's insanely cool), awesome kills and wicked gadgets. The film is also one of the funniest I've seen this year, if you like Shane Black's writing you'll like it, the jokes (even the 'mum' ones) basically always land, there are witty and some not-for-the-easily-offended jokes constantly being chucked around which also basically all land. Even The Predator itself gets one of the biggest laughs. Also surprising amount of character development and backstory. The only main issue I have is the editing, it's obvious where they re-shot and cut around the film and the ending scenes feels very tacked on and some jokes are bit awkward and badly timed. Overall it's entertaining as hell and a throwback to old school action movies and defo worth watching."
7.0,17 September 2018,"Normally I can find at least something good about a movie...not so with this POS. Literally this is like 4 or 5 movie ideas stuffed into one incoherent movie that just doesn't end. I feel terrible for Oliva Munn, wow, just wow, fire your agent. This is a train wreck of epic proportions and does not even live up to either AVP, which should tell you all you need. The bolt on ending which I know if from the books feels just awful. How can such a simple concept be so difficult to deliver for this franchise. Seriously The MEG is better."
1.0,14 September 2018,"This movie may not be perfect but it's what the franchise needed. As far as lore goes it adds to the predator universe in a positive way. You couldn't have a had another predator chasing soldiers around in the jungle. Everyone would have cracked it at how it wasn't original and it ripped off the first movie. There was enough homage the the first and even second to make it feel like a sequel even after all these years. But other than the few references was entirely it's own movie.

Sure some of the CGI seemed a bit off at times but its certainly more ambitious than previous installments into the franchise. But for the times more practical special effects were used it nailed it. The fugitive predator especially.

The humors there but no worse than any marvel or transformers movie. It could have been dulled down to suit the tone of the movie but it doesn't ruin it and sometimes even gets a laugh. I'm happy it dosen't tone down the violence or the language but it seemed to throw the f bomb into ever sentence even it really didn't need it and come across forced.

This predator really isn't as bad as some of the stupid 1 star reviews make out. It's an action packed popcorn movie that's worth a watch. If you wanted a remake of the original your out of luck, but it's certainly taking a leap in the right direction and if they decided to make the planned sequels hopefully they come out more polished."

Man, just EVERYTHING. The script is delusional, I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS SCRIPT WAS GREENLIGHTED. We are treated to a string of set pieces in ""a tour de force"" of nonsense, being the next scene impossibly even more stupid than the previous one.

8.0,17 September 2018,"Truly this is a disgrace to the franchise. Even if I was not a Predator fan, I would still call this movie a garbage, because this is what it was - regardless if it is a Predator movie or not. The fact that it is situated in the Predator universe only makes things worse, because it makes a parody out of a beloved character and franchise. I had low expectations after the trailers, but after watching the movie I was speachless of the idiotic characters, absurd dialogue and nonsensical script. Sorry for the overwhelming hate, I don't usually do this, but this is clearly not only the worst Predator movie (yes, it is worse even than AvP: Requem), but it is a bad sci-fi movie and it is comparable to ridiculous titles such as Sharknado or alike. Shane Black, how could you?"
6.0,24 November 2018,"Okay so I'm not the biggest Predatorfan. I have seen all the movies (apart from the AVP ones) and I can say that I really like the first one, the second is just meh I think and Predators is actually a solid entertaining movie that brought us something new. I wasn't excited for this movie, I knew it was coming and I was probably going to see it but was I waiting in full anticipation like a true fanboy? No. Then the movie came out and wow did it get bashed by audiences and critics all togheter. Everyone said it was a hugely dissapointing movie. Now that I've seen it, I can understand why.

Let's start with the positives. I do like that they referenced the first movies, they didn't pull an AVP alternate universe on us. The references are brief, making it clear that they really wanted to make a stand alone film, which I am all for. The characters are mostly good, I really like the protagonist as the big action hero and most of his teammates are a fun presence. They also made this movie rated R, now if there's something which I despise about current cinema, it's that everything has to be PG-13, all because of money. This movie actually has some guts and quite literally shows us them. There are some really entertaining deaths and it was just satisfying overall to see that they wanted to make it as violent as the first one, because let's be honest, we all went into this movie wanting to be entertaind.

Alright now we are into the bad... Let's get the big one out of the way first: the comedy. Now I knew going into this movie that it was going to be a comedy, and knowing that I could deal with it, most of the jokes were actually pretty funny I thought, but by making this decision they really ruined all of their potential in making this a good Predator movie. Suspense? None of it. Atmosphere? None of it. Compelling characters who we care for? A couple yes but mostly they are all expendable. Let's talk about those other characters. There's a female scientist who has a huge role in this movie. Why? I don't know, she's just there be scientific and a ""cool female character"" I guess (this is not how you write good female action characters guys...), there's also a young boy who also has a big role...and he's pretty annoying. He's suposed to be this very intelligent boy who has no friends etc, you all know the cliché, so at least you could make him likeable? Nope, they didn't do that either. There are also evil human characters of course (because we really needed those), and they are there to be evil, yup that's pretty much it. When it comes to characters, it really all comes down to the protagonist and his teammates. The predators are cool yes, we have a couple of new designs now, and while I like that they keep on expanding the predators' possibilities, in the end they did nothing with it, you'll see. Last but not least, this movie ends...yup you guessed it, with a set-up for a sequel. Could someone please explain to me why every succesful movie has to be remade, rebooted and most of all, be turned into a franchise? It's all about money these days, and as a result the passion is gone, the feel is gone, the atmosphere is gone, everyone is just trying to make everything like the MCU and everyone is failing.

Guys, in the end, this is a descent movie if you view it as an entertaining action comedy you can watch with some friends and have fun, but that's it. They just keep on remaking every great movie from pre 2000 and turning them into cash grabbing conveyor belt products.

I give it a deserved 5.6/10"
1.0,18 September 2018,"The entire movie is a joke of itself and goes completely off the rails from the original movies.

The predator franchise is supposed to dictate a dark gritty and suspense filled sci-fi Horror/Thriller.

Instead it was a comedy filled with cheap laughs, jokes and gaffs.

It had a confusing mix of music from the 1st and 2nd predator films which was thrown in as cheap padding, the story line was terrible and unfulfilling.

How the writers and directors thought this was passable and had any respect for the original films is beyond me.

This has damaged the Franchise beyond measure and it will be a long time before anyone can pick this up again and make something worthy."
1.0,15 September 2018,"The Predator wastes no time getting straight to the point: mindless action, violence, gore, swearing, and immature humor. Mix this with good to great performances and some wonky editing and pacing, and you get a perfectly serviceable late summer action film. I very much enjoy the Predator franchise, but I woudnt label myself a die-hard fan, but I did have a blast in the theatre. Constant one liners and gory violence moved things along at a ""usually"" good pace. The final 30 min are cleaely affected by the reshoots as they lack the previous two acts tight pacing and plot. Those looking for a deep, dark suspenseful horror/thriller should seek out the older Predator film or different films in general. I see many reviews or people going into this film expecting near Oscar notifications, DON'T. Go in with a free mind and enjoy the bloody violence."

The movie goes along on a pretty fast pace and manages to give a bit of homage to the original 2 entries while adding a bit of fun and creativity into the Franchise.

It's very disappointing because I am one of the biggest fans of the original film. I have watched the original at least 50 times in my lifetime. I didn't go in expecting it to live up to the original because I am pretty sure that will never be accomplished. What I did expect was to at least be entertained, which other than laughing at the atrocious dialogue, predictable actions, Star Wars ripoff film score, incredibly stupid Predator characters and overall terrible aspects of the film, it was very far from entertaining. It in fact was painful to watch. The editing in this movie is maybe the worst ever done. Scenes stretch for what feels like forever and they easily could have been cut. It is confusing to think that Shane Black co-wrote and directed this movie. It felt like a Sci-Fi Channel movie you watch to laugh at. I am still wrapping my head around how bad it was. I normally am not this negative when reviewing films I watch... but this one is definitely an exception. Viewer beware!"

It's a chuffing predator movie! They've all been pap since the first. This is the the right style for the franchise, in my opinion.

Fanboys hush your vile poisonous negativity and take each other's phalluses out your respective mouths"
8.0,25 September 2018,"'The Predator' is pure fan service for 80s moviegoers.

It's everything you knew it WOULD be and nothing you imagined it COULD be. It delivers what is expected in hefty doses, but it fails to become anything of greater substance. It's amusing and violent and funny, but it is also ultimately empty and forgettable.

There's a joke a minute, and at times the movie seems more concerned with one-liners than actually constructing a coherent story. To be fair, many of the jokes do land, but they do so in a way that meanders from what matters in each scene, so they end up serving as distractions. Much of the film consists of loud, violent (and a share of humorous) distractions that certainly entertain but don't do much else. And maybe that's all director Shane Black was looking to make-a fun, disposable movie that fans will forget shortly after leaving the theater.

Black clearly wasn't attempting to make something that he wanted to be taken seriously. It's too silly for that. There are mountains of both intentional and unintentional comedy littered throughout. At times, it's difficult to tell which is happening. The special effects are laughably bad in certain instances, but maybe that was a nod to the original? Again, it's difficult to tell.

There's also an outrageous claim about the next step of human evolution that is simply passed off as plausible even though it is the exact opposite of plausible.

I haven't even mentioned the plot yet because it's hardly relevant. But here's the gist: a group of soldiers encounter a predator on Earth, and it kills everyone except the one truly excellent soldier, who subsequently steals the predator's gear. An accidental misuse of the gear signals another predator to come to Earth. So now we have two. And the second one is a BEAST. Predator 2.0. Then yada yada, the humans fight the predators and what not.

The plot doesn't matter much. This is about the spectacle. The spectacle puts on a decent show, but it's not nearly as impressive as it needs to be. So, ultimately, you'll walk away with an empty feeling, wishing this movie had tried to do more."

This movie delivers on just that, and on what made the original fun and unique! Why is it not great? It rests its hat on a fairly simple plot, great action and a formulaic build up. The characters are formulaic, until we meet the Loonies, then we get this great rainbow of crazy and well, its fun!

If you like Aliens, Predator and what made 80's action movies iconic, then this is for you. The comedy had the theater bursting out multiple times, some people WILL find the jokes distasteful and politically incorrect but ask a comic if he's met anyone who found his jokes offensive? Better yet, ask The Predator's critics. That's usually the hallmark of a great joke, to reflect how insane we can be as a whole and turn it on its head, reflect it back to us, and ask us to laugh at the ridiculousness. So in that, The Predator, invites you, to get away from the seriously dire need for thought and existential questions and simply asks, will you laugh at the ridiculousness with us? Rated R for RIDICULOUSNESS."

7.0,7 June 2019,"The hopes were high for this latest Predator rebirth, not because Shane Black starred in the great first Predator film, so therefore he surely must care about the project? But because he's an excellent writer and director. Shane Black can count Lethal Weapon(S), The Last Boy Scout and The Long Kiss Goodnight on his CV, he was the man who put Iron Man back on track after the sag of part 2. Plus he is the creator of two of the best buddy buddy neo-noirs this millennium (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang/The Nice Guys), So how come The Predator stinks of lazy cash cow manure?

Plot in a nutshell sees the universe's most lethal hunters unleashed on Earth due to the meddling of a soldiers kid and some nosey scientist types. The fate of mankind rests with a group of damaged ex-soldiers and a rather cheesed off female scientist.

We have a rehash mishmash of what we have seen before in Predator 87 and Predators 2010. A group dynamic fighting a seemingly invincible foe. The subsequent science aspects such as human DNA inference/reasoning etc never really add up to much, serving only for a bunch of standard actors shouting, swearing and spouting hopelessly weak jokes and series re-treads. When you think the pic is about to up a gear, get rivetingly dramatic, a poor slice of humour comes our way either by vocal spillage or visual drivel (puppy pet Predator dog, really?). There's a bunch of plot threads that just dangle never to be pulled (PTSD/our hero's family strife et al), and the Predators loose on Earth - with different agendas - are confusingly shifted about by a screenplay not sure where it wants to land.

Plus points? Well the cinematography is superb (Larry Fong), and you can't fault this for action quotas, there's plenty of it and it's bloody (both red and green type). The score is the traditional one we had from Alan Silvestri back in the 87 film, in fact it hardly deviates from it and yet Henry Jackman gets the credit. Of course some of the jokes will work for some folk (I would be lying if I said a Whoopi Goldberg gag didn't make me laugh), but the terror has gone, these Predators are no longer scary creatures. This reeks of a troubled production going hand in hand with a cash cow that not only narratively adds up to nothing really, but of a franchise death knell. Shame. 3.5/10"

In the end I found it not only watchable, but I am fairly sure I would watch it again. It is a huge divergence from the norm of the franchise, but maybe that is a good thing.

1.0,2 December 2018,"In 1987, Arnold Schwarzenegger was the lead actor of the engaging and original action-sci-fi film ""Predator"". Along the years, poor sequels, remakes and films were made using the alien hunter warrior predator.

In ""The Predator"", the use of this being by the cinema industry reaches its bottom, with a film that is the ""perfect"" combination of terrible screenplay and awful characters. The lead character is an autistic boy, who is smarter than a team of skilled scientists as if it were a Disney movie. His father and his fellow soldiers and their opponents are also awful characters. But maybe the doctor scientist that looks like Rambo is the most ridiculous one. The special effect may have improved, what is questionable, but the storyline is lame. My vote is three.

It's not the most impressive cgi or storytelling I have ever seen. If you have some time to kill it is very entertaining fun. In my opinion a boring movie is the absolute worst! Here I wasn't bored at all.

Sure there are some holes and sudden plot twists that may seem like coming out of nowhere but those are things that I expect to see in an action/sci-fi where I do not expect to have a meticulous plot. I hope it does well in the box office to get a sequel going.

I'm mainly writing this review so that this title does not get flooded by all those 1s and 2s from people who loved the original and cursing this film to not follow the plot of the original and subsequent sequels. I only evaluate this film based on if it is enjoyable with good action sequence and likable characters.

It has a good amount of humor and some good action sequence. Yes I second that some of the combat scenes with the hunter Predator is unbelievable since the original film it took a team of highly trained elite force to take on the ordinary Predator. Yet that kind of ordinary Predator gets defeated by the hunter Predator like a 5 year old kid vs an adult.

2.0,13 September 2018,The Whole movie feels like bits and pieces stitched together to complete a film. Movie lacks the strong script and holding the story together. Actors are trying to be macho and humourous but fail stupendously just like movie direction. very disappointed as expectations were quite high and it couldn't deliver bare minimum. One star as can't go lower than that.
7.0,12 September 2018,"Since the original film I don't think any of the following films (AVP films included) have captured the fun/action/horror of Predator. However the combination of a great cast (Thomas Jane being brilliant as the Tourette's riddled vet), a surprisingly funny script thanks to Shane Black and the gore of the original really brings this one up there with the first film. Jacob Tremblay is also a stand out in the cast and actually brings a bit of emotion to the film, add on top of that characters that you actually don't want to die ( a rare thing in movies nowadays, especially horror) and you find yourself on the edge of your seat hoping that no one gets the chop. The film is not perfect however, one of my main criticisms of the film would be how rushed the final 20 minutes feel, and how certain characters seem to get killed off in a blink and you'll miss it scene, but end at the end of the day I really enjoyed this film and I hope Shane Black comes back to this series to carry on the Predator legacy!"

7.0,13 September 2018,"The Predator franchise has seen a tumultous journey to Black's newest instalment, with the original retaining its reputation as the best. Besides this, only Robert Rodriguez's 'Predators' is considered to be of a similar quality. Wheres these films were originally considered action-horror films, Black's new interpretation, whilst vastly different, proves a worthy addition, and hopeful defibrillator, to this otherwise dead franchise. Many have commented on the shortcomings of 'The Predator', claiming its comedic tone to be a bastardisation of what the original stood for. Whilst this may be a valid comment for die-hard fans of the original, one must remember that this is a 2018 Predator film. Gone are the days of 80's machismo and campy over-the-top action. We live in a cinematic landscape where every other film is injected with off-the-cuff humour, whether it be appropriate or not, inspired by the success of the MCU. In this case, it works. The R-rating allows for savagely funny comedy, aided by the inclusion of Keegan Michale Key and Thomas Jane, to match the brutality of the on-screen violence, which lacks the unconventionality Black previously deployed in 'The Nice Guys' and 'Iron Man 3', but reverts to its roots with indulgent, crowd-pleasing gore. The characters retain the series trope of being overtly shallow, but plainly serve as reminders that this series has never accommodated depth, simply prey for its titular star, which shines here above all iterations since the original. The narrative is laid thin, once again a servant to the graphic panache of its main antagonist, with the ending proving an unusual and seemingly rushed conclusion. Furthermore, the score, heavily reminiscent of the originals, contributes a level of nostalgia, which, alongside the reinvigorated visuals and tone, cements this as a Predator film for modern audiences, taking the action-heavy, mindless focus of the original and thrusting it into the 21st century. 'The Predator' is a ridiculously enjoyable action film that proves a direct descendant of the original, borrowing its shallow characters and plot to highlight the grandeur of the creature that made the series such a pop-culture staple. Black understands the advantages and allure of the property, and unapologetically utilises them to create his modern Predator film."

The predator is one of the worst films I have seen and will never watch again.

Pretty sure this film got torn to shreds in the editing room as the story makes no sense and it jumps nonsensicaly from one scene to the next.

We want to see a film about a predator hunting people but they tag a crappy version of this right at the end.

Humour falls flat, CGI is awful, no character depth, big predator and predator dogs are a big disappointment.

Shame on Shane Black for getting this so, so wrong. Avoid!!"
3.0,15 September 2018,After watching the trailer I really didn't expect much from this - I was really surprised. It was never going to be as good as the first 2 films but it was a fun little romp. The chemistry between the loonies was great and some of the other members of the cast were also alright. If one thing let it down it was the stupid bit at the end. If you've got a cinema near you that charges £4 a ticket it's well worth a watch.
7.0,13 September 2018,"Bad storyline, cheesy acting, commical, does not make sense and a big let down for all the Predator fans."
1.0,15 September 2018,"The Predator: In a homage to the original the film opens with a Special Forces Sniper team in a Mexican jungle targeting drug cartel gangsters. Their mission is rudely interrupted by a crashing Predator Starship which has impacted with a satellite. The Predator kills two of the the team but Captain Quinn McKenna (Boyd Holbrook) acquires some of it's equipment and disables it. Then the Men In Black (MIB) appear (though their tactical uniforms are dark blue) and McKenna makes off, posting a Predator helmet and armlet to to a PO box. Back in the US attempts are made to portray Quinn as being insane and he is put in a bus with five other military personal suffering from PTSD.

Casey Bracket (Olivia Munn) is a biologist who is called in to examine the captured Predator and Quinn's bus is diverted to a MIB base for interrogation. Meanwhile a large Predator Craft arrives and attacks the MIB base. In the confusion the Predator escapes. We see how ruthless the MIB are and Casey joins up with Quinn and the five loopers (self-described) to hunt down the Predator. Things are complicated as the helmet and armlet were delivered to Quinn's home and his Autistic hyper-intelligent son (Jacob Tremlay) has made them operational, they cam now be tracked by both aliens.

We get not just your usual Predator but also a eleven foot tall specimen who has the alien equivalent of bloodhounds. He is in competition with the other Predator to track down not just the helmet but other artifacts and a crashed Starship in Georgia. Plenty of humans are torn to pieces, decapitated and have their throats ripped out by the aliens. Quinn and his group also have to engage in savage battles with the MIB led by Traeger (Sterling K. Brown) who will kill anyone to keep the existence of Predators secret. Naturally they also want the artifacts.

A tale of Alien hunters in conflict with each other counterposed by the two sets of humans in a four-way battle. A cross between Catch-22, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest and the original two Predator films. Directed and co-written by Shane Black this is an effective Science Fiction/Horror film which continues the Predator legacy and is leavened by a dark vein of humour. 8/10."
6.0,16 September 2018,"What's bad... This film does appear to be a little rushed at times and seemed a little too short. The comedy element had to be in there due to the nature of the cast, however there was a little too much of this & it took away the suspense. It would have been good to see the non-hybrid Predator work alongside the humans & for it to have put up more of a fight against the mega predator.

What's good... Although it could have been a lot better this film is still worth a watch. It had a well put together cast & had solid acting throughout. The action sequences were good and the mega Predator looked amazing. Some of the ideas behind it were quite original an added to the myth of the Predator.

What's next... I hope they make more predator movies because lets face it the Predator character is ace. However the directors, producers & writers NEED to listen to the fans and not just inject their own ideas in to make movies. Just imagine what a Predator film would be like based upon what the fans actually wanted from the franchise!

Thanks for reading my review."

3.0,12 July 2024,"And let's just jump straight to Prey and watch it repeatedly.

I still need 536 required characters so let's elaborate and say we really really need to pretend this never really happened.

If you have watched the other Predator movies, then what you will witness here is a total destruction of the franchise, with bad taste, bad script, ridiculous story, and an unbearable kid who saves the world.

I still have 220 characters to go so I will speak of Prey. What a wonderful movie that came to save the day, and restore peace in the predator world! It was a debt owed to the predator fandom.

All the copies of The Predator should be hidden and destroyed, buried in the desert, deleted from every platform or database, and let's just forget this heresy ever took place.

Even Alien vs Predator Requiem is better than this POS.

It seems the writers, producers and director hated the franchise so much that they wanted to denigrate it to a limit, and this movie was the result. Thankfully, it wasn't effective and it couldn't kill the franchises.

I forgot what I was talking about. It must be a movie that never existed. So, about Prey, have you noticed how wonderful it is that the gun she gets to her tribe at the end is the same the Predator hands to Danny Glover in Predator 2? Meaning (possibly) that more predators came and killed Naru's tribe and took the gun as a souvenir.

The dog is so cool, too."

The stronger female character who also sucks, but is much better, does very little other than know everything better than him all the time and never have a time to shine. Her character sucks, he sucks, this movie was awful. I really want to know who thought that this would be a good movie concept given that Predator had a very strong recognition as a brand that put faulty people against an ultimately strong opponent who would make them have to face their best selves in order to possibly defeat it."

It is hard to describe how bad this was, because I still cannot believe it. It was a jumbled mess with no good parts. The dialogue was corny, the plot was painfully bad and silly, and there were no good actors. Anyone involved with this film should be ashamed. Oh and the alien dogs, they made me cringe every time they appeared. Luckily I paid less than $2 for it since I have the AMC A-List pass, but I still feel like I over-paid."

The cast was enjoyable, it was surprisingly funny and the action and gore were great. Obviously it's not going to top the original but I genuinely think this ties with Predator 2 for my second favorite Predator movie. I can understand why some fans dislike it though, The Predator is much more action oriented and less horror than the original and there are some changes in the lore not every fan may like. Personally though, I recommend it."
1.0,14 September 2018,"The Predator starts off as a fun Sci-fi action movie, but then unfortunately gets lost along the way. Which is a shame because fans on the original 2 movies (huge fan here) got a taste of what could off been.

I'm sure Shane Black and Fred Dekker did their utmost to tell an entertaining story. But with re-shoots and a rumored 360 changes to the film's third act, perhaps The Predator was always facing an uphill battle.

The chemistry between the main group of heroes is great, there's some fun and laugh out loud moments which suit the 'fun' nature of the film, which is where this story goes rather than the darker aspect of the first 2 movies.

The downside of this is, after watching the film yesterday, I can't really remember any of the names! 3 characters stand out. McKenna, his son, and Traeger (played brilliantly by Sterling K Brown - deserved more screen time)

Other than their little quips and oddly placed one liners, There was no connection there. Where as in the original and it's sequel the characters were memorable, as they all had their part to play in the story and when they did meet their end, I rooted for the hero even more.

I generally think the final act suffered greatly from the re-shoots and script changes. It felt rushed, and went in a different direction than what had been setup in the beginning. A shame.

Good action. Black's one liners are there too. Sadly let down by the muddled third act. 7/10"

1.0,13 September 2018,"I love the first two predator films and have seen them both many times. The third film 'Predators' had its moments but is not a good film and now we have Shane Black (the Nice Guys, Iron Man 3) trying to rejuvenate the franchise with this fourth entry. Black would seem to many like the man for the job as he was on screen in the original and proved to the numbers guys that he can turn a profit with a tent pole like Iron Man 3. However despite loving his last film ""The Nice Guys"", I had my doubts that his more comedic sensibilities would jive with a franchise that despite what other faults any of the three previous chapters might have had, has always taken itself seriously. My doubts were realized by the film being a very unserious tonal mess. To be fair at the start I decided to just go along with the ridiculousness of the film and actually had fun watching the first third of the film despite no characters being fleshed out, not being very well made with poor effects. However the terrible choices kept adding up and made the rest of the film a chore. The film has way too many characters and way too much universe building style story elements and absolutely none of them are good. Most of the cast are fine and do well enough with what they have to work with but the leading man is very bland and Olivia Mann is very miscast. The Predator creature through the first half of the film is done practically like he has been in the previous films and looks good but the super-predator who arrives later in the film is done with cgi and looked awful and basically suck really bad. Not only that but they team him up with one of the worst parts of the previous chapter, the predator-dogs, who are terribly rendered and are just a bad idea from the get go. In the end you have a film that was planned to reinvigorate the franchise and tries to set you up for more films but gives you a total mess of bad ideas, bad effects, bad action, some ok gore with a few laughs in a film that looks like a B film from the 90's. Also the post climax tag is embarrassingly awful... I doubt we will see another Predator film anytime soon. 3.5/10"
2.0,15 September 2018,"Shane Black (director/writer) and Fred Dekker (writer) wrote a film about as exciting as a power drill. This is by far the worst Predator film I've seen, and it's a shame it will be a smudge on some of the all star cast, as even they couldn't save this. From the opening scene into the first 5 mins, I knew the writing was sloppy and convoluted. Plot issues everywhere. And the lame humor... I'm a huge fan of Keegan-Michael Key, and maybe they cast him for the humor, but even he couldn't make the lame comedic writing funny, never mind the rest of the cast and their one liners. The score sounded like a 5th grade production. The directing and editing was sloppy, but what do you expect when one of the original Pred actors decides to write and direct. No wonder Arnold turned down the role unless the script was re-written. They should have chosen a different name for this film and changed up the alien costumes to have avoided the failure and embarrassment calling it The Predator and insulting the franchise. A very generous 6/10 out of sympathy for the all star cast wasting their talents due to a lousy director and writer(s)."

The Nice Guys is highly underrated and somehow never got any recognition come awards season, I've always heard great things about Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, and hell, I even like Iron Man 3 to a certain extent. However, The Predator is perhaps the biggest farce of a mainstream ""blockbuster"" this year. Not only does the outside of the film issues give the ""The Predator"" name an unsettlingly cringey vibe, but the film is just not good. It's just not good. The characters are written poorly and even at times borderline offensive, the plot hardly ever makes complete sense, and Black's direction is nothing more than sub-par. Why did I have to watch Sterling K. Brown chew gum in every scene, in every shot, and every single thing he said on camera? Or how about the fact that they introduced Olivia Munn's character to The Predator by saying ""would you like to meet a predator?"". After what happened, why in the world you keep that line in the film?

Six words to describe it would be poor, convoluted, messy, chaotic, messy and strange in a bad way. The movie is obsessed with quibs and one liners. It feels like a funny, cringey and CGI fest Predator movie with no cohesive narrative that was stitched together scenes after scenes that doesn't make any sense.

2.0,4 December 2018,"1987 spawned a new icon, the predator. The flick was a blast and created a lot of crap afterwards. The wildest dream was that the predator would fight against alien. AvP remember. Not what we hoped for as did the others that followed. Predators (2010) was okay but 8 years later we have this one.

Starts off pretty good but once the soldier swallows a thing from the predator that makes him go invisible made me already think, OMG. And when a child comes in to solve the puzzles this quickly turns into some kind of Disney predator.

What do makes it worth seeing are the battles against the creature. Messy and bloody and even gory, but again, sadly all CGI what turns it down again.

Putting in a crazy bunch of soldiers with jokes and all turns it completely away from the horror Sci-Fy genre. With the child they are picking in on the succes of Stranger Things of course but some scene's are really unbelievable and even a bit over the top to make this a mediocre flick. Predators and spacedogs working together? Predator making human moves with his finger? I don't know. If you never have seen an entry in this franchise you can pick it up but like with so many franchises see th efirts one to understand what's it all about and what makes it great.

1.0,10 June 2023,
8.0,15 September 2018,"If you enjoy looking at your phone during an entire movie, this is the movie for you.

From it's opening minute, The Predator isn't interested in the suspense or atmospheric jungle build-up that made the original film the all-time action classic that it is. To wit - Predators are immediately shown on screen, fighting in space, before one crash lands on Earth - conveniently mere metres from a hostage/sniper operation. From there, a soldier investigates, and within moments has stolen some Predator tech and mailed it back home to his ex-wife and child in the suburbs.

Sound legit?

And so begins this rollercoaster of implausible action, confusing scene cuts, internal leaps of logic, and witless coincidences that will only feel acceptable if you were a cast member of this film and stand to profit from it.

Don't bother even trying to suspend your disbelief. Held beside earlier films, this is a film of leasts and mosts:


At one point, Olivia Munn's ""character"" is introduced by being taken by agents to a secure compound. Once there, her arrival coincidences precisely with the moment when decades of government research into Predators, descends into chaos. And in seconds, she tranforms from University Professor to gun-wielding commando.

Shane Black ought to be ashamed of this garbage. The film is packed with snappy lines, but how can an original cast member of Predator be so utterly clueless as to the structure and tension which made the original film a success? Or why it's enduring appeal still gave him the opportunity (30 years later) to make yet another sequel?

""The Predator"" is a Marvel-ized atrocity of a once-beloved sci-fi suspense franchise, edited by and for people with Attention Deficit Disorder. This is the final death-knell of this franchise for fans like me. A film so overblown and childish, I wouldn't even download it for free.

No matter what they release after this, I won't be watching. Well done everyone.

The best way to describe the problem is to say - if you look away from the screen for 3 seconds then you have no idea what's going on or who died (the who died then) is still reeling in my brain and I still have no idea. You'll seriously watch this not having a clue what's gone on, you'll just remember that something did happen and now something else is happening. However, there is a good movie in there, I imagine there is a 2 hour version of this where everything makes sense. And there is some great action! The deaths are the main attraction, you'll enjoy them.

My own personal gripe was Thomas Jane'seseses character being there for comedy value, personally I like the guy and think he was deserving of a more heroic role, but he made it work and was memorable so I can't complain too much.

The actual story is bland, not really much could have been done due to the franchise being as old as it is, so a lot of the writing came across very lazy and half hearted.

The humour - some was good, some felt forced, each to their own on that I guess.

Space dogs - I hate all space, vampire, monster, creature.. anything dog-like in a movie. It's very lazy and always feels generic.

Story- LOL

Nostalgia- music, some scenes, ultimately -childhood ruined. But don't let that put you off.

On a serious note, it's 'OK'. It felt as though it could have been great with a little more TLC but it scraped by and I didn't hate it.

Ps: maybe you've read this, maybe you haven't. But I've typed out this review while sat in the toilet, doing a poo.

I'm just saying..."
1.0,12 August 2020,So bad it's very funny. Listen to the dialog. I think someone was taking a first years screen writers course and made a movie with it.
7.0,27 July 2019,
1.0,5 November 2020,What an insult to the franchise. Truly a pathetic movie in every way. I won't repeat what my fellow predator fans here stated. Listen to them. They are right. I just wanted to add my review to the group.
9.0,5 September 2019,"I'm seeing a lot of reviews saying, death of a franchise etc. The fact is, there is only one great Predator movie, and its the first. This movie is fun, and takes the Predator into some interesting new territories. Also there are some fun twists on Arnies's lines from the original. There are flaws here, and some annoying characters, but it's still probably the second best in the series. I actually like the first Alien VS Predator movie though, it may be a tie."
6.0,12 December 2018,"There really aren't any decent bits of this movie. It's awful. The acting is awful. The story (is there a story?) is awful, the jokes are awful, the script is awful, the acting is awful, the cgi is awful, the editing makes the film practically unwatchable - I had no idea what was going on for most of it. It was just such a poor movie, horrible to watch. I can only imagine the director watching the finished thing back at the end and realising what a spectacular disappointment they made."
1.0,12 September 2018,"It's easily the best of the bunch after Arnie's original, edging out the somewhat underrated second one and leaving the rest in it's dust! Fun, not too serious, 80s style action is what this franchise needed and this movie delivers. It's not revolutionary, but it definitely takes steps in the right direction. Hopefully we will see an even bigger and crazier sequel before not too long. A very enjoyable, fast paced high octane action movie!"
1.0,26 September 2018,"I love the original Predator and Shane Black films, so this was tough to see. While the first two-thirds of the film are okay, the third act turns into a generic and lackluster climax. There is almost no tension (one of the great aspects of the original) at any point and the action is simply average. Holbrook, while not bad, is nowhere near as charismatic or compelling as Arnold was in the original."
7.0,13 September 2018,
1.0,12 November 2018,You killed a part of me with this insult of a film. Thanks for ruining a francise I have loved since I was a kid. A 2yr old could have written a better story and your CGI guys should go to the job centre.
7.0,9 March 2019,"The promotion for The Predator would have you believe that this was a return to the original roots of the first film. No more fighting Aliens, no more trips to distant planets, now we are back on Earth in the forest, with a military unit fighting it out while exchanging quips and being picked off one at a time in the later stages. In reality, while the film has its moments, mostly it is unsatisfying in its uneven tone and content. The writing itself is the biggest root cause of a lot of this, as it involves daft setups, set-pieces with no strong foundation, and characters who generally seem like references rather than characters in their own right.

This causes the film to not have the heft of the original but instead seem like just another blockbuster without a heart. The gore will satisfy those that think an R rating is somehow a measure of quality, and it is enjoyably violent, but this does not make up for everything. The action does produce lots of noise and movement, which is decent enough, but there is rarely tension in it, nor a sense of real build-up. Of course part of this is the franchise not really having any surprises left to play with, but it is also that the delivery is fairly generic and lacking in effort and character. The presence of Shane Black does nothing to change that. The cast add to it by mostly being lesser names, or lesser performances, or both - some good touches from all, but it is not consistent.

In the end, it is a generic action movie within a franchise that is many decades from its best film. The Predator may hark back to that film in some ways, but quality is never one of them."
1.0,13 September 2018,"Shane Black get the point and get it right! the first half was great, but flop in second half, especially that ultimate predator. I wonder there were massive changes of the script due to the idea from FOX and the later extra shoot."
6.0,14 September 2018,
1.0,16 September 2018,"I, as most fan probably, miss the original feeling and genre of the Arnold movies but I think it was an honest effort to give movie goers a good predator movie. It had some corny humor, a lot of action and does deliver a story that did not feel like yet another recycled reboot."
9.0,15 March 2019,"Predator is a concept that's hard to mess up but Shane Black did. Every step of the way. The script leaked early and people were horrified. Rightly so. This project was spearheaded by complete morons from script to finished product. It's almost fascinating in its stupidity and commitment to get precisely EVERYTHING wrong. Tone deaf, brutally unfunny (the filmmakers think they are hilarious though) with a idiotic story and lazy uninspired call backs to the iconic original. No wonder Schwarzenegger stayed very far away from this train wreck. Watch the original classic masterpiece and just pretend they never made the others. Part 2 is still boss but everything after that one is complete cack."
7.0,8 June 2019,"Thought it was pretty entertaining to be honest, not nearly as bad as people are saying it is."
1.0,3 December 2018,"This movie is trash, trash dialog with the F word in every sentence, the actors acted like school kids instead of professionals, it was purely pathetic to watch, this movie was a cash grab off the Predator name simple as that, story is non existence, action is poor, acting is abysmal, CG is bad, we also have a feminist scientist that turns Rambo even after the creature left her alone.....her part could of been cut completely. I already wasted enough time on this movie, and I hope this review will help others avoid wasting 2 hours of their life. I give this a 1.

Do your self a favor and re-watch the original 1987 Predator instead of this trashy movie.

I will avoid any future movies that this director has anything to do with."
2.0,15 September 2018,"I have seen all of the Predator and Aliens vs Predator moves and read the Predator comics. I love the Predator lore.

This movie was awesome! Any true Predator fan will tell you this. Saw it with a friend of mine and we were sceptical based on the reviews, but we came out very surprised how cool it was. Yes, it had some questionable scenes, but never did I cringe over a character doing something stupid. The action was there and at a good pace, the gore was something we all missed from the 80's & 90's movies. The Predator lore was good and left us with questions. Go and see it!"
7.0,6 June 2021,I know this isn't like the original Predators and it's another time where Hollywood has simply recycled ideas.. but it was still enjoyable. There's some funny moments of relief that break up the story line and just make this entertaining.
2.0,26 July 2020,"...after this, it only went downhill, fast. I can't believe someone read this script and thought it was a good idea. The plot is awful, the acting is cringe-worthy, there is nothing of value in this time waster flick. Highly NOT recommended."
7.0,6 August 2020,"Incredibly a dumb, boring, and horrendous watch. You only need to watch first and last 5 minutes.."
1.0,30 September 2018,"Proudly taking the spot of the worst Predator film to date with surprising ease, the 4th instalment in the Predator franchise is a terrible mishmash of action, horror, sci-fi & comedy that puts these genre elements at odds with each other to such extent that they end up neutralising the effect of one another, and leave behind a hollow mess that's dull, disgraceful & disappointing.

The Predator doesn't hold a candle to the original masterpiece and is another forgettable addition to a franchise that's full of disappointing sequels. Bringing nothing new to the table, adding nothing of significance to the saga, and unsatisfying on all levels, it actually makes Predator 2 & Predators look good, and that's saying something. A myriad of one lame decision after another, Shane Black's latest is one of the worst films to surface in cinemas this year."
7.0,15 September 2019,Not sure why this film was so negatively recieved as its an almost perfect love letter to the 80s original. Some of the dialouge will make you cringe but alot of it will make you laugh. In bright lighting the predator gear looks like cheap plastic tat but the visceral kills look great. The loony soldiers are charicatures but they are entertaining. All in all its good dumb fun and I have to wonder if people wanting a more grounded or serious take on the material have ever even seen the classic original.
5.0,2 June 2019,Just wanted to give my disappointment some pressure Release. The characters are paperthin and super unlikeable. Everybody swears Like a Sailor and shouts for No apperent reason. The Story ist very forced and far away from the visceral Feeling you got from watching the Classic Predator movie. Plain Bad. Thus director can do so much better. Dont watch it.
8.0,5 June 2019,"Funny story, I watched THE PREDATOR (2018) for the first time on a flight, heavily edited and censored. I found the movie to be abysmal, borderline amateur. Being a fan of the original Predator, this felt amateur at best. Super cheesy, unlikable characters, bad cgi, the works.

Tonight I am rewatching it at home, uncensored with all the swearing and the gore. It turns out I realize Shane Black and the whole cast must have had a great time putting this movie together. Is it a good addition to the Predator saga? Definitely not. I am laughing at how silly the movie is, that's for sure...

Entertaining, but a mediocre scifi movie nonetheless."
6.0,7 July 2020,"If you a Predator fan, you are in for a great disappointment of a failed action/comedy attempt at a sequel."
1.0,11 October 2018,"Entertaining, but shallow. As A blockbuster is.

At its core, this is an action movie. Sure there are some callbacks to the original, but that was no cinematic masterpiece either. I'm not sure why people hold this franchise to such a high standard. It's not supposed to be art. It's a blockbuster, designed I entertain.

Really the biggest complaint I had was how awful the CGI blood looked, something this film shared with Alien: Covanent.

The story is mediocre, the action pretty damn good, and the acting is what I'd expect."
1.0,28 April 2020,"This is an insult to Dutch, Dillon and Co. Who lost their lives for the cause. You cannot even call this a parody."
6.0,16 September 2018,
1.0,30 June 2020,"By far the biggest let down of a movie series that I'm a huge fan of.

They tried to inject the predator with comedic elements and, honestly I'm at a loss for words. Horrible directing, horrible producing, terrible acting, and the worst part is how bad the plot is laid out.

Dear God, someone needs to be held accountable for this travesty."
6.0,25 April 2020,"The fact that this movie was green lighted to release to fans of any genre is a slap in the face to any movie goer, streamer, YouTuber, or basically anyone that took the time to watch this pile 💩. I made it 46 minutes... good luck"
1.0,18 March 2020,"They turned a good franchise into something ludicrous. With the level of bad acting in the movie, I wished the predator just killed them all."
6.0,16 September 2018,
1.0,1 May 2019,"This is not the best Shane Black outing, but it still has him written all over the place. It also picks up his love for having kids in his movies that have quite a lot of weight to carry (see also Iron Man 3, with a very good child performance). But this is not just about a father and his son, this obviously has a Predator in it. Now I understand that some still have the very first Predator in high regards (a very good movie) and liked the over the top sequel it spawned (even if the latter didn't make as much money in the box office). But this has merits of its own. For one it is made for adults and it has quite a lot quotable lines in there.

Good acting overall and the action is more than decent too. You get a bit of a callback to the original with a posse of people trying to fend of the Predator. But they are more than unlikely ""heroes"". One may even call them bad apples/guys and would not be wrong to do so. If you can get over that and just enjoy it, you will be good. This is not a masterpiece, but it is a good action movie"
8.0,14 September 2018,No coherence. At all. It's amazing how this script got approved. I really can't believe it's rating in IMDB. I actually think I might have over rated it.
6.0,15 September 2018,"Now as an action film it's not bad , the special effects are good , it has brutal deaths and lots of gun play ,, but as a predator film it doesn't quiet work , the central character is a child - not a 6""5' Austrian bobybuilder , the supporting characters are very varied and don't quiet grab the audience, but it's not a bad film , nicely set up for a sequel"
5.0,13 June 2019,What was Shane Black thinking....Absolute trash I have ever seen. Don't even bother for it on DVD. Just will till it comes on ITV. It's a JOKE literally.
1.0,2 December 2019,"Though this isn't, by any stretch, anything like the original it does hold it's own. There's more explanation about the antagonist which I found refreshing. Decades of this and the alien has always been something of a blank slate.

There's far more humor but, given the characters, it fits. I didn't mind it and given how dour past films were I appreciated the lighter tone in the dialog. Look, I could spoil this film but my suggestion is to give it a go."
7.0,14 November 2018,"A Predator crashes his ship onto Earth after a battle in space. It lands near American military assassin Quinn McKenna on a mission. Fearing being scapegoated by the military, he mails the predator gear to his son Rory (Jacob Tremblay). Rory's autism allows him to access the alien machinery. The government retrieves the Predator and calls in biologist Dr. Casey Bracket (Olivia Munn). The Predator escapes as Quinn, Casey, and a ragtag group of prisoners go into a pursuit. They are hounded by dark ops leader Will Traeger (Sterling K. Brown) who intends to retrieve the alien tech.

With the creepy best friend scandal aside, this is simply trying too hard. Shane Black is trying to be too wacky, too sly, and too complicated. A Predator movie needs not be that complicated. It's not so convoluted that it's not understandable. A little clean up can make this a sleeker action thriller. He fills the movie full of weirdos. Some of them are trying too hard to be weird which makes the comedy a little awkward and not that funny. As for the predator dogs, I want them to be more imaginative. It's basically a monster dog with predator hair. I also am uncertain about the denouement. I don't want to go back to the base. It's one of many pieces that remains uncertain for me."
1.0,16 September 2018,"I watched it today and it was really enjoyable. Combine with blood, gore abd comedy, it has pretty decent storyline."
7.0,8 December 2019,
1.0,13 May 2020,"This film is just terrible. The storyline is nonsensical and every character is annoying as hell. The ""comedy"" element is unnecessary and cringeworthy at best, most notably the thumbs up scene. If you are a fan of the original Predator and Predator 2, i highly recommend you do not to watch this film."
6.0,4 May 2020,"I mean, go watch it and then tell me if i am wrong....."
1.0,16 September 2018,
9.0,8 May 2019,Don't believe all the horrible reviews. Things happen in Sci-fi movies that won't make sense! Who can say what a child with mental disorders can do or can't do? Part of liking Sci-fi movies is that things happen that you can't explain. This movie has some things that you can't explain. If you enjoy watching movies and not evaluating everything that happens then you will enjoy the movie. It's not the best movie in the world but Predator movies never are. You have to use your imagination to believe that there are alien creatures from outer space to begin with or this movie can't happen! If you can believe that why can't you believe the rest. Don't dissect the movie WATCH IT AND ENJOY IT FOR WHAT IT IS!
6.0,3 August 2020,This deplorable mess is an insult to every actor in it. Olivia Munn and Sterling K Brown what were you thinking? Just awful.
1.0,25 February 2019,"Is this the movie of our generation, ready to define hollywood movies for the next decade? No

Does it try to be? No

The Predator is a fast-paced action-adventure movie with many comedic tones throughout the movie. It's not perfect and sometimes you can get lost in the action and forget what exactly is happening but when you're in the mood for such a movie The Predator is a good void-filler.

When bullets and plasma rays aren't flying towards you, very quick one line jokes are, when caught, the jokes can be good chucklers, but sometimes a joke misses because of how much is going on. The humor to add isn't your typical humor, it seems to be more the style of black, war-related humor you'd find more in movies like Range 15, Jarhead. Or series like Generation Kill. It really isn't for everybody, which is a good definition of comedy in of itself.

If you've got nothing better to do, want to kick your feet up and sink into a movie without having to think about anything, you will enjoy this movie."
2.0,28 May 2019,Unbelievably bad. Shane Black has lost his touch. Poor acting. Throw away dialogue. Bad CGI. No plot. Might as well have been produced by Disney and would've likely been better.
6.0,18 December 2018,"The Predator is really fun until the end, a surprisingly enjoyable 2/3 combined with a terrible final act. Boyd Holbrook, Trevante Rhodes and Sterling K. Brown are great. The losers themselves are really funny and have great chemistry. Shane Black's direction is great, resulting in some great action sequences in the first 2/3's. Unfortunately this is ruined by a final act filled with awful cg, stupid decisions, terrible editing and an ending that sets up a sequel that I never want to see."
3.0,15 January 2020,"So, this was a big moment for Predator to return on the big screen once again. Good old Predator! It was a simple and focused film back in 1987. But... how is this new version holding? Let's find out. First of all, I want to say - NO! This film is definitively not holding good. We have waited for almost 8 years for Predator to return to big screen, to return big and unforgettable. Alas, that wasn't the case. And honestly, I will not hate this film. You know why? Because, it is NOT WORTHY of my anger and my emotions. Not even close! Let's start from the beginning.

So, first off the bat - Shane Black. Now, Shane Black is not my cup of tea, but I appreciate some works that he did. I think he is a decent director, who can give us a well-directed comedy film. But, I think he is an even better writer. In my opinion, ""Lethal Weapon"" is the best action, buddy-cop movie out there. So, automatically, I put all of my trust in Black. Yes, some people use an argument that he worked on the first ""Predator"" film. But, only as a supporting actor. That does not make him qualified for the job. He co-wrote this film together with Fred Dekker. So, is the script good, since it was written by a two experienced veterans? Is the directing good, since it was directed by a pretty much seasoned veteran? Sadly - no. I'll try to keep myself calm and not break the keyboard under my fingers... This movie is so far away from previous ""Predator"" films. I understand that the change is good in movies and it is needed for originality, to attract future generations, etc. But, if the change is good and original and if executed well, then, we have no problem, whatsoever. However, in the case of this film... It's a mess. This movie is a complete and utter mess. The idea, story, characters, script, etc. Everything looks senseless. It looks like a movie doesn't know what to do with itself. Everything happens so quick and randomly. There are many cringing, uninteresting, non-funny and confusingly unexplained moments. It looks more like a science fiction / action / comedy. Far away from the tone of the previous movies. It is not tense or exciting. I understand that Shane Black, as he said in the interview, he wanted to expand Predator universe. An interesting idea. But, what is the idea?

So, the plot is next: A special forces sniper made an encounter with the Predator, and therefore he is captured and thrown into the bus full of crazy soldiers. He also has a son who has autism, and, get this - the, so called, super Predator wants him badly, because of his autism and because, according to this film's idea, autism is the next step of evolution. OK, how so? This is just ridiculous and does not have anything to do with the Predator universe! I just cannot carefully explain this story in detail. There are many things in this film that are done, there are many things in this film, that are said... And, they are just unredeemable. Characters bickering about the title's character name and definition. WHY is that important!? This super Predator... terribly done, by the way. The CGI is really ugly. Super Predator is basically nothing but that terrible idea - make it bigger, make it badder! And it is just horrible. This super Predator is neither interesting, appealing, nor fun. He is just big. The super Predator also have hunting dogs. The less I say about them the better. This movie has a terrible plot, or no plot at all.

The characters: unlikeable, not charismatic, irritating, dull and pointless. Our leading hero is portrayed by Boyd Holbrook. He is a decent actor, but here, he was just boring and not appealing at all. This guy does not have a star power. Jacob Tremblay is a great kid actor, I have seen him in ""The Room"" and I think that he does not deserve this kind of treatment. Olivia Munn was... well, I saw wooden boards and steel pipes performing better than her. She can be OK, but here... there was just nothing. We have some veteran actors like Thomas Jane and Jake Busey. OK, Jane is also a good actor and I think he was the best actor in the movie, but his character was nothing but a waste. I only gave one star because him and Keegan Michael-Key have some decent chemistry together. They really fed off each other nicely. And that is the only thing worthy in this film. Trevante Rhodes plays a potentially interesting character, but not that much. He has some charm and he is trying to work something with it, but the film just does not allow him to do so. The less I say about other actors and performances the better. These are the characters that you don't care about and you want them dead.

So, CGI, editing, musical score... nothing good, new, or special there. So let's get back to Shane Black. I really don't know what was he thinking about when he wrote the script. I am curious what was in his head while directing? Did he really wanted to make a film that is actually one big joke? And why using Predator in all that mess? This is a real travesty example of a film character that is really beloved by many fans. I am a fan of Predator, not the hardcore fan, but still a moderate fan. My obsessive passion is movies. And Predator started out as a movie. It was a respected and interesting character through the years. The first one is the best, second one is not the best, but still a decent sequel. AVP movies are bad, but better than this crap. At least they have some consistency and solid pace. Predators (2010), I think was a decent film, and I think that film expanded Predator universe more than 2018 film. I feel quite weird and ashamed for watching this film. To be aware that this film is the part of the franchise now. This is just another example of Hollywood today. No ideas, nothing new, and when they give us something new - the idea is terrible. This film will not last long and you can be sure of it. It will not be timeless and I can't believe what I am going to say... I feel sorry for today's generations. For giving them something like this. This horrid piece of puke. I hope that this film will not get a sequel and I hope that somebody else will take over and restart and rethink the idea. The audiences and fans do not deserve this film."

6.0,13 September 2018,I rate the original Predator as my favourite action film ever so I had high hopes going into the theatre. I had read the reviews and knew it would be a rough ride. I enjoyed the first 30 mins. I laughed a fair bit. I also died a little on the inside as the film progressed. A blur. A bit of a mess. So much potential but sadly rushed in the end. I feel for Shane Black and the team behind this motion picture. It was in places hitting the right notes but sadly the bad parts and narrative gaps destroyed it. I feel sick. I will struggle to work this one out.
1.0,17 September 2018,"I have always been a fan of the previous predator movies but this movie literally sucked the soul out of the entire series. The movie in plain words was a wreck with silly puns, bad direction, scenes were just scrambled together n didn't make any sense .. I tried hard to get the angle the movie was heading but in the end I walked the movie heavily disappointed!!!!!"

6.0,24 November 2018,"Well, that's clearly a fib. There are many many horrific movies.

But this one? This is my 2nd ever review on here. Usually I really don't bother but wow.

I'll revert you to my title.

Worst movie ever! So so bad I actually felt embarrassed for some reason....

The only good part was the end."
1.0,4 August 2024,"6.5/10 While for a minute i actually thought they finally getting into another different and original direction, it's eventually the same old Predator premise that's been repeatable for most of the time in this franchise, it's another depends on the film execution whether it's still worth to watch or not, and while it's probably the most questionable entry in the franchise, and the uncredited Comedy genre, some of the characters in the film definitely helps to make The Predator for me personally still quite followable and quite works, Boyd Holbrook was good as a lead in this film, and the rest of his criminal partners were enjoyable and funny, Olivia Munn basically just an alien nerd scientist that contribute nothing, but her performance still ok i guess, Jacob Tremblay in i think his worst performance, and Sterling K. Brown as a pretty nasty villain, and yes he works just fine, and the thing that i really like also was of course the bloody goryness that they are not shy to show, i'm pretty sure male audience especially teenagers will love to see many people got cut in half, and the special effects was pretty good, overall The Predator and basically this whole franchise are still not giving us the new completely original different direction since 1987, despite this movie particularly still have some things that works, and it's pretty disappointing knowing that the Alien franchise actually able to do it and it works for me personally, 31 years later same old cases."

1) this is a good movie 2) lots of ""critics"" who posted reviews earlier had definitely not seen the movie before - because they refer to scenes based on photos. But the truth is that not everything shown in photos is part of the movie 3) no reason to make comparing to Predator 1 and Predator 2. Nobody needs carbon copy or blind carbon copy.

Watch it and enjoy.

I am looking forward to the sequel.

7.0,7 January 2019,"How could this film be so bad? It is directed by the talented Shane Black(Kiss Kiss Bang Bang) who was an actor in the original film. He is known for his witty streak which infuse most of his screenplays and it is evident here also but not to the effect he may have desired. To its credit, The Predator tries to do something a little different than the previous sequels, both of which copied (to one degree or another) the beats of the original. The core problem remains, however. The Predator may look cool and do creatively bloody things to its prey but it was never all that interesting. That's why John McTiernan's movie put the focus squarely on Schwarzenegger and his band of Merry Men. The actors here are forgettable as is the action."
2.0,18 September 2018,"It's a good dvd or Netflix movie, it needed another 30 min to tell the story it chopped around to much."
1.0,26 February 2020,"Very bad. It is literally a movie worthy of Syfy alongside Lavalantula, Sharknado and the like and in that sense it even becomes a little funny / bearable to watch. It only has better special effects, but bad compared to films of the group in which it belongs (Alien, etc.). Each line had to be a joke, cartoon characters and full of stereotypes, including the lead actor's autistic son. It is at most a film for teenagers just because violence does not allow it to be for children."

7.0,17 September 2018,"The Predator had a lot of potential. It seems the studio decided to reshoot a large number of scenes, and very unfortunately, it shows with a vengeance. The movie is one big mess. This mess the studio calls a movie, lacks coherence, as if an eight-grader got his chance to produce & edit what could have been a Hollywood Blockbuster....

So much for the salute to ""Predator (1985)"". Amazing, the sheer level of stupidity of whomever it was that decided to do this. Must be nice to be able to waste millions of dollars and not be held accountable... Could have been really good, had all the requirements; yet someone, somewhere decided to turn it into a Frankenstein of a film... much like ""The Meg (2018)"". All in all, waste of my time and ticket money."
1.0,31 July 2022,"As a longtime fan of Predator movies, especialy original, this movie is biggest disapointment in my life regarding movies. Its not a Predator movie, its something like a mix of parody and comedy action movie that happens to have Predator thrown in it. While watching it i was like wft is this all the time.

Total waste of opportuninty to make good Predator movie, its like they wanted to ruin franchise intentionaly."
6.0,15 September 2018,"I've been a rabid Predator fan boy since I was even in Kindergarten. The first one is my favorite movie of all time and I watch it atleast once a month.

I'm reading a lot of negative reviews and, from appearances, it would seem these reviewers either wanted to watch the first one on the big screen or not watch a Predator movie at all.

Does the movie have flaws? Of course it does, but you're hard pressed to find a movie that doesn't, let alone the sixth time the titular alien hunter appeared in a theatrical release. Shane Black and Fred Dekker had master stroke world building that added without taking away from the monster mythology. They cleared up a plot hole from the second movie where the Predator has thermal vision without the mask, which has infuriated me for twenty years.

This movie is action packed. It comes in hot and it doesn't get boring. Director Shane Black brings his amazing writing and dialogue that made his earlier movies like Lethal Weapon a massive hit and is peppered with comedic bits as well as interesting characters mixed with quirky. The story isn't a rehash, so it builds and expands upon what we've already seen and remains relevant without neutering the creature. It has exciting visuals, well paced, and feels like a Predator movie.

For the flaws, the main team of protagonists are over the top when they are introduced but balance out as the film goes on, the ending feels a bit rushed but has a really good payoff, and it falls into trope territory with the ""gifted"" child and a scene involving a translator. Also it's probably not the most delicate representation of combat related PTSD.

All in all, if you came to watch a Predator movie, you will be entertained. If you came to see a best picture nominee you will be disappointed. If want it to be just like the first movie, watch the first movie. If you are a fan of the franchise and want to explore more of the Canon, then this is for you."
1.0,13 June 2019,Watched it and thought it was fine. I laughed out loud more then I thought I would. It was as good as any of the Predator movies. Crazy how all the fanboyz are so butthurt!
9.0,15 August 2020,"Once in a while you just start watching a movie with no expectations at all. It's complete torture and every minute you're asking yourself:""why??????""

People got paid for this s***. Why tell me why? There was a budget for this movie? Why tell me why? Actors got paid for stupid back to back one liners.. Why tell me why?

Soak yourself in a bath of gasoline, light yourself and that probably hurts less then the pain this movie causes to your ears and eyes. Buy an pineapple and go sit on it, its gives you more pleasure then watching this..

Wow! Compliments for making something so bad. I think Arnold must have taken a shower for a week after watching this movies. He feels wrecked.

Why tell me why....?!?"
6.0,21 September 2018,"The Predator is now a comedy. There is 0 suspense anywhere in this film.

They said that the entire last act of the movie was completely reshot, and boy, is it obvious. It feels like a Frankenstein film, think Justice League.

The ending comes from Iron Man. They decided to rip off Marvel I guess. *sigh*

But my favorite part is that in a desperate, last ditch attempt to garner attention for the film or herself, Olivia Munn decided to make a big stink about Director Shane Black hiring a sex offender for a small role. That's funny because she didn't have a problem at all working with Brett Ratner or Bryan Singer. (Google them!)"
1.0,30 May 2019,"It's not what I thought it would be, but I think the wave of 1/10 ratings is excessive. Film is a sequence of jokes and over the top action scenes with a very loose plot to hold it all together. Quite a few references to the new and old flicks as well.

Once you understand what this really is, you can sit back relax and try to have a good time. I did. There's plenty of intentional and unintentional comedy with a bit of cringe you can laugh at too.

I do hope that one day we get a film that captures the essence of Pred. 1 & 2"
2.0,1 March 2019,"As a huge Original Predator fan for over 30 years, this was an insult to me. Not just for the silly and nonsense plot, but also for the amazingly poor acting of all of those actors. It was promising in the first 10-15 minutes but then turned into something painful to watch. It was hard to say if this was a Predator Parody or an actual Predator movie....

R.I.P. Predator franchise."
7.0,25 September 2018,"The new ""Predator,"" the return of a classic brings a mix of nostalgia with current times, we have the action and the canasta scenes of a good 80's movie but we also have the comic relief that the recent Marvel films introduced and almost defined as a standard. The film is not perfect, far from it, but it's a lot of fun, the over participation of the ""monster"", the group of characters and situations completely kill the suspense of the long leaving it up with a humorous face with action scenes, not for less, the direction of the film is by Shane Black a director with a very strong humorous vein. With funny and funny characters, an acceptable build, a lint of script and good action scenes. The new ""Predator"" does not aim to beat the classic, but rather to bring a fun movie to market, bringing a bit of nostalgia and comic relief to please all audiences. The film technically is acceptable, the performances too, we do not have great highlights, but it is a great movie to see Sunday as a family."
1.0,19 August 2020,"It couldn't be worse, my god. 😔 Bad acting, terrible story, horrible special effects."
6.0,5 February 2019,"The Predator is a new film from the Predator film series. This film is directed and partly written by Shane Black, the director of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Iron Man 3 and The Nice Guys. In the film ex-military Quinn McKenna (Boyd Holbrook) discovers alien technology, through which he comes into contact with a secret research team who is familiar with this technology and would like to examine the technology he finds. Quinn only wants to cooperate when he gets more answers and is put on a bus with other former soldiers. The research team has called in the assistance of scientist Casey Brackey (Olivia Munn) in researching the Predator and its technology. When the Predator technology is activated, people end up in a conflict between two different Predators. Quiin and the other former soldiers must now, together with Casey, protect the inhabitants of the small town in the suburbs from the actions of the conflict between the two Predators and try not to fall prey to the Predators.

Shane Black, who also played a role in the first Predator film of 1987, puts this new Predator film in a modern look and adds some more humor. He has made an entertaining new Predator film, which sometimes can get used to for the fans of the original Predator film. They have also chosen to add a new kind of Predator in the film, which was also done in the Predators of 2010 film. All these new Predator types do not appeal as well to the fans as the originals do, but it is entertaining to see, but it is entertaining to see what these new Predators can do. This new kind of Predator only goes against the Predator idea. Predators are chasing their targets more unseen, while this larger type of Predator can be heard when it comes to its target. The effects have also been put in a modern way in the film. In the older Predator films there was really an actor in the Predator costume, which made the Predator credible. In this film, star-contact Brian A. Prince is really in the Predator costume of the normal Predator, but in the film they have added CGI effects, which makes realism less. The big super Predator in this film is fully placed with CGI in the film. This is done well and credibly, but sometimes you can see that it was done with CGI.

The acting is also well done by the entire cast. Because of the size of the cast not every character is worked out equally, but most of them have a nice action moment or funny comical moment in the film. The best comedy comes from Keegan-Michael Key and Thoms Jane, who like to play together with each other. Boyd HolBrook puts down good acting in the main role of the film, just like the young Jacob Tremblay, who plays his son in the film. Olivia Munn also makes strong acting as the only female characters between a group of male characters."

6.0,12 September 2018,"Dear Sci Fi lovers, now you can be more happier because The Predator movie is fascinating to be watched and entertaining enough to not to be forgotten like previous series. This kind of millennial predator for millennial generation has taken us back to the origin idea of what is happening and why the alien is coming to earth. Still the Director defends the iconic scenes of Predator which are sadistic, full of blood, mutilation scene, or unpredictable gruesome. This kind of movie that is for 17+ Rating in my country. The action, devices, and technology are better than before because here we can see other purpose of Predator to use high tech and why they have been called Predator. Do not forget the ending scene that could make you wonder of what happens in the movie still in the movie, then you will pray that Sci Fi movie is not for real. Because if that so, just run for your life. Besides, this movie has such level of humorous that could make you sometimes smiles because basic idea of this movie is the fighting between the angry alien, imperfect soldier, and his child who has autism. Their main roles is to prove which one has the right to rule the world and to defend the life. I believe there would be Predator 2. Come on, fighting still goes on and Doomsday is still mystery."
3.0,1 February 2019,"It's a parody of a Predator movie and by extension of all action movies, and Shane Black would know. I think this is exactly the point, a tongue-in-cheek, over-the-top, metafilm, but at the same time a highly entertaining action flick. If you fail to see the cinematic qualities of such an idea, I feel sorry for you."
8.0,13 January 2020,"The original ""Predator"" film is one of my all-time favorite action films. John McTiernan's direction is excellent in depicting the geography of the amazing action on screen and generating suspense and thrills accordingly. The testosterone-filled crew of soldiers led by Dutch (a prime Arnold Schwarznegger) is absolutely legendary among action films. The jungle setting gives the film a special atmosphere, which again would not have been the same without McTiernan's abilities as a director. The one-liners are genuinely delightful.

After quite many sequels, reboots and spin-offs, all of which, in my view, were highly forgettable and pretty mediocre, 20th Century Fox hired Shane Black to direct ""The Predator"", an astoundingly ridiculous sequel that tries really hard to implement many of the elements that made the very first film so enjoyable, but that fails so miserably that it feels disgraceful in a franchise that already included plenty of terrible sequels. ""The Predator"" is a complete mess in so many departments, I don't even know where to start. And this has nothing to do with my love for the original film: with all objectivity kept, every aspect of ""The Predator"" is a failure.

Shane Black's direction is the complete opposite of McTiernan's: You can barely understand what's going on throughout this endless string of poorly filmed, chaotic action scenes that are completely devoid of structure and continuity. At the root of this widespread mess is a scenario of staggering stupidity, probably one of the worst scripts that I can remember in recent years, even by B movie standards. The dialogue is laughable, the characters are beyond archetypical and bland (I can't remember one of their names, even the protagonist's), and the generalized silliness of the story extends beyond that of any of this derailed franchise's outings and spin-offs. Take a second, and let this sink in: the crew of soldiers manages to ""train"" one of the Predator's pets (those ridiculous dog-like creatures that were introduced in ""Predators"") at some point. Oh boy.

The cast features some of the least charismatic actors I've seen in a major production in years, especially the protagonist, an incredibly far cry from Major Dutch in the original film. It was quite heart-breaking to see Thomas Jane impersonate a totally anonymous, poorly-written character in this wreck of a film. As the interchangeable members of this crew of soldiers get impaled, beheaded or cut in half, you'll most likely remain totally indifferent. Again, that's if the messy direction even allows you to notice who's getting killed.

Finally, the quality of the special effects aligns perfectly with the overall production: they're mediocre to a point where you'll wonder whether this really is a major studio production. All the creatures (especially the ""giant"" predator), the spaceship and the gore all looked cartoonish, and the overall cinematography feels like a joke of very poor taste.

Needless to say, ""The Predator"" is an abysmal mess from start to finish, in every department without exception. Do yourself a favor and revisit the original film instead of wasting your time with this cinematic garbage."

1.0,16 May 2019,"Admittedly I am a very big fan of all things Predator, Alien and Terminator related. Sadly, I have no freaking idea if this latest installment of The Predator franchise is a re-do, re-boot, update, sequel or whatever.

Although it has its moments (ie-the trick or treat scene), overall it falls short of the first 3 Predator flicks. Way too many F bombs than necessary and having a child in a major role just felt wrong. I can only assume that they were going for something like Newt in Aliens, but sadly they missed the mark.

If they had shortened this installment to one hour and announced that this was a pilot for a new TV series (be it HBO or SYFY) in addition to casting the major players a bit better I could have rated it a little bit higher.

In fairness its hard to compete with the original Predator starring the not yet Governors Arnie Schwarzenegger and Jessie Ventura or its sequel with the late, great, scene stealing Bill Paxton along with Gary Busey. Even the most recent Predator flick (2010) continued the well established tradition of great casting with Danny Trejo and Walton Goggins among others.

This endeavor was more akin to the 2 Alien v Predator flicks than the first 3 Predator movies. It would have made for a good TV show. Not bad, but could have been better."

Predator who wants to save humanity the dumbest that could come up with the writers, even the film predators 2010 was better than this masterpiece in the quotes!!! I hope there is no sequel!!!"

9.0,19 July 2019,"Here's my review of The Predator. So ""The Predator"" is the newest in the franchise directed by the guy who played Hawkins in the original predator movie. This movie is a Gorey action flick you think ? Well you thought wrong. This is a comedy like a straight up comedy with jokes which actually land at times. Now we've seen the predator in the jungle , we've seen it in the city and even seen it fight in pyramids so this time we see it in the suburbs( ik , wtf right ) . Unlike the other predator movies this one doesn't involve the predator taking out people strategically. You know how in fps games it's a stealth mission but that noob teammate of yours goes full assault that's pretty much what the predator does in this movie. The story is very linear and you don't really anticipate for anything. Now the editing in this movie is like so bad I wonder how it made it to a final cut . Like say a kid is walking to a table to get his toy , that scene has 5 cuts !!!. In the end it's a guy movie , if you're into Gore , guts and jokes then you won't mind this movie in fact you might enjoy it . Otherwise it's a should've been shelved script somehow turned into a movie."

7.0,23 December 2018,"I rarely write reviews but thought I'd breifly give my 2 cents as I'm seeing alot of bad reviews, when it really wasn't that bad and I'm quite a harsh critic.

The film started off a little cheesy and I felt the family dynamic of the film could have been done better and I was worried the comedy in the film would ruin any tension or scares but tbh this I think helped you bond with characters and helped demonstrate the bond they had with each other.

(I'd say it didn't ruin this as there was rarely any tension and I wasn't scared once but it was still a good action film.)

From here the film gets better the action picks up and I can't really fault it apart from perhaps personal preferences like wanting to see more one on one action between various characters and the predator and wanting them to have individual skills which would make them unique in dealing with the predator. I would have also of liked to see more of a concentration on the use of predator technology which I think they tried to do in this film but missed the mark a bit and perhaps seeing the predator being more tactical.

I would happily watch a continuation of this film or perhaps (in light of all other predator films) another predator story by the same writed and director"

7.0,3 December 2018,"Where to begin?? (*may contain spoilers .... if at all possible) I thought Prometheus was the bottom of the barrel but I was wrong. How anybody can blow $88,000,000 on this foetid digital dump is a mystery.. If Edward D. Wood Jr had had access to CGI, this is what he would have produced. I was half expecting Bela Lugosi (&cape) to pop up someplace!

From the opening sequence when the good Predator's (gP) trans-dimensional ship is fleeing from the big bad Predator's ship (bbP) and we HEAR EXPLOSIONS IN SPACE (have none of these ""directors"" seen ""2001- A Space Odyssey""?) this waste of 107 minutes precious life continues to drag on in an utterly insipid uninspired, pseudo-sciencey, formulaic fashion. Don't do what I did and wait for it to get better.. it doesn't.

""Dirty Bad Bunch do the Creature(s) from Outer Space"" would be a better title. There are no surprises or great reveals except that some prepubescent savant who can't act can in fact interpret a totally alien language and symbols and save the day... That and the savagery of the chopped limbs and exploding bodies and simply ghastly crudely represented 2 dimensional characters.

Throwing a whole bunch of ""sciencey"" look equipment together and projecting ""sciencey"" looking graphics of triple (nucleotide?) helices (""they're does not a bio lab make and when will the human race learn to properly chemically restrain captured aliens? It is no good giving incremental shots .. it has to be continuous ..

Clearly the director thinks he is going to get funding to continue to torture what was once an adequately enjoyable idea (""That's my new suit Bubba."" say the hero, when the ultimate weapon is revealed as a magical ""Iron Man meets Transformer"" amulet/super suit.) but I doubt it. into something that not even a marginally evolved unicellular organism could understand let alone enjoy. This is not how to reboot a franchise. Thank Heavens for ""Pop Corn Time"" is all I can say.."
1.0,16 September 2018,"This film is nowhere near as good as the original predator, but that doesn't mean it is ""trash"" as other reviews are saying. This movie has great action, gore, effects, and extremely likable characters. There were nods to lines from the original, which were cheesy and sometimes cringeworthy, but it did not rely on rehashed material to keep the audience entertained. It is an action movie, about a killer predator from outer space. And for what it is, it does an awesome job. I highly recommend for any action/sci-fi/predator fans. Shane Black did a solid job on this film. 8.25/10"
7.0,13 November 2018,"I wish there was a way to officially disown movies like this. Like officially, we all agreed that this movie never happened. The predator 2018 seems to have been written by a very untalented, fat, old standup comic desperately trying to appease his audience with outdated jokes. Pretty early in the movie, you get the sense of where its heading, and there is no surprises. Forced jokes and funny situations in every scene, mixed with violence and blood and a crap load of stupid stuff, like the predatordogs becoming mans best friend, or autistic boy deciphering predatorlanguage, or...nah, ill stop there, because i could go on for ever. It is a really bad movie, and im really surprised crap like this still is being made. Avoid if possible."

Do I still want to see another Predator-movie by Shane Black? Yes, I do. A strong cast, the dark humor and a brilliant presentation of the fugitive Predator make me hope this one does well enough at the box-office for another one to happen.

6.0,15 September 2018,"I grew up a huge fan of the Alien and Predator franchises. The original Predator is a straight classic and I was a little worried this addition was going to take Predator into similar territory as Alien: Covenant. I am happy to say it did not.

The newest Alien films stripped the Xenomorphs of what made them terrifying: that there are species ""out there"" that are inherently murderous. Ridley Scott threw that fear out the window with his origin story. It muddled the franchise and sapped the life out of the original. Shane Black's The Predator does not do this.

Sure, they gave the Preds a motivation, and added details that can be applied to the Arnie original but not so heavily as to really be taken too seriously. The Predators are still the hunters. They are just trying to be the best hunters they can be.

Shane Black has proven to be a master in comedy-laced action and it worked very well here. This movie is pure entertainment and I was entertained throughout the entire runtime. The action was gorey and visceral, and with the comedy I give huge credit to the casting and the great acting. It's not forced and it does not attempt to be comedy first, action second. It's a healthy mix.

Go see it for yourself. On a big screen if you get the chance. In my opinion this is the only Predator that lives up to the original. And in today's day and age where classic franchises are being wrung dry this film is one sequel that does not disappoint. 9/10 spines ripped."

More predator dogs (even more stupid) The ex wife was the highlight of the film. Now chances of anyone making another (to hopefully to get a good one) are sabotaged.

7.0,21 September 2018,"I decided to watch this movie and make up my own mind despite the spectrum of negativity it's generating. I like the Predator franchise, and I've enjoyed watching all of them for what they are: a provocative science fiction monster movie. And, I'm rather glad I ignored the criticism (perhaps it helped), as this is an entertaining interpretation, albeit a somewhat comicbook-esque instalment. This is not a movie concerning the typical tense Predator confrontation-survival versions; this is more of a misfit, magnificent dirty half-dozen sci-fi flick, more in tune with the 21st century superhero genre replete with self-referential irreverence, thematic mockery, and subjective amusement. This version of the Predator isn't going to please everyone; however, this is a solid popcorn rendition of the alien-monster genre - finally, a version that doesn't take itself too seriously and, while leaving room for some development, expands the typically restrictive vantage point usually present in Predator movies. Until now, we've only seen the Predator narrative presented in the form of a skilled hunter versus a determined prey that - and let's face it - only prevails due to some dubious decisions made by the antagonist. The mystique of previous movies lay in its intentionally restrained portrayal of the signature character, which, although inspired fascination, eventually moved towards repetition present in each sequel. The dilemma with this version of Predator is in its anti-hero status clashing with the need to avoid predictability - does anyone really want to see yet another banal-more-of-the same edition? If we already know the Predator format - the whats, the whens, and the hows - then surely, what could we expect? As with other franchises, a soft reboot that mixes it up a little isn't committing the original sin according to the Predator bible. I considered the departure from the classic 30 year old original to be refreshing. Unlike other fans, I didn't want a samey, prosaic walk down memory lane - I know enough about the Predator already. The version is about the Predator Universe and not just the Predator itself; and, in the expanded universe (first introduced in the comic series of Predator and Aliens vs Predator: Three World War 1991), there are different Predator clans with different traits and attributes that help explain the changes. This movie tries to add to the story-universe by redirecting emphasis towards a more progressive concept rather than rehashing the threadbare hunter-stalking-quarry motif - hardly the crime of the century. Yes, it has a different focus, intention, and style; even though this has inflamed frustration, resulting in disappointment, even fury from many fans, it must be said that this is a very different movie model than that of previous releases. With a nod to the originals, this movie works as a good individual piece, which is how I've judged and rated it. Granted, there is much about which to complain, however, mitigating expectations to solve myopic nostalgia, it really isn't all that bad - remember, even the original had its flaws - this movie delivers an entertaining, humorous, and contemporary extrapolation of the initial Predator concept. In other words, and in PG Deadpool pithy parlance: it's much, much better than a prolapsed rectum, ignore the trendy bandwagon of exaggerated hypercriticism and watch the movie; it's ok, you won't die. Give it a go, and you might have fun."

8.0,23 September 2018,"Once again, a Predator comes to Earth. but this one is behaving a little strangely. And this one may not be alone. Rory, an Autistic kid(Tremblay, giving a nuanced performance), Casey, a high school biology teacher(Munn, who I've yet to find convincing. She seemed more confident when she was on G4), and Traeger, one of the higher ups(K. Brown, who we love to hate) who wants to learn about the ""bass fisherman""(rather than destroy it before it starts its rampage), join the familiar players: a team of military badasses who have the skill and weaponry to fight back as they're being hunted down, one by one(if that *is* what it's interested in this time...). The twist? That last one? Every member is suffering from some mental issue as a result of their service(this very clearly has respect for those, and wants the audience to as well. Despite the jokes at their expense arguably going too far). Except of course for Quinn(Holbrook, charming, albeit not to the extent he was in Logan), who is being hidden from public view since he saw the extraterrestrial. He doesn't have a disorder. He just wants to keep his (already mentioned) 11-year-old son safe(and it's due to this point that I don't understand why people say there is no one to cheer on in this, that you can't get emotionally invested. I'm not judging, I'm just confused).

This is not perfect, it has definite flaws, but it does have a lot going for it. It feels like a proper sequel to the first movie, which none of the other sequels do. It knows how to still have action scenes(which are fairly varied and always exciting. I never felt like I was just sitting watching special effects, stunts and ""noise"") as frequent and as big as we expect today, since everybody watching this knows the titular creature. We are not going to sit through the equivalent of the '87 flick, that can only work with a new franchise, where we don't know. Here we see it very early, and so do the protagonists, in some cases few minutes in. So they can approach it in a way that makes sense from that perspective, rather than frustrating us with having to wait until they get there. There are a lot of quick short scenes and you can tell that this has been reshot, sometimes by the demands of executives. That's not going to bother everyone, I didn't think it hurt the film very much. I understand why some say that the humour is tone deaf, belongs to another decade, and makes us dislike the heroes - I guess all I can say is that that's ultimately a matter of perspective and I disagree with them on that. I don't think this ever slips into self parody: rather, it manages to be satirical and yet deliver. Just like Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and Iron Man 3.

There is a lot of bloody violence, sexual references and strong language throughout. I recommend this to any fan of Shane Black and the series. 7/10"

Though it wasn't that bad of a movie... it still hurt the franchise more than it helped it.. Weird plot holes.. fast wack action transitions... Tried to add in comedy that wasn't funny... Had no sense of mystery and memorable moments... Even the last predator movie before this one was better.. smh

By the way, just because you do not like like a film does not mean you automatically give it one star. Shows a lack of critical assssment. The movie is entertaining enough and there are problems to be sure. But if you just want to keep ck back with a decent enough sci-fi, horror flick late at night and enjoy the good a lot no with the bad you might find this surprising. If all you want to do is piss and moan and slam down another one star review here then maybe move along."
8.0,29 November 2018,Remember how gritty the original Predator was? How action-packed? How suspenseful? How violent and awesome? This movie is none of those things.
6.0,14 September 2018,"""The Predator"", like its predecessors had a lot to live up too concerning the original film, which director Shane Black starred in himself 31 years ago, starring the ever iconic Arnold Schwarzenegger. To me, the original is exactly what is now and honestly always will be, a self-aware 80s action creature thriller that is never short of one liners. As well as having more cheese than the whole state of Wisconsin, some hold the original up as a really impressive feat for sci-fi action but to me, it's slightly overrated and tried to be way more serious that it truly needed to be, especially with it's cast. ""The Predator"" is almost exactly that but with the style of writing and directing Black has come to be known for throughout his career. This new film was exactly what I expected it to be knowing the witty dark comedic tone Black has within his script. The humor in my opinion was delivered extremely well and like it's 1987 predecessor, never short of one-liners that I'll most likely be quoting for a long time to come.

This film is at its best when our rag tag group of heroes are together exchanging dialogue with eachother either during the small moments of of breaks they get from the action or while participating in the chaos of the carnage our antagonist is dishing out around them. It truly goes without saying that the acting in here is very on point here and in an extremely well blended way. Each actor really has their own moments to shine and they truly give their all without sounding too cheesy or out of place within tone that Black is trying create. The standout performances are definitely without question from Boyd Holbrook, Olivia Munn, Trevante Rhodes, and Sterling K. Brown.

The action is very well shot and choreographed as well and it comes without shock that our beloved Predator shines when it comes to creative flashy kills. Every single scene with Predator doing what he does best was an absolute joy to behold to the eye. The VFX team as well deserves to be applauded for their work on everything to really amazing practical sets, stunning green screen, and masterfully blend the ladder to where it's almost indistinguishable to the human eye. It really goes without saying that this movie does look extremely beautiful, and especially our open shot, the cinematography team cannot get enough praise here. Lastly, Henry Jackman's score was just perfect for this film and honestly just an excellent score overall. He was able to just captivate all the orchestral 80s music that we love, the score just sounded so vibrant and ominous that it made me just want to immediately go on Spotify anf listen to the whole score.

This film does not come without its flaws though, the third act is really muddled with the crammed idea for an obvious setup plan for sequels and not all the characters are as fleshed out as I would have liked to see sadly. An example would be Alfie Allen's character, Lynch. He arguably has the least amount of screentime out of all of main characters and the few moments the he was in, were actually pretty good. It just sucks thats his talent was so looked over and never got his own moment.

And yes, this film does not come without controversy with Olivia Munn doing the right thing in my opinion and outing a sexual predator who starred in the film. Thankfully the scene with him in it was quickly removed and never to be seen. But this should not impact the rating of this film at all. Politics should be set aside when it come to viewing a film on your own. There truly is enjoyment to have in this film and some may not view is so but this really is the best Predator film since the 1987 film, yes I get to some that making that statement really isn't saying much. No it's not a phenomenal film or even an amazing one at that, but it's a good time to honestly sit down too with a grouo of friends, a bowl of popcorn, and just watch the galaxy's greatest hunter go do what he does best. I understand that diehard fans of the first may not enjoy it as much and that's completely understandable to me. But if you're willing to get past the muddy sequel set-up in the last 30 minutes of the film, then you should have a fun time with ""The Predator""."
2.0,1 October 2018,"While many critic reviews compliment the film on its references to the original and the way its pays homage to the great grandfather it descended from, they fail to mention how this film IS AN ABSOLUTE INSULT TO ITS ORIGINS.

Predator (1987) has an intense, thrilling storyline, plenty of action, crazy pursuit scenes and overall blends Schwarzneggars bid to survive versus the Predators hunting instincts well to present a film that wowed audiences.

In all of the films I have seen, I have consideted walking out and asking for a refund twice. It should have been a dead giveaway at the 5th minuts in at the poor quality and new profit orientated composition when the story relies on black and dark humour, intense gore and borderline parodical presentation that try to mimic the likes of Deadpool but fail miserably, to carry the film. Absolute disgrace.

Nothing about this film is gripping. Nothing about this film draws the audience into its concepts. I found myself actually LAUGHING at the ridculously corny one-liners from all cast members, no one is safe from Shane Black's cringe. This film was made for 8 year old american gamer boys who want their dads to take them to the cinema to watch something where people get chopped in half for the sake of it.

Long story short, if you want to laugh at a movie because of how BADLY WRITTEN AND DIRECTED it is, see Shane Black's The Predator."
4.0,14 September 2018,"I am so glad I don't read or watch reviews any more before seeing a movie.

This movie is amazing. Shane Black delivers again. 2hr are action packed, bloody and thrilling. It's also original and has so many awesome scenes. Trailers were awful, fortunately it was just bad advertising.

I would like to question all of you reviewing movies, people giving freaking 8 stars to boring, paint by numbers, Marvel movies.

What's great about it, 2hrs just fly and there is no fillers. Yes, no fillers! Also, it's very self aware, which I enjoyed a lot.

Don't get discouraged by bad reviews here. If you liked the first Predator, you will love this one. It has everything you could ever wanted and then some more. It has original ideas and scenes. It is very engaging and fun.

I will see it again. Amazing job, Shane!"
7.0,16 May 2020,"Watching this movie it stood clear to me that Jake Busey must play Donald Trump in a future movie... and Olivia Munn could land a role as Marina Abramovic.

7.0,15 September 2018,"For some this may not have been the film they were hoping for. But it was a change for the franchise as a whole. From being dark, gritty ,violent films this one is the same with a big sprinkle of comedy. The film is great and coming from a director who knew what he was doing added his own take to it. Comedy may not have been a great choice but it worked and it was a breath of fresh air. The story may be a little confusing but it still stands strong with some great set pieces. The cast is probably one if its weaker points. Some cast member were underdeveloped while others shined through out the film. This film may not be oscar worthy but it is a good time at the cinema without thinking too much about."
1.0,13 May 2020,"The movie had some cheesy moments and characters, but the story was pretty good and some of the comedy woven in to the action was kind of funny.

My husband and I both enjoyed it....guess we are all different."

1.0,12 November 2018,Ok this has to be the worst movie I've seen. Defo in the top 3. From poor CGI. To even worse acting. The movie is a mess. Shane black needs to go far away and never grace any movies ever again. He has killed the predator franchise. The story line is terrible. The jokes are terrible. The acting is beyond belief. IAM sorry had to go 40 mins into it. Thought this is a joke rite. But no. How did this rubbish get off the cut table. And for Keegan-Michael Key. This guy isn't funny He's a poor actor. And it really shows in this tripe As is Thomas Jane. Wow. What else can I say but stay away in another galaxy from this pathetic movie. Predator is dead. No coming back from this.
7.0,28 October 2023,"First question: Is THE PREDATOR anywhere near as good as the original film? Well, no. This is a CGI-rich, rather silly, action movie.

A rag-tag group of soldiers is thrust into a battle with the titular terrors, resulting in tons of gunfire and explosions. We're also introduced to a child genius with the ability to use alien technology within seconds of looking at it. Actually, he's the most interesting part of the story, and, unfortunately, gets precious little screen time.

The plot concerns a rogue Predator on the loose, and the others that seek to destroy it. The ""deeper"" reason for this is revealed later, and it manages to be both preachy and absurd.

Lovers of action for action's sake, tough guy banter, and digitized, cartoonish blood spatter will be overjoyed. Anyone expecting more than that should look elsewhere..."
3.0,14 May 2023,"To be quite honest, this movie is not as bad as some reviewers would suggest. Is it great? Far from it. Does it put a different spin on the franchise? Yep! It looked like everyone did their best to make a serious Predator movie, but they all happen to be in on the joke. There's some funny callbacks to earlier films that people will see and enjoy and, as it most sequels, it tries to improve on it's original and just quite doesn't hit the mark. Regardless, go into this film with an open mind and lower expectations (I mean, it's not worse that AVP: Requiem) and you'll enjoy it for the most part.

The acting was decent for what they had to work with in script. (Remember, the actors are given direction to do something and the editors/director does the rest, so try to lay blame where it belongs.) The effects were fairly high budget, the cinematography isn't awesome, but it's fairly decent given the darker scenes. The list of actors are not all well-known or they used to be bigger names, but it's nice to see them on screen again.

TL:DR Give this movie a shot, but don't expect to be overly wowed by it. You'll be entertained."

Interesting characters remincent of the first film so much so I actually got upset when I knew this was a predator film and these guys cool as they are gonna get brutally hunted.

The predator feels like a modern day 80's action movie great one liners , awesome references amazing predator action sequences enjoyable from start to finish feels like Deadpool and the predator had a baby to create a film I'm even considering seeing for a second time just because I enjoyed it so much. True predator fans will love this film it's a bloodbath."
7.0,9 October 2018,"Everyone was excited to see this movie, but in the end almost everyone was dissapointed. In my opinion this movie isn't completely trash but it is the worst of the all the franchise. It's enjoyable but nobody thinks about it after seeing it. Movies nowadays relay on comedy to stand out, and this movie isn't supposed to be funny, but still the studios wanted it, and they accomplished it with some fairly good jokes but still out of place. The editors had to cut the movie in order make it last as the same as the previous other movies, as a result some scenes are too fast and incomplete. It all happens too fast. It's so fast it doesn't build up to the last fight, nobody is excited to see a fight, it feels like everything else in the movie. Probably the best thing in the film is the bloody action. Finally an R rated film! It has the action the predator must have, not excluding what was necessary. In the end, the predator is an enjoyable film but forgettable, the more you think about it the worse it gets, I don't think this movie will be remembered or mentioned when compared to the others"

1.0,5 January 2021,"6.8 First off, this version is not of the same caliber as the original. But...... I found it to be original and very humorous at times. What it lacks from the original is the consistent dark lighting throughout, with that feeling the Predator is right around the corner. The casting and actors were superb. Thomas Jane, Olivia Munn, and the rest of the cast have a comedic argument over something uttered, that I'm sure is in some part was something that has happened to Shane Black personally. And I give him credit for finding the humor in it. Though many on here rip on Black, I like all of his movies. Writing this version of the movie HAD to be a passion project. Considering he was the first person to die in the original film decades ago. Me personally, I enjoyed this version of The Predator movie series and look forward to seeing the next installment. Which was a phenomenal setup at the end of this one. Well done Mr. Black! Thank you for reading. I am a MovieFreak......rUaMovieFreak2"

This was a bold film into the franchise that I enjoy. I was relieved the predators were for the most part NOT crummy CGI like alien covenant. I was not a fan of the ""dogs"" but that's just me. You need to see this film in a good theatre to enjoy it. Don't believe the ""professional"" critics that are giving this film a ton of hate. There is a clear storyline here & it is fast paced so I assume they didn't pay attention. The film opens up the possibility for more movies."
2.0,31 December 2018,"This is a well made and fun sci-fi action movie, if that's your thing, watch it. The reason for all the bad reviews? The original Predator movie was very serious, and mor comparable to the first Alien movie. This one is more comparable to current Marvel super hero movies like Thor: Ragnarok, or Guardians Of The Galaxy. Albeit with more entrails. It has action, lots of jokes, space ships, alien tech, and Predators. Contrary to most of these reviews, this movie may very well save the franchise, rather than end it."

This is one of the worst movies you will ever see, and yes, this pile of stinking crap killed the Predator franchise. Everything about this movie is so silly, so stupid, so full of bad jokes that it is hard to endure. The whole movie looks so incredible cheap (the ""CGI"" is an insult to the viewer), that it might as well have been produced by Full Moon Entertainment. The story about a ""good Predator"" that wants to save humanity (why???) and the bad Superpredator is garbage. You don't care abeout any of the characters one bit, and of course, the hardest, toughest character is a woman. A biologist, that is. Don't waste your money and your time.

4.0,17 September 2018,"As a Father to an autistic child, I have a few personal issues with ""The Predator"" but I'll put them to the bottom for the time being and try and talk about the film in more general terms.

If you're initial fears were, like mine that this was going to be an anodyne family friendly Predator movie, shorn of gore and violence to try and make as much money as possible then I have good news for you. It's not that. Limbs and heads fly off, spines are ripped out and blood accompanies all of it. It's not holding back in the language department either. Where the film does fall down more, is in plotting and characterisation. I understand the desire from the story to position Sterling K Brown's Military science unit (...Space Force!) as the villains of the film, but it feels a bit of a stretch that they would just make the decision to assassinate anyone who know about the existence of the aliens, especially when they're (for example) genetics experts who only know about the existence of Predators because they were invited in by that team. The readiness of McKenna's (Boyd Holbrook) team of misfit toy soldiers to risk their lives for his cause also comes a little too easy, after the films midway point and into the conclusion. I've seen some criticism of the film as having too many jokes, I'm still not sure that's really legitimate - but what the films does have is too many jokes that don't land and too many cute references to the original film, that grate more ingratiate. (Though there's one amazing Disney World joke in the opening act that I think might earn the film an extra star on its own, although I am also going to retrospectively remove that star for the awful reveal in the film's final scene).

It probably won't live long in the memory, or in the public consciousness but it was diverting enough whilst it lasted.

So, as a father to an Autistic boy - whilst it's not an offensive portrayal of the condition, it's not especially realistic either. Ignoring that not everyone gets that ""savant"" style superpower that seems prevalent in ""film autism"" - its effects are pretty inconsistent across the running time. Rory is overwhelmed by a fire alarm in the film's opening scene though able to act ""normal"" around a sustained firefight as the film reaches its conclusion, or whilst being bundled into a helicopter. It didn't ruin the film for me, but some of the discussion about autism being the next stage of human evolution made my eyes roll. Also, despite Shane Black being a sufferer himself, the use of Tourette's syndrome as a comedic device also made me feel uneasy and I'm surprised that hasn't generated more complaints."
1.0,13 November 2018,"Ojk along with The Meg this must be the worst movie of the year i mean the Predator was suposed to be scary ya know nothing of that this stupid parody of a movie is useless.

I dont know how prominent celebrities did this to ruined their carreras i mean come on Boyd Hoolbrok (Narcos!!!), Sterling K Brown (This Is Us), Thomas Jane (1922, The Mist, The Punisher), babe hottie Olivia Munn, Olivia Strahovski (Dexter!), Alfie Allen (Games Of Thrones!) i mean its obvious that here the whole thing is about money because i think none should do this movie Shane Black i hate ya!!

7.0,16 September 2018,"Honestly, this should've been marketed as an action comedy, because it's hilarious. The jokes are phenomenal, the characters are surprisingly rich and work well together. However, this move isn't without its flaws, it dangles several plot threads early on before finally sticking to one. There's additional antagonist introduced in act two, to set up the third act, that aren't necessary because with a few rewrites you could've centered the story around the first two acts. Either way, the story is decent enough, but in act three the cgi and practical effects really fall off, not jarringly, but noticeable, and the final scene is just awful. All in all, I had a great time and really enjoyed it, largely due to the character dynamics and the comedy."
3.0,17 January 2019,"I was quite intrigued when I heard they were making this sequel. I am a big fan of the original film, but had soured a bit on some of the films in the series. The official synopsis is when a young boy accidentally triggers the universe's most lethal hunters' return to Earth, only a ragtag crew of ex-soldiers and a disgruntled science teacher can prevent the end of the human race.

We start off this film with a sniper, Quinn McKenna (Boyd Holbrook) lining up his shot. They are trying to rescue hostages from a cartel in Mexico. This is interrupted by a spaceship as it crashes. Quinn checks it out and is attacked by a Predator (Brian A. Prince). He defeats the creature and takes some of the gear to keep himself safe. He sends it to a PO Box he has back in the States.

Also back in the states is his family. He is estranged from his wife, Emily (Yvonne Strahovski). They also have a child together, Rory (Jacob Tremblay). We soon learn that he is on the spectrum with autism. I really liked this concept to the film, as a doctor in the film, Casey Bracket (Olivia Munn), points out there are beliefs that autism is actually the next evolutionary growth for humans. This could make sense, especially with how Rory understands things and his memory is uncanny. He is bullied though in school.

Casey is picked up by the government. This gets a little awkward due to the scene that was removed by Munn's request. We never actually get introduced to her. She is a leading biologist who focuses on evolutionary changes. She is brought in to help with the study of the Predator. Leading the investigation on them is Treager (Sterling K. Brown). He seems to know quite a bit about these species.

In order to cover up, so none of the information about this gets out, Quinn is going to be locked away in a veterans psyche ward. He gets on a bus with Nebraska Williams (Trevante Rhodes), Coyle (Keegan-Michael Key), Baxley (Thomas Jane), Lynch (Alfie Allen) and Nettles (Augusto Aguilera). They are all good soldiers, but the effects of war have messed with them.

We end up learning that the first Predator we saw is being chased by another one, one that is much larger and dangerous. The question becomes, why? I do feel that the film actually is paced pretty well, but there are just some scenes missing. Much like Casey, we never get introduced to Emily. The characters end up with an RV and I'm not sure how. During the climax, some of the characters kind of disappear for stretches and it just doesn't flow completely correct like it should. I do feel that the tension builds and we get a pretty satisfying payoff at the end, but it just still has some pacing issues.

This film actually has some really good acting performances. I thought Holbrook was fine as the male lead in the film. We get to know his character and he plays the part well. Rhodes I thought was solid in support of Holbrook. He actually was a fun character that I quite enjoyed. I'm still blown away by how good of an actor Tremblay is. It is just mind-blowing for how young he is. I picked up immediately from his performance that he was autistic and I like how his character develops. Munn I also thought was solid as the biologist. She kind of disappears a bit in the film, which I didn't really like. Brown was also good as the villainous government agent. The rest of the cast round out the film very well for what they needed.

As for the effects of the film, for the most part I was on board. I liked the look of both of the Predators. One was clearly more CGI due to the size of it, but I didn't mind that. I did have some problems with the CGI in this film though. Any time they needed to show blood, whether it was human or alien, it looked fake. I was disappointed at how bad this actually looked. The dog like aliens also didn't look great. Other than that though, I thought the film looked good. I thought that was a strong portion of the film.

The last thing to touch on would be the soundtrack to the film. It doesn't stick out to me, but for a film like this it didn't need to. It fit the scenes and helped to build the tension during the battle or firefights. I didn't have any issues with the film here.

Now with that said this film I came in expecting it to be fun and that's what I got. It has its issues, which I do think holding it back to be better. The film though does have a good story. I would buy that this alien race would be doing what they are. I liked the concepts of evolution and how it can be connected to autism possible. This film does bring up an issue that is debated in politics, which I could have done without. I do think this film did have some pacing issues. Not in that it doesn't build the necessary tension, because I think it succeed there, also having a satisfying payoff in the end. There are just some scenes missing throughout that make the film confusing. The acting though was really good as were some of the effects. Some of the CGI though doesn't look good and it was quite noticeable. I would also say that the score of the film fit what they needed it to. Overall, if you like the series, I would give this one a viewing as it is fun. I do think this film is slightly above average."

7.0,7 October 2018,"The new sequel to the movie franchise Predator got bad criticism, and the audience is divided. It seems that much depends on expectation. Many see this as the sequel of the original and compare it with the same, but I think they are making a mistake. Director Shane Black (Acting in the Original) has brought the movie exactly what I was expecting, humor and fun. The film is far from some perfection, I absolutely agree, the story is full of holes, the tone is different from its predecessors, and the end of the film itself is the worst ending I have seen lately, but this is not a critical view of the film. I Watch a movie like a pop-corn movie, a fun of about 2 hours to put my brain off mode and laugh. Believe me I laughed more in this movie than in most comedies that come out of the last few years. In that way, I think the director succeeded and gave him a positive rating. Rating is a subjective matter and gets thumb up. 👍🏻"
1.0,17 November 2018,Yhe movie is so badly done. B movie. Acting really bad. Deserves minus 5
6.0,16 September 2018,"A rogue Predator crash lands on earth and is followed by a second come to mop-up. Throw in a couple of Pred-doggies and it must be time to rip up a few more hum'ies.

The Predator has lots of shooty action and some good humour. It has blood but no horror and no tension. The most intelligent character in the movie is a ten year old; so... no thought from the audience required. Just sit back, ignore the pseudo-science, chomp your popcorn and watch the pretty fireworks. The CGI is good enough.

Since the original Predator 1 and 2 (1987 and 1990) there have been a couple of cross-over movies with the 'Alien' franchise and a re-boot in 2010. This second re-boot attempt pays no attention to the original theme. A follow-up is setup at the end of the film but the money will determine if gets made.

Guys who like simple action will enjoy this but if you're invested in the classic Predator mould you'll be disappointed."

1.0,18 September 2018,"You get your bang for your buck here with lots of action. Violence is there but it's not so in your face so it's not that graphic. The cast is the best thing about this movie with a likeable collection of main and supporting actors. Olivia Munn is a scientist who can fight. Boyd Holbrook of Narcos is the sniper father and he is quite good in his action blockbuster debut. Jacob Tremblay the kid in Room has a pivotal role and he is cute. Yvonne Strahovski is mom - a bit underutilised.

The story is usually quite confusing in this kind of movie these days. In this movie I more or less understood the story and the evolution thing was quite a good idea. Was okay till the latter parts when I didn't quite get who was shooting at who.

OK for monster movie action fans."

9.0,4 February 2019,"Yet another movie that has been eviscerated by sheltered, basement-dwelling, anime-addled, comic book cretins because it dared deviate from the epic expectations or tone that they'd built up in their narrow minds (see ~in derisive sneer mode~ ""Disney"" Star Wars) or have been warped by the Nolan-ization of all things action/comic/sci-fi.

I think the main intent behind this new Predator, tone-wise, was just to be 'fun'. Would I have preferred a back-to-basics, serious and intense thriller full of great action, like the first? YES. But I watched this one with an open mind, and it was indeed, FUN.

Anyone giving this film 1-star should just be disregarded completely and never paid attention to again. They're the kind of person that would reject Jesus at his second coming because His return wasn't flashy or exciting enough, or was too jokey."
7.0,17 September 2018,"Shane Black is known for some great scripts but this one may be his poorest, either that or he hired the worse editor in motion pictures. The plot and story are a jumbled mess that begs for more questions asked than answers them. Plot holes are so huge and obvious you wonder if you have fallen asleep many times throughout the film. Where do the heroes get an RV? How did they get a cache of weapons? Or the news helicopter? How is it that a biologist has the skills of a mercenary? Normally I would include some sort of outline of the film's plot that I review but it is truly so messy, I can't describe it. Character backstories are non-existent and some character's disappear altogether for a good amount of screen time only to reappear without an explanation. Whether this is the fault of a poor script or a bad editor, the story is one of the hardest to follow in years. The one good point is, like many of his scripts Black provides some humor as well as some fun nods to the previous films, but it isn't enough to cover for its obvious shortcomings. The film's ending obviously sets up a future sequel, but like the rest of the film it is so out of place and chaotic you really don't care. Shane Black has the ability to make a much better film than this and why he didn't is the true questions to ask. Not even fans of the franchise will get excited for this film and it is truly one that should be avoided. Except for a few laughs and actions scenes this movie offers nothing but a waste of time. It might not even be worth a rental a few months from now."

7.0,11 November 2018,"What an utter waste of time, resources and money. Why was this movie ever made. It's an insult to our intelligence and our value of human live. Why do we even waste money on making stuff like this. It's an insult to the original franchise. Why did this ever get a green light?

Why does this exist? I truly want my money back, good thing I didn't pay for it. Someone else paid for my ticket, I want a refund for him and a refund of my own life and time I wasted.

Do not watch this if you are a true fan of the original, run away while you still can."
2.0,13 September 2018,"This film pleasantly surprised me. I went along with a group of friends more for the company than the end trip to the cinema, and was expecting very little having seen the trailers.

Instead I was treated to laughs, some great action, and a surprisingly half decent story. Unfortunately it starts to fall apart at the end, which is why I had to deduct a couple of stars - the final act starts jumping the shark and has special effects that seem somewhat less polished than in the rest of the film.

If the final act had been better, it would have been a solid 8/10 film that I might revisit. As it is, I'll probably never watch it again."

The casting was excellent especially the band of lunatics, even the humor was good. I really don't understand all the negativity .

6.0,13 November 2018,"This atrocity should effectively kill off a once great movie franchise. I'm not sure why every action movie needs to be a half-assed comedy with a bunch of cheesy one liners but here we go again! Horrible acting, horrible plot, just a really bad movie from start to finish."
1.0,15 September 2018,"Most of reviewers I follow told me it is a bad movie, and a cringe comedy but they are wrong. It is neither.

I don't think it is a great movie, but it no where near deserves the negative reviews. You can't expect them to make a remake of original, it has already been done with Predators (2010). This movie moves fast, they drop a bunch of theories and lore without spending ages justifying it. The predators have long lost their mystique and you can't make a movie around that anymore, which is what everyone seems to expect.

I find this a good and fun addition. You should judge the movie on your own. I was pleasantly surprised because the reviews were trashing it a lot."

I didn't think the second one any better than this one, i like it mostly for watching Bill Paxton do his sleezy cop routine. Predators with Adrien Brody is great. And then this one. I happen to like the actors in this film and i thought the story line fine. Academy award potential? No. Good as the original? No. But a very enjoyable few hours and besides, I really like shane black's work. He was great in the first one. And i think this a fine directing job."

9.0,11 July 2021,"This film is definitely better than 'Predators' (2010) even though it's full of ""Made For TV Christmas Movie"" actors (I actually love Christmas films!). It's a fun film and full of action and it harks back to the original in its way.

It almost seems like they're trying to bring it to a younger audience by bringing in the character of Rory though. To be fair, kids these days are better at watching horror films than I am. Freddie Kruger still freaks me out.

It's a shame that the predators run so funny because of the costume that they have to wear, but I'm glad they didn't CGI them, because the big one doesn't look so good! It's not Neville Longbottom on the broom bad, but. . . ?

I do find it hard to believe that they would kill all of the other soldiers though and not just knock them out. It seems a bit wrong, even for a group of rogues. I also wonder when will they learn that bullets don't work on The Predator?

I actually didn't mind it at all. It's not Arnie, but it was never going to be.

1.0,30 November 2019,"My feelings towards ""The Predator"" are mixed. I'd high hopes for the movie when it was announced but as soon as the film had opened, the negative reviews poured in. As a result of the hostility for this addition to the franchise, I gave it a wide berth...until now.

Feeling more like a SyFy Channel rip off rather than an official offering, ""The Predator""'s tone is all over the place. We have cheesy comedy, violence, horrible CGI and great physical effects...all fighting for dominance.

The acting veers between the acceptable and the awful. Olivia Munn manages to keep a straight face throughout, as does Yvonne Strahovski. All the other talent in this project are wasted (although I did enjoy seeing Jake Busey playing the son of the ill fated Special Agent from ""Predator 2"").

By the half-way mark of the movie, I'd accepted its shortcomings and decided I was onboard for the bumpy ride. All the while, though, I was puzzling over what was running through Shane Black's mind as he directed this beast.

9.0,21 September 2018,"Ok first off I shouldn't have to say this but the intelligence of users makes me have to but NOTHING will ever live up to an original of any movie period. So for anyone to go to a sequel and it to expect it to surpass its predecessor is naïve, ignorant, and just plain senseless. So with that being said lets jump into this.

I rated it a seven because it wasn't ""trash"" and also it wasn't an Oscar winner. Everyone who gave this movie a 1 star and did nothing but cut the movie down for ""What it should have been personally just for them"" shouldn't be allowed to rate anything at all. Of course we all have our qualms with movies but everyone's entitled with their opinion But to not give it proper review is selfish and helps no one make a decision to go see a movie or not. So Shane Black explained he wanted a sequel to further explore the predator history / mythology. So with that's what Mr. Black wanted that's technically as far as you should take it. No less no more. SO with that being said the movie did hit on that so it was accomplished in my eyes. It paid homage to the original with music and what not nd few things I won't spoil but it did overall ok. So The movie had mediocre special effects which was nice to see in XD along with the action scenes which were nice to. The acting wasn't to bad. However I do agree to many action movies now a days has to much comedy in them and not enough seriousness like I've stated before in other movie reviews so that I can concur with other reviewers. So just go watch the movie it is good but DO NOT go in thinking it will live up to Arnold's because it wont. For anyone to ever think it would have is just...................I don't know I have nothing to say for that. I see to much 1987 this 1987 that why do you people do that to your selves? It will never happen to any of the classics. Just don't watch them like I didn't even watch total recall Remake. Why?

So if you want to watch film by Shane Black then go watch, the user nassahdeys said it best ""just have fun"". Also I have to 100% concur with user KJ Proulx's review lukewarm haha well said sir but it gave a decent experience."

4.0,3 March 2024,"One of the big troubles with Predator sequels and reboots is that most of them are terrible. They're terrible movies and they're terrible sequels. It's usually because they're basically just the first one with different characters and maybe a different environment.

The Predator manages to avoid these traps. As a movie, it's just okay. None of the characters are particularly likable or even really memorable, but at least they have more development than some of the other Predator sequel characters. The plot is fairly bog standard action movie fair, but at least it isn't just the first one done vaguely differently.

It also avoids the traps that it could have fallen into. It has an autistic child character for example, but unlike with other movies that have them, he isn't annoying and isn't the entire focus of the movie. It's just an incidental thing that he has it. I think this is a good example of what I mean when I say this movie has better character development than some of the other sequels, because even though it does inform his character, it's not his entire character.

Really, the big things this movie does well is how it does as a *sequel*. The stakes are higher, for a start. But more importantly, it feels like this movie does move the story along and do some more world building. While the other sequels have acknowledged the first one is canon, this is the first to actually treat it like it mattered and feel as if it's actually a story set decades later instead of a movie where the original incidentally also happened.

Really, the biggest sin of this one is that it doesn't ever capture the '80s cheesiness the first two had. If it had have done that, it would have made the jump from okay to legit good."

Yes, Predator from the 80's was great but this is nothing like that at all. The only similar thing is the Predator.. But this has a lot more to the story. I have to say that this kept me engrossed right to the very end and I was sad it had ended. All of the characters are very likeable. Especially the main man and his kid. When you like the characters you care what happens to them and that keeps you interested.

I can only think the other reviewers haven't reviewed the film on its merit. I thought the storyline was well thought of and the action was really exciting!

If you are looking for a great action sci-fi film with no preconceptions of what it should and shouldn't be like then honestly give it a go.

The film has some pretty seasoned actors in it but even they couldn't do anything to save this abomination. I don't really want to waste my or anyone else's time by writing more. Surely some of the actors, production crew, studio reps noticed it not only disrespected the franchises canon but also makes no sense at times? For instance we all now know bullets only do minimal damage to a predator, so why were these dummies grabbing any gun to fight the creatures? Like, you dummies are all going to die and guess what? They do. This makes it hard to root for any of the good guys coz they're just too stupid. There are so many WTF moments it would take ages to list them all. This isn't the Predator movie we wanted or needed. DO NOT let any of these people near a predator movie ever again.

9.0,13 November 2018,"Too many times, movie goers expectations are predetermined by prior releases of related films, and Predator is no exception. Certainly, many people sat down to watch it with wide varying preconceived expectations.

I found myself firmly in the pleasantly surprised camp pretty early on, and it wasn't just for the top notch visual effects or the crisp pacing. Rather, it was those other intangible things that caught my attention halfway through act 1, those variables that are sometimes sorely lacking from what could have been a great movie (and there are far too many examples for me to begin citing here.).

What quickly caught my attention was how well the characters were both written and just as importantly casted. There is a palpable chemistry that so easily comes through the screen and raises the level of the entire movie from the mere farce it could have so simply been, to something so much more. Please don't misunderstand, this isn't the second coming of 2001 or anything even close. But for what it tries to be, it succeeds on many more levels than it misses.

The story is well thought out and presented with some great twists and turns, as well as a number of surprises you won't see coming; and some you will. In all, it's a fun over-the-top rollicking ride well worth taking."

I only made it an hour in and turned it off. Whoever wrote this crap should have their skull and spine ripped from their bodies Predator style. Important to note that I've enjoyed every Predator movie, sure some of them could have been better but trust me after seeing this one you will no longer be able to fault any previous predator movies. I really, really hoped they haven't killed the franchise."
3.0,16 September 2018,"I really felt Shane Black's ""The Predator,"" had so much going for it to revive the franchise, after countless failures with the AVP movies, but they blew this one too! Just to get to basics, it's about the hunt! Pure and simple! It's about the Predator stalking and eliminating his prey one by one. And Shane Black the director, who also starred in the first one, completely ignored that big important detail! I like the fact that it's in the suburbs. I like the commodore between all the crazy soldiers in the film. I even liked that they had Peter Keyes make an appearance in this, but it's all about the hunt! The hunt is what made the first one. It's even what made the second one as watchable as it is...So again, it's about the hunt. That's what they completely missed in this one..."

1.0,10 November 2018,"Relentless action from start to finish. some great cgi and gadgets and gizmos for us techies to wonder at but a very poor choice of cast and lead female and male characters I must say!

Overuse of foul language as usual and although the humour seems forced and not much characterization for some reason I still thoroughly enjoyed it.

Seems all the sci-fi nerds expected Arnie to return with Ventura and Landham - give us a break that was 30 years ago. No way does it deserve a meagre 1 or 2 out of 10; that is just nonsense voting!

Yes it does have its faults but if you just want to switch off and enjoy some alien action it will do - It is no Predator or Alien one has to admit but it passed a night of popcorn and a few beers with the lads!"

1.0,16 May 2023,"Another wasted opportunity for the Predator franchise.

What starts off as, at least, a unique take with actors that give us hope because they're involved, turns into a generically-directed jumble of improbable-verging-on-impossible nonsense.

So many films these days-and this one is a prime example-start off as though some thought has gone into the script and end as if the creative team was replaced by a child playing with action figures.

Shane Black being involved gives misplaced faith that this will be a decent instalment.

Wacky characters, feeble comedy, a child with inconsistent autism that becomes a superpower to translate all things, several appearances from Basil Exposition and characters who have knowledge of things they couldn't possibly know. Also, bullets don't work. ...but then they do.

The 1987 original wasn't perfect, but it has enduring personality. Not least because a great director was in charge and the writers weren't bland or pandering in their style.

This one will sink without trace."
6.0,21 February 2020,"This is an action B-movie, written by an A list writer of nineties action comedies (Lethal Weapon series with Mel Gibson). This writer started directing as well and he turned this Predator franchise into a great FUNNY parody. He made fun of the whole macho tough guy thing out of the original Predator. Hence the many angry old Predator fans, who were insulted that their beloved memory of the original Predator was being messed with.

But hold on, the original Predator was only liked by total nerds and B-movie geeks. The original Predator was cheap and rubbish. Nobody took that movie seriously back then, besides teenagers with pimples. At least director Shane Black tried to make fun of such a cheap action monster like the eighties movie Predator. And I applaud him for doing so. Let all the nerds go rewatch the original dumb Predator as many times as they like, but give this movie a chance if you are into parodies of B-action movies. THAT is not a big audience, but I like these well made tongue in cheek parody of B-movies now and then.

Concluding: NOT suited for the original Predator fans. BUT entirely suited for those who like to laugh at these dumb, macho B-movies. And a good laugh it is. Suited for female viewing as well, because the macho men get whooped by a smart kid and by a smart lady. How's that for a change? I like it!"

8.0,14 September 2018,"Predators was good, a little too lean in my opinion (theg could've spent more time with the characters instead of trimming it down so much), but it was still a good continuation of the Predator universe. Shane Black's follow up, The Predator, is a great R action movie. It does a good job of world-building, character development, and keeping you laughing while the action mounts to a crescendo.

The editing is a little jumpy, some strange cutaways and one character's death towards the end that was COMPLETELY botched (I couldn't even tell who died until I counted the survivors in the next scene) - but my expectations were pretty low, and I can honestly say it was way better than I feared or hoped. The cast was hilarious, Olivia Munn got undressed twice (no nudity you pervs) and Holbrook flushed out the one-dimensional hero well.

Don't believe the people who just want to poo poo everyone's fun. If you want a good action flick with lots of gore and one liners, this is one of the better in recent years. And I can't wait for the obvious sequel."
6.0,23 September 2018,"I'm normally a big fan of Shane Black's work. The Nice Guys was in my top 3 favourite movies from 2016, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is an underrated gem and even though parts of it were problematic, I really enjoyed Iron Man 3. So even though I have little familiarity with the Predator franchise, his involvement as a writer/director pushed me to check this out with a friend in theatres as opposed to waiting for it to come out on Blu-Ray or Netflix. This movie oozes Shane Black's sensibilities and while that equals a solid movie more often than not, The Predator came out as more of a mixed bag.

Starting with the plot of The Predator, there's a more concerted effort to firmly establish the Predator's motivations than I expected. There hasn't been a lot of continuity with this franchise (even more so considering the AVP spinoff) and the movie clearly explained why the Predators were here and even worked them the current landscape in a topical way. As a novice, it was a plus as I didn't have to start from scratch and there wasn't much ambiguity as everything unfolded in a straightforward manner. The story suffers from a few problems that are typical of the genre (a little scattershot, dragged in the middle) but I didn't think it really stood out in a good or a bad way.

With the large budget and the history of the franchise rooted in action/horror, I was excited to see what kind of action the Predators would get into. I'll give the movie some points for the unflinching and creative nature of how the Predator dispatches of its enemies. This is a movie that earns the R rating and although some of the more important character as taken care of abruptly, there were a couple of HOLY $#!* deaths where there is no cut away. While I did like that aspect, the problem is that the action isn't filmed as creatively or even all that well throughout. The editing is choppy in sections, it can be hard to tell the characters apart and this is one of the rare occasions that the CGI in a big budget action movie just didn't hold up. The action wasn't terrible but with all the choices we have in terms of big action movies, The Predator lacked the polish of a tentpole superhero movie or the inspiration of a John Wick, The Eqalizer or Atomic Blonde.

While the horror or the action elements lack a distinctive feature, just like in any Shane Black movie, the real star is the comedic dialogue and the distinctive characters. I was never blown away by the action, but both my friend and I were cackling through the whole movie. Not every joke hits but I got a laugh at least once every 5 or so minutes. Black's got a gift for writing funny tough guy dialogue and that carries over into The Predator.

You also get some crazy characters that help the movie get over some hurdles. Our protagonist Quinn (Boyd Holbrook) is lumped in with a busload of crazies and each of them have a distinct personality and reason why they've been removed from society. Some of them border on the cliché (despite a committed performance from Thomas Jane, Baxley's material covers the basics of a guy with Tourette Syndrome) but they helped keep the movie above water when the rest of its issues were trying to drag it under water.

The cast is largely composed of talented and well-respected actors. Boyd is solid as the lead in The Predator, he gets the balance the movie trying to strike and can handle both the comedy and the action. Trevante Rhodes had his moments as Nebraska, he works well with Boyd and transitions into his character smoothly. Jacob Tremblay is one of the better kid actors out there, but I don't think this is his best work. His character's competency is all over the place and he wasn't as memorable here as he was in some other movies. My favourite performance came from Keegan-Michael Key as Coyle. He was a riot and he sold his material completely. I already touched on Thomas Jane, I wish Sterling K. Brown had been given more to do as Traeger. I think he did what he could but other than a few witty lines for him to deliver, he was just a forgettable villain. I saved Olivia Munn for last because while I feel she was trying here, she still comes off as a little bland. She still hasn't found the right vehicle to put herself over-the-top and while she's fine in this as Casey, this isn't that vehicle.

I walked into this expecting to really like it, but I walked away mildly disappointed. The strengths The Predator has are real strengths (the comedic dialogue and performances) but the rest is very mediocre. The action is alright despite the iffy CGI, the plot is fine but lacks anything that will stick with you and the ending was really scattershot minus a funny stinger when it wraps up. I can see diehard fans of The Predator franchise getting angry about this and while I can't say I side with them totally, I at least understand where they're coming from. The staples of Black's body of work that are implanted in this save the ship from sinking but I don't think this is one that you have to see in the theatre. My real rating for this would be 6.5/10 rounding up to a 7/10."

1.0,13 September 2018,"This is unbelievable garbage and an insult to any Predator fan. I hoped and expected the resurrection of the franchise and got a movie in the range of Alien versus Predator 2. It is 100 % action movie, completely lacking the ""Predator"" atmosphere. There are too many characters in the movie, undeveloped and unsuccessfuly incorporated, without any charisma, especially the main ones (Boyd Holbrook and Olivia Munn). Music is some kind of copy of Alan Silvestri original that tried but couldnt lift the atmosphere because the scenes were changing to fast. The Predator is visually ok, some scenes with the ultimate Predator came with the CGI from 10 years ago. Humor is ok, but its exaggerated. Yes, I know, it is probably damn hard if not impossible to make a fresh, interesting and in some way an original movie of the successfull franchises like Predator, Alien or a Terminator but this...this is an amateur work. Destroyed my day and night , coke and the popcorns. R.I.P. Predator franchise.

Stay home and rather watch any other Predator movie. Shane Black, shame you, You should be visited by real Predator."
7.0,31 December 2018,"Yes, it's make believe & they have to sell an effect, but sound effects in space? Combustion looking propulsion and turning in space with a wing designed hull (Hint: vacuum) - duh! Talk about fake news well this is fake science. Of course there has to be a savant grade school kid (w/the added bonus of his own personal bullies) to decipher alien speak. The usual university prof to interpret what would otherwise be unintelligible to most of us (and add gender equality, and sex appeal to the all male cast). Some military goofballs to kill the invaders. But the interesting, and also made up, not possible, subplot is that the aliens want to incorporate some human DNA into their own so that when climate change makes Earth inhospitable for humans they can move in. Supposedly Trump offered to accelerate the warming in exchange for the aliens giving him land rights to build alien hotels."

5.0,14 September 2018,"Oh boy, what a load of crap this movie is.

I don't know where to begin with why this movie fails horribly. It's just a huge mess through and through. There is not one thing I liked about the movie, not one.

The story and the pacing was atrocious. It moves from location to location in such a nonsensical manner that you don't really understand how much time has passed or where they are. You are just along for the ride, and man did I want off this ride. In fact, I could have sworn over 2 hours had passed only to look at my phone and realize it had only been an hour and a half.

The characters leave a lot to be desired. At worst they are forgettable, at worst I was rooting for them to just die already. I remember when watching the original and thought to myself how the movie was missing a subplot about a child dealing with autism and becoming closer to his father, thankfully they fixed that and added it to this movie. Seriously though, aside from how patronizing the whole movie is to people dealing with Autism, it is just a very strange subplot for this kind of movie.

The action is OK sometimes, but it feels almost like I am watching a slapstick routine half the time. The predators themselves no longer worry about stealth or tactics, they are just invincible killing machines. the group of ex military dudes just act like buffoons. If you really must watch it, just wait till you can stream it or rent it from redbox. This movie does not deserve to succeed."

""The story is too hard to follow""... Really? Awe, shucks booboo... are you kidding? It would be stupid to compare any of the sequels with the original because we've all seen the monster and we all know what it's game is (likewise Alien, Jaws...). This is waaaay better than Predator 2, and waaaay better than AvP Requiem. Sure it's another hollywood action film with all the regular tropes of hopeless authorities who can't do basic logic or hit the side of a barn (military/FBI/police...), and only our hard-done-by maverick heroes who show any level of capability, and a bunch of convenient coincidences... but why the hate for this, it is the normal suspension of disbelief required for standard hollywood action films since the late 1970's Arnie/Stallone/Die Hard/Smokey and the Bandit/Dukes of Hazard era. This reboot tries to add a little humour which is good when it works, and sometimes cringeworthy when it doesn't... again, standard for hollywood and the action genre. They've retained all the Predator and 1980's action film tropes, teamed up our hero with maverick oddballs to add a little bit of antihero vibe and a little attempted humour, got Olivia Munn gratuitously naked, made a film to the formulas that have proven popular, and... pretty much everyone is dumping on it. Just as pretty much everyone has dumped on every predator sequel. Boo hoo.

Yes, they decided to put comedy in a classic thriller ... the result is the worst storyline in the history of the movie series ... while Nolan creates a fabulous remake of Batman, same thing Blade Runner, this sequel / remake is simply terrifying tao bad. A cretinic mix from the beginning to the end of the movie. Do not waste your money going to watch this movie. Not worth it."
7.0,20 September 2018,"I'm not a child, I'm old enough to understand that original movies can afford to be subtle and nuanced and tense because everything is new. Logically therefore, sequels/remakes/reimaginings need to find other ways to keep the audience engaged and on the edge of their seats and enjoy the ""old"" environments and settings all over again. Alien -> Aliens -> Prometheus for example. Terminator -> T2. Hell, A New Hope -> The Force Awakens.

But oh my goodness, The Predator fails on so many levels. The script is OTT, the forced connections between characters is paper thin, the plot devices to move the ""story"" along are so unbelievably stupid that it loses all credibility within the first 10-20 minutes and not only does it fail to recover, it gets steadily worse and worse...and worse.

It's a cross between Masters of the Universe and Starship Troopers, I still don't know if this is a legitimate attempt to make a serious piece of film or if they are deliberately taking the mickey. It's aimed at 14 year olds who think saying the f-word is the mark of a cool person.

The middle section where the initial action takes a break (in the scenes in the motel and the suburban house), is up there with the most uncomfortable I've felt whilst watching a film, ever. If it's 20 minutes long, it's 19.5 minutes too long. These scenes are filled with toilet grade dialogue to force in a joke reminiscent of the original (if you don't want to be compared with the original, or viewed thru that lens, don't throw it in my face), and filled with totally ludicrous details that point out for you how bad the movie's plot and characters are. And! And it makes you forget you're watching a sci-fi film let alone one with a history like Predator. It's not about the Predator, it shouldn't be named after the Predator.

I'm trying to stay away from hyperbole, I'm not exaggerating, it's obscene and utterly, utterly non-sensical and bordering on offensive.

There's a segment towards the end, before the much talked about (and ridiculed) last sequence where I thought, ""ok, at least this bit is semi-decent"" and that feeling lasts for about 4 minutes and it just goes completely abysmal again.

The ending? I just wished they *had* done what everyone thought they were going to do, it couldn't have made it any worse.

The tone(THE TONE!!! Honestly, the tone is so wrong), the script, the plot, the characters, were just all so poor. The CGI isn't even good! It sometimes looks b-movie bad. I'll watch it again in about 6 months once I forget how disgusted this has made me feel, and will reassess....but, I mean, come on....Dogs? Gimme a break. GET TO THE exits"

The only problem here is the characters, the movie is full of cheap-stupid comedy, they should have removed that. When the characters die you feel happy and relieved.

1.0,18 August 2021,"This film has a more humorous bent than the previous one. I really did like Predators, but I prefer the tone of this film. It matches more of the over-the-top feel of the original and 2. They do add a few more jokes than those two, and a little too many of them have a frat bro/trying-to-be alpha dog mentality that can be a little exhausting. Still overall, it's pretty funny."
6.0,14 September 2018,"As a true fan of the series who loves AVP, Predator, Predator 2, Predators, and Predator: Dark Ages, I have to apologize for all the bad stuff I've ever said about AVPR. At least AVPR has a predator in it (wolf) who does elite predator things.

This is a predator movie in name only. Shane Black should have called this ""your mom jokes: the movie."" I wanted to like it so bad, but the trailers did not impress me. I actually rewatched AVPR before this movie to lower my expectations after waiting 8 years since Predators for another film. Boy, were we all let down.

The CG can get REALLY BAD, the acting is all over the place, there's no tone, the editing is beyond amateur, the pacing sucks, and did I mention that every 4 minutes we have to cut away from the action so we can tell more unfunny jokes?

Remember Hawkin's trademark joke about his girlfriend from the original? You have to hear two characters make it again for (no joke) 30 consecutive seconds.

Also how is the Predator scanning a computer when he doesn't even have his mask on????!!!!!! It didn't make any sense. I wouldn't blame a single person if they told me they walked out and it pains me to think of someone being introduced to the predator franchise through this movie. Everyone with creative control should be ashamed of themselves.

AVPR might still have more bland, punchable, cliche horror trope ""characters,"" but at least there are 20 minutes of Predator action. That's more than this movie offers and it's a total shame to say that, since no one wanted to like this more than me."

7.0,21 September 2018,"This film has everything.

I love the original film but this one ticked all boxes for me. At the end of the day it's a Shane Black franchise movie. It's not going to change lives.

Go into the film wanting a fun time and you'll get your moneys worth."
2.0,1 December 2018,"I don't typically like this kind of movie ...all out action... military...macho. Having seen the original several times though I like the central conceit and I do like sci fi.

This was good fun. A straggly band of soldiers...funny lines..good timing...a decent story. What was not to like?

So it leads me to think 1/10 ??? Why the offence? Why the disgust? Is it more about someone paying folk for bad reviews on IMDb? Is it more about dishonesty? I have to say yes.

I love films and have to say I've only ever marked a few films that low out of 100s. This smells funny to me.

If you're thinking of giving this a go...take a chance cos people are telling porky pies for some reason. Not cool."
7.0,10 July 2020,"LOL, mediocre at best movie turns into a global warming speech about the end of the human race in a few years. Yep, that is how you end up making a mockery out of a decent franchise. That and the cast of dopey characters, addition of Ghost Buster like dogs, and stupid plot."
1.0,9 February 2020,"You're either going to buy into this film after about half an hour or absolutely hate it. It's a real mixed bag but in my opinion in a (mostly) good way! I think director and co-writer Shane Black (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Iron Man 3, also appeared in the original Predator) along with writer Fred Dekker have produced an entertaining and outrageous instalment in the Predator series. It's very hard to not compare it to the original so I'll get that out of the way quickly now; nothing in the series since has managed to really capture the intensity and suspense of the first one. There are a few lines of dialogue in this one which they directly take out of the original (you can imagine which ones) and they do feel a bit cringeworthy here in my opinion. Apart from those few moments, I really enjoyed this one! It is genuinely hilarious at points most of the time intentionally and some times particularly towards the end unintentionally I imagine but still doesn't detract from the enjoyment. It is surprisingly a comedy for the most part and however that sounds will determine whether you'll like or hate it. The newly evolved 'Ultra-Predator' is an uncompromisingly brutal thing which is great as we get to see the iconic Predator return with its vicious bite! The gore is amazing and proves to be the highlight of the action sequences. Performance-wise, everyone is having fun and they all revel in the funny dialogue; you genuinely feel the affection between certain characters such as Thomas Janes' Baxley and Keegan-Michael Key's Coyle. The whole central group in the film are really funny and have some great moments when it's just them outside of the action interacting with each other. Jacob Trembley (Room, Wonder) also appears as Rory and proves yet again why he's one of the most talented younger actors today. Overall, it's all a lot more fun than Predators (2010) and brings the cheesiest and goriest aspects of the original along with it"

6.0,28 February 2019,"Ok i get all the bad reviews because the movie somehow messes with the orginal predator idea that a lot of people have come familiar with so what do i make of this movie? First of all i want to say that i can only see this movie as i standalone predator movie compared to all the other movies and thats because it feels totally different when you watch it and not in a good way, because when you start to watch a predator movie,you will have certain expectations. The movie starts actually in a very positive way and you feel hopeful that this could be pretty cool, and in some ways it is but not what you would expect. 2/3 of the movie is actually pretty fun but in the last 1/3 it gets a bit dull and the movie feels like it lacks that Wow factor. The action is pretty solid but forgetfull. and the story isn't that bad but what bothered me most was that you have the feeling you are watching a sci-fi action comedy and not a sci-fi action horror. I mean there is one bit with the predator that was actually pretty funny but it was kind of out of place. What made the orginal predator movie great was the tension it brought and to see the fear on the characters faces when they realized they were being hunted by an Alien being. The tension has been totally removed in this movie and it looks like no-one is that bothered about seeing a predator for the first time. But does that make it a bad movie, not really because i did enjoy the movie but not like i would normally enjoy a predator movie. If you expect a predator movie like the orginal arnie movie or the later Predators you will be really dissapointed. I went into this movie open-minded and what i got was an action packed film with some bad jokes but enjoyable nonetheless. If you compare to the other Predator movies it most likely will be your least favorite one but if you expect a fun action packed 2 hours then you actually might enjoy the movie the way i enjoyed it. I do hope if another Predator movie is made they will go back to how the first movie was and bring back the tension, because that was a classic, this unfortunately is pretty forgetfull. This is not a great movie bit i did enjoy it so my final verdict is based on that fact.

Not the best but by no means the worst. 6/10"

7.0,23 September 2018,"That is literally a thing Thomas Jane says in this move. This was a strange movie from start to end. It seems so weird to have so many jokes in a Preadator movie but several of them are actually pretty damn funny. The tone is definitely comedic not a horror film like the original or how this was billed when first announced. Also, there is soooo much talent in this movie and some of the performances, particularly the PTSD Avengers, but if they had one less expensive person, they could've finished the cgi, which is atrocious in places. This movie needed another month of visual effects and editing to feel finished.

Objectively, this should be a bad movie, but for some reason it's... fun. It's not serious, revels in how rediculous the premise is, and just goes with it. Its the predator movie you and your drunk friends would make."
2.0,13 September 2018,"To be fair my expectations were fairly low so I didn't hate the movie but I won't be watching it again. It gets ridiculous and ultra cheesey towards the end. It's not really a movie, more like a sketch show of action scenes sprinkled with comedy strewn together."
7.0,27 September 2018,"The original ""Predator"" from 1987 was a film full of mindless action done in a smart way. Every other sequel, spin-off, and reboot following has just been mindless action done really dumb. ""The Predator"", the new quasi-reboot/sequel, is no exception to that trend.

""The Predator"" tries to be a lot of things at once: an ultra-gory action thriller, a witty character comedy, and a relationship drama between family and friends. Instead, it's none of these things as each piece is weighed down by the other until the whole thing falls apart into one lazy mess.

""The Predator"" comes as the first failure by director Shane Black, who previously did well with ""Iron Man 3"" and ""The Nice Guys"".

Black's trademark use of witty banter doesn't go over well here like it has in his previous films. Most of the jokes are shoehorned in for the sake of having them and are delivered with little effort. They also seem really out of place. Dramatic scenes have jokes in them for no reason and scenes that are supposed to be comedic end up being dry.

Also, the whole tone of the film just feels off. It never settles and constantly keeps seesawing between hard action and silly over the top fun, which jarringly contrasts each other.

When the film is hard action, it's ordinary gory action that's been done better by others. Specifically, the whole third act of the film feels like a generic shoot 'em up. It's a huge disappointment considering that the film had been building up to this moment throughout the first two acts.

Along with the Fred Dekker, Shane Black also serves as a writer. Similar to his directing, Black's writing is lackluster and a letdown when compared to his previous work.

The overall plot comes off as lazy. There really isn't a big picture for the film and how it connects to the rest of the franchise. We do get some connectors and facts, but mainly they're just cast aside in favor of more action set pieces.

Another misstep is the introduction of the main character's son, Rory, who acts as a link between the aliens and humans. Just like every other kid in an action movie, Rory's only purpose is to artificially raise the stakes and force us to care for him just because he's a kid.

The biggest gripe against the writers is how they take the ""Suicide Squad"" approach towards the characters. We go around introducing each character and learn one trait about them. Then the characters only act on that one trait the whole movie, which quickly gets tiresome. Half of them don't even serve a point until they die at the end in a desperate attempt to make us care for them.

Stemming from the bad writing is some equally bad acting from the main cast.

Boyd Holbrook plays our lead character, Quinn McKenna, an elite stealth sniper. Holbrook is very boring in the role and plays the same ""conflicted army character with a heart of gold"" that we've seen over and over.

Just like Holbrook, Olivia Munn plays her character, Dr. Casey Bracket, like every other action movie scientist. She gives some science mumbo jumbo every few minutes and doesn't do much else.

Sterling K. Brown lacks his usual confidence here. He always looks unsure of himself as he doesn't know how to play his character. He wants to be a multi-layered villain but ends up being a cartoon.

One slight nod can be given to Keegan-Michael Key. His manic energy allows for some of the jokes to not totally fail.

Everybody's heard the saying, ""Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars."" Most films embody this statement, shooting too high and coming out average. ""The Predator"", on the other hand, does the exact opposite of this statement. It seems like the filmmakers didn't care enough to shoot for the moon. They shot for average at best and missed badly, leaving us with a film that feels like an empty shell of what it could have been."

2.0,6 October 2018,There's really no comparison to the original 2 movies but seeing the predator on screen again with a lot of radical new ideas is fun and entertaining. The comedy aspect of the movie falls prettty short. There are also just so many wtf moments where you ask yourself is this really happening. Overall if you go with few expectations and simply enjoy the predator it should be enjoyable.
6.0,23 February 2019,"I've been fairly interested in this one, mainly because of Shane Black, but missed it on it's theater run. My initial feeling of the film was that it tried to be something special, but the end result just wasn't there. I like the bloodiness (even if it's not quite the way I'd prefer), the quirky/comedic/macho comradery, the iconic theme, and altogether the film had a couple of nice moments. But there's still just too much of that bland modern actioner look and I felt it just suffocated a lot of the good underneath it. The first two Predators are known for their distinct looks and atmospheres, this won't be. The screenplay's also quite the mess. So unfortunately this chapter of the Whoopi Goldbergs from outer space isn't going to score many stars from me.

1.0,5 June 2022,"There are two scores for this film. If you are expecting a serious sci-fi horror film along the lines of Aliens or the original Predator, then this is a 0/10. Even the previous film called ""Predators"" is superior in that department.

However, this is clearly not the intent of this film. Directed by one of the guys who was part of the platoon in the original Predator, this film is clearly a tongue-in-cheek action-comedy about the Predator themes, and it just doesn't take itself seriously.

Watching it in that regard, it's actually a fun relaxed Predator film with some funny one liners (similar to the dialogue in the original Predator). The predators themselves also look great so this is a plus.

Watch this as an action-comedy, and wait for the next sci-fi horror Predator or Aliens film."
7.0,6 January 2023,"This is not a good movie. I don't even know what audience it is intended for. Obviously previous predator fans, but only if you expect previous Predator fans to still only be 12.

Why, oh why, was there a child in this? Bad, bad, bad decision. As soon as I saw the kid I was thinking 'this is going to be bad' and nothing ever proved me wrong.

The predator dogs! They were so bad. I know they had dog things in Predators but that was a bad decision too. You know when you watch a movie and think 'wow, a cool alien creature comes to earth to hunt with its way superior tech and senses' and then suddenly it turns out to be basically human? Yeah. Boring.

Lastly, the giant predator was awful."
1.0,15 September 2018,"The originals were cool but they're out dated. I was born not long after they came out and I enjoyed them. All the reviews I've seen that are bad are just people trying to defend something that has sentimental value to them. The Predator was good I don't care what anyone says. It had action, comedy and a decent plot. The biggest downside was the third act and some editing. But, the supporting cast really makes this movie special with its band of misfits and the crude comedy they bring to the film.

If you're going to rate or review a movie don't do it based off comparison. Ask yourself if you really enjoyed the movie. You can't tell me the characters and visuals weren't better than the original.

(No offense to the OG Predator fans)"
6.0,29 November 2018,"Lighten up. I agree with much of the criticism, but it's still a watchable movie that could have been much better. On the negative side, The Predator cannot make up its mind if it wants to be a space action thriller (like the original Predator), an adventure comedy with misfits (like Con Air), or a sci-fi social commentary (like Venom or Prometheus). Yes, there were fundamental errors. Like why is the hot single action science chick paired up with the happily married father? The chemistry between them is flushed, unused. She's extremely likeable, but undeveloped. Her character goes nowhere. The producers couldn't decide if the main character, a military sniper, is doing real violence or ""pretend movie"" violence. All the Dirty Dozen type military mental cases the hero hangs with are also involved with both real violence and comedy violence. The errors are in abundance. It was like they had a first draft of a great script and rushed to production, without fixing plot holes, character inconsistencies or even deciding on a consistent tone for the movie. Starship Troopers was a great movie because it embraced its own Cheesiness. The Predator could have been 3 great movies if they'd picked one direction and been consistent. Having said all this, it's still fun to watch. There are some great ""so bad it's good"" moments. Like when some clown puts together the entire relationship between the first Predator and the ones who follow based on ZERO information. Remember the 50's show Lassie? ""Woof, woof"". ""What's that Lassie? Timmy fell down the well at the Schwarzenegger Farm and is suffering lacerations and a concussion? Good dog!"" The main character, played by Boyd Holbrook, is a worthy successor to Arnold. He's badass but not cruel, funny, a good dad, chicks dig him and he delivers some great one-liners. He cruises through the confused story and comes out looking like someone we'd enjoy watching again. Ditto for the wasted Olivia Munn, who manages a role written for a bimbo to look and sound intellectually stimulating while being foulmouthed, sexually hot, and handles the physical parts of her role like a professional athlete. A lot of the dialog is really great, there are a ton of interesting characters, the lead actors are all superb and, hey, it's got Predators. They spent $88 million to make and bake this turkey, so visually and musically everything is professional. Is the rumor true that this script was found in a high school parking lot by a producer high on acid who rushed it into production before the LSD wore off? Just asking. Anyway, if you can turn off your critical thinking and go into ""so bad it's good"" mode, this movie is fun. I'll watch any sequel and hope there is an adult in charge who keeps the snappy dialog up to the same level but fixes the sinkholes in the continuity. I give the movie it could have been a 10, and this production a 2. Averages out to 6."
4.0,19 September 2018,"This movie was only similiar to the first movie in that it got it's predatory hands on my money. Where to begin? All movies are really just stories dreamed up by some writer with alot of tinsel thrown on top to cover the lack of plot. I could not really tell you what the story was about, an escaped Predator? No, an escaped Predator that just happens to land in the middle of a sniper assasination team. No, an escaped Predator, with an assasin, that crash lands and is captured by a snide, overzealous espionage bueraucrat. Let us not forget the alien pooch ""Ole Yeller"" running around, what was that about? This movie goes on and on with a rambling sense of entitlement and weird teenage tension between Olivia Nunn and the good ole boys. In the end, the story was really about spines being ripped out for DNA. I wanted to rip my own spine out after seeing this cluster f--- of a movie. Bad writing, bad movie, good alien Ole Yeller."

7.0,22 September 2018,"A pretty sweet Predator flick. Bloody, action filled and ends with a promise of countless sequels for the future... So things start off with a space battle between two predators, one crash lands on Earth, gets himself caught, loses his stuff, which just happens to be scooped up by a sniper there on a totally unrelated matter, but, shit happens. Now as you may have guessed, this predator escapes the lab, kills a whole bunch of scientists, gets a little human hunting in, a joke make throughout the movie is that the predators are actually hunters, and of course needs his crap back, which of course the sniper guy sends to, well blah blah blah, it ends up in his autistic sons hands and unlocks its powers, which of course can be tracked by the predator, and its around then when as you may have guessed, the other predator enters the scene, cause he can also track and you find out... well you saw the trailer, which literally gives the entire movie away. To me it felt like the Expendables met The Avengers to fight The Predators. The sniper guy gets thrown in with a bus filled with military men with mental issues, it was pretty amusing, Tom Jane and Keegan-Michael Key formed a pretty entertaining crazy person duo, Theon Greyjoy is there for some reason, oh yea to die, the most amusing is the two leads the characters Quinn, the sniper, and Nebraska, a dude that tried to kill himself, chain smokes and convinces all the crazies on the bus go round for round with an alien. Also, Nebraska chain smokes, and the constant reminders of smoking is bad is hilarious, when he's off screen, you can hear him coughing, at various times he runs out of breath and throws the cancer stick away, once you notice it, you can't un-notice it. I dunno, it was a fun movie, yes its pretty formulaic, and the main theme dealing with the Quinn's son has been done before, and before that, and ok it had a very lame attempt at using the quote ""Get to the choppers"" thrown in. I did really like the villian the flick, Traeger, the government dude sent to get the all the wonderful thing an alien species on Earth has to offer, he was a good bad guy, know what I mean? Yup so thats my convoluted mess of a review and I'm sticking with it. Can't wait for the next one, I'm such a nerd. Filmbufftim on FB."

In a way, most action movies are a little dumb but once you take them too seriously, imo, you're the one being silly. It's a fun movie. Stop expecting oscar scenarios with these flicks and you'll have a good time."
2.0,22 September 2018,"A drama lacking in screenplay. Although I saw a cut version, a horror film was adapted into a comedy. Manufacturers keep the concept of horror film is to have dead people should always arrange the die slowly, from reluctant to forced. The female lead from a researcher who knows how to operate a gun is a trained soldier. And the male lead acts as a hero rather than a survivor. A savior than a father."
7.0,16 September 2018,"Minuses: 1.The biggest problem is obviously that they have cut out a lot of scenes for some reason, which makes way for the most of the problems. 2.A lot of plot holes because of that, and a lot of questions unanswered. 3.They should improve on the script in some places.

Good things: 1.I really like the design of both predators. They looked cool enough. 2.Time really went by very fast watching this film for some reason, which happens very rarely for me. 3.Fighting sequences were good.

Verdict: Despite few problems, it was entertaining enough. If you ignore the plot holes, then you should be fine more or less. I really wouldn't want to blame Shane Black for everything. As I understand, the company did not like something in the beginning, so they ordered the crew to refilm/cut out many parts. I will be interested to see, whether they will add some scenes in the DVD version."

There are of course some plot holes that a better script could've ironed out. Same with the overall writing; if, as a writer, you are going to try to inject comedy into a violent movie it's best to have a writer on the team that knows how to write one-liner gags. It became painfully obvious Shane Black did not.

7.0,13 September 2018,"Reading reviews it's apparent ppl just want a remake of the first predator which is never gonna happen, they would cry if they remade it anyway and complain. Basically what Black does is give us more of a look into the Predator mythos, their tech, their capabilities, their brutality but makes it fun. It's a fun filled sci fi action movie and the characters are likable and you root for them. Critics are never gonna love a film that's simply for Predator fans and fans of fun no nonsense movies. Critics want Daniel Day Lewis playing a Predator after living like a lizard for 12 months in hopes to get in touch with mantra of the Yautja then they want the Predator to have a complex storyline for daddy issues and why his tribe are so not 2018 and need to have gender neutral predators....blah blah blah.... This movie is fun, fun fun and full of action and gore and just enjoyable. Bring on the sequels I want more!"
1.0,16 September 2018,"I finally had the opportunity to watch my first film in 4DX! I'm a gigantic fan of Predator (the monster more so than the entire series). I love the original, its one of two films that define my childhood. I've seen it so many times. I heard reviews for Shane Black's The Predator weren't so hot. Amidst the controversy of the sex offender cast in the film, I heard that this film was also generally bad. Now having seen it, I'd say I found it to be decent despite it being one of the lower ranked films in the series.

The film is about a Predator alien that comes to Earth to retrieve gear that was stolen from him. A crew of former soldiers and a scientist attempt to take the alien down. However, during confrontation they realize that there is another bigger and more advanced Predator on the planet as well and he starts to hunt them down. The film stars Boyd Holbrook , Jacob Tremblay, and Olivia Munn. Directed by Shane Black, who of course was in the original Predator film. This is crazy, but this is the first time I'm realizing how hot Olivia Munn is, wow.

The film is slow moving at times especially in the first act. It spends a lot of time with the characters and attempts to develop them. Its not always interesting when that's done here is one of the examples where that was the case. I'd say the film delivers on its action sequences. There is blood, gore and guts and its all welcome. The suit for the Predator looks nice but the CGI is jarring at times. Especially for the predator dogs and the Mega Predator. Parts of the film have humor which is kind of what I expected with Shane Black, it works sometimes and fails at other points. Some of the films acting is hammy but it is what it is. There were obvious references to earlier films in the franchise, which I honestly could have done without.

I did like that the films score was very reminiscent of the original film, that was a welcome callback. The monster's mystique remains intact which I liked. I wouldn't mind a sequel to the film but it needs to be a lot better. I think this was a passion project for Shane Black but it obviously could have been better, which makes me wonder what the film looked like before reshoots. I will say this though, this film series seems to be in a better place than Alien because Covenent basically killed that series. Overall, not necessary at all but an enjoyable theatrical experience, most likely made better through a 4DX experience.

Completely soulless movie made by people who clearly don't care for the franchise whatsoever, which is ironic considering Shane Black was the one directing it.

Anyway, not only is the film itself bad but it tries to ruin the ENTIRE franchise, expanded media and all, by retconning EVERYTHING fans know of the Yautja species. Why bother following up from the cliffhanger of ''Predators'', which was a pretty decent film when you can make a psuedo-comedy that butchers the franchises lore? At least Covenant didn't have characters cracking bad jokes all the time or the Xenomorphs holding decapitated arms with a thumbs up. This film just sucks and has little to no redeeming qualities. Dont even get me started on the ''Weaponize Autism'' thing or the deleted Ripley/Newt cameo. What were they thinking? Probably the biggest wasted potential is that the film doesn't even try to establish any form of continuity. They couldn't even care enough to make the hounds the same species as the ones from the 2010 film (and actually made the dogs look worse). Predators may as well just be a fan film for all that ''The Predator'' cares. Theres even an AVP easter egg in the film which means what exactly? That the AVP films are actually canon to the Predator franchise? What a mess. No wonder Arnold wanted nothing to do with the movie...I guess I can say if you're wanting a basic popcorn flick then sure, but if you're a FAN of the Predator franchise this is DEFINETLY not your movie."
9.0,22 November 2018,"That's all I want to say. I think director wanna gets a ""Alien 2"" taste but end up with a ""boring fighting and fighting"" mediocre film. I cry for Arnold and previous Predators."
6.0,29 September 2018,"This movie was able to fulfill all that it had promised, this film had fantastic action scenes / fights, fabulous spice effects, great actors, a complex and fantastic plot (which is really good), a good soundtrack and some overpowering scenes. It's really a shame this movie has this kind of horrible rating, which only proves that today's critics do not know anything; If you want to criticize film, criticize movies to not good movies; Criticize movies with Star Wars Hollyday Special, Dragon Ball Evolution, Piranhaaconda, Sharknado, Jurassic Prey, Birdemic Shock and Terror or The Amazing Bulk. One of the best films of 2018. I highly recommend it."
1.0,10 November 2018,"What have they done to the Predator? This must be the worst movie of 2018. What a horrible mess, what a trainwreck, what an insult to the fans and the original two movies. This movie should have never been made. Anyone who read the script and thought this was a good idea should have his head examined. Shane Black, I expected so much more from you.

1/10"
2.0,15 September 2018,"On Wednesday, the RT score was 64% and IMDB score was 7.7 (assuming it was the critics score as they watch the early screenings). Now it is plumbing down to (34%/6.3). This movie is being panned universally!

First things first, it depends on your mood. Well, my mood was good as I knew the director had written some of the best 80's and 90's movies (Lethal Weapon; Last Action Hero). and second he directed Iron Man 3. My happy hormones were more released as the IMAX screen projector had some technical issues and we were tranferred to another auditorium where they screened it in 4DX. That was nice as it costs a fortune watching movies in 4D!

The only issue was that there was no proper character development and the script was revolving too much around Rory (Jacob Tremblay...boy, he has a bright future ahead!). The comedy was a nice addition, unlike the original, but at some point it crossed the lines with too many unnecessary F-words.

I still give Shane Black enormous credit as he takes risks in directing 3rd/4th sequels. For instance Iron Man 3. How many directors do this? After the first sequel, most of the directors leave the franchise to avoid criticism.

I remember watching 1987 original movie with my family but still some of our folks found it boring. Consider the recent movie of a tribute to Arnold Schwarzenegger!"

7.0,13 November 2018,Yeah so i really enjoyed the predator with Schwarzenegger which is for me a real cult classic nonetheless this wasn't all that bad. So I guess the thing I liked was the music. Even tho the composer was Henry jackman in stead of Alan silvestre they managed to keep almost the same tune wich really gave me a predator feeling. Just watch it
2.0,22 August 2020,
9.0,13 August 2024,"The predator franchise has a very hit and miss history but for the most part they are at least enjoyable as some mindless action escapism, this movie however was painful to sit through, not only is it extremely self righteous and preachy, but the thing it preaches is objectively wrong and massively insulting. The gist of it is that autism= highly intelligent which in turn = the next step in evolution, which could not be further from the truth, autism is called a spectrum and classed as a disability for good reason, sure and there are high functioning individuals, but the condition itself is a defect that in the 100% of cases is a lifelong struggle and often times so debilitating that the person unfortunate enough to be inflicted with this incurable, untreatable condition will never experience things that ""normal"" people get to.

At best this movie is massively insulting to those of us with autism because it grossly misrepresents it as a positive thing and a form of evolution while glossing over the fact that even the most highly functioning people still struggle with aspects of the ailment.

At worst it is beyond tone deaf again by downplaying a literal disability so that some evidently out of touch writers and exec's can get on a soap box, use a subject they have less than 0 understanding of and pat themselves on the back for ""raising awareness"" or whatever they have convinced themselves they are doing.

I am classed as ""high functioning"" I can live independently and take care of myself and my property, I have also spent a number of years as a ""mentor"" for people younger than myself who are having a hard time accepting their diagnosis, between my own time in groups and charities and my volunteer work I have encountered thousands of people with autism, I have seen every possible symptom associated with the condition and the numer of people who are capable of living fulfilling, independant,funcitonal lives that they are content with can be counted on 1 hand because having a small enough number of symptoms and having them to small enough severity for this to not be a struggle have lower odds of winning the lottery, one quick example is a man in his twenties who is obsessed with health and exercise, he has completed marathons, triathalons, iron man competitions, rock climbing, you name it he's done it and by all accounts when interacting with him he can pass for ""normal"", but he is so bad at basic human functioning ( cleaning, changing clothes, washing clothes, feeding himself etc) that when he tried to move out of his parents home and have his own space his health deteriorated to the point where he was hospitalized, of course that is not going to be the case for all of us, that is just an example to show how rare it is for this condition to be anything other than a handicap in your life, it is so rare that even people who are considered to be on the ""high functioning"" end of the spectrum are still afllicted to the point where they will need constant supervision for their entire time on this earth.

I did not get diagnosed until I was a young adult, I went my whole school life being bullied because as far as people knew my awkward mannerisms, lack of eye contact and mumbling when trying to start a conversation weren't a sign of anything, I was just branded as ""weird"", the point of telling you this is that I spent 16 years in formal education being ""weird"", I grew up hearing every insult you can possibly imagine but even with that long history I can still say without a shadow of a doubt that sitting through this movie is the most insulted I have ever been, I genuinelly do not think it is possible to create something more tone deaf than this."
7.0,9 October 2021,Its like a fan film on youtube with a huge budget. A comedy trash version of a predator movie...as if the director said: u know what...we will make it sharknado style.
4.0,18 September 2018,"So you looove the original Predator movie (like me), are a fan of P2 and enjoy the rest of the movies for what they are... This falls into the latter category. Nothing will ever match up to the original so keep an open mind if possible.

I would describe this as a Predator in suburbia such as in AVP requiem except with no Aliens. The main protagonists are a rag-tag bunch of military vets akin to the A-Team, except there's just one Face and a whole bunch of Murdoch's. And that Jessica Biel character is there too.

Pretty typical modern day action movie - good action and comedy but lacks suspense."
1.0,9 November 2018,"Worst cast ever! Movie script boring! Action? What action? And copying cheesy dialogues from the original? Come on!!! From the beginning this movie seems rushed and very annoying with the constant unnecessary swearing, and that black dude, Sterling K Brown, dude stop trying to be a badass! His acting in the movie makes you want to punch your tv so hard!!! ""Shame"" Black you should be ashamed of yourself with such poor script and a so called predator movie."
7.0,17 May 2020,"This film would have been a bit better if it was a stand alone film, not a poor try to reboot the franchise of ""The Predator"". In this movie, there are too many turn events and characters making stupid decisions. The actors were fine not much to say Jacob Tremblay's character was a poor choice for the film. In every event there was an issue resolved with another issue. Zero twists and if there was any twist then they didn't give it much attention."
1.0,1 October 2018,"So I just saw the new Predator movie at the theater. Honestly I really wasn't expecting much as the franchise has greatly gone downhill over the years. I was willing to give the film a try however since I am a fan of some of the cast members. Unfortunately the film somehow fell even lower than my expectations. It was a complete mess with shiny CGI peppered in for good measure.

The film is a weird hodgepodge of cringe-worthy comedy, bad acting, a ridiculous story, and of course the biggest sin for an action movie it was boring. No one sees a movie like Predator for its compelling story or award winning acting, you see it for some badass action. The movie completely drops the ball in this regard. Besides a fresh coat of CGI paint this movie is a noticeable drag in comparison to the other Predator films. Action movies should be entertaining, doesn't seem like a difficult concept to grasp.

Gone are any likable or compelling protagonist in any way. Every character is a carbon copy of each other with some minor tweaks. Jacob Tremblay really deserves better material to work with then this. Same goes for Keegan-Michael Kay and Thomas Jane. Also can we all agree that Olivia Munn is just a terrible actress. Can we please stop casting her in parts?

I couldn't help but think about how inferior this movie is to the original films. It reminded me about how inferior most action remakes and continuations are to the originals. I'm not sure if it's just an over-reliance on CGI and a lack of quality directors for the genre, but action movies have suffered in quality over the years.

Overall the movie had relatively boring action scenes, a ridiculous cliche ridden plot, walking caricatures as characters, and was just all around not a fun watch. I was not a fan, 4 out of 10."
7.0,1 December 2018,"The Predator (2018) is a project you hear about and instantly get excited over. A return to a franchise with a very good first instalment, an underseen and underrated second instalment, and...other movies and crossovers.

All directed and co-written by Shane Black, who brings things full circle having been cast in the original and punching up its script. It's been a long time since 1987's classic, but Shane Black too has had a lot of time to grow and evolve and hit peaks of his craft. Coming back to the well, however, brings mixed results.

Black, by no easy feat, has written and sometimes directed some of the smartest, funniest, genre defining and defying flicks in the last few decades. He's done things small - like Kiss Kiss Bang Bang - and he's done things big - like Iron Man 3. All of his films evoke his charm, his characters, his humour, his unconventional and unique storytelling.

The Predator has a lot of Black hallmarks, but much like shifting a focus to Halloween rather than Christmas, The Predator is a little off. It's no fault to the characters, The Predator has a fantastic cast and the dialogue is on point as expected other than a few eyebrow raises and deliveries. Just when you think the movie has gone without a good joke for a while, it'll hit you with a pinpoint Disneyland joke you don't expect.

Once we get all of our people together on a mission, they rock. They make us laugh and they make us interested. It doesn't hurt that the cast is fantastically charismatic. From the always perfect Sterling K Brown to the forever surprisingly effective Olivia Munn, the supporting cast round out a film full of great lines and characters that make a bunch of misfits super watchable. Unfortunately, the movie isn't called ""The Misfits Hang Out and Are Hilarious"", it's called ""The Predator"", and that's what brings things down.

It's all a hazy mess in regards to what's actually going on with The Predator side of the film. You can infer a lot and some characters flat out state what's going on or what they take to be the Predator's plan of attack, but it's all a bit clunky. Predators in general are watchable and easy to get as a concept, but The Predator falls down the biggest trap that is ""the sequel must be bigger and better"". A much bigger Predator does not a instantly effective movie make.

The whole idea of this Uber Predator, plus the evolution of Predators as a whole as explained in the film, feels awfully weak and cheap, much like some of the effects. For all the amount of fun I had with the story and the action and the reversals and the humour and the characters and the dialogue...The Predator fell down on what I was expecting to see.

Some of the ideas were silly, and not the good tongue-in-cheek-fun silly. And that's what brings it down for me. The Predator is a good fun time that ticks a lot of expectations for Shane Black - one of my personal favourite screenwriters - but it doesn't tick a lot of expectations for a good Predator sequel. Maybe stick to Danny Glover in the big city."
5.0,21 September 2018,"This movie was absolutely disappointing. From the terrible humor that only a fourth grader would find funny, to the horrendous plot and cgi. This movie fails on all levels. I keep asking myself why do I keep watching all of these franchise reboots? Hasn't anyone in these studios realized to fix the previous mistakes of reboots? I don't think so. It's all just a cash grab..."
6.0,13 September 2018,"The Predator is a pretty good franchise.. In my opinion none of the movies are directly bad. Alright, AVP:Requiem maybe isn't a classic, and Predators was a slight miss, but the rest are pretty decent. Of course the original being the best. Anyway, we now have another one, and I'll be damned if that one isn't good as well! Actually, I'd say it's bloody good. *wink wink* Tons of humor, tons of action, no shaky cam, a whole bunch of recognizable faces, from Olivia Munn to Jake Busey, and the best part? It's rated R. And it's not one of those R-rated movies where you doubt if it actually IS rated-R. There is no doubt. The blood is splashing and heads are rolling. It's very enjoyable. The chemistry between the characters, especially the ""team"" is excellent, and I ended up liking them all. The kid is good, Miss Munn is good, it's all good, ya dig!? I enjoyed it very much. It's just super entertaining to watch the Predator tear stuff up. And by stuff, I mean people. I'm sure it might be a little breezy for some, with little sense of real danger, and the music seems sort of Star Warsy and out of place, but in the big picture I just didn't really care about those small complaints. Shane Black really did good with this one, I hope people go to see it. Superb popcorn entertainment, with a side of blood."

The humour was crude and vulgar- totally unnecessary and just awkward to sit through. The storyline was totally unoriginal. For a movie meant to be about predators, there was more screentime with humans. I felt like we barely saw the predators! Gave it a 2/10 cos the predators themselves looked cool, can't fault the costume design. Otherwise would have given zero."

6.0,20 September 2018,"I whana say something right away - if Michael Bay or any other typical blockbuster movies director helmed this, it'd be way worse. Shane Black (Director of such crime comedies like ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" & ""The Nice Guys"") left his distinct mark in ""The Predator"" franchise, giveing us healthy amounts of dark comedy and awesome characters. I mean, putting a group of mentally disturbed war veterans in the focus of the movie is pretty damn awesome. The dark toned comedy, the characters and the fate of those characters were the things that made this movie better, because everything else was, honestly, quite generic. The action and kills were nice, but nothing over-the-top. In some moments I could even smell a wisp of cheapness regarding the cgi, but there were just a few of those moments. One thing that I really disliked about this movie was Jacob Tremblay's character, I feel as if it kinda made the movie worse. Didn't need no kids here & this is an overpowered character, not to mention that it's, in my opinion, also the worst role of the young and rising Jacob Tremblay. The ending also disappointed me a little, it was hold up as a mystery & they revealed the plot detail only at the end, after all the anticipation it came out as kinda lame. You whana know what it was? Go see it. Because it is worth enough, especially, if you are this franchises fan. It's different, but not really worse. My rating: 7/10."
3.0,25 August 2020,"This movie is an absolute insult to a franchise. It started fine, but it was falling deeper and deeper by each shot. In the 3rd act it was absolute garbage. I do not recommend this to anyone. Only if you want to see a Scooby-Doo or Jurassic World spinoffs."
6.0,15 September 2018,"I'm not sure why people keep expecting Predator movies to be an Academy winning effort. Yes, it's cheesy, yes there's far-fetched action but so was the original. Expect 80's action movie and that's what you'll get."
1.0,14 October 2018,It's a good film but not beautiful. Predator is a very beautiful concept
8.0,18 September 2018,"Terrible. As a stand alone film, with no expectations of following its predecessors it may just scrape a 4 star. As an addition to a much loved franchise it falls way short, on a par with AVP Requiem. Uneccesary story, uneccesary ""humour"" , terrible editing, uneccesary ""giant"" predator laced together with some very average CGI (sometimes bordering on laughable) and the least said about the end the better. It's not just nostalgia either, watch the other Predator films first (yes, even Predators ((which I actually liked)) or AVP) then watch this and decide. How could it have gone SO wrong?"
6.0,24 March 2019,"Great sci-fi thrillers of the past used to go out of their way to capture an element realism. Those film-makers, the ones that were visionary sci-fi directors, were not hamstrung by the effects technology... they planned the shots and adapted according to what worked for the story and tone of the movie. It's well documented how in the original predator the Fx people sent down a red ""crab creature"" to the shoot location, and the filmmaker basically said, this is not going to work, and got someone else to design the rastafari Predator we know and love.

In the modern era, however, we have directors who are better at comic book story-boarding than they are at filmmaking (think about it... when you pitch your film with an entire story board vs. a mere text screenplay, how much less vision and trust is required from the producer to open up their wallet!) And the dialogue / writing ends up sounding like it was lifted off the pages of a comic book as well.

I suggest watching ""The Abyss"" to see how story premise can be used to create tension. Even though that film flows into several sub-conflicts, there is constant demands put on the audience to anticipate what will happen next. What does the alien look like. Is it friendly or hostile. Who will survive.

Modern comic book style sci-fi films, none less than ""The Predator"", abandon that approach and instead try to entertain you with ""Deadpool"" like *shocker* dialogue, and as filler gouge out the audience's eyeballs to CGI effects that come so fast and frequent that suspension of the laws of physics becomes trope, as does the Sarah Conner gritty female who can fight better than the men. As others have mentioned, this film gives a female biology professor who goes from cowering in a heap to blasting away with an AR like she's John Rambo. OK PC Hollywood. But did you also have to go all ""Mercury Rising"" on us?

And BTW, the IMDB ""filters"" prevent using the kind of language that you will find in this film, as well as the kind of review it truly deserves. I would say this movie is not just a ""pass"", but one of those movies where Predator fans should be writing angry letters to the studio. That's how bad it is. So why 3 stars and not 1? Because there are a few places where they were creative in tying back to the original film: namely ""Get to the Choppers""... a ridiculous scene, but one that was actually funny in a creative way. But then again, I'm someone who likes this franchise so much I would rate AVP at about a 7/10 and AVP2 a 6. In many ways, this film has a lot in common with AVP2... even to the point of having a ""good"" predator have to take on a bigger, tougher ""hybrid"". The difference is that AVP2 made no bones about being a B-movie slasher film where everybody is going to die... kids, dogs, they don't care. ""The Predator"", on the other hand, film tries to resurrect an epic-premise, the alien hunter vs. the elite soldier, and falls all over it's face trying to do it."

If you love romping irreverent military unit banter this will be up your alley. I don't know what people thought they were getting when they were so disappointed in this movie. It's not perfect, but the cast collected for it was outstanding, and overall it was a lot of damn fun.

10.0,7 December 2018,"Building a story from the alien's thinking is commendable! Although the quality of the film itself is not very good, there are many scattered and illogical places... But what must be encouraged is that, for the first time in the entire series, the film attempts to establish a social structure that includes aliens. The behavior of people and aliens in the film is limited to a social framework determined by the biological chain. They and their actions are limited by their position and hierarchy in this social structure, and thus are no longer merely struggles between individuals."

But the sad thing is that many of the very good story/script elements, you see from around start to around mid of the film, were not developed and executed, even satisfactorily, further in the film. This is very disappointing.

One other thing which frustrates a bit, was the fact that many things were left mostly unexplained. The story was not sufficiently clear and there wasn't a proper closure around many elements.

I went to see this film because of the Director, who has directed several good films in the past, but this movie is an exception in that regard. Movie, ultimately, at the end, comes out as very underwhelming. Should be avoided unless you are a die hard fan of the franchise."

I've been a die hard Predator fan since the original release, reading the comics, playing the games and even drawing the creature. I've always felt it was a very versatile ip. It's humour worked for me (I knew it would be funny considering the directors previous work), it didn't destroy the lore (unlike recent star wars movies), its vfx and creature work by ADI were top notch and it didn't take itself too seriously. Editorially it was somewhat messy and perhaps that were down to cuts for running time and oft mentioned reshoots but i understood exactly what was happening. I wish people would get off its back. It'll never compare to the original but then that's not the point here. Leave your brain at the door and have a laugh with it."

The problem is this sequel tried too hard: Olivia Munn, a scientist who out of nowhere sudden knows how to handle a gun and jump on top of a running bus and go face to face with a predator, oh and let's not forget, is all hardcore and feisty, ike really?

6.0,9 February 2019,"It started off the first 12 minutes or so like the predator sequel I wanted but quickly devolved. The gore was made on someone's old laptop. The story of a bumbling ragtag group of soldiers saving the day was asinine.

A 10 year old saves the day. This is by far the worst in the series. At least requiem tried to be serious. Don't bother watching especially if you are a fan it will just make you angry. Watch the original or 2."
1.0,14 August 2019,"First, this film is not a "" serie B "" film. He has good special effects and it is a professional film.

Now that is clear, let's get into it.

This film is hard to review because on the first hand, he is good, actors arent that bad and predators arent that bad too.

But on the other hand, the movie is not as serious as previous predator's movies . He contain a lot a jokes and it's a decontracted movie. You can watch it without a lot of concentration, nothing hard to understand.

And that is on this point that the film is dissapointed , Predator is a strong license with badass characters . This film could have been a Serious movie with capital issues and the comeback of famous actors that would have lead to raise the level of the license but no that is clearly not the case.

To finish , This film is good but not as good to say that he bring trough the reputation of the predator licence that has been mocked by the press and spectators the few past years with bad predator episodes."

2.0,22 December 2018,"Concise version, I enjoyed the movie.

It has quite a bit of comedy and the premise is solid enough.

It's better than the previous predator movies, with the exception of the original.

Probably more a watch at home movie than a cinema experience."

1.0,5 January 2019,"I really should have known better and never given this film a second of my time. Where to begin? The movie is yet another stain on the true Predator film that we were given in 1987. Maybe if I was a fan of the never ending Avengers stuff and the non-stop Marvel and DC conveyor belt I might feel different. If you are unfortunate enough to have wasted time watching this it will be no mystery to what audience Mr. Black has made this film for - and he went so far as to have based it on similar template, complete with his own version of tired Iron Man which will likely spawn more dribble in the form of exactly what the world needs more of; sequels. The soundtrack is awful and lacks any dynamics and strikes me as something one would find on a royalty-free source (if such exists). The acting is cliche and the supporting cast adds zilch to the film other than slight, sophomoric humor. In the end I'm absolutely shocked this movie was not a hit among the tireless hordes of superhero fans out there. Would I watch the next film (the sequel)? Not if you paid for it. In fact, I will outright steer clear of anything I see Shane Black's name on in the director role. Shane has one film under his belt for writing credits I enjoyed which was Lethal Weapon... And it appears his role in Iron Man 3 has shown him the fruit to be had with the very average Marvel formula (a surefire recipe for the demise of art in film making)."
1.0,19 September 2018,"The Predator (2018) takes place in the same universe as some of the previous movies. How do you know? They reference previous visits.

The story is pretty good, though there are some pretty serious plot holes. It starts with Quinn McKenna and his troop of fellow military guys in Mexico and while they're trying to rescue some hostages an alien ship crashes through their group. Knowing nobody will believe him he takes some items from the crash and mails them home. Soon after he's arrested, interrogated and to discredit him they deem him insane. On the military paddy wagon he meets up with other soldiers with various disorders.

McKenna's son, who is probably the best character of the movie, has Asperger's. He's bullied at school and they show us how his amazing mind works. The box his dad sent winds up at the house and using his unique mind he decodes the language, figures out how to use their computers and then wears the items out for trick or treat. He's found by the bullies but escapes, then he's found by his dad and their new crew just as the Predator crowd catches up. What ensues is at times confusing.

Questions remain such as: Why is the Predator dog friendly to the people, always following them, but never used in any way to further the plot? How do the people know the hybrid Predator was bringing Earth something to help them? Yes, they deciphered the language but it's unclear. How did the dad know how to get in the craft later? Does he understand the language too? Why does Dr. Bracket seem to be just as much of a military action person as the rest when her backstory doesn't seem to say that?

For me, there was far too much unnecessary cursing, especially from the kid. The violence was much more geared towards the Predators but there are various human mutilations and lots of shooting/stabbing/slashing deaths. There were a few moments with good humor, which is needed to break the tension in some movies. There were some sexual innuendo bits, but primarily from the guy with Tourettes.

I liked it and would likely see it again. I wouldn't recommend it for kids. I've given this six stars."
7.0,1 January 2021,"Hollywood please stop. Too much CGI oh, nobody goes to locations and films anymore a walking stereotype"
2.0,17 September 2018,"It was fun but the editing was horrible, it took unexplained leaps of faith and had gaps where there should have been a simple explanation. The third act was obviously reshot when Sterling K. Brown took off his magically appearing uncloaked sunglasses from inside the Predator ship at night.

The practical effects were incredible and the Predator suit and animatronic facial movements were the best that franchise has ever had. But, as if a 7 foot Alien hunter wasn't scary enough, they had to introduce a 10 foot Alien-hunter hunter and that was a CGI slap in the face to the practical FX work on the man-in-a-suit creature.

If Star Wars 'fans' think Rey is a Mary Sue they should take a long hard look at Olivia Munn's Scientist lady turned back-flipping, grenade launching, commando and Predator cloaking technology expert.

I enjoyed the humor, I liked the actors and characters in the squad of loony commandos but the story lost itself three quarters through and the little stinger/cliffhanger at the end took too many leaps over believability and into anime territory. Overall, it was a lot of fun to watch but it's the Justice League of the Predator franchise."
7.0,18 September 2018,Whats there to say...? The filmmakers really wasted this chance to reboot/reskin the franchise. Filled to the brim with plot holes and amazingly inconsistent across the board. Worst film in the series? Yes! even worse than AVP:R
1.0,28 December 2018,"If you go into this expecting a 10 film you'll be disappointed. If you immerse yourself in the senseless violence and crude language you just might mess around and be entertained. I went into watching this seeing the horrible user reviews and found myself entertained enough to keep watching till the end. If you're looking for an elaborate plot, look elsewhere. If you're looking for mindless, violent fun, give it a try."
7.0,22 September 2018,"Before you read my review, you must know I have never seen none of the prior films of the Predator franchise, so, now that you know, go on.

I found this film so fast-paced that I wanted to end already, and it was only halfway.

The story was so absurd and idiotic, that the movie gets really boring. The characters suddenly appear in other locations so fast and misteriously that breaks the rythm horribly.

And the dogs... wtf was that about!? And the ending is so lame, ugh, this was a terrible cinematic experience, I wished the Predator cut through the screen and annihilate us all at once instead of continuing watching this trash."
1.0,17 September 2018,"A great group of characters made this movie fun to watch. I laughed and was very entertained. So if your not a Predator geek and just want a few laughs with great action, this movie is for you."

6.0,17 September 2018,
2.0,22 September 2018,"Terrible storyline, actually I'm not sure is there even was one. Characters were just as bad, none of the had anything interesting about them. Cheesy lines from the original film, I'm so glad Arnie had nothing to do with this shambles of a film. It was like watching Disney Pixar's version of predator, they had an annoying kid, CGI pets and as many crap jokes as they could fit into a very boring 1:30. If you loved the original predator, this is not for you!"
2.0,9 November 2018,"You have have expected to see something like the prior movies, dark and serious most of the time, scary, with a predator that is almost impossible to kill. This movie is different, it is light, funny, and bring some new idea for why the predator arrives to earth. This franchise may have many sequels, as it's always great to fight the predator, and each movie may be different, one thing is sure, predators are coming to earth, so there's always a movie to make. Some characters in this movie makes you wonder why they are in the movie, it could be much more efficient with less. Also it seems to be not so hard to kill a predator as you may think or used to. The best actor in the movie is a kid. It is must see movie even if not perfect, as it's part of a franchise, but it could have been done much better, in all aspects, you will understand once you see it. This is probably the worst predator movie of all, but still - watch it."
7.0,17 January 2019,There is absolutely nothing worthwhile in this film. You're better off watching Mac and Me if you're in the mood for an alien action film.
3.0,25 September 2018,"In the future it is possible but ""Iron Man"" is more realistic."
6.0,9 April 2024,
3.0,16 January 2021,Going into this one with low expectations made it an okay experience. The first two acts of the movie are actually enjoyable with a good mix of action and humour. Then things just go bad and it's all downhill afterwards...
7.0,12 January 2019,"I give credit to the company who cut the trailer together; well edited from the source material. The score stayed true to the original movies, and the Predator itself is still a great concept. This is on the other hand, is just clumsy, pointless, derivative and entirely frustrating to view over the almost 2 hour runtime. Puzzling why this even got the green light. Oh right, cash grab."
1.0,21 September 2018,This movie was fun from start to finish. I had a great time.
9.0,19 October 2018,"This film should never have existed

there is nothing good about this film, nothing. the actors do not have charisms. The film does not tell anything! I fell asleep after 5 minutes ..."
7.0,15 September 2018,"In 1987, a new science fiction icon was established, an apex hunter that proved its merit by tackling the threat of mercenaries led by America's action star Arnold Schwarzenegger. Yes, it was Predator, the franchise about alien hunters setting out to... well I guess hunt. Filled with gore, cheesy stories, and interesting technology, the Predator franchise has continued to secure its foothold in science fiction community, continuing to please the super fans in its numerous media. Tonight's review is on the latest addition to the field, with a gigantic cast, a controversial media story, and what looks to be another special effects fest. Robbie K is back with another review as he gives his opinions on:

Movie: The Predator (2018) Director: Shane Black Writers: Fred Dekker, Shane Black Stars: Boyd Holbrook, Trevante Rhodes, Jacob Tremblay

LIKES:

Acting (primarily Olivia Munn and Jacob Tremblay): It's a star-studded cast loaded with talent And this rag tag band of crazy mercenaries feels like a modern assortment of the classic squad. While more diverse than our original group, this squad had enough bite to their acting to make the characters diverse, and the crazy believable as they brought the hammer down. While I nod my head to all performances, Olivia Munn and Jacob Tremblay were my favorites, their character balanced, involved, and the performances detailed in their respective quirks.

The Special Effects: The evolution of technology means flashier graphics, bigger explosions, and more detailed imaginations coming to life. No surprise, The Predator is back and abusing the heck out of the computer generating images, crafting deadlier, more brutal aliens who are ready to kill in the goriest ways. Fluid movements, detailed costumes and designs that are brought into beautiful displays, and technology that is the edgiest arsenal we have seen. These effects are going to immerse you into the hunt, and really drop you into the blood bath that this series has been famous for.

The Story (kind of): Okay, it's not the most basic of the predator stories, and it has sort of diverged from the straightforward kill for thrills that the franchise has bathed in for years. It attempts to springboard a new connecting arc, that attempts to give a point past the hunt, and parts of it really did work for me as they connect the series. As such, the series could utilize this new story element to bring with it a new turn of events, it just depends on the execution components.

The Comedy: Half the cast is from the comedy genre era, so you were expecting laughs. The Predator has some nicely timed, clever jokes unleashed like a laser blast from the Predator's cannon. References to the first film, famous movie tropes, and some insult comedy go a long way in this film, many of which work to relief the bloody tension that comes with the thriller.

The Predator Feel: While not the most traditional of the bunch, The Predator still has much of the same components you love of the series. The Gore, the overkills, and the grandiose displays of gunplay vs. alien technology are there to keep you engaged in the bunch. It is ridiculous, it is over the top, and brings with it a lot of satisfying Predator goodness that was established back in the 80s.

The Action: I've hit the nail on the head multiple times, but I have to say that this installment has the fastest paced and the greatest number of sequences of the film. The Predator takes many potshots at the action angle, utilizing the chaos to bring about more chaos in an attempt to keep our heart pumping fast. Some of these fights are off the chain exciting, while others don't quite live up to the snuff. Nevertheless, the pace is thrilling to keep you engaged in the film.

DISLIKES:

The Sloppy Character Development: It's a Predator movie, I know it's not the point of the series, but this film tried to try to elaborate on the backstories of the group. Nodding to their attempts at change, if you are going to try to establish characters, do a little more to really get us connected to the group. Should this franchise out, we need a little more sustenance to the group, so that we can actually root for them in the end. However, Jacob Tremblay did get a good development so kudos to them.

The Grandiose Speeches: We know this series is hard to take seriously when it comes to the dialogue, but this movie did a little too much inspirational preaching for my blood. It was fun at first, but by the fourth speech, the lines had become stale, the timing inappropriate, and the emphasis/passion of the speech was missing. It was pointless to me at these points.

The Over Excessive Cursing: Shocker, I don't like the haphazard use of the F bomb, but Predator's lazy writing just kept rocking it from the speakers with no end in sight. It's a small dislike, but something that shows writing still has a long way to go in the art of balance.

The Story: While I appreciated the springboard ideas, Predator still has a long way to go to achieve the story it wants. It offers not so much a challenge, as a very shallow, cut to the point, ridiculous fest that Sci-Fi genre loves, but has started to cross into the eye rolling zones. As the movie ends, there is potential, but the movie needs to pick a direction to roll, is the main limitation is the film's inability to decide which plot setting it wants to go. The Predator just tries to take too many paths, and seems confused as to which one it wants to stick with as it tries to reach new levels of campiness.

The Comedy: Some of the comedy is great as I mentioned before, however this installment tries too hard at times to get a laugh. Predator is meant to be indirectly funny, but this one was a little too forced on me that it didn't see fitting to be in this franchise. As such, the relentless humor takes away from the movie and leads to some of the mixed reviews that you are reading. Again, the comedic relief is appreciated when timed, but too much of a good thing usually goes bad.

Sterling K Brown's Character: I get it, bad guys are supposed to not be liked, but this particular villain is more obnoxious than threatening/evil. Again, this comes from incomplete character development and an aimless story idea, but Mr. Brown's talents were not the best utilized in this film. I would have liked more development, more threats, and less unyielding taunting that they took the character in. Not the best antagonist in the series, and certainly not the best film editing techniques with him either.

Quantity vs. Quality Action wise: As much as I like action, I like scenes where the fighting has impressive choreography, strategy with creativity, and lasts a decent time to make the skirmish worthwhile. The Predator has these moments that I love, but many are short bouts of carnage that seem to be just fillers to extend the movie length and show more special effects. Quantity is good for pacing, but The Predator needs to focus on quality to really seal the deal for the next installment. Utilize that suspenseful nature with the technology like the end game, and you've got potential to make some of the best fighting scenes in the series.

The Classic Predator: From a story aspect, I understand the inclusion, but the trailers really focused on differentiating the two as the selling points. Sadly, outside of some contributions, the classic model doesn't do as much as you hope it will. The focus was more on the super predator and it would have been nice to see more done with the creature that started it all. Sorry, but the studio needs to make up its mind as to which predators they want to focus on, instead of just creating new ones for the sake of creating new ones.

The VERDICT: Overall, The Predator is a mixed bag of tricks in terms of the quality it brings. On the one hand it's got all the science fiction action you could want with the carnage and special effects to maximize the chaos. Like all Predator movies, the fans will enjoy the hunt and the poor extras who try to face this colossal sized creature and it offers some major potential for them to follow up on. However, the movie struggles to find the directions it wants to take, primarily in the story vs. action. Vs comedy and that is where it divides people. The series needs to research its origins and choose the direction for the next installment, making sure to emphasize quality instead of quantity. Still, it's worth a trip to the theater for the special effects alone and will certainly rattle your ear drums with the deafening sounds.

My scores: Action/Adventure/Horror: 7.0 Movie Overall: 6.0"
2.0,14 November 2018,"When I heard they were making a new Predator film and it wasn't going to follow on from Predators (2010) I was disappointed. Whilst Predators wasn't as good as the 1987 original it was still a decent film from which to build on for the future.

Then I heard Shane Black was involved and my disappointment turned to interest. After all, this is a guy who was actually in the amazing original Predator (1987) movie, and who had written Lethal Weapon, and directed Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. Surely a solid and safe pair of hands.

How wrong I was. This may be one of the worst films I have ever seen. It is bad and amateur in every way. I do not know where the budget went. If you adjust the budgets of Predator and Predators for inflation they come out at 33,000,000 and 51,000,000 USD respectively (up to 2018). This stinking piece of garbage cost 88,000,000 USD! Did they spend it all on cocaine and hookers? It certainly didn't go in to CGI, sets, paying for top talent or the script or screen play.

The story comes across as being a mishmash of ideas they threw at the wall to see which stuck - and then decided that they would use ALL the ideas anyway, even the ones that fell on the floor and rolled behind the refrigerator and started to go moldy. Almost anyone who has watched a Predator movie could have written a better, more intelligent and interesting story than this. It makes almost no sense, its stupid, and pushes the Predator backstory in to ridiculous territory. The script is so inane you can almost feel brain cells screaming out in pain and then exploding. It tries to give a subtle nod and wink to the original movie, but is so brutally handled it comes across as parody. And the end scene; we're entering Power Rangers territory here!

And then the 'acting'. Wow. I have no idea how Olivia Munn keeps getting cast in big budget roles. She must have friends in high places. Boyd Holbrook is the quintessential 'made for TV' leading man - forgettable, wooden and untalented. The rest of the cast are all on the same mediocre level. I don't think we can fully blame them though; Thomas Jane has put in some good performances in The Mist and The Expanse so we know he can do better. I guess they just had to go with what Shane Black gave them, take the pay packet and try and forget they were ever involved.

I can only hope that this film flopped hard enough that the Studio Execs put it to rest forever, or at least until they find a better team to resurrect it. Preferably someone who cares about more than a pay check. Shane Black should not be allowed to write or direct any more movies. I had hoped Iron Man 3 was a blip on his career, but this is a whole new level of awful!"
1.0,18 November 2018,"Wait.. what? Is this a joke? Who greenlit this? Who made this? Who produced this?

This movie is simply a bad comedy posing as an action movie. It's probably the wackiest movie ever made.

The only explanation I can come up with is that the director, screen writer and producer were pretty high from smoking insane amount of weed and one of them said 'hey bro let's make a movie.' Then his friend said: ' yeah... there's gonna be action, boom, mutilation, boom, guys doing action stuff, boom, shooting and killing, boom, lots of shooting and killing, boom boom.'

The producer stood up and said ' Let's f#cking do it.'

They high-fived each other and then we got this abomination."
7.0,31 July 2022,Who ever knew that climate change is the reason the predator came to earth to take us over. It's so lame that you can't even make this stuff up. This is the worst one yet.
3.0,20 September 2018,"In the day and age of marvel and action popcorn fun what were people expecting ?? I have read the 1 and 2 star reviews and they are not reflective of what the film was supposed to be I don't think. Plenty of action , a plot not as bad as some people have mentioned. And it was Shane black so there was always gonna be some comedy too. For me it was fast paced fun was on for 1hr 45 mins but barely felt that long. I love the original predator and enjoyed predator 2 and think that this compliments them nicely without being the classic the first one was. but was it ever going to be??? I wasn't asking for that."
6.0,22 September 2018,"I have never seen a more repulsive movie in my life. This movie wasted my $8.50. I wasted my time in this theater. The only reason this movie has a ""1"" score, is because I could not give it a 0. There were so many plot holes it was insulting. So many things happened that made me say ""how did they get that?"" The only redeeming quality is how brutal the deaths were, but alas, this could not make up for this terrible excuse for a film. The cgi looked like a child made the special effects out of play dough. If you enjoy terrible movies, that make you actually get brain tumors, this is the perfect movie for you."
2.0,29 November 2018,"Don't know why the film is getting trashed. It's entertaining, has the right formula and is a good addition to the franchise. The faces are recognizable and although there's no Arnie they are suitable to the story. Olivia Munn is actually relatable to the character in the AvP books so it's a thumbs up from me."
6.0,23 March 2021,"Absolutely terrible, tries to turn predator into a comedy and has massive plot holes."
1.0,14 September 2018,"The character development of the main band of army vets was better than could be expected from a ""character expendable"" type of movie. While not perfect, I could at least get a feel for them and see them as people, not bags of meat. A lot of new lore added in makes the over-arching Predator universe more exciting, but the ending ultimately tried too hard. The final scene was the biggest let down for me, since it could've had the potential to re-establish the franchise but just fell flat on it's face."
10.0,21 September 2018,What a hunk of crap! All of the actors REALLY sucked to high heaven!! DO NOT WATCH THIS!!
6.0,13 September 2018,"First up let me say that this is not a perfect movie, but then again you know this is a Predator movie, and that means you're not looking for perfection. You're looking for testosterone action, high stakes, snappy adolescent-level dialogue, varied high level gore demises, plenty of surprises and a solid story: The Predator ticks all those boxes. I love Shane Black movies. They sit perfectly in the 1980s/1990s and I don't mind that a bit."
2.0,13 December 2020,"If the gravitas of Alien Vs. Predator was too much for you (good movie, actually) this is at the other end of the spectrum. Random action, no real plot, good actors, and NOT un-entertaining."

5.0,18 January 2019,"It was so bad in every way that I didn't want to write it! Shame on everyone involved in its made! It could have been the ""The Asylum"" studio?"
6.0,22 September 2018,Despite a solid storyline that adds to the series with a lively team of characters.The movie was action packed and super fun.
1.0,16 September 2020,"This is the first time i ever felt insulted by how dumb a movie is, and i've seen all kinds of trash. It's the worst sequel ever without any doubt."
9.0,19 September 2018,"The Predator, for me, was watchable enough although nothing special. It tried to be funny in places but only a few of the fun lines worked and you would only ""get"" these if you have watched the original. Effects are pretty good and it certainly can't be criticised for lack of pace! It also tries a different take from many other movies around the typical characters you get when you have a group of ex cons, ex soldiers or other misfits pulled together for a cause - but this didn't really work and some of scenes were cringeworthy. One of those movies that didn't have to be made but will no doubt return a box office profit - the only reason I can think if for making it in the first place! Overall worth a watch..."
7.0,23 August 2020,"I thougt I was going to watch a scifi thriller. Turns out that this movie is more like a b-rated comedy on a big budget.

2 stars because of the nostalgia and some special effects."
1.0,14 September 2018,The people reviewing this movie and saying it is crap are downright fanboys of the original... It's not the original. It's literally monster squad meets night of the creeps... And since it was written by Fred dekkar I wouldn't see past that.... Go into this to be entertained... And honestly you'll get your money's worth.... Don't go into this thinking some sort of mythology is going to creep up and/or another horror film.... If you exclude the avp series.... The Predator franchise is all worth it.
1.0,28 September 2020,"Well, I enjoyed the movie with some great sets and action and the idea of the hydrid predator and the predator killer suit but I feel it was lacking in some high profile actors with the not so high profile so we can hand the franchise off to them. If you are going to make an 18 action movie don't include children as it takes away from the seriousness of the action and story you feel you don't want to take it seriously and as a movie franchise that has never had any other children in it then it does not make sense. Its an adult movie or it should be. I hope they make another but really need to think what does a predator movie deserve...take the fight to a large Predator ship humans trying to get off it...high profile actors please!!"
7.0,22 September 2018,"I'd rather spend time huffing fumes from a porta-potty than watch this piece of crap movie again. I'd say more, but that pretty much sums it up."
1.0,13 January 2019,So poor comedy nothing like the others very disappointing
7.0,19 September 2018,Some masterpieces need to remain at the top of the classics and they do not need to be touched... The pioneering of the first film (1987) strictly does not leave a margin for any remake.
1.0,27 November 2018,
7.0,13 August 2020,"Like I couldn't watch it more than 30 minutes.

The writing was lame, props more like kids toys, acting was stoick and jokes like from 12 year olds movies.

Just abysmal like many other people had said."
1.0,27 September 2018,"Ok I know it's not the best of the Predator series, but it was a fun action flick! The suspense and violence as per other Predator films was on point!"
10.0,30 August 2020,"In a franchise seeming to get worse with ever films, this was by far the worst instalment. It's only saving grace was the occasional funny line. As a massive fan of the original 2 films I was expecting this to return the franchise to its roots, instead the film seemed to be a parody of itself. It was seemingly created with no understanding of what made the original film so great."
7.0,4 October 2018,"First off I love this film, it took real risks with the story and takes the Predator mythology on it's ear which I love.

The story starts off with Quinn McKenna (Hal Halbrook) a mercenary that finds some misplaced Predator tech which he steals in the woods. Soon enough he meets a band of mercenaries code-named ""the loonies"" (which are funny by the way) and a scientist (Olivia Munn) as they are hunted by the Predator and a giant Predator let's call him ""Upgrade"", because of this Upgrade Predator has spliced his DNA with the deadliest creatures in the universe including human DNA! he's really cool too, it has armor plated skin, bionic eye enhancement, superior strength even to average Predators and Predator dogs! Now I know some people have taken issue with this but i don't care, i personally liked that this took some risks unlike 2010's Predators, this franchise needed it, and it's not like this came out of thin air, Shane Black and Fred Dekker who wrote this got the Upgraded Predator from the Predator comics books. There is a similar story with and Upgraded Predator that takes DNA from other creatures and injects it's self making it stronger.

Overall, I had a damn good time with this, and I can't wait to get this on DVD. I give this a 7/10. I do know the story isn't the strongest are the best but i liked it way better then Predators, also this had a lot of re-shoots done to it, so that is why there are plot holes. But this is so face paced most won't notice, also don't take this one too seriously because it's suppose to be funnier than the previous installments. Highly recommended."
1.0,14 November 2018,"I was so looking forward to this. After 15 mins I thought I must be watching a 'spoof' remake. The Director, Producer Writer, in fact the whole darn production team should be placed in a boat and set adrift. In fact let's put the cast in the boat as well. They have ruined a wonderful franchise. Shame on them!..."

I was hoping for better, especially since Shane Black was in the original movie and understood what made it successful. Good popcorn movie but don't expect much.

1.0,3 April 2021,"Just wow. What an awful, awful movie. Did people really think this was going to work? If it was just the Predator series it would be one thing, but Hollywood's obsession of taking successful movies and trying to put lightning in a bottle is just garbage. Look at the Terminator, Ghostbusters, etc. A note needs to also be made for Olivia Munn and her despicable hypocrisy. Don't act like you are some progressive liberal when you make gun violence movies and at the same time snubbed out Shane Black's friend and your costar because he had a previous sex offense. Either the guy paid his debt to society or not. He is just trying to live his life, post conviction. She's willing to save puppies, but isn't content until this guy is homeless and destitute under a bridge somewhere. Shame on her. Props to Shane Black for trying to give his friend a leg up in the world. I also feel like this was a rare swing and miss for him. He usually produces great scripts. You get a star back just for making Nice Guys."
7.0,28 November 2018,Why would anyone create such a terrible movie out of a very successful series of movies? This is way different than any of the previous Predator movies. This is a classic cheeseburger movie. You can consider it a semi-comedy movie or something for young teens. But definitely not worthy of the name of this series. Stop this abomination and don't produce a part 2 please

7.0,13 September 2018,"Frankly not a patch on the original, where as the original had tension because no one knew what was in the jungle picking off its prey one by one. The new Predator is a ridiculous concept from start to finish and mainly 1 action sequence to another and even that is dull. Why is there a kid in the film ? ok he has some sort of talent but it's not explained this should have been done in the first act. Shoehorn in the ""happy ending"" i.e the dog predator in the background and the setup for The Predator 2 PLEASE DONT.

Predator had badass characters i.e tough guys and muscle men, all we have here are deranged mentally challenged individuals as the prey. This movie is CGI'd to the max a whereas Arnies wasn't, the modern effects are not an enhancement but a distraction such as the uber Predator. Finally and you have to trust me on this any reviews giving this a 10/10 are clearly wrong this is a terrible addition to the franchise."
2.0,11 November 2018,"Is it a ground-breaking as the original?

The story was meh but in the end the film is well enjoyable and you should definitely give it a watch!!!!"

To my surprise except few flaws movie was new addition to action genre. I'm a predator fan (the classic one). So what? this one has jokes in it and more fire power (with lot of blood). Definitely not your typical predator movie. But, it stands tall in its own way. With funny one liners, fun cast and one-line story movie was fun to watch. Also they gave lot of room for our unfriendly alien to dismember and disintegrate humans like video game. So watch it and decide yourself."

You might think well at least there is going to be a predator so it can't be THAT bad.. well it really is.

So the acting and storyline is awful, but whats really annoying here is everything else, the plot holes, the lack of any kind of script, the constant desperate dramatic music that relentlessly plays the whole way through, the forced jokes...

seriously everything is awful, I really don't understand how rubbish like this ever gets made. the people that made this really shouldn't be making films, and must be very lucky to have parents \ connections in the right places.

I'm jealous, as if i was given 100 mill I'm pretty sure I cold make something just as rubbish as this."
1.0,28 September 2018,"After Shane Black made the god-awful Iron Man 3, only a fool could entrust him with another franchise.

One of the film's most notable missteps comes in the form of its cast and characters. Boyd Holbrook portrays Quinn McKenna, the Army Ranger and sniper in the center of the film's plot. Holbrook does his best to make McKenna compelling and likeable, a difficult task considering how poorly written the film is as a whole. He is joined by a large collection of forgettable supporting characters, the highlight of which is Keegan-Michael Key's Coyle, a wise-cracking ex-soldier who drops some memorable jokes and one-liners. The remainder of which - a group of quirky military criminals with annoying character traits, an evil government agent who order the deaths of people without much reason, and an evolutionary biologist who manages to survive every ridiculous near-death situation because of her pretty face - are all forgettable and thinly written. This makes the plot uninteresting, unfunny (I say this because the film attempts to make a LOT of ill-timed jokes), and void of tension.

The issues with the characters in The Predator, however, are a result of a bigger problem that plagues the entire film: the writing. The Predator features some of the most scattershot, lazy, and brainless writing that I've seen in a film in some time. Granted, I don't make my way into subpar action films very often, so as far as I know, the writing could actually be thoughtful and well-crafted compared to other movies of the same caliber (although I doubt it). Throughout the film, characters make decisions that have no reason behind them. Things happen without any sort of explanation. Plot points are treated as important but are then completely ignored later. Major events occur without any sort of repercussion. Etc., etc., etc. The script seems to be constantly struggling to coherently lead the characters to the film's action scenes, filling the gaps in between those scenes with nonsense and half-assed references to the Predator franchise (its ""homage"" to Schwarzenegger's ""Get to the chopper!"" line is horrendous). And even when the action finally happens, it is underwhelming, bogged down by poor camerawork and hard-to-follow editing."
6.0,20 September 2018,"'The Predator' is the fourth film (we don't count the two 'Alien Vs Predator' films) in the series and does exactly what it should - has Predators killing people, soldiers killing people, lots of explosions, some jungle, and some humour. The pretty-thin plot is - an ""upgraded"" Predator is sent to Earth to hunt down a rogue Predator. Stick around to the end to see the silly reasoning.

McKenna (Holbrook, from 'Narcos') is the hero, with his son Rory (Tremblay) having a key part to play. Casey (Munn) is somehow an evolutionary biologist and the rest of the cast is a ragtag crew of mentally-unstable soldiers - Nebraska (Rhodes), Coyle (Key), Baxley (Jane), Nettles (Aguilera) & Lynch (Allen). They all have just enough to do to make them interesting - and bump-up the body count. Traeger (Brown) is the typical government agent/bad guy.

It takes about 20min to get going, but once it does, the pace is good, there's plenty of action and fighting, but also a lot of stupid moments, which are also counteracted with some genuine laughs - e.g. why it's called ""the Predator"". Sufficient amounts of gore and blood. Not better or worse than 'Predator 2' or 'Predators', which is good."

10.0,5 December 2018,"I came into this movie with 0 expecations, I had heard it was horrible. And yes it is not a ""good"" movie but its not that bad.

If it wasn't in the Predator movie family and just a stand alone movie it would not be getting these horrible reviews. It was a fun alien movie with Predators. It has a lot of jokes and comedy in it that doesn't really fit in a Predator movie but it made me chuckle from time to time. The CGI is not the best but I have seen way way worse in other movies. The story line was predictable but decent. The acting is in my opinion great.

I would honestly say I liked this movie more then the AVP2 movie. Give it a chance if you like films about space aliens."
6.0,28 November 2018,"Shane Black appeared as an actor in the original Predator in 1987. It was a good year for him as he also wrote Lethal Weapon that was released the same year.

In this fourth sequel Black is co-writer and director. It really is Con-Air meets The Dirty Dozen with elements of the first Predator film.

A Predator ship lands on earth. Soldier and ace sniper Quinn McKenna was nearby to assassinate an important bad guy and ends up shooting the Predator. Quinn gets some of the alien's armour and mails it. Eventually it is delivered to his autistic son Rory (Jacob Tremblay.)

In a secret military facility, the Predator is examined and it is noted that it has some human DNA.

Biologist Dr Casey Bracket (Olivia Munn) is called in but the Predator wakes up and starts to attack, it escapes from the facility. It now finds out that some of his gear is with Rory and it goes looking for him.

Quinn meanwhile is being transported on a prison bus with some other bunch of misfit military prisoners. They are there when the Predator is escaping and Quinn goes to hunt it.

However Will Traeger (Sterling K Brown) who called in Dr Bracket to examine the Predator does not want loose ends. He is a dark ops guy and is willing to kill undesirables who have come into contact with the Predator. Traeger is after the Predator's ship.

The Predator makes a fine action film when it gets going. It is wonderfully shot, there are some really good special effects.

Tonally it is all over the place. It wants to be a loose comedy half the time. The story is a real hotchpot and makes little sense.

The Predator has an ulterior motive to visit the planet. A bigger Predator later arrives. Dr Bracket is great at fighting back and somehow manages to catch up with the Predator's ship at the end. Then there are alien hounds where one of the them wants to be a friend.

We have the convicts fighting with the army when they should be hunting the Predator who is on the loose.

This movie shows all the signs that the screenplay had problems and was half baked. The ending was reshot after test audiences did not like the first version of the movie."
1.0,27 December 2018,"I nearly didn't watch this because of negative reviews however glad I did. There is some good comedy tongue in cheek comments but not too much that makes like it ala airplane.

1.0,16 September 2018,"In a nutshell, this movie is utter trash! The original Predator was well .......ORIGINAL, an amazing film with animated, interesting, and very different characters. Arnie's film is the type of flick that every time it comes on, I would have to watch it.

The storyline was actually a good one, the action scenes and pointless violence decent. Everything else violently disappointing! Watch the original or Paddington... anything would be better"
2.0,1 January 2019,"This is the worst predator train wreck I have ever seen. The whole plot and story was so lacking and the movie looked like something made for a child to make him/her feel better about having Asperger.

3.0,13 September 2018,"The predators 2010 was actually the best predator movie after the first which was successful in resembling the theme of the original one. Still people did not rate it well.

This movie is a different approach, probably the trend nowadays to mix more action, unnecessary humor and rap music into a movie. I would say its a good watch and cant blame anyone considering the welcoming received by predators 2010. It could have been better.

I watched alpha the other day and even though its a good movie it wasn't enjoyable or the kind of movie I would recommend to anyone because it has its own type of audience.

This will be a really enjoyable watch for all general public except hardcore predator fans."

1.0,18 September 2018,"The Predator tells the story of Quinn McKenna(Boyd Holbrook). When an accidental incident causes the return of a deadly alien race, it is up to McKenna, scientist Casey Bracket(Olivia Munn) & a group of ex-soldiers to stop the mass termination of the human race.

The Predator is a great film. Writer-director Shane Black tries his best to live up to the 1987 cult classic. He succeeds, for the most part. This movie is a great homage to Predator(1987). Black makes sure he updates this franchise for the new generation. The action set pieces are fantastic. The visual effects are flawless. However, this movie's sheer shock & thrill factor doesn't match up to the original. The humor makes the viewer chuckle from time to time. The regular one-liners however, dilutes the more intense scenes of the film. Boyd Holbrook is brilliant as Quinn McKenna. Trevante Rhodes is amazing as Nebraska Williams. Jacob Tremblay is spectacular as Rory McKenna. Tremblay adds yet another unforgettable performance, to his already impressive filmography. Keegan-Michael Key is hilarious as Coyle. Olivia Munn is outstanding as Casey Bracket. Sterling K. Brown is perfect as Traeger. Thomas Jane is superb as Baxley. Alfie Allen is good as Lynch. Augusto Aguilera is impressive as Nettles. Yvonne Strahovski is excellent as Emily. The Predator is a must watch for fans of the Predator franchise. Go, have a great time."

2.0,11 November 2018,"I went into this with no expectations as I'd managed to avoid any spoilers, story lines and plot twists. I usually come to IMDB first to guage whether a film is worth watching, but I didnt even do that and now I regret it.

This film is garbage. I guess they thought if they could dub the predator music over it in scenes it will feel closely tied to the original. I felt like that Jakie Chan meme throughout the movie. The bad psudoscience and convoluted story line, the film was all over the place. It was like it was meant for 10 year old audience but had 18+ gore. The predator with little armour manages to avoid hundreds of bullets, did they hire storm troopers as security? I wont give any spoilers away but you can read from all the other comments the bad plot points.

I'm just going to write this off as 'not a Predator film' and forget it's existence."
7.0,26 December 2018,"Sure, this is not better than the first movie, but it as least on par with the recent predator movies.

Brash, loud, dumb and completely without logic or reason, it teleported from one dull set piece to the next without even mentioning why or how it was coming up with a reason to go on. I just wanted to go. I wanted to leave the theatre but I though, no, see it through. There is no reason to. I'm still shocked as to how bad this was. Do not spend your money on this, even the football players in the audience I was in, with IQ's I could count on one hand fell silent after hee-hawing their way into the first ten minutes of the film at the sheer ineptitude that even they found puzzling. Just junk. What a shame."
7.0,15 September 2018,"I loved it! So fun, completely satisfied and entertained."
1.0,11 February 2021,"The characters are somewhat likable. They all had their own individual quirks; and cracked jokes. They seemed like a group you'd find in a typical 80's action movie, so it's better to thought of them in that way. Outside of the group of soldiers, Olivia Munn, Tremblay and Sterling K. Brown, who played governmental bad guy Traeger, were all really good. Of all the characters with major roles there wasn't anyone who was poor. As an action movie it did exactly what it's supposed to do. It was loud, fast-paced and fun. It's no classic; but it had that same feel as something from the late 80's/early 90's. The level of violence was very satisfying. This film also did well when it comes to crossing genres. Not only was it a solid action movie; it also had some good comedic scenes (even though they were tad too offensive), as well as some visually impressive sci-fi stuff. The CGI predator dogs could have looked better, but it mostly didn't matter. I thought the costume designers deserve props though for the look of both the original predator and the new mega predator. Those suits looked really cool. However, one minor issues is the editing; there are some parts of the film that don't quite fit together as smoothly as perhaps it could have. Overall, an enjoyable out-and-out action flick."

4.0,14 September 2018,"I have been a long time fan of the Predator film and comic series. The standard of the movies, however, are on a downward trend, with The Predator 1987 being the best and The Predator 2018 being the worst. I watched the Predator 2018 at the theatre and then watched the original one on my DVD. The difference was alarming, and while I rated this 2018 movie a 2/10, I would rate the older 1987 one a 8.5/10. I also had a similar feeling after having watched the recently released movie, The Meg 2018 and then comparing it with the Jaws 1975, directed by Spielberg. These only serve to show the lack of directorial finesse offered by the present directors, as compared to the older ones, even with highly improved CGI at their disposal. These lackadaisically directed movies are going to leave a sour taste in my mouth for quite sometime."
7.0,21 February 2019,"While this movie was predictable it certainly had some great moments. I especially loved the interactions of "" The Loonies"" with everybody. Olivia Munn was superb. I loved the space dog too. I bought it on DVD and have watched it at least six times now."

7.0,14 September 2018,"First of all, I think Shane Black is a great writer. I cannot comprehend what just happened here. This movie lacks tension completely, the characters aren't shocked or surprised - there are simply no emotional states during the movie at all (shock, horror, anger, exhaustion ) - but you get as many cheesy ""jokes"" as you can. If you want to make a great predator sequel, you don't need to reinvent the whole thing. Build unique and real characters, force them to depend on each other and fight for their lives, spice it up with suspense and an original location - make the situation nearly hopeless - and it's done. This story dumps the predator lore right in the trash, sucessfully avoids any logic. It's quite funny that the CGI was so bad, that the original predator looked much more believable than this one. What does 30 years of progress count in filmmaking right? Welcome to Predator Devolution."

9.0,19 September 2018,"It's understandable that this film couldnt live up to the original two Predators. Schwarzenegger and Glover were a huge part of my childhood in these films. The replay value was just excellent, and I still rewatch them today. The sense of human fragility and fear was present in those films. A contact with the Predator was synonymous with death in most instances. The struggle was real, and certainly felt real to the viewer. The new film is nothing like this. It is characterized by unrealistic action sequences and excessive satire. The characters never seem to truly fear the Predator, something which makes the entire premise exciting. I wanted to view them fighting for survival against a superior and savage alien. Unfortunately this film chooses the action and comical route, a mistake in my opinion. All of this considered, I still enjoyed the movie as a fan of the franchise, because I managed my expectations before going to see it. I knew it would not be the original, and if you can accept that you will enjoy it too. I would describe it as fun, not horror/thriller, and mediocre overall."

1.0,16 September 2018,"What can I say, yet another franchise ruined by Fox. Thanks for taking something that could have been good and editing it/re-shooting it into pop culture ad nauseam. What was the purpose of taking out any and all of the tension you had from the first few movies and replacing it with comedy that fell short and overshadowed the entire premise that the Predator is a scary mysterious alien? Can we stop making movies that care more about action and explosions then anything coherent in the plot? As bad as the entire movie was, it fell off a cliff in the third act. I never thought I'd say this but I'd rather they did what happened to Alien then this..."
6.0,28 September 2020,"The good:
very nice visual effects. The action scenes are pretty good
The bad:
many strange and dumb plot choices. To give an example: the movie literal implies that autism is a superpower, wtf?!?!
characters behave weird (and not just the insane ones)
mostly unsuccessful attempts at humour
In conclusion: It has some nice eye candy but there is no ""substance"" behind it. It's not boring but you have to ignore many things to enjoy this movie. I wish we had got a sequel to Predators (2010) instead of this. If I wasn't a Predator fan, my rating would probably be even lower.

Final rating: 6.3/10"
4.0,14 September 2018,"This film could have turned out to be an epic battle steeped in suspense and raw gritty gore. Yet, the corny jokes and over-the-top sentimentality of a misfiring story steeped in overly patriotic rhetoric has let a promising premise down. I hoped for a teasingly suspenseful build up to a crescendo of predator-predator violence but was instead disappointed by the very early show of hands and poor CGI. This film can be placed firmly in the generic aisle, with a boring, easily-guessed yet, often convoluted story line. There was no mystique to the predator with this film having similar effect to the franchise of that of The crystal skull did to Indiana Jones.

On a plus note, the film made me jump once and laugh a few times. This, however is cheap comedy thrown around through lame characters. Perhaps this film reflects current attitudes trending through pro-Trump America. At the least, this film left me angry, if not sad."
10.0,18 September 2018,"Ever since i saw The Predator trailer, i wasn't sure of what to think (mostly because the trailer couldn't decide what tone this movie was going for). So i went in with low expectations and as a long time fan of the Franchise, i was joyfully impressed.

The Predator is a movie where you can simply turn your brain off and enjoy a bunch of nonsense being thrown at the screen. Does one ounce of if make sense? No. Is the plot original and well thought out? No. But i think that was the point.

In terms of quality, i would say the movie could do better. While the gore and action is badass, it really is choppy and can be headache inducing. The humor for the most part was fine, i mean the main cast kinda fits the picture, but because of so much humor i couldn't really tell when the movie was attempting to be serious.

This movie is one of those films where i agree with both sides of how they thought the movie was. If someone were to say they hated it because they turned it into a comedy, i would semi agree. If you said you liked it because it did something new with the Franchise, i would agree. If you thought it was out of character for the (main) Predator to be like he was, i would agree.

So all in all, The Predator should NOT be taken seriously at all. It's messy and could be better for sure, but like everyone in the movie; i had fun with it. It's kinda nice to get away from the Oscar-bait movies. Also grab some friends, it is a blast with a group of buddies. 7/10"

5.0,11 February 2020,"Really... Why?

Why make another version of the Predator? Are these wannabe Film Producers not getting the hint...! Re-makes of the classic films do not work! Terminator failed after T2, Conan had no presence and the Predator should have died and stayed dead in the 80's jungle.

Terrible acting, awful story, awful screenplay, tired SFX.

Don't waste your time.

Dear Hollywood people, some classics CANNOT be improved and franchise films get so boring."

3.0,13 September 2018,"I came into the movie with very low expectations after having watched all the sequels and spinoffs.

Only Alians Vs Predator 1 came close the rest were garbage compared to the 1987 cult classic Predator starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, but this movie is very good. In fact, I would even say it's very close to the classic.

Sure, it does have a predictable story and fairly ordinary characters, the action sequences are nicely paced and constant enough yet not too mindlessly portrayed to keep the audience engaged and excited.

I gave this 10 stars because of the action sequences and decent acting plus the movie ended with a possible new story arc which is great for the franchise. Well done to Shane Black for delivering on his promise of giving this a R rating so all the blood and gore is out there in its glory. Overall, a great movie and worthy sequel to the original. Go see it in Imax or Cinemax.

Cheers."
6.0,13 September 2018,"The film is not bad. A lot of explosions, murders and jokes. Personally, I really liked the secondary heroes. The graphics are not horrible. For the whole film was one really terrible moment - when for a couple of seconds they showed a disgusting schedule. It was so bad that it would be permanently imprinted in my memory. Something too much water, it's time to sleep!"
3.0,7 September 2020,
6.0,14 September 2018,"This movie is utter garbage, literally the only reason I give it 2 stars is the fact is has a Predator actually kill someone.

Alien vs Predator 2 was better than this, at least they had the courage to kill the kid 5 minutes in. This heap of trash has him as... well you can work it out.

Also we now have a new Mary Sue Champion, the University lecturer turned combat vet inside 90 minutes. Move over Rey.

You want predator action? Watch Arnie again or Danny, or even Brodies.

Genuinely if I save one person from spending hard earned cash on this mess I will be a happy man."
4.0,11 January 2019,"1/10? 2/10? Haha. Just watched this expecting it to be utter bilge, and ended up enjoying it. Plenty of action, pretty funny. Just goes to show..... Haters will be haters. Don't trust these reviewers. Glad I didn't...."
10.0,16 September 2018,"Incredible how bad the movie was, I went out of the show theater, had to drink a few beer in disappointment."
6.0,10 November 2022,"Not as good as I'd hoped. I like Boyd Holbrook, and I'll grab any chance to watch Olivia Munn. In fact all the cast were good (nice to see Thomas Jane playing against type). The big, second Predator was badass, and the action was okay. But I agree with the critics who found the plot jumbled. And whilst I'll admit that some of the jokes made me laugh, they did feel out of place. Take out the swearing, and this to me was what it would be like if Marvel made 'Predator'. I'm not knocking the MCU - I like and own quite a few of them - but over-'quippy' is not what I expect from a Predator movie (and playing 'fetch' with a Predator Dog?). I can see why they didn't follow it up with the teased sequel, and instead went in a different direction with Prey (which I thought was better). Okay for a watch whilst you're doing something else. 6/10."
2.0,9 August 2020,"A pursued predator crash-lands on Earth, then kills a lot of people, then the pursuer lands on Earth and kills a lot of people and the pursuant, then there is a nonsensical 'surprise' ending (especially 'surprising' because it is completely inconsistent with the first half of the film). Battling the tusked-terrors is 2D action-hero stereotype Quinn McKenna (Boyd Holbrook), an even more trite kick-ass biology professor (Olivia Munn, the worst character in a tight race to the bottom) and McKenna's team of mentally-unbalanced army outcasts. Tossed in for some 'sensitive moments' is McKenna's autistic young son (so: guess who figures out all the alien technology) and, to maximise CGI gore opportunities, there's a team of largely incompetent and expendable MIB types led by Traeger (Sterling Brown). Nothing in the film works. The script is terrible and the 'bro-bonding banter' between McKenna and his crew is painful to listen to (Munn's contributions to the puerile repartee are especially cringe-worthy). The special effects are technically adequate (except for the space-dogs, which look like something from the frugal auteurs at 'The Asylum'), but lack any novelty or imagination - pretty much everything in the film has been done before, and better. The CGI predators look like CGI predators - they lack the realism of the original creature (a legendary design created with practical effects almost 35 years ago). The inane plot is buttressed by risible pseudoscience and the alien technology (so well done in the original film) is ridiculously contrived to fit the needs of the plot. The final scene is clearly trolling for a sequel - hopefully to no avail, the fluorescent-green blood-letting needs to be shelved until braver producers find a writer/director who can do something new with the iconically ugly ETs."
1.0,17 November 2018,"This was maybe the funniest movie I've seen this year. If you're looking for a classic predator movie you'll be upset, but this was definitely fun and worth the watch otherwise."
7.0,14 September 2018,"Messy action scenes, not funny jokes nor one-liners. No attachment to the main characters. Even this great casting does not save this movie from sinking.

It is finally a big budget B-movie which has nothing to bring to the saga. Not talking the end twist (really ?).

So, again, a beloved saga is also being dragged into the mud like the others: Star Trek, Star Wars, Transformers,..... for whatever reason."

1.0,15 September 2018,"Seriously, this movie started great. Then a little bit slow, it has some lame phrases like ""get to the chopaaa"", like it would be funny next 20 times. I was five when watched the first Predator and my reaction was similar to this one: ""Noo, they killed him!"" I hate to see clasic predator die.

Some things doesn't fit, like half human half alien predator, seriously? Some dread dog running around with no purpose, and why predator would stand against his kind and send the weapon to humans to kill his own kind? That was the top of it and ruined the entire movie. I would believe other things, but this one... Asshole or not, I hate to see hybrid predator die too. End was bloody and brutal, but killing him like this shows how low humans go, just like that. And the damn officer got a star for acting like savage. This could be seen only in american sloppy movie.

Btw I hate the cast of the actors, so weak since the first till the last. Even classic predator was made to look like idiot with those shiny armor and small size. Bad film, another ruined Predator film!"
7.0,17 September 2018,"Well I didn't thot is possible after the alien movie this year to be even more pissed off , disappointed of a sequel for the love of god why make another predator movie if you're not capable to do it right then don't try .. so all what's left for me is to erase this movie from my memory ... And lmao all this ppl giving this a good rating I think most of em are new generation who has grown up watching cheese duo cop action/comedy movies whit Jacky chan ..I mean come on there was even a time in movie when I thot that the predator will say ""Get over here"" and I already was listening Mortal Kombat sound track in my head as the scene looked sorta kabal striker scorpion loll, and don't get me started on the dogs ... lmao humans are Cesar the alien dog whisperer.. and the cutting arm off and kicking all out from the back of truck and show the arm whit thumb up to driver (ye an vicious killing machine stop for a smoke in truck) and the Lara Croft chick whit the I see dead ppl kid .. and throw in a black guy who is trying to be funny and you have an family Sunday movie..

if you aspect an horror action movie don't go .. if you will go see it whit family sure go if you have nothing else to see"
1.0,19 September 2018,"It's always the same, we see the predator(s) solving their own problems here on Earth, (excluding Predators 2010). Can we see something totally different like the Predator own planet and civilization, how they evolved, why do they are so obsessed with our planet and why do they came here so many times?! Please do not get me wrong here, I'm a huge fan, I loved this release too, but I miss some info on what I mentioned above :)"
10.0,30 September 2018,"Just avoid. The continuity gaffs and ridiculous script in the first 20 mins told me to buckle up, this isn't going to be the movie we hoped for. Why someone though injecting a comedy script into this franchise was good idea is anyone's guess. The worst Predator story by a fair margin - hopefully the studio will shelve the reboot."
6.0,24 July 2020,I gave it a 7 bc I knew what we were in for. The gore was awesome. The levity was perfect. The action was cool. The story sucked a little but you like every character. Even the bad ones are funny. Just enjoy it. Don't look at it like the first one. Easy to watch and forget Covid.
3.0,15 September 2018,"Tries to be a comedy (it isn't funny).

Horror (not scary).

Suspense (zero suspense).

Mature content (pointless F-words).

Started out reasonably well, then it quickly shifted to autopilot and it speedily bangs along without pausing for breath.

I gave up on the final thirty minutes. Simply wasn't worth my time.

If it came on TV, it may be worth a watch, for free. Pay for this rubbish? You must be joking."
1.0,1 October 2019,If you have a sense of humour and can take that this is more of a joke than serious then watch it...good laugh and very tongue in cheek. Best enjoyed with a glass of wine. Watch it for a good laugh with a bit of action...

4.0,16 September 2018,"My son and I loved it! We are HUGE predator fans. Let me start by saying it's not an oscar film but I go to the movies to be entertained and that's exactly what this movie does.. entertain! It's funny, in a marvel way.. it's got tons of bad assery. You cared about the characters and they were all awesome as well. The only thing I didn't like was the digital predator. Keep him a guy in a suit. Anyway that was my only problem with it. I thought the story seemed silly from the trailer but it was actually fine. Go see it! Great father son day out! Although fun for all."
7.0,13 September 2018,"Loved the original but this is not really a 'Predator' movie. Just like Prometheus isn't an 'Alien' movie.

Enjoyed it for what it was. A decent enough bit of entertainment. I didn't hate it. Didn't love it either.

Star Wars managed to pull itself back on track. I'd love to see the same treatment for re-boots and sequels of other well-loved movies. Keep the core of what made them great and reduce the jokes.

Can't help feeling this is plugging in to millennial sensitivities where everyone wants to be sassy/opinionated/kick-ass.

Honestly save your money or go see it for yourself.
6.0,14 September 2018,"These days, to make an interesting scifi movie, you generally need more than one good idea. Say two good ideas and your movie can be different and interesting. This movie has some great ideas - such as why there is a predator on earth and there being different ""kinds"" of predators. But then the movie keeps dishing out ideas and it gets a bit ridiculous - esp. concerning the kid in the movie.

There are other problems as well - but all in all, it was nice to see a predator movie with some interesting angles. I hope there will be more such movies that are ambitious -- just not overly so."
1.0,30 September 2018,"Okay, if you went to see this you're probably an established fan. If you didn't, save your money, it will be on Netflix by Christmas. Why so bad? First of all, I'm reminded of a Japanese anime plot format where the reasoning for the action is explained in the first two minutes and then it's just a shootem' up from there. So many scenes are just absurd to the point of being ridiculous. Men in black, ""Doctor come with us, leave your dog."" She leaves with the mysterious agents and doesn't give two thoughts about the dog? Upon entering a high security facility the Predator's helmets and gauntlets are on display in the entryway like in a high school trophy case. Which, by the way, turns out to be a bad idea. And who thought that a Disneyesque Predator Hound was a good idea? Oh I know, Jar Jar Binks. I really liked Predators 2010. I was hoping for more of that. I should have known when I saw the 12 foot tall Predator in the trailer. Why not just make him 20 feet tall? Or Godzilla tall. Wow. What a waste of everyone's time."

Just what would you expect in a predator movie.. Aliens and guns.. It's a fun movie.. Just don't expect any plots or anything logical.. If u like aliens, guns, and killing this movie is for you. I had a lot of fun.. A good time and thats whats needed while going to the movie

The jokes are not overused btw"
7.0,9 July 2020,"A predator crash lands on Earth. Yes, the old formula returns with some standard issue Predator branding but this film gets up to speed delivering action throughout.

The main character is a sniper who has to avoid the army intent on acquiring alien tech (straight out of Aliens, a la Carter Burke). He is joined by a group of army misfits who all have their own likeable quirks, plus a biologist brought in to understand the predators.

There's many Predator features sprinkled throughout the film which make it fit with the collection: invisibility cloaking, arm bracelet weapon, spaceships, jumping through the trees (homage to the original Predator), and multiple deaths. The tried and tested military vs aliens has been done many times, but it works. Oh, there's even predator hounds too, nice.

If you want an arthouse deep and meaningful actor type film, then don't watch this, but if you want a no-brainer Sci-Fi action film that thrills from start to end, see this.

I hope someone out there also sees this as a neat addition to the franchise, and doesn't get put off by the masses who say this film sucks. It's good, watch it."
3.0,14 September 2018,"This dud of a movie doesn't pay any homepage or respect to the Predatory Methodology. I was amazingly disappointed in the script and some of the dumbest scenes that I have ever seen in a movie.

I don't know who this movie was geared too but it is safe to say that even younger generations will find it un-entertaining and just plain stupid.

Total disrespect, weak script, characters with no real meaning and sad lag and waste of money.

However, you will have to experience it for yourself."
6.0,16 September 2018,"I ignored all informations about the movie before I went to the theatre. I thought this will be a perfect one time sci-fi thriller with an old folk (same feelings with the Covenant movie) but I couldn't decide the genre and I felt the cast had the same opinion. The story was a total disaster and the dialogs were ridiculous. I almost went out after the first hour, and giving a second chance was the worst idea of my day."
4.0,23 May 2020,"I have had a long dislike of black and white ratings on IMDB. Like the rest of life, things aren't usually black and white. Life is lived in shades of grey where extremes are rarely the case. And that is how it should be when you are trying to help others decide if they should see a movie or not. It should be rare that a film gets a 1/10 or a 10/10 - these extremes simply don't help. I scored this as a 7 ... here's why

1. Screenwriting for the genre - 7/10 - the plot was good and the premise was fine - there was no confusion over the storyline or muddling of the information, the film continued through the 3 acts seamlessly with intent and purpose - hence a very good screenplay. 2. Direction - 8/10 - Shane Black is a rather good director and steered the film along nicely keeping pace and energy and giving us a break where needed. no confusion or terrible plot holes 3. Editing - 8/10. There were some really good points where things could get confusing with the pace of the movie - the editing was well up to standard and kept everything tight and on target for the third act which was surprisingly good for a poorly rated movie on IMDB 4. Acting - 8/10 - c'mon guys, the cast were really trying to get you into this this movie and make you love it. I've only seem a couple of the cast before, but they were really very good for the genre and they did a great job whilst making it really quite believable in the grand scheme of what would or wouldn't be believable that is. I'm pretty sure they'll get a lot more work on the back of this, even the kid was quite good in an adult film 5. SFX - 8/10 - very good, what can I say - anyone can do this on their MacBook these days, but there were no gaps or moments when you thought it wasn't good enough and poor SFX weren't the reason to notice any problem with the movie, hence a very good (8/10) 6. Camerawork, lighting etc - 8/10 - same as above - professional and good enough for any blockbuster you might want to name. 7. Music - same again 8/10 - I mean, why wouldn't it be? 8. Concept - 6/10 - Nothing new here, its OK - I suppose Shane Black was wanting to tie up some loose ends from the other films, viz. the way the predators changed in the various films and why they were doing what they did, which he gave a reasonable answer to I suppose, hence 6 instead of 5 9. General overall cohesiveness - this score is for the whole thing in terms of its reason for being (a sequel in this case, how it fits into the genre SciFi, how it fares against the concept fro the time of making it, etc, etc). 6/10 - because its not particularly well received at the moment and the other films have been somewhat poorly received and haven't been as well exectuted as they could have been. 10. My own make for enjoyment, etc - 7/10

If you add them all up and divide by 10 you get 7.5 - but round dow for !MDB = 7/10

If you think otherwise then let me know because you're not helping with the extreme scores 1/10 or 10/10"

Lots of stuff that was not logical, forced third rate humour, and plenty of evidence of reshoots, as the film jumped around for no apparent reason. I think the predator franchise is long past it's sell by date, perhaps we could move on now. Only watch this if ( like me ) you have a couple of hours to kill"

6.0,29 November 2018,"Outside of there being a few of them in the Movie, this isn't a predator movie. They need to go back to the basics and reboot.

Horrible tone, acting and premise. Felt like a TV show comedy that wasted a few good actors.

It never takes itself seriously and that is the main problem. Horrible writing and acting to boot.

Was excited to see it but knew 15 minutes in something was terribly wrong."
1.0,27 September 2018,A very FUN movie with great action and Surprisingly is very funny CGI is abit crappy at times and the plot is abit strange but over all it's a great popcorn flick
1.0,13 December 2018,"I absolutely agree with rachit666. This was a straight trash. First I thought after some positive reviews I read that this movie has good potentials, some fresh humour, great ideas, etc. But instead all of these... every minute was so awkward, so bad. A real shame. The ending prepares bed for a sequel - as I realized this I thought ""Please don't!""...

So... yes, fans of the original 1987 movie... avoid this!"
7.0,5 October 2018,"Even though I hated Shane Blacks Iron Man 3, which is the worst iron man movie by the way and actually should have been called Tony Stark cuz iron man was hardly even in the movie. But anyways the predator delivered good laughs, gore, and action. Thomas Jane and Keegan nailed it with there chemistry! They gave great laughs and a true meaning to brotherhood. Olivia Munn wasn't bad either. Boyd Holbrook did a much better job than what I saw from the so called masterpiece of Logan! Which was to me nowhere near a masterpiece! I'm a big fan of predator and I'm not like those other haters!! I love all predator movies cuz he's a badass!!!"

WHY show the Predator right from the start.. ?!? That's NOT how the Predator movies work.. !!! And the Predator dogs (?!?).. NOT a good addition.. NOT a good idea.. just awful.. !!!

So we have: 01. Predator (1987) 02. Predator 2 (1990) 03. Alien vs. Predator (2004) 04. Alien vs. Predator: Requiem (2007) 05. Predators (2010) ... ........ (2018) yeah.. nothing happened here.. !!!!!! 06. Still waiting for movie No. 6 (????)"
10.0,9 October 2024,"1. You absolutely mustn't count or think about plot holes, loose ends, continuity errors or editing hallucinations.

You see, this movie doesn't give a flying f. It just wants to deliver good Predator fun, filmmaking postulates be damned. And I think it succeeds in making this a fun and watchable, if not a great or just a good movie.

2. You mustn't be bothered by cheesy dialogue and self-referential tropes.

Shane Black directs a sequel to an original he wrote the script for. Not gonna lie, I'd have done the same. I take it as tongue in cheek, if a bit on the nose sometimes. Also, it does try a bit too hard to be funny, but it kinda works, which brings me to the last point.

3. Enjoy the cast.

Especially fhe duo of Key and Jane, and what an exit they had. Also, I would've thought this kind of movie was outside of Key's comfort zone, but maybe that's what makes it work. Holbrook made his name in Narcos but he's kind of everywhere and to this movie he brings his usual everyman vibe, you could say a contemporary Michael Biehn. And talking about self-referential, Jake Busey.

This movie really has nuggets for fans, and I appreciate that. In the end, I enjoyed it and if you don't think too hard about it (and you shouldn't), you'll be entertained too."

2.0,18 July 2020,"Don't understand the lower ratings, I thought a good revamp with different story! And, great use of comedy!!!"
2.0,2 December 2018,"What a weird experience this movie was. It has some great elements to make it a proper R-rated sci-fi action flick, but they completely ruined the potential because of a couple of (very) bad castings, poor writing and directing. On the other hand at times it's pretty entertaining.

I like the angle they took that the predators are scavenging planets for their apex predators and using their dna to upgrade their species to evolve into the ultimate predator. Also in certain scenes the action and gore are pretty good and a couple of actors are well cast, like Holbrook and Rhodes. But the very unnecessary and very cringe humor, poor dialogue, those very stupid predator dogs, the angle with the kid and some very out of place actors make the movie completely fall apart.

They should've taken this movie serious, it should've been in the spirit of the original movie, then it could've been at least decent... now they just made a movie that doesn't really know what it is and really tarnished 'Predator' for any future projects.

I do NOT recommend this movie, not even for a very boring Sunday evening... it's just not worth it."
7.0,13 November 2018,"Ok so it's not the kick ass predator films we have loved through the years. It's more a fuel injected ET with the humour of lethal weapon. Has a '80's feel about it, and the cgi looks like it came from that era. But hey if you go with it and take it for what it is then it's ok. Worth a watch"
1.0,1 February 2019,A disapponting reboot and an insult to the franchise. Shane Black a hero in the original but i'm afraid not so much for this lacklustre attempt.
6.0,14 September 2018,"First of all, I'm not a 'fan' of the franchise. I liked the first movie with Arnold, but back then I was also just 16 and those testosterone fueled action flicks were distinctive for the 80s. The last time I saw the original Predator was like 2 years ago, and although it's kinda nostalgic, the plot fits on a beer coaster and it's neither thrilling nor anywhere near the overall quality that you'd expect from a movie nowadays in general. It's a classic, I get it, but this franchise needed a drastic overhaul to be worth a watch 'today'.

When I saw the trailer and that Shane Black is going to be the director, I already had a movie in mind that would not take itself so seriously - comedic aspects, good action and gore. And now that I've seen it, I can confirm, ""The Predator"" is exactly that, respectively, exactly what it needs to be. The namesake creature is just not fit to be anything like its extended universe, terrifying brother, the Xenomorph. They finally got it right with this movie and I hope it continues in the same direction."
1.0,3 October 2018,"I expected to hate this film based on the reviews, and it just goes to show you that people consistently exaggerate nowadays. It was not over the top, it was a bit lighter in tone. The plot points dubbed as ""whacko"" by some, were actually plausibly explained. The characters were zany and why was explained. The problem with this movie is poor editing. Scene cuts were poor, lighting was bad even for a mostly at night timeline. I remember reading that the first cut of Star Wars was a disaster due to editing, and Shane Black should have read those notes. So its an okay film, i gave it an extra point only because so many people jumped on board the bomb bandwagon to kick a flick when its down . Its good for a matinee and better for a rental. It was hyped to, but never made to break new predator ground...its just more of a straight predator story. BTW i will say the obligatory sequel scene was an obligation that should have gone unfulfilled."
6.0,12 September 2018,"Every predator sequel felt like a predator movie, predator 2 entertaining, but letdown by the leading cast, predator 3 fun and entertaining, but multiple predators killed off easily ruined the movie, this one was more like a superhero movie, the first hour or so was entertaining, the last half hour ruined the movie, it moved very mindlessly, not knowing exactly what was going on"
1.0,14 September 2018,If you're a fan of the originals and want a good laugh I'd definitely recommend it. I could tell you how bad it actually was but you wouldn't believe me. I wish I just could of paid $15 to watch the original. It's a joke.

6.0,15 September 2018,"If you are a predator fan, a sci-fi fan or even just a movie fan, do yourself a favor and never watch this. It's so bad it's not even funny.

1.0,13 September 2018,I I'm shocked in how they even let this be released. Shaky camera from the start the characters in this are terrible making terrible puns to the original film and trying to be funny made my skin crawl. The first predator film was serious and this one was more like a awful comedy. Only reason it got 5 is because boyd Holbrook because his acting was on point. Also CGI isn't the best
10.0,15 September 2018,"The Predator...

What to say? That was awful. Absolutely shocking. Unbelievably bad beyond words. Nothing made sense. Not one scene landed. Every time I thought it had reached the lowest that it possibly could, it somehow managed to get EVEN WORSE. I was genuinely embarrassed to be sat in that cinema watching it. It's legitimately one of the worst movies I've ever endured. I wasn't so much desperate for the film to end as begging to be put out of my misery.

The new Super Predator is just the icing on the turd that is this nonsense.

My reaction to The Predator is a violent, guttural, animalistic one. It's one ugly mother... I never want to relive this moment.

I've been an IMDb member for years and this is the first review I've ever written - that's how angry I currently am."

4.0,16 September 2018,"Actually, steaming piles of excrement contain more logic than this entire movie. I have a rule to never walk out on movies, but boy was I close on this one! AVP are freaking masterpieces of cinema when lined up against The Predator.

The real predator here is 20th Century Fox who, not satisfied with killing off the Alien franchise with deplorable writing, have now slaughtered its compatriot by allowing The Predator to be written, evidently, by a twelve year old boy addicted to Fortnite explosions and who thinks the F-word is the pinnacle of hilarity no matter the context.

Friends, if you've seen this eye-gouging crapfest, please know that you're not alone in your trauma. I'm considering starting a support website for counselling services, and will welcome the actors in this movie who probably need it the most.

I'm giving this movie a 1 out of 10 only because of the love story subplot between the guy with Tourette's and that dude from Pitch Perfect 2. If I've learned anything from this movie, it's that love allows you to survive being shish-kebabbed through your chest, or summarily disembowelled, long enough to share a sweet and tender moment of lovingly understanding eye contact, before romantically shooting each other in the head."

Shane Black should kick his own butt. I could've made this movie be a true sequel to the original. Also I would have cast someone else besides Olivia Munn uninteresting acting. Movie is a mess..
7.0,10 November 2018,"I'm only about 20 minutes into this and it is horrendous, the CGI is rotten the humour must've been written by an 11 year old. I think this may be the last of already below average Predator sequels but it's a new low. The acting is shocking the directing is shocking, I bypassed it at the cinema I'm glad I did i reckon I would've walked out by now. It's a pity they could do so much for a sequel and for me personally we've never really had a great sequel to the original."
3.0,13 October 2024,"I have no idea why they made a predator movie into a action/comedy, but they did, and this is it. It's like Guardians of the Galaxy style action/comedy. As many have said, just go with it, ignore all previous predator movies, and it'll be typical action/comedy for you. If you're a die hard fan that can't stand all of the crappy sequels, well, this'll be another to ad to that list. The action, effects, etc. Were great, the comedy... meh, but most all comedy for the last couple decades has been all pretty much meh, so there you go. As far as the comedy goes, I believe I had two ""Pff, ha!"" moments, but that was about it as far as laughs. The very ending reminded me of the old TV show Knight Rider where they ran out of story ideas, so they started upgrading Kit the car with more and more crap to the point of being ridiculous."
10.0,17 November 2018,"How to shoot oneself in the foot with 88 million bucks.

I feel sorry for Hollywood. Even with a fanbase and a wholly built universe, they've become unable to write a screenplay.

The suspension of disbelief is impossible. The humor is frankly bad and out of place and the acting is poor.

What can I say?

The original 1987 movie is still the best, and it's certainly not about to change.

I'm hugely disappointed."
6.0,15 September 2018,"For someone who has never seen the original, this felt super familiar. In my opinion if you let the movie just roll on, sit back and just enjoy the ride - it actually is fun. But the thing is if you take yourself backwards and look at it differently, it's pretty bad.

CHARACTERS were underdeveloped. As much everyone played their role nicely, their character background just didn't have much room for the audience to root for any of them. There were also doubtful moments like the doctor being a badass, and fighting alongside all these military guys - and ending up NOT HAVING MUCH BRUISE OR WHATEVER. She was literally thrown to places, but nope. Crew had to make sure she looks beautiful af for the camera.

PLOT offers nothing new. Again, I haven't watched the original but this one felt like it's a rehash of other alien films (Independence Day, etc.) It also suggests that the predators have been on earth a few times before - yet everyone seems unexperienced in terms of knowing how to battle with it.

THE MOOD / TONE is also weird. I don't think it wanted (or tried) to be a dark, thrilling experience. It gives you a prejudgement that it will be a thriller kinda like one of the ALIEN franchise films, but it's not. It's more of an action-comedy film. YES COMEDY. It is really funny, which made it very enjoyable, but at the same time made the film more indecisive. If it wanted to focus on being an action-comedy then it should've stayed like that. The action scenes weren't impressive or memorable as well.

THE ENDING also sucked hard. It showed us a huge potential for the franchise - that more films could come - but kind a sure this just ruined the chances of that."
3.0,17 November 2018,This was a complete disaster and disappointment. Sad because I had high hopes. But it just didn't meet any of my expectations. There is zero storyline. The effects sucks. It's just awful.

7.0,6 March 2019,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning

This is the section of the review where I usually write the plot summary, although it is not clearly in evidence that The Predator has a plot, so I'll just have to try as best as I can. From what I could decipher, Quinn McKenna (Boyd Holbrook) is one of a group of convicts heading on a bus to a place of detainment. However, Quinn has an autistic son named Rory (Jacob Trembley) who can read the language of the Predators. Which is just as well, as they've crash landed on Earth (again!) and this time want to consume the human species for themselves. I hope I've been as accurate as I can, but I really can't describe it any better.

Since the Predator first graced movie screens back in 1987, he has certainly become, to coin maybe an overused phrase, a 'cultural icon.' Even if you weren't the biggest fan of the film, the very figure itself, with it's ugly, spider like face and Rasta dreads (not to mention the very costume design) was certainly highly visceral and mesmerising in itself, ingraining itself in your mind, and with huge potential for spin offs. Which, indeed, there certainly were. But, as successful a franchise as it became, there was a sense that the greatness of the original would never be matched, with even megastar Arnold Schwarzenegger jumping ship after the first one. And, this time round, the series has been regurgitated to the point of death.

Like many modern films, the onus to push diversity shines through, with the encouraging inclusion of a young autistic boy as one of the main characters. It's just a shame he's appearing in a film with such a terrible script. As I've already posited, the plot feels virtually none existent, and as such it's impossible to care about any of the characters, or feel for any of them as real people. From what I've gathered from other reviewers, apparently this was meant as more of a comic, Deadpool style affair, but it certainly never makes you laugh, or warm to any of the cardboard cut out characters any more. And even the action is lame, with some laughably cheap looking CGI for a film with such a large budget.

This review feels pretty pointless in many ways, as I don't think I can trash the film any more than anyone else has, as there doesn't seem to be any positive reviews at all (apart, apparently, from some obviously paid ones other reviewers have seen!) It's just a shining, stinking example of the laziness of modern Hollywood, yet again taking a long established franchise, not bothering to write anything resembling a coherent, proper plot or writing characters that in any way feel like real people. I despair for young cinemagoers today (but it's probably them who are writing them!) *"
3.0,15 September 2018,"The movie taken at face value was amazing. The humor wasn't over the top and redundant where it wasn't funny anymore. There were awesome execution scenes. People try to compare too much to old and new that they are left disappointed, just as they do with comic movies. I agree that the predators should have been more difficult to defeat but overall without critiquing and being anal retentive I enjoyed it."
7.0,15 September 2018,"I can understand the criticism for this film. However, it's a Predator movie, you can't expect too much. This movie hits most of the marks. It was cheesy, funny, entertaining, plus it used the classic score & sound effects from the original. Seeing the predator in full costume on the big screen reminds me of the days of poping in Predator with Schwarzenegger on VHS. It's worth a watch if you like the old ones."

8.0,15 September 2018,When did they have time to get motorcycles? What was the point of first predator then a gigantic one? I know there was an upgrade but i got lost. The predator dogs just sit there then there is one who is frendly. I don't remember if that dog lived or died? ha awful acting the trailer was probably a better film than what I saw. I can't wait for the Halloween sequel. HEard that is very well done. They should have went with the original script where Arnold appears at the end.
6.0,17 September 2018,"I'll keep this short. If you go into this movie with extremely low expectations looking for little more than some predator-themed violence, you will come away feeling at least somewhat satisfied. If, however, you are hoping for a movie that breathes new life into an underestimated franchise that has huge potential, you'll no doubt come away bitter and disappointed.

In brief, the strengths:

-A lot of laughs keep the movie from taking itself too seriously -A decent amount of action keeps the movie entertaining if you come for the alien violence and nothing more -There's a slight deepening of the Predator lore, so the movie at least tries to show us something we haven't seen before -A cast of strong actors, for the most part, keeps the movie afloat -Because of the humor and action, it is, if nothing else, fun at times

The weaknesses:

-This movie is dumb. I mean DUMB. -A lot of the humor comes off as forced and trying too hard -This movie is one ugly MFer. No, really, it's bursting with absolutely terrible CGI, especially in the final act. For reference, it's on par with the original Thor's final battle -Not enough action with the original Predator creature; too much reliance on a bad CGI rendering of something new for the sake of being new -Odd pacing hampers what could have been an otherwise strong movie, despite the other flaws; scenes are rushed, the action muddy, the stakes unclear; it barrels forward without much interest in setting up suspense or thrills--just one muddy action sequence after another with jokes in between -Did I mention this movie is dumb? It is really, really dumb -The stupidity is multiplied by an unnecessary, out-of-left-field final sequel-bait scene that should have been left on the cutting room floor"
4.0,16 September 2018,"Stay away from this bizarre wish fulfillment from the viewpoint of a dad with a ""genius"" autistic son. What trash. I'd say the kid character ruined the movie, but the movie was ruined regardless - all around terrible. Predators was much more entertaining."

Perhaps the studio had final say in what was the end result? Who knows. All I can say is I would have rather seen a complete remake of the original using the surviving cast members in their original roles. Reshoot the same movie using today's FX and CGI to make one hell of a retro film. Has this ever even been attempted?! Remaking the same film with the same cast. I'd be first in line to see it."

1.0,11 September 2018,"I was lucky enough to see this at TIFF last thurs, and was blown away by the sheer intense action and entertainment that Shane Black's signature style delivered. The plot is swiftly paced and catapults the viewer into a massive battle triangle of non stop relentless pure cold blooded gore filled thrills. The cast consisting of the Loonies actually surprises here with their comic relief as well as their overall chemistry. You start rooting for them and get a feel for their backgrounds as they face the epic galactic problem on their planet. Boyd Holbrook stands out especially with a great heroic performance and was a solid main protagonist. Some of the comedy is hilarious and you can tell Black and Dekker came up With it. The real stars and what we all came to see, The Predator's are what truly carry this film to great heights. The fugitive Predator will be a very memorable character of the franchise and will surprise a lot of people. The practical design and creature effects are top notch here and as good if not even better than the classic Winston originals form P1/2. The Ultimate Predator is absolutely incredible and ferociously obliterating throughout the film and a true force to be reckoned with. The cgi Of the Ultimate is very well done in the darker scenes but a bit dull in the light though overall looks great. When it all comes down to the finale things get damn right insane and extravagant. There are some scenes that true Predator fans will be clamoring over and had me swooning. There is a bit of an unexpected plot turn toward the final Moments that will be sure to throw some people off as well as give fans of hope of a bright new future of the franchise and I definitely didn't see it coming. Overall this was an absolutely fantastic no holds barred throwback action film with some amazing Predator franchise expansion and is a must see for any action fan and without a doubt needs to be seen by every single predator fan."

2.0,20 November 2018,"Nothing makes any sense in this movie. There are so many gaps between several sequences that the whole ""finished"" product comes across as a relentless insult to viewers. I was 18 when the original Predator was first screened and I felt mesmerized by the whole concept. 30+ years later, we are very obviously at the end of a downward path. I forced myself to go through this abomination, mouth agape, thinking what I was watching was not real, that it could only get better... but nothing came in to save it from a total collapse. It's too long to cite what went wrong, from the lack of characters development to the shallowness of the scenario, to the lacklusting SFX, to the irrationality in the succession of sequences, etc., etc. etc. The list goes on forever.

6.0,24 September 2018,Anyone going to see this hoping to see a remake of the classic Arnie movie will be disappointed. But given its all been done before to try and reach the tension and mystery of the first movie would be pointless. Instead Shane Black took a more lively approach creating a movie that's fun to watch with a couple of pseudoscientific twists thrown in for good measure. Solid acting all around (thank goodness Hollywood are moving away from cute blond kids with lisps) with no cringeworthy moments. Sit back and enjoy a bit of fun.

First part was awesome, especially back in time, second was good, I like it and then... it start getting worse and worse, and when I though ok, that's it, they ruined the movie - no! These guys step in and put the final nail in the coffin.

I couldn't succeed to even watch whole movie (I watched more then half and simple couldn't do it more). I think all this ""jokes"" which Predator perform (literally) in movie, yes you read correctly made me realise ok, definately only name is there, After first 2 minutes you will know everything.

7.0,20 September 2018,"Full disclosure, I've only really seen the first two movies, and after that I ignored the franchise. When the 2010 film dropped, it didn't even hit my radar and none of the crossovers with aliens I even bothered with...

...but by 2010 I was 30 and, honestly, these are rated ""R"" movies that I loved in my childhood. But that was the 80s when parents could take their children to bloody rated R movies and not be arrested for abuse.

So, when they started making more, as much as I loved the first one, I really didn't care too much about the series. They lost me at the sequel.

But 2018 rolled around and I was feeling nostalgic. I wanted a throw back to a simpler time when people weren't so high strung about everything including the movies. Why not give it a try.

And, I loved Predator as a kid even though it was clearly an adult movie. But you get the feeling that this one was a rated R movie clearly made for children.

I remember moments of levity in the first few...but I don't recall them being light and, almost whimsical at all. They were serious sci-fi horror films.

This comes across as a Marvel movie, and though I love Marvel movies I don't want a Predator movie to feel like The Avengers. It's the Predator, it is supposed to have a different tone.

It left me with a bad taste in my mouth. It was too light to be a Predator movie. It wasn't dark. It wasn't scary, and it had too much of an attempt at humor to enjoy.

In other words, the movie stank. It couldn't even remember what it was supposed to be."

I weap for the future of Cinema after this. I will never acknowledge the existence of this film within the franchise and I will never support or be interested in any other films from Shane Black.

I can't believe it was THIS bad. Do not pay to see this. Ever. Not a theater ticket, not a BluRay purchase, not a Digital Download. Do not support this movie in anyway. Vote with your wallet. Avoid this film like the plague, would be my suggestion.

As a huge fan of the first ""Predator"" (1986), and the one who loved the sequel ""Predator 2"" (a highly underrated movie) and the one who actually enjoyed ""Predators"" (2010), i was blown away how bad this new movie ""The Predator"" (2018) is. I was really looking forward to this movie. Shane Black said its going to be a true sequel to the first one. Boy oh boy how disappointed i am after watching it. Even the first AVP movie is better then this garbage.

Unfortunately, in this movie they successfully were able to get rid of the horror that was associated with the monster Predator character, a skitchy story that ends up as being either funny or silly, and finally adding a child with the ability to ruin the movie on every scene. I strongly suggest to leave the movie before the ending, as it's probably the worst part of the movie."

It's almost like Black watched all predator films made since the first and challenged himself to make the worst in the series.

I can see this appealing to kids but it's utter tripe"
7.0,29 September 2018,"The Predator Review 2/5

The film opens with a Predator being pursued by another ship. It manages to escape crash landing on earth. Our lead character played by Boyd Holbrook is a special ops assassin who bumps into the predator and salvages some of its weapons. Considering it was written and directed by Shane Black (Lethal Weapon, The Nice Guys) it's an underwhelming letdown. It's bloated cast of characters are one dimensional and dull with barely any chemistry or development. If they'd have cut some characters out it could have been a more focused film.

It mocks mental illnesses like Tourette's and Autism and just has no regard for coherent storytelling. There are some good things to take away from it like the predator design which is great as always, the visual effects are good (apart from a few which look cheap) and the action scenes are not bad. The first 40 minutes or so it's actually a decent film exploring some things we've never really seen in depth like the alien technology and where they come from but it just falls apart once its second act kicks in.

The whole third act was reported to have been re-shot entirely from scratch and I won't spoil it here but it's all over the show. The music score is generic mostly using the cues from the first film. If you've ever seen a Predator film you'll know how each scene will play out because it tries to mimic what made the original film a success, it even puts its own cringy spin on the famous lines like 'get to the choppers' and 'you're one beautiful motherfucker'.

You'd think the predator would do most of the killing but it's actually the human protagonists and they have no remorse whatsoever near enough spitting out cheesy one liners after each kill. Tonally it's inconsistent and never really knows what it wants to be - Does it want to be a horror or a cheesy homage to 80s sci-if action films? It would have been a much better film if it stuck to being a horror because there are a few scenes where it works well.

It mostly fails with the action route thanks to its clunky editing and dark lighting making it hard to see what is going on. The hard R rating feels like a desperate attempt to reach out to fans and it just feels forced with the exaggerated CG blood effects and bad language. It's an ongoing trend to revamp franchise films from the 70s and 80s and they do work if done right but where films like Blade Runner 2049 and Planet of the Apes succeed there's always a failure like Solo and The Predator. It's just sad to see such a franchise suffer especially with a talented writer and director like Shane Black.

All in all the acting is fine but it's quite a boring film with a jumbled plot and an awful lot of predictable scenes throughout. The 2010 reboot is worth a watch because it is so much better than this. It's not as long and has a better pace. I hate to say it but Alien vs Predator is more enjoyable than this."
3.0,22 April 2019,"My first and only thought about this film is ""Why did they make it?"" It is stupid, and I want to know who greenlit this production and spent all those money when they could have given it to the needy (or maybe even me?) total waste of time and total waste of money."
4.0,15 September 2018,"Great tie in to the original predator franchise! Kinnaman actually holds great chemistry as the main ""hero"". The other characters that are introduced as a lesser known group are developed very well and show a great contribution to the overall story. So right away the action doesn't hold back and it continues to showcase what a Predator movie/franchise can be.

The secondary plot with a child however is where the story gets bogged down with an almost unnecessary need to emphasis the directors poor choices. That is where the movie gets terrible for the quarter of the movie plot to be centralized once again around a child actor that can not act and has zero likeability to care why he is in the overall story. A troph that director Shane Black seems to use a lot in his recent movies. Hollywood needs to be more aware of when children are needing to showcased enough in movies. This is not the movie for that.

Walk in to expect an epic amount of predator killing action... bogged down by a zero likeable child that is annoying to the ""T"". Otherwise it delivers to be one of the better out of the series. Even with the amount of advertising that gave away the main centralized plot of super predators! Maybe Hollywood will take pride in knowing that their projects will get enough of an audience outcome to withhold major details from the trailers. Overall a decent movie with just enough great action scenes to want more!!!!"

2.0,15 September 2018,"I typically don't check on films here. I made an exception since I couldn't put my finger on how this movie ""felt"" when watching it. It was, to me, a homage to the old school action movies I grew up with in the 80s-early 90s. And what do you know. It was directed by a guy who was responsible for some great 80s movies! I honestly had no idea who any of the directors/writers were before looking them up. So.... a movie review for this title? Simple:

It's not going to win an Oscar. But it will take any reasonable person back to their childhood when movies were FUN! (if you were alive during that time) There are black guys in this. Yet you don't notice because it's not a movie about race. There is a strong female, or two in this. Yet you don't get the ""stronk"" woman vibe from it because you don't need that crap- you just don't need it jammed down your throat! I mean that is what made the 80s movies so freaking awesome! They were more inclusive to all these issues we complain about today but no one noticed! Even the original Predator was incredibly diverse in casting! But it's not considered a diversity film!! I wish more movies were like this. It just seems more ""real"".

Please, directors and writers. Take me back to simpler times when movies were entertainment and not a method of shilling propaganda! Mr. Black I thank you! I had no idea who you were until I hadn't seen a decent action movie in years and looked this one up after a screening. Your resume has some of my favorite films and I never knew it. Go figure. Kiss Kiss remains a top 10 movie to me and my wife to this day.

Super nerds and NEETs feel free to keep whining about this not being ""canon"" with your subsequent low ratings. Good grief. If any of you were in your 40s you'd realize how these type of films are gems in a box of crap in the current year. I know... you're literary shaking I bet. You guys should stick to movies like the first film ever to have a black guy and a strong female lead (sarcasm), Black Panther. More the typical millennial/zoomer fodder these days."
6.0,21 September 2020,"As always, the movie unfortunately doesn't even care about adding any amount of depth to the Predator lore. Instead, you're in for yet another no-brained hunting trip with your favorite extraterrestrial killer.

1.0,19 June 2022,"1987's 'Predator' is a classic, and 1990's first sequel, while boasting what is on the surface a curious premise, is ultimately just as good. What these two movies have in common is that the Yautja, a terrifically proficient killing machine, presents as an exceptional unknown threat, and the result in both cases is a great action blockbuster. 2010's 'Predators' was an outstanding, action-packed thrill ride that changed the game by putting the prey in unfamiliar surroundings. I can appreciate the need to introduce new elements into these features to keep the concept fresh - and rest assured, 2018's 'The predator' doubles down on that notion, for both good and ill. It's a significant shift from its predecessors, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't have mixed feelings about it. One way or another, however, it's still a good bit of fun.

The first alteration from the formula to greet us is a glaring one, and it tests our patience even in the first few moments before we see the title appear on the screen. Essential aspects of the plot and scene writing feel like they could be spliced in from any number of other non-'Predator' features from the past 30-40 years, including 'Independence Day,' and even modern superhero flicks. Further small details in the narrative - the who, the why, the alignment of the humans we see - are likewise very familiar, no matter how well written they are, and the end product is a movie that feels less like a successor to 31 years of a series and more like facets of that series being jury-rigged to fit a more ordinary genre picture. And, oh, one more thing: if 'The predator' is 50% sci-fi action, the other 50% is comedy.

It's gratifyingly smart comedy, I will note, with fantastic repartee in the dialogue, and situational humor. Still, if the infusion of abject humor into the franchise seems over the top, just wait until you get an eyeful of the heightened blood and gore, the exaggerated characters, a more up close and personal updated appearance for the Yautja, expanded Yautja lore, and more grandiose special effects. The flavors here are very distinct; if this title's antecedents were chocolate ice cream, this entry is like a dollop of chocolate ice cream inserted into the middle of a container of rainbow sherbet.

None of this is to suggest 'The predator' is bad, because it's certainly not. We get what we'd want out of its kin, only with a mind for popcorn-plucking bombastic entertainment over sincere thrills - I mean, it's easy to imagine the climax adapted for an attraction at an amusement park. Honestly, I do like it, and it's well made. The filming locations are choice, and there's nothing about the production design that isn't considered or realized with utmost care. Set pieces, costume design, hair and makeup, props and weapons - and, yes, the visual effects - all look great. Moreover, the cast is solid. I don't even mean Boyd Holbrook as protagonist McKenna; it's rather the supporting cast that steals the show. This includes Trevante Rhoades, Thomas Jane, and others rounding out McKenna's new ""unit""; Olivia Munn, portraying the most hard-boiled biologist I've ever seen; and Yvonne Strahovski as McKenna's estranged wife, filling the role with piss and vinegar that makes me wish we got to see more of her. The characters aren't especially complex, but that's hardly a surprise in an action movie, and the ensemble bring them to life very well.

I guess what it comes down to is just how serious one is about their sci-fi action. If you're fixated on the purity of what the first two or three 'Predator' films represent, or if you don't care for comedy blended into your action flicks, then this probably isn't for you. On the other hand, if you're in love with the highfalutin romps represented by movies like Michael Bay's 'Transformers,' or recent Marvel ventures, this is likely right up your alley. For viewers who are receptive to all the wide possibilities cinema may lay before them, it's really up to individual discretion. In my case, I gladly recognize what 'The predator' does well, and what it wants to be, but at the same time, there's a great deal about it that just feels so unexceptional that it becomes a bit bland. I still like it - but unlike its predecessors, I don't know that I'd say this is a must-see. Good, weird, overdone - this is a film that's just here to have a blast. It succeeds; I'd just rather it did more to stand out."

It got to be predictable, boring, cringey like none other, and downright insulting. I spent $1.25 getting this at Redbox and I still want my money back.

By the time it was over, I was physically ill. I was literally nauseous to the point I thought I might throw up. I didn't want to move, it made me so sick. I'm not exaggerating. What a steaming pile of filth this movie is. If IMDB had a lower rating, I'd give it a lower rating."

6.0,5 August 2022,"Stupid and juvenile but also rather entertaining and quite fun- The Predator is not a very good movie- nor a solid starting point to reboot a franchise- but it is a fun popcorn flick. There's nothing really significant I can say this film does, the visuals are really nice- I enjoyed the cinematography but the CGI Predator interactions can feel a bit fake at times and prove to be noticeable. I wasn't a huge fan of all the military praise but the cast did a really good job regardless and did prove to have some fun on-screen chemistry. Olivia Munn's character was literally useless, which is a shame because that girl really does not get a break. First X-Men Apocalypse then this, she truly became the queen of unnecessary female characters in Fox films. I enjoy the storyline even if it was rather thin. The dynamics between the characters, the predators, and the government make for some rather entertaining antics- and Black's directing style seems to fit perfectly with the films rather sadistic sense of humor. The last 20 minutes or so did kinda seem to drag on, but all the other fight scenes were really well done and gave us some of the coolest predator moments in the franchise- especially the lab fight and school scenes. In the end, The Predator doesn't do much to make it stand out- but is a solid watch nevertheless and more often than not was a fun watch.

My Rating: 6.2/10."

7.0,10 June 2022,"This extremely violent, pacy and comical popcorn-flick works well as a big sci-fi action movie, but it's just not acceptable as a Predator movie. Although it's quite enjoyable on a different level, Shane Black's The Predator has an utter amount of flaws, as well as so many things that raise questions and make absolutely no sense. This is why the movie is so ridiculous and underwhelming in so many directions.

A very new element in this movie compared to the 1987 original is CGI work and effects, which are usually bombed on when they appear big sequels or reboots like The Predator. The extreme blood effects are CGI and even the predator or the other creatures are CGI. This doesn't live up to the original classic and should be avoided by viewers who hate CGI work in film, but this all would've worked finely as a completely new sci-fi action concept.

But seriously, it may be a very disappointing let-down of a Predator movie, but if audiences view it as just an original and brand new sci-fi action flick, it's much more enjoyable and acceptable. It's extremely violent, it's fast-paced and there's very frequent but often crude comic relief, especially by Keegan-Michael Key. So, just give 2018's The Predator a chance as something that isn't a Predator movie. It's appreciable.

It's all ones or tens from you people, be a little more objective and less hyperactive-fan-boy about your reviewing."
7.0,10 December 2018,The worst of the worst. Don't bother to watch this movie.
2.0,16 September 2018,"First of all, let's dismiss the obvious. This isn't McTienry's Predator, nor does it try to be. Those saying 'don't watch it if you're a fan of the original' are both and wrong. Does it involve the mystery and suspense of the original? No. Does it involve the gore, action and camaraderie of the original? Absolutely, x10.

Whilst I love the original and personally herald it as one of the best action-horror films ever, The Predator doesn't do it any injustice, it is it's own completly separate film. Whilst it involves cheeky nods and references to the first two films in the franchise - and even AVP -, whether it be a one liner or a character, the film staples itself as something different and distances itself from previous films in the franchise. In the first film, the antagonist is slowly drip fed to you over the course of the movie, whereas this film makes it statement clear and introduces a Predator from the very start. If you need any more indication of what direction Shane Black is taking the film then I can't help you.

Speaking of Shane Black, you can clearly tell it is his script, it's where the film shines, as per with most of his films (see The Nice Guys or Kiss Kiss Bang Bang). The banter and interactions between the ""Loonies"" is at time, genuinely hilarious and really adds to the feeling that these group of guys are all in the same boat - or in this case, bus. Some of the characters are underused, which is a damn shame but the majority get their own individual moment and it works. I never thought Thomas Jane had comedy chops but I was wrong and in my opinion he was one of the best characters in the film. The protagonist was fine, nothing special but the film isn't about him, not really. The secondary antagonist was alright, but nothing stand out. Overall, the team dynamic was there and the dialogue that Black has created seriously worked and didn't take away from the feel of the film - in fact it enhanced it.

The action was fine. Some impressive physical effects and the Predator outfit was great to see, especially before the focus was shifted on the all-CG character instead. The right blend I thought. Again, the gore was plentiful and due to the large budget, they were able to use physical blood and gore a lot more, which looked a whole lot better than the, at time, horrendous CGI. It just looked bad. Other than that the action set pieces were fine, some were 'meh' and others made me wanna shout in manly giddiness.

Other than those two things, that pretty much make the movie what it is, there isn't much to say. The film isn't perfect and it certainly won't win any Oscars. There are pacing issues, some lines don't land as well as they intended, some of the effects look very shoddy and there are some headscratching story moments. However, if you go into this film thinking it's gonna be serious, suspenseful and akin to the original, all I have to say is 'Why?'. Leave the original as it is, a Arnie flick with one liners, great suspense and a total disregard for forest plant-life. Go into this with a blank slate, don't compare, and accept it for what it is - a silly, gory, very funny action romp."

The main characters are more interesting than the title character, there's no mystery. Not intriguing at all. I liked the acting and the script, not the story. The action was good.

I understand everyone compares it to the previous Predators, but you know - every joke is funny only the first time. There is no way to use an idea a second and a third time and each time to get better and better. On the other hand, the movie is good enough to be worth watching (if you do not whimper continuously for the previous series). At the end of the day it is better than most b-movies, there is plenty of humor and tension."
9.0,19 September 2018,"So, big fan of Predator as a character... Huge fan of the original film which among others defined my childhood... Predator 2 was ok... I even enjoyed AvP and AvP 2 for what they are - mindless action and slaughter... Then came The Predators which I hoped would return the franchise to glory, which fell spectacularly short... and then this.

This movie SUCKS in every aspect imaginable, whether you're a previous fan of the franchise or not. Horrible acting. Horrible ""plot"". Horrible characters. More ""jokes"" than in any comedy, yet most of them are cringe-inducing and feel completely out of place. Even the action scenes are crap. There is no Predator in ""The Predator"". There is no stealth, no horror, no anticipation, no ANYTHING. There's just a horribly CGI-animated 3.5m tall ""Predator"" which acts as a tank - run in and brute force kill everything. And he's absolutely unbelievably stupid and gets easily outwitted by anyone all the time in the most basic and stupid ways.

The story is completely incomprehensible and makes ZERO sense. Basically the director took a huge dump on the franchise and ruined it for all time unless they somehow remove this movie from the cannon. It's literally worse than what The Last Jedi did to Star Wars.

Please, if you are a Predator fan, SAVE YOURSELF and don't go watch this ""movie""."

6.0,14 September 2018,"What happens when a studio takes the production and is motivated by nothing more than money nd profits. A sub par debacle called the PREDATOR...Shane black is a decent director,yet he is in the middle of this firestorm that will consume the franchise. The movie doesn't take itself seriously for one moment, this a children's adpation of storytelling (EVEN AN R RATING IS useless ) ,screenplay is terrible, the screenrighters did not proof read the dialogues. This is a direct adapation of something that was only suited for a comic book . The predator is forgettable,most characters are souless, physics is completely massacred. Every happens according to a grand coincidence for the protogonist. There are no fights the team can not loose, no heights they can jump,a biologist can track and hunt down an Apex predator (in a fist fight with blades and a small gun) , the series has taken a severe beating which will dampen the future income for this. Don't waste your money ,this is not even worth direct VOD..the studios must build characters and plotlines. This movie if basically a wanabe comedy show running in between a Expendables explosion scene. This movie be truly THE PREDATOR KILLER fr the series."

Acting and writing was also not that good. They were okay.

This movie is actually worse than AVP Requiem which is saying something because that was unbelievably awful. This movie has no concept, has no flow it really has the Worst plot inside the the predator universe that I've ever witnessed, the ending makes it seem like a superhero movie and it's outside I wish I could say something positive about this movie but there really isn't anything it's that bad and that's saying something I waited all year for this movie to come out...saw it opening night and really regret wasting one hour and 42 minutes of my time.

God awful...so disappointing...worse than The Last Jedi...so think about that level of awfulness."

Even more! I was astonished with fact that they managed to make each (trust me, every single one of them) next scene more stupid than previous one.

Forced humor (or what suppose to be humor), forced ""linking"" between characters, acting, effects... everything is so bloody dumb that they better put title Predator VS Facepalm.

If they ever make remake of Tropical Thunder, they should reedit that popular scene, which should goes: ""Never go full Predator(2018)!""

I was big fan and honestly - was. This is the last time that i m going to cinema to see any movie from this franchise."

As for the story no complaints 8/10. Really enjoyed how humanity is dealing with the limited knowledge we have of their race. Characters keep the plot moving quickly

Effects. 9/10 few scenes were CGI wasn't perfection but otherwise great.

Character Build up. 10/10. Enough to make you care without interfering with the action.

Sound 10/10 all the classics you'd expect in a predator movie.

Would definitely see another. Great job Shane Black"

It angered me to the point where I walked out. Maybe questions were answered later on in the movie but I'd had enough, the main question is why the predator was so human like, even knowing how to use a machine gun. WTF, no use of it's special toys that it used to defeat a crack team of muscle bound army guys lead by Arnie or an L.A police department and the FBI lead by Danny Glover. This thing was just a joke, as was the movie, bad everything, the crack team now a bunch of crack pots with bad jokes, lead by a mental handicapped boy just to keep the PC crowd happy. The action scenes were tedious and repetitive, the jokes wore thin, the storyline non existent, badly put together. IT'S JUST WRONG. no wonder Arnie refused to be a part of it.

I still don't know if I should blame the script or the editing... it jumps all over the place and just expects you to roll with it... also, the profanity is wildly overdone and unnecessary due to the amount of violence and gore that would have easily given it the R rating that they were shooting for...

1.0,26 September 2018,"The Predator is about a scientist who ends up getting situated with these ex-army men, who become involved in the hunting of an escaped Predator that crash-landed on earth. Meanwhile, the scientist's son played by Jacob Tremblay unintentionally attracts more Predators on over to the planet after getting his hands on their technology.

This movie was directed by Shane Black, who starred in the original Predator with Schwarzenegger. I say this because I expected a lot more than what I got. I was hoping for a movie that was faithful to the original film, despite the Predators having upgraded technology. Instead of something suspenseful and thrilling, what we got instead was a loud, bloated and incoherent mess.

I will give this movie credit that this movie isn't terrible; it has its pluses. I actually liked the opening of the movie and I think it sets it up really well. The first 20 minutes are at least enjoyable, aside from one somewhat offensive scene involving the kid. I also found the action to be well choreographed. The effects were good and the score was alright. However, the action does feel too short.

The movie's first half is pretty simple and tolerable at best. The second half of the movie, however is unnecessarily bloated. There are certain things that happen that don't make a lot of sense. Sideplots end up mashing together just before the third act that add almost nothing to the story. By that point, the focus is more on the characters rather than the Predators, so why bother to mash them in and make the movie feel incredibly bloated and incoherent?

And the characters, I hate the characters. They're all unlikable except for the scientist and the kid. The ex-army men, who are probably the worst characters, are simply unbearable throughout the entire film. They're loud, obnoxious comic reliefs with way too many lines that they need. There's a scene in the movie where the scientist, the army men and a woman are all in a room and the army men spend around two minutes hitting on her, and it drags on for too long. That's the humor we get from these guys. They don't even have motivations for killing the Predators, they just seem to want to kill it for the sake of it. That's just one of the examples of the atrocious characters in this movie.

If this movie wasn't directed by a star of the original Predator, I think this movie would be more excusable. But since this is Shane Black directing it, I think he could've done far better than what we were given.

I'm a huge fan of the original and have been sorely disappointed in every other installment in the series, save the direct sequel. I went into this viewing of The Predator with somewhere in the range of no expectations to brutally low. Now, with that being said, I found this flick to be pretty okay for what it is. It's no where near the calibur the original was, but I feel like it's not trying to be and that's honestly kind of refreshing. I pushed of watching this for so long because I expected to be disappointed, and this was in part due to the bad press and negative rep it received through outlets such as this. Give it a chance is all I'm saying. Stop feasting on the ""member berries"" and expecting something similar to the source material.

Gore and Action are good - some scenes are really good and some are deep black,fast cuts so you dont know what happened..

Comedy is awesome, this cast of idiots was great and they are really,really funny - but why this in predator ?

I didn't think it was possible but Shane Black actually managed to make a Predator movie worse than ""Predator 2"".

This movie is a mess. It's silly, it tries to be half a comedy, it tries to continually reference the original movie but fails.

Technically, the movie is dark, the action editing is awful - to the point you can't understand what you're seeing on screen - the CGI is awful.

Plot wise, you can see right from the opening scene that the movie takes the wrong direction: This time you see everything from the predator side. There is no mystery like in the original (and the sequels), no build up, no tension. The plot is stupid and the third act completely jumps the shark. The last scene is cringy.

The main male lead who personally do not know his work is no Arni and not very good in this role, the main female who is a scientist turns into Rambo pulling off silly moves when in combat. She keeps getting thrown about to the point for me I wished they would just kill the character off.

The rest of the cast are ok, the bad guy is good but his presence is not long enough to save the film.

Is this better than predator 2, not in my opinion

The ending reminded me of the farce that was Robocop the series and this thing on a whole in my opinion in terms of how good it is, is on that level.

.Was it flawed...yes .need more direction and story....yes .Was there some things needed to be forgotten... Yes o yes .was it action packed.. very .Was it vicious. Yes .comedy make me laugh..yes .have a kick ass original pred.... Hell yeh.

I enjoyed it for what was a very good action film. Similar to that you don't take expendables too seriously. Could of been alot better with tweaks but enjoyed it. I think it's going to be one of those marmite things some will love the new direction. Some will hate it. Did feel with all the chopping and changing of final cut that it impacted the film.. just hope we get the full polished film when releases on blu ray."

6.0,14 January 2019,"All right so I'm a huge fan of the original Predator movie, but come on really what did you all expect? Did you want a complete copy with new actors? I for one think this plot is refreshing and I enjoyed the comic relief. It could have been better in ways, but again the interesting idea for the new story makes up for it. If you want some good action, some gore, and a few laughs, check it out! It's a fun movie."
1.0,15 September 2018,"Avoid it, i wanted to leave before the end of te movie but i bought too many nachos so i was forced to stay, the movie is even worse than the main characters acting. the youke at the end ""what are you"", so baad, terrible like the whole movide i want to unsee this movie"
6.0,28 November 2018,"If your looking for a film that really follows in the footsteps of the original, this is not your movie. If your looking for a fun ride with more crazy predator tech and more predator screen time that you can actually see (looking at you AVP requiem) then this is great popcorn flick for you. Watch it and decide for yourself."
1.0,17 September 2018,"I've been a Predator fan for years. This new film ""SUCKED"" Terribly. For me, the movie seemed to be a comedy, which was not funny to me. Black actors always die. I don't remember seeing any Black Women in the Got Dam movie!! The movie was biased to say the least. Let's keep it real. Extraterrestrial's are Black people anyway! There is no way that Black Extraterrestrials would have lost in the real scope of things. I understand that most white movie directors want to keep the real Truths from society at large. I suggest that the developers and staff need to take this movie out of circulation fast. I am vehemently disappointed with the new version of Predator. It displayed the Predator being weak-That's BS!!! I want my money BACK👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿"

3.0,1 May 2019,"Was never a big predator fan, but I expected nothing from this and found it rather enjoyable. Don't expect a lot of sci fi. It's an action comedy with quirky characters and a ridiculous story. But I think the movie strikes a tone which makes it feel consistent and I wasn't bored at any time."
10.0,15 September 2018,"At first I thought I thought that people were just being really harsh towards this movie but after watching it you will understand why. This movie is beyond bad, it felt as if I was watching a Predator parody movie the whole time and it get worse towards the end especially when they introduce the ""Predator Killer."" Please do yourself a favour and don't watch this movie, I wish I didn't, if you want to watch it wait until it comes to a streaming service. I would give it zero stars if I could."
7.0,10 June 2019,As a fan of the original and part 2.....this was once again a action packed movie. CGI was horrible and many holes in the plot. But what did we really expect??? Felt good to watch some action with our favorite hunter
2.0,16 September 2018,"I went in expecting a mediocre film that would be fun to watch, and instead got trash. It was barely watchable. The script was incomprehensible, the editing was garbage, the CGI was overused and poorly done. Dont bother watching it, as it starts out bad and only gets worse."
1.0,15 August 2022,"It could have been the beginning of our ""avengers"" with Boyd as our Steve Rogers/Tony Stark. The plot is not bad, but the script is just plain stupid and clumsy.

I am glad Prey succeeded. More warriors and yautja and less american cowboy fantasies."
6.0,16 September 2018,"This movie was a complete disappointment and, sadly, it probably means that there will be no more Predator movies. Only the first ten minutes were somewhat interesting. The remaining 90 minutes were utter garbage. The plot ignores everything that makes the Predator universe interesting. It was difficult if not impossible to care for any of the characters. The pacing was frenetic and horrendous. The dialogue hardly made sense. The jungle setting of the original was one of the elements that made it so interesting. Instead, this one takes place in some boring suburb, and inevitably, a high school gym. At that point, I was ready to walk out of the theater..."

6.0,21 July 2020,"This is one of those movies where you don't want to think about it too much or it starts to fall apart, and for me that's OK. I'm laying here sick watching a big advanced alien make some of the same dumb decisions that humans make, and I don't even really care. The characters are inconsistent. The plot has a few points that don't feel right. The CGI isn't the best I've ever seen.

But I still had fun. Not every movie needs to be a masterpiece. Sometimes I just wanna see things blow up and take my mind off the world for a bit."

6.0,16 September 2018,"Seriously, what the hell happened here? Did Shane Black even want to make a Predator movie? Because make no mistake, every follow up to 1987's Predator, while all being terrible, are still more legitimate Predator movies than this. You could easily swap out the titular character in this movie with any generic outer space monster/baddie and it wouldn't make any difference because in this movie, the creature isn't the star- it's Shane Black's never-ending parade of bad quips and fall-flat references. This is the sci-fi/action equivalent of an unfunny comedian's five minutes on the mic.

The movie starts out with an army sniper (Boyd Holbrook) witnessing the crash-landing of the Predator on Earth. But apparently this Predator has other plans on Earth other than a few days of hunt-and-kill R&R. Hot on his trail is another kind-of ""super Predator"" trying to hunt him down with the help of Predator dogs (?) and Sterling Brown as a government bad guy who is also- you know what? Forget it. I've already put far more thought into the plot of this mess than the movie has. The Predator doesn't exist to service any kind of story or plot- there's barely a moment when things DON'T happen that seem completely contrary to logic or common sense. What, you mean that the group of soldiers in the woods being hunted by an alien killing machine SHOULDN'T be shouting R-rated one-liners at each other? Perish the thought! This is a Shane Black movie and he's got to make jokes, so make jokes we shall!

I would love to tell you how much better other aspects of the movie, like the action, are. I would love to, but I can't, because when there is actual predatoring going on (which is actually a surprisingly small slice of the film because, you know, JOKES) the movie is cut worse than an MCU film on speed. Forget being able to follow the action, would you like to actually come out the other end of an action scene with some idea of who survived and who didn't? You would? Aw, your optimism is adorable.

Maybe I just don't get Shane Black. It isn't like he's that bad of a writer- his scripts can work when there's a good director to tone down the excesses as necessary. But directing his own material it's way too obvious he's too in love with his own shtick. That's how he made an Iron Man movie with hardly any Iron Man in it. And that's how he's made a Predator movie that's more about an endlessly quipping squad of Three Stooges-ish military rejects than an actual Predator. And when we do get to that Predator, Shane manages to water down any of the terror, threat, or coolness the creature had. Oh well. Maybe if he'd learned to tell a few jokes he'd have gotten a better role in his own movie."
1.0,4 June 2021,"A Predator franchise movie it is not.

10.0,14 September 2018,"We just went to see predator on the cinema. It totally blows. Especially the last 30 minutes, why the lame story and super lame ending? I'm amazed. They took such a nice pitch as predator is and trashed it. Such a disappointment."
6.0,14 November 2018,"I liked this as it's more human than the last couple of predator films. I liked the humour but I could tell that the film had contuity issues as it jumped about quite a bit, and each scene didn't flow into the other very well. Apparently the third act had a hasty reshoot and it shows. Despite this it was still a good film. It's a shame arnie didn't take them up on a cameo, that would have been sweet."

7.0,2 February 2020,This was terrible! Poorly executed 'over used' jokes with a terrible storyline! The actors didn't even fit their roles. So disappointed...
1.0,11 December 2018,"I get why people hated the movie but only those who are fans of the original will be bothered by it. I loved the first and 2nd Predator movies although the first is the best. This movie is an enjoyable action flick and almost suitable for kids but I would have loved this as a kid regardless of the blood lol. I also saw the original Predator as a kid and adult and that one is more like an evergreen and this new one not so much. Btw love Fred Dekker, Monster Squad was one of my faves as a kid. I'm gonna give this movie a ridiculous rating of 10 stars I wanted to give it 7 stars but so many people are giving it a 1 star which is very unfair. Lets be reasonable a movie of this quality can never be a 1 star.

Btw I wasn't interested in writing an indepth review just want to counter those 1 star ratings. Watch it if you like action movies it's still very enjoyable. Definitely not a 1 star movie. For that I reccomend other bad movies which I still enjoy sometimes like Jack Frost horror ones, Troll, Leprachaun please people with all the movies accessible these days we are spoiled rotten."

7.0,16 December 2018,"I bought this as a fan of the franchise, and after seeing some online reviews that said it was decent. Before watching I looked on imdb and saw all the 1's. Yikes. Honestly with the history of this franchise being so up and down I didn't expect a lot, but I was pleasantly surprised at some of the new ideas. No where near as bad as AVP Requiem in my opinion. I tried twice with that movie and still haven't watched it all the way through, it was godawful. Don't expect predator 1 or 2, and you should be fine."
1.0,13 September 2018,"The Predator is the fourth installment in the Predator franchise (sixth if one were to count the Alien Vs. Predator films). Directed and co-written by Shane Black (Iron Man 3, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, The Nice Guys), it is a mediocre entry in the series that has little that has not been seen before.

In a small American town, Rory McKenna (Jacob Tremblay), a young autistic boy, accidentally activates an otherworldly device which causes an advanced and dangerous alien race known as the Predators to return to Earth. In response to this, an elite team of former soldiers, led by Rory's father Quinn (Boyd Holbrook), are sent out to try and stop them before it's too late.

While it does have its fair share of fast-paced action and some solid practical effects, The Predator does not do enough to elevate itself above being merely average at best. Supporting characters are still seen doing illogical and questionable things which predictably makes them nothing more than cannon fodder for the Predators. Most of the comic relief falls flat and attempts to showcase the soldiers as overly tough and masculine seem forced and dated, much better suited for the 80s rather than in today's world. Overall, The Predator unfortunately proves that the franchise peaked far too early and there is not much more that it can offer movie-going audiences.

I rate it 5/10"
1.0,20 December 2018,
7.0,15 September 2018,"I remember the original predator coming out and thoroughly enjoying it. It was original, tongue in cheek and the alien came across as a deadly threat. With this sequel it seems they went with the cliche ""let's make it bigger""! Does this add to the original? Not in the slightest. There is no suspense in this film, no sense of dread as the hunted try to avoid a bloody fate. It is a film of action that misses what made the first one good, the fear of being hunted. Instead you get set piece after set piece, some good and some bad. Even the special effects are ropey with the beginning in particular looking like it came from a SYFY TV movie. There's jokes, many of which fall flat, some good actors wasted (Thomas Jane in particular) and an ending that is absolutely terrible. As this came from Shane Black who has written and directed some great films, I expected much much more. As a go to the cinema film it's a miss, watch it via cable at home and it's passable."
3.0,17 September 2018,As good as I expected only thing bad about this movie was the jokes.
7.0,17 November 2018,"In order to enjoy this movie you have to view it as the film depiction of a comic book instead of from a logical, true-to-life, perspective. There are many scenes that are absurd in terms of logical consistency, but instead might be found in a ""comic book universe"". I could list a few but you'll see what I mean when you watch it.

Overall, despite it's flaws, I actually found this movie entertaining and it's a unique story in the Predator universe. Some of the action scenes are great, there are plenty of gory deaths and lost limbs, the actors do a pretty decent job for the most part. It's got a heavy mix of action and comedy, and pays homage to the original Predator in a few ways. For example (SLIGHT SPOILER) the ""You're one beautiful mother****** "" line is a twist on the ""You're one ugly mother**** "" from the original. (END SPOILER)

Go into this not expecting to see a ""Predator"" movie exclusively but instead expect it to be a mix of Predator, Rush Hour and E.T. You might find you actually enjoy it if you don't have too high expectations of it remaining rigidly faithful to the vibe of the original Predator and just view it as a sci-fi action comedy!"
1.0,14 September 2018,"This is horrible, horrible film. I am a fan of predator and alien... but I feel like I have been violated by having the ""pleasure"" of being entertained by Mr Shane Black. Actors dissapointing, Narcos guy is horrible, Brown bad as well and these are the guys that played very well in their tv shows. but hey, I am not a critic so I will say one thing.

PREDATORS DON'T FU*KING STOMP LIKE DINOSAURS. WHO APPROVED THIS.

1.0,14 September 2018,Utter rubbish and this is from a massive Predator fan. If I could only have that time back.
8.0,4 August 2020,"The original Predator was a slow-moving, stilted but a decent parade of militaristic cliches in a simplistic storyline, though perhaps few viewers appreciated the spoofery inherent in the macho posturing which that movie was stuffed with.

This movie, The Predator, is fast-paced, entertaining parody of the Predator ethos - richer in the spirit of what underlaid the original Predator. The Predator has a more involved story than any of the previous Predator movies. The gore is what you'd expect. What's surprising is that the comedy keeps pace and holds up throughout. Thoroughly recommended for those who are up for grisly comedy. (Much better than, say, Zombieland, which was enjoyable enough.)"
2.0,12 December 2018,"As a Parody its decent but if you are expecting a return to 1987 greatness then sadly those days are gone. You see this is a complete insult to the series. Jokes all the way through which are poor, the story is a confused mess which makes no sense at all. CGI is terrible. What more can you say. For a film where 80 million quid was spent, its a total disaster."
1.0,30 September 2018,"Is it Thee Predator or is it Tha Predator? It's enough to say, after having seen The Predator, it's not really a predator but a hunter, a satirical and metaphorical hunter, because it does not eat its prey. Even the titular Predator says it's a Predator, so maybe Predators are either not that smart or they lack the ability to understand nuance.

Those who watch The Predator and are disappointed perhaps missed the point of this blood-filled, campy romp. Shane Black was in the original movie, so he appropriately gets to have fun with the fairly ridiculous story and uses it to raise awareness about global warming and evolution.

Character development is terse, which is fine, because you have to kill off the characters so you don't have to write anymore dialogue for them. One character is developed by revealing he suffers from an upset stomach, probably acid reflux disease, as stomach acid rises into the esophagus causing severe upper-chest pain.

It's hard to determine whether any of the actors are acting or simply enjoying making a movie because it is so far-fetched and silly that the only option is to treat working to make a movie like The Predator as the simple fun it must be. Despite its grossness, the final scenes smack of maudlinsim, and hopefully a crossover with Rambo someday."
1.0,2 June 2019,"The original Predator is my all time favorite movie. I literally have my entire arm sleeved out with a predator tattoo, just to give some perspective on how much i love this franchise. That being said..... this movie was so painful to watch that only my loyalty to the franchise was what kept me from turning it off before it ended. This movie had 0 direction, a terrible plot, and was just all over the place. I did not enjoy a single thing from this movie besides the homage to the original score in the beginning. I had high expectations from Shane Black (Hawkins). Thinking he would do this franchise right. He couldn't have done any worse. Do not waste your time with this film."

1.0,19 March 2019,"I couldn't understand what is the plot of the movie, I just kept my eyes on the TV and try to watch until the end, because I didn't like any character (which i have to say: too much people on this movie), I think that the idea could be better worked, but they focus on annoying things, said that, obviously the best thing was The Predator your makeup it's fantastic, and the little boy with alien stuffs."
1.0,4 January 2020,"This movie was a absolute joke. Even the last one before this was good. I wish they continued that one instead on a alien world and people are being dropped in hunted etc. This one was so crap i forwarded so much of it. I giggled at one joke in the entrie film thats it. Actors were rubbish boring generic as you can get. Useless scientist woman hated her from the start even the main character.when they swear in the film its so forced and out of place. Honestly feels like a 12 year wrote this. The originals 1 and 2 will never be beaten ofcourse, avp yes crap but still entertaining apart from Requiem which was toilet. I liked the 2010 predators alot was missed out etc but they should have just continued that one. Instead you get this junk, im so angry they thought this would be a good movie to release. Dont believe any of the positive reviews for this have be paid bots. This movie needs a laser blast and hung up by the predator."

But... then it just started to get silly.. half way through the movie I was thinking ""this is just a mess, so many things happening, so many farcical moments.. and unrealistic plot points.. It's like the director was making a parody of the franchise rather than a sequel.. such a shame, the action scenes and visual effects were on point.. it could have been a great movie, the production team did a great job.. but the writing and direction made it flop!!"
2.0,16 September 2018,"I'm sorry folks, but this movie is garbage. I'm in my early 40's and the original Predator (1987) is my all-time favorite movie. I even respect the other movies in the Predator series (some better than others, of course) for what they are, including both AVPs.

The Predator (2018), however, is complete rubbish. I went into it with low expectations too based on the trailer and some production photos. My wife and I saw this movie today and it was WAY WORSE than I expected. Honestly, I even considered walking out at some points (but being a true fan, I stayed and endured the pain).

Heads-up! THIS IS NOT A PREDATOR MOVIE! This feels like a horrible made-for-TV ""B"" movie on the Sci Fi channel. There was absolutely NO suspense or build-up. The music/score turned campy at times like I was watching some goofy action flick.

The movie tried explaining way too much to the viewer and there weren't any hooks. Honestly, watch it and you'll see what I mean. This movie doesn't feel like a Predator movie. Even AVP 2 (which didn't get rave reviews) is 100 times better than The Predator.

As a military reservist, I also feel the movie missed the mark with ""The Loonies."" This isn't a spoiler as the trailers show our group of protagonists are a handful of PTSD service members on a bus. Thank you for disrespecting those military members who actually experience PTSD, making them seem crazy.

The jokes in the movie didn't fit either. There were attempts at comedy/joke scenes that would have been better suited for an actual comedy movie than a Predator movie. Even my wife said that the joke scenes (that she happened to like) would have been better suited for a Lethal Weapon movie. Furthermore, there weren't any memorable one-liners.

Olivia Munn's character was horrible. My wife and I like her as an actress, but her character (biologist/bad-ass) was completely unrealistic. This was unfortunate as she was the only enjoyable actor/actress in the movie.

I'm not sure what they were trying for with regards to making the kid with Asperger's some kind of Rain Man/hero but it didn't work in The Predator. Hopefully, no one on the ""spectrum"" with this or related conditions was offended too much by the movie. If they were, however, I wouldn't be surprised.

Honestly, I don't think I will watch this movie ever again in my life. I'm not exaggerating either! It was seriously that bad. Not just super disappointing, but seriously bad.

They took everything that worked in the first Predator (1987) and completely disregarded it. Even the storylines and suspense of Predator 2 (1990) and Predators (2010) are leaps and bounds above anything The Predator had to offer. Shane Black should be completely ashamed of himself for giving us this Cleveland Steamer."

2.0,17 November 2018,"Despite the negative reviews, I decided to watch the film. This can be considered the fifth film of the franchise(including the two Alien crossover movies).

You can see where the director went wrong. Not sticking to the formula that made the first film so great - Predator was an inferior species vs. superior species battle. Dutch killed the Predator in the first movie using stone-age weapons and traps, despite the predator having a laser-cannon.

Also in the background we hear fragments of Alan Silvestri's epic score from the original film. In my humble opinion John Mctiernan should have directed this film as a homage to the loyal fans of his film. The late Stan Winston who also designed the predator suit will be sorely missed.

Verdict: the C.G.I. effects look very ""fake"" and spoil instances in the film when the action really gets going. Alien weaponry is basically the same - no new weapons used. Boyd Holbrook of Narcos TV series fame is a competent actor, but doesn't have the physique nor the charisma of Arnold Schwarzenegger. The main reason the Predator fails as a movie is because the writers tried to do something new and it backfired on them."
1.0,15 September 2018,"Is this movie going to win an Oscar??? Ummmm, no. But it had me entertained from start to finish, and sometimes that's all you want from a movie!!! Tons of action, and I haven't laughed that much in a theater in a loooong time!!!!"
2.0,24 September 2018,This film has had some seriously bad reviews so I went to see it to see what the fuss is about. I am a big fan of predator so I can relate to the negativity of it but to be honest it's not that bad. I have low expections of these remakes and reboots and that is the key to enjoying the movie. If you like to see predator up close killing people this is your film. It's just mindless entertainment. They crack too many stupid jokes and swear too much but it's just a bit of fun. It's not Oscar worthy so stop whining about it and enjoy it. People say the predator was hardly in it? Well he was in it a lot more than the first! There's some good scenes and potential for more films so if you think you can write a better predator film then send your scripts to Shane Black and shut the **** up.
8.0,16 September 2018,"Whomever is giving this move a positive review is a paid plant. When you read 50 reviews and they are all 2,3,4,5 and you see a couple 8,9,10. Those are bogus reviews. There really is no redeeming quality in this movie. You were constantly shaking your head throughout the movie with stupid line after stupid line. Full of really inappropriate jokes, mental illness humor, zero plot line, predator dogs, bad acting, terrible direction. Granted the special effects and Predator costume were good.

8.0,2 December 2018,"After reading some reviews I had lowered my expectations but I have to say it was an action packed movie, quite fun. Better than Predators in my book."
1.0,14 September 2018,"I had been waiting for this movie since I heard Shane Black was at the helm and promising so much. I was so hopeful that I paid for myself and 5 family members to come along with.

I was so crushed, so devastated by this movie. There are so many things that are wrong; the script, the story, and the overall feel. There are nonstop jokes, weird action scenes where nothing gets hurt, and huge jumps in settings that leave you lost. There was complete disregard for the predator as a species, and as a franchise.

Someone else had written that if they had switched the predator out for a different monster then it wouldnt be as bad. And they're right. But it IS the predator, and this movie loses complete sight of that.

Utterly disappointed."
5.0,17 September 2018,"Assuming anything surprising from seventh (?) Predator movie is a bold move. Yet, the supporting team to McSienna ( the bus gang) was really well played and did remarkable role- IMHO. Everything else was.... as always in predator 7."
2.0,13 September 2018,"The Predator: a mess of a story, devoid of atmosphere and characters you don't care about. Only positive is there's decent gore for a 15 rated flick.

It's an average action movie, but I expect better where Predator is concerned."
1.0,12 December 2018,"This was much better than I expected after so much trash talking. So strange that people hate this so much when it's seriously a blend of 2018 sensibility with 80's tropes and nostalgia. Score was awesome, homage to the original. Acting and plot aren't the best, but this isn't trying to be 'There Will Be Blood.' Most of the cast is really great and Black seems to mirror much of the format of the original. Munn is great to look at, but her character honestly makes no sense. CG is better than Black Panther. If you just relax and enjoy the silly ride, this movie is a lot of fun. The action sequences are pretty cool and well conceptualized. This is far from Black's best work; he may never top Kiss Kiss Bang Bang."
3.0,23 November 2018,"And not a very funny one. If you're expecting a Predator movie, then watch any of the others. If you want a Wayan Brothers movie with an alien in it, then The Predator's got you cloaked."
8.0,16 September 2018,F'in awesome movie worth watching again over & over .I think you will find it the best movie ever
2.0,24 September 2018,"Yes this movie has over the top gore, lots of dark humor and comic relief and isn't very suspenseful BUT it is still a good solid action movie. I guess above all it was FUN, an R rated Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom if you will.

I had no issues with the new tone, the editing or pacing or plot and it ranks alongside the first two movies in my opinion. I mean what do you really want from a movie about an intelligent inter galactic killing machine?!

Lots of action and gory kills, tons of laughs and a decent if not a little out there plotline. Whats not to like?!

As for these 'fans' of the originals, please get a grip. You are barely out of nappies!

I would say go see this movie, support it at the box office, we want more!

As it stands the movie has made £100M from an £200M production and advertising budget which is pretty impressive for an R rated Sci-Fi film of this type.

Don't believe the basement beards and arm chair fan boy critics, GO SEE THIS MOVIE!"

1.0,16 May 2019,Absolutely terrible. It regurgitates classic lines from the original movie as jokes that fall flat. The quality of cgi for a 2018 movie looks cheep. The story makes no sense. I wasted two hours of my life watching this.

What was Shane Black thinking, he has made the predator a comedy action film. Does he not remember what made the original a classic. The cast is ok, but why have we got all the veterans playing comedic parts, with their own unique querks and annoyances. The storyline is pointless and why would these veterans want to help fight an alien when there own country has locked them away. Far fetched nonsense. Destroyed the franchise, not that they've made a good one since the original really. Do not watch."

Sad movie. Seems Hollywood is running out of original ideas for movies so they are trashing classics.. Please stop..
2.0,8 June 2020,"There must be a predator story template that all films in the franchise adopt. Takes an hour to populate instead of the weeks or months normally required for a script. There's almost nothing original here, including the title. The plot contrives to have a predator visit Earth and locals fight back. We've seen it before. It's as formulaic as they come, and as the movie stretches on, more and more unbelievable, convenient and silly. The only highlight was the group of misfit soldiers who generate much-needed comic relief, among them Keegan-Michael Key (of Key and Peele fame). But much of the cast was wasted, notably Yvonne Strahovski and her 3 minutes of air time (remember her in Chuck?); she should have Olivia Munn's role. For that matter, I would rather have seen Thomas Jane in the lead than his cringe-inducing Tourettes demonstration. I'd say let's hope there's no more, but just like those pesky Predators, they keep coming back."

1st of all, ignore the anal retentive and so-called ""movie critics"" that hated this film. Aside of 'A Quite Place' The Predator is one of the best monster movies of 2018 . And Even though Predator has been around since Regan was President, Writer/Director Shane Black (who was in the Original 1987 film) pulls out all the right punches to make an old story feel brand new."
1.0,15 June 2019,"If there was a half star I would rate this movie. The half would be for see the credits. I held on for 8 seconds like I was on foo-man-chew but it finally floored me!

If you're going to watch this I suggest you do it on an adult game night where you'll be too distracted to watch."
3.0,4 July 2019,"I'm sorry, I can set my brain on idle and enjoy any mindless crap for awhile. But this mindless crap was a marathon that I could not finish. Terrible writing, horribly-developed characters you could care less about, no editing, a script that was just flat-out embarrassing, translation, garbage. I guess some people were entertained by it, these are people I probably don't encounter much in my life except when I am buying a slurpee. I like Munn, but hearing a ""scientist"" drop one f-bomb after another caused me to wonder, really?"
10.0,18 September 2018,"As with almost any classic franchise, this generation of hollywood has brutally pumped and dumped it for cash.

1.0,17 August 2022,"It's just a very bad movie.

The acting is horrible. Granted, I don't think the actors had much to work with - that being said, I am pretty sure Olivia Munn had one facial expression for the entirety of the movie. I can only describe her look/acting as the look you'd have after the teacher called on you in the middle of a day dream.

The plot is ridiculous and all over the place.

It relies on deus ex machina that is just nonsensical, cringey, goofy, and corny. I understand as the audience we need to suspend disbelief but this is demanding the audience suspend a functioning brain altogether.

It's a movie that has no idea what tone or theme it wants to have at any given time.

The CGI is jarring - it's overdone when it isn't being poorly done.

It's just so bad. It's bad from beginning to end and has you quietly begging for it's end throughout."
4.0,16 September 2018,"I saw a few negative reviews before watching it today and had low expectations but I can now say it's not as bad as people say, my 12 year old son and I both liked it and I grew up with the original and of course it's not as good as the 1st one but it's definitely better than part 2 and all the AvP movies. The acting is good, special effects are great and I wasn't bored while watching so I say it's worth going to the theatre to watch"
1.0,4 October 2018,"I rarely wrote reviews on here, but The Predator deserves one. So, so, so, so bad!! Shane Black, what have you done?! One of the biggest disappointments in recent years, I've seen it described as; ""garbage,"" ""trash,"" ""a train wreck"". I honestly can't disagree with any of those statements. The only positive I can give it is; I have seen worse. But this makes AvP Requiem look like a masterpiece."
4.0,4 December 2018,"The movie is essentially as coherent as Alien: Covenant, but it doesn't even attempt to take itself seriously. It's over the top and seems aware at this point it can only play on nostalgia. And... It works. It's enjoyable. I don't like how it tries to be a real Predator movie sometimes, because that doesn't work well, but I'm happy with parodies and it's not a bad one.

It's essentially what Hot Shots! Part Deux (1993) was to Rambo 2/3, but still licensed, bound by the rules of the universe to a much higher degree, so way more restrained. I believe most fans reject anything after Predator 2 (1990) as canon, I certainly do. If you are one and take that approach to this movie, you can have fun!"
10.0,31 December 2018,"I'm a big fan of the original Predator movie, but none of the sequels have been that good. This one is no exception. It feels like the script was written by teenage fanboys, as it frantically jumps around from plot point to plot point with no real logic behind any of it. There are definitely some entertaining moments, but most of this movie is just messy."

3.0,14 September 2018,"We all know nothing will ever top the timeless original that transcended everything we know with its visceral and practical brilliant invention. This is something to keep close in mind as you watch this new exciting and action packed thrill ride. Once you accept that this new offering is its own entity with a wide array of cleverly added elements with story expansion, intricate Pred technology, as well as a more comedic tone that predominately and surprisingly works, you should be able to appreciate what this film really is and what they were going for. This is without a doubt director/writer Shane black style entertainment at its best, and he shows his keen eye for obliterating action as well as his razor sharp witty dialogue. The film starts out at lightning speed with an incredibly memorable opening sequence that sets up the film in visually spectacular fashion. The predator ships are stunning! As it moves along you get a feel for all the characters and the loonies really do stand out in the film with their unlikely chemistry and hilarious comic relief. Once the fugitive predator unleashes true chaos and the blood is shed this film kicks into high gear. The practical effects on the fugitive predator are Without a doubt the best so far even more so than the original. The story keeps going with tremendous action sequences and hilarity and then we get to meet the ultimate upgrade predator which consists of fantastic CGI contrary to what most people have said. I really thought they did a terrific job at designing this ferocious force to be reckoned with and utilizing CGI for an 11 foot predator is really is the only route you can take. Once we get to the outstanding finale everything comes to a dramatic and massively insane finish that you have to see to believe. The set design was amazingly well done and full of atmospheric detail and flourished in the final act. The final moments of the film which I thought were a genius addition got me very excited for the future of this franchise and where Black could take it. The big criticism I have was casting Munn and Brown as main characters. Their acting was truly abysmal and killed a few scenes. The possibilities are truly endless and we may get our first official look at the Pred home planet Yautja Prime and see huge expansion of the lore and mythology which would be mind blowing. Overall this was just an insanely entertaining film that every true predator fan should see. You have to be a fool to think that the same formula as the original would work in this day and age no matter how innovative it was back then. Contrasting edgy idiots would find a way to hate it regardless. I give Shane black loads of credit for his fresh new take and tone that he brought with this film and the many great additions he infused. If you're not open minded with the franchise then I suggest you just stick to the original predator and quit slandering this and giving it 1's just because it's something fresh and different from what you wanted. This film is leagues better than predators and honestly I'd put it right up there with predator 2 as far as quality."

Predators with Adrian Brody was and still is the best Predator movie since the original with Arnold. The pointless dialogue using F bombs for no reason. Are we supposed that things more seriously or think someone is tough because they use the F word?? Not a career advancing move for anyone in this, but especially for Alfie who was so incredible as Theon Greyjoy in Game of Thrones. And they even threw in a lobotomized Predator dog! Sure glad I got this for free with my Amazon Prime membership. And it kills me to see Thomas Jane going nowhere or perhaps even backwards with his Hollywood career. And Olivia Munn plays the foul mouthed tough chick Mom here. She was so perfectly suited as Psylocke in X-Men: Apocalypse. Some of the actors I've seen in much better quality movies or TV series. The three stars are for the actors I've mentioned knowing they are much better than their characters in this movie."

If the internet has proved anything in the era of social media, it is that intelligence is not democratic.

I've seen the first at least a baker's dozen times. I'm a fan. A big fan.

This movie was, in a sense, exactly what the ""franchise"" needed - an adrenaline packed, self depreciating yet thought out and story building film about the Predator. Acting was more than decent. Special effects were great. And it was damn funny at times. The lobotomized alien pooch - c'mon!!!

There's a;ways room for another ""thrilling"" installment that will take itself seriously like the first did, and fall way, way short of it.

If you were to take this film as canon it would destroy everything about the predator legacy thats meaningful and interesting. They turned this franchise into a poor attempt at a comedy (wtf?). Its a travesty so if your a fan of the aliens/predator universe just avoid this movie and pretend it doesn't exist.

I was not expecting it to be better than the original or the second maybe. But at least, the very least rival Predators. How do studio's throw money at movies like this when they have had since 1992 to make a direct sequel of any quality. Even the comic books of the 90's had some cracking storylines and yet we get AvP2.1. The CGI, script and storyline belong on the SYFI Channel. The set-pieces are as gripping as trying to run home when clenching a sh** and as pulse pounding as a dead body.

I want the time this film took from my life back. How this got made I just don't know. I assume the word ""Predator"" generates enough revenue to allow funding to be raised. It may not it will again after this. What a shame. The Predator in this film won't be back in the future.

4.0,16 September 2018,"Executive summary: If you loved The Last Boy Scout and Predator, you will love this movie.

When I heard that Shane Black (original actor in original Predator and screenwriter of Bruce Willis action movie The Last Boy Scout) will direct new episode to Predator franchise I was so happy. He is one of my favorite Hollywood moviemakers and I tought that he might be the one that can actually make good Predator sequel. That was bad moment, because immediately I started to wait this movie release day. Naturally I avoided all trailers, because they nowadays tent to spoil whole movie plot. It is not easy, because Predator trailer was shown to me about 10 times in cinema when I was watching another movie. My wife was shamed as I was making funny noises while eyes and ears blocked (I can still hear dialogue, f*&k).

Avoiding all trailers, IMDB reviws, social media posts, posters, etc. just made my expectations higher. As time passed, it just got bigger. I had some bad examples from history that when expectation grows too high, you actually are dissapointed more likely. I had that exact feeling when I entered in to movie theather in Finland on opening day. I was sure that I will be dissapointed or even worse, feel nothing...

I was so wrong.... Shane Black made it! 10/10! Best possible Predator movie since original one.

It was not only the cleverly hidden references (yes, you need to read all original Predator trivia, articles and watch all additional material related to the movie) but the fact that Shane insanely inserted his brutal humor to the script and lifted Predator to the new level. There is now path open for entire Netflix/HBO series.

8.0,18 September 2018,"'The Predator (2018)' is never funny but the humour only occasionally gets in the way of the story, usually by being tonally jarring or far too persistent, and is only distinctly unfunny in a handful of key moments that fall flat mainly because they feel misjudged, mistimed and, sometimes, slightly misogynistic. Most of the particularly 'bad' jokes actually surround a character who has Tourette's whenever it suits the 'comedic' needs of the picture, because apparently invoulantary ticks are funny. Yet, for all this talk of the thing being turned into a 'comedy', the much larger problems with the piece come with the fact that it just isn't cohesive and generally feels cobbled together. The narrative lacks a proper flow, to the point that scenes sometimes feel almost like non sequiturs, and there are several small but noticeable inconsistencies that soon becoming incredibly grating. Continuity errors aren't usually a big deal but, when they bleed into the story-telling like they do here, they instantly reveal the movie's 'seams', scars left by something cruelly chopped or changed, and immensely reduce immersion. Some plot-points transform over the course of the flick and others still are dropped all together, leading to a frustratingly inconsistent experience that has clearly been subject to some studio interference - in fact, around half an hour was cut quite close to the film's release. In the moment, there is some sense that what you're watching has had time and effort put into it; most of it looks like a big-budgeted, blockbuster affair. However, the overall experience lacks any tension, suspense or even stakes, despite the high body-count. This is mainly because there's just no reason to care about anyone, never-mind what they're doing (something that isn't clear despite the numerous haphazard exposition sequences). The problem is amplified since most of the action is relegated to being a dark, CGI mess - even if the original predator is brought to life with a practical suit (which, sadly, isn't given the time of day once its digital 'superior' arrives). The set-pieces essentially all rely on getting the previously sneaky, and scary, big-bad out in the open as much as possible, which might seem like an obvious choice (and one the series has made a few times in the past) since we all know what the eponymous creature looks like but makes for a cumbersome and unthreatening foe. The feature also culminates in possibly one of the worst, most over-blown and unbelievable rag-doll finales in recent blockbuster cinema, one that makes a mockery of the series' comparatively grounded and 'realistic' roots (two terms I never thought I'd use to describe an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie from the 80s). On top of all that, the whole thing ends with a sequel-bait that feels like it would fit a 'G.I. Joe' cartoon more than a predator movie, which is a sour note indeed. Needless to say, this picture is pretty disappointing. I didn't have fun and, honestly, I didn't feel like I'd even watched it, thanks to its weak and nearly non-existent narrative. This could've been so much better, especially with someone like Shane Black at the helm, who's work has been consistently up to par before now. It didn't feel like 'The Predator', so maybe, as Olivia Munn's character says, 'Bass Fisherman' is more like it. 4/10"

I thought MAD Magazine shot this movie.

I feel sorry for the lead actor and the supporting staff, but after 50c shot the predator dog and made it ""nice""......yeah.

Anyway, DON'T ENJOY the movie.

This is embarrassment to the series and the sooner we forget it, the better.

1.0,25 November 2018,"I love the predator. I love Shane Black. How this movie turned into a boring, collusal mess is beyond me. The plot was somehow overly complicated and stupidly simplistic. Normally I would try to find a positive in all movies but there just isn't anything that this movie does that another predator movie down better."
2.0,15 September 2018,"The Predator (5 out of 5 stars).

The Predator is awesome and a better sequel that's filled with lots of action and humor. The original Predator movie was good, the second movie was bad and a joke. While the AvP movies with the first movie being fun and entertaining while the sequel sucked. And 2010 Predators being an entertaining sequel. Director Shane Black co-writing this sequel does pack a punch with this one. Having a group of misfit vets battling a predator.

The plot follows Quinn (Boyd Holbrook) who is on a mission in Mexico, trying to save hostages from a cartel in the middle of the jungle. Until, he comes across a crashed ship with a predator on the loose. Quinn recovers some alien gear and sends it away for evidence. The government questions him, hoping he can keep his mouth shut about what he saw. They send him away with a group of vets like Nebraska (Trevante Rhodes), Coyle (Keegan-Michael Key), Baxley (Thomas Jane), Nettles (Augusto Aguilera), and Lynch (Alfie Allen). Meanwhile, Casey (Olivia Munn) is brought to a secret government organization led by Will (Sterling K. Brown). Who is hoping they can figure out what the predator is after.

There is more to the plot. The film begins with a predator in a ship being chased by another. And the predator is after the missing gear which is a link to something more with their secret agenda. It is a pretty straightforward plot. Sure, the ending does set up for another sequel and would be interesting to see were the story goes from there. This movie does follow Quinn trying to find his gifted son Rory (Jacob Tremblay) which the predator may be after.

The film moves at a fast brisk pace. It does not hold back on the action. There are plenty of bloody action sequences. And a bloodbath of a predator making his way through soldiers. And using all his high tech weaponized gear. And than there is a giant predator that shows up with another agenda on searching for something. Which leads Quinn and his misfit team trying to protect Rory and hunt the predator down. For all the action enthusiast, you will enjoy this film.

There is also a lot of humor. Especially from Keegan-Michael Key's character with jokes in almost every scene. The humor made the movie fun. Boyd Holbrook was great playing Quinn, a soldier who wants to hunt the predator that killed his men. Trevante Rhodes plays a vet who struggled with emotions. Jacob Tremblay plays an autistic kid which the predator may be after. Olivia Munn playing a biologist who sticks out in this group of misfits. Keegan-Michael Key plays the loud mouth jokester And Thomas Jane playing a vet with a disorder. Alfie Allen and Augusto Aguilera were good too. All these characters stick out in a characterized way.

Overall, The Predator is an awesome film. I enjoyed it more than the previous films. It lives up to the original movie. The characters stick out. The movie moves at a brisk action packed pace and it never slows down. Expect a lot of bloody gore violence. A plot that leaves it open for another movie. And it has a lot of comical humor. See it on the big screen for its loud action packed ride."
1.0,14 September 2018,I almost walked out of this after the first 30 minutes. I grew up obsessed with the original and still love it as well as the sequel. Danny Glover is no Arnold but still good stuff. This movie on the other hand is a travesty. It's joke after joke trying to hide the poor plot development and terrible CG. It's 2018 no CG should be bad number one and number two predator is known for SFX not CG. Such garbage...don't waste your time.

The cussing!! Now I talk trash, but the cussing in this film is pervasive and completely unnecessary. It started to bother me. Just because you stand there throwing F bombs doesn't mean you are a badass or that your movie is great. I left after an hour and got a refund. Save your time and money. It was frustrating when it could have been so good."

1.0,4 December 2018,"...did not disappoint. I watched the original when i was exactly the right age; just before i was old enough to be allowed to see it. It was awesome, start to finish. This one was exactly the same kind of stupid action to satisfy the kid in me; with just the right amount of humour added to satisfy the grown-up part of me. Whoever was disappointed by this movie did not approach it with the right expectations.

It's entertainment - if you're not watching it to be entertained, that's wholly your problem, and you deserve to feel your time and money was wasted."
2.0,16 September 2018,"Shane, what have you done? I certainly waited for the predator. I was one of those who grew up on the cult film of John McTiernan and when he learned that the director would be Shane Black, it was hoped that Shane would remove a very high-quality product, because the Predator is a perfect non-empty sound for him, because he himself began his career in this cult film and do not offend the fans, it seemed to me.

But I made a mistake, Shane took off, and I'm ashamed of myself, absolutely no respect for either the fans or the cult team of the 80s, it seems that I looked at the Predator parody, the film has no interesting characters, and the Predator is an absolutely weak link in it movie.

This film is an absolute dummy and spittle for all those for whom the Predator means something. The script is written in such a way that people come just to laugh, turn off the brain and just relax. This Predator is the most untalented that I have seen. Compared with this movie, the Predators of 2010 is a masterpiece, although there's a lot to be bothered about.

It all started in the movie is not so bad, there was a good tension, the Predator was invisible, but the farther you look at the movie, it's all dumber and stupid. It seems that the script writers had enough thoughts only for 5-10 minutes, a maximum of 15.

Shane Black made a primitive movie for children with high ratings, where brains are not needed, where smart characters do not occur. No one is interesting, but the movie has a lot of humor, but it was really needed. Since there was no it in the film, then half the picture could get up and go. Humor was created in order to hide shortcomings and distract from the problems of this film. Did not work out. Very conspicuous.

People. In this movie about Predators know everything. Predators for them are not in fact a threat. But the people themselves do not cause any emotion. In this picture, people use the technology of the Raptors more often than the Aliens themselves how to come to this? People here are represented by experts who know everything and have no fear. And while they are still arguing how best to call the newcomer Predator or Hunter. More delirium and you can not think of.

Throughout the movie there is a kind of marasmatic nonsense people are fighting each other, the Predator watches. Yes, the Predator committed many murders here, but this is not a hunt or even a semblance of it.

One of the heroes of the film, so as not to spoil the encroachment on the sacred, he said one phrase from the cult of the first part. This phrase in the 1987 film was very emotional and dramatic to no less dramatic music, then it's just a mockery and pathos.

Predators. What did Black Predator do? He turned him into a dumb, brainless creature, who has the perfect technology, but he uses it on great holidays. Predator in this film does not hunt, does not collect skulls. And how he can hunt here if it's not hot. Predators are engaged in hunting only in hot places, and here at times it was even a little bit cool.

The Predator has also been turned into a Terminator, which is masked only at the beginning and at the end, and they constantly ran. Or just walk confidently on the ground like Terminators without feeling any danger. I did not see any code of honor in this madness. Not all the weapons I saw the predator. Predator dogs are found to be tame. Another brilliant move from Black.

The ending turned out even more crazy than the whole film. No respect for the Predator, made him completely helpless, stupid and unable to undertake something original. Black mocked strongly over the Predator. So to mock the beloved alien is simply unthinkable what he created. He touched the most intelligent alien and took all the best that was in him and showed all the worst.

I hope the movie fails at the box office, Shane shoot something else, and Predator let someone else do that will make the Predator and people strong characters, and not what you showed.

Mr. Black said we shot a film about the Predator with the eyes of Man. No, you shot the Predator with the eyes of a child, and a sick child who clearly has some kind of brain problems. And I hope that someday they will shoot the film with the eyes of the Predator, where they will show all their race, how they live and hunt.

For mockery of your favorite character, for the shame that I looked at and for the fact that this spit in the direction of the cult film, I do not think that the movie deserves more than a minimum score.

A SHAME!

5.0,3 February 2019,
1.0,18 September 2018,"You know a movie is bad when your average reddit user could have actually written and filmed something better than this. It was just a hot mess. You want to say, ""Oh, Hollywood only hires the best to write and direct, the suits would never make a bad film! They've got it all figured out!"" Nope, the suits are human too. Fox has an unfortunate record of making so many bad movies and lucking into really great ones after being begged by people much smarter than the suits. It's incredible how badly run this studio is.

I could go into detail how bad this movie was. I don't even know where to begin. Boyd Holbrook really hurt his career taking this. He's much better than this garbage. Olivia Munn was as horrible at acting as everyone says she is, plus her character was badly written. The whole film just snowballs with its mediocrity and plot holes so much that most anyone who watches this garbage in your average theater, even in improvised outdoor rural African theaters will have a list of suggestions to massively improve this movie.

This movie is so bad, it makes the last Predator movie look like an Oscar winner and IMDB Top 250 film and the AvP movies look like nominees. You will appreciate these movies more after seeing this! Don't pay to see this. Don't even waste time watching this for free. It's that bad. So bad, anyone who says they like it should be deemed a liar and not worth trusting ever again.

One more thing, Shane Black, please stop pushing know-it-all kids into every single movie you make. It's a terrible, if not weird habit you have."

However, Shane Black is taking a different turn like the Fast and the Furious did when it stopped being about racing. You have to look at this movie in that way. Youll have to forget about a predator hunting humans in a jungle or in a city because its been done to death already. Like any remake or some version thats supposed to be similar, it turns out never measuring up (i.e., Halloween,2007 and Psycho) Therefore, if you are a die hard fan like me, expect this movie to do like Fast and the Furious and take a different turn in its direction. Theres a reason why most non-Predator fans like this movie. They dont know much about it and see it without any expectations of it being similar to previous Predator films. And so, it turns out being good. I thought it was good. If I compare it to the first, then it looks like a weird story. If I compare it to any Alien Invasion movie, then its a good freaking movie.

Life is different now I still watch a hell of a lot of films but as an adult who understand that when you're young everything you see is new and groundbreaking, but not so much now as there nothing new that can impress me but that don't mean I can't have fun! This film brought me back to them days of just watching a film to enjoy this is a Science fiction film not to take seriously, I don't get scared watching horror films no more but I still enjoy them.

I enjoyed this film it's funny has a lots of action lots of killing story line when was the Predator that deep nearly as good as the original better than the rest by a mile the cast done what they were meant to do and that's to deliver a fun fast furious action horror with added humour.

It doesnt hold up to the first or even the second film but I felt that this one makes up for the lady couple films. I really liked how they expanded their culture and their technology. I'm not gonna say anymore without spoiling anything.

1.0,21 September 2018,"The Predator is a horrible movie. The characters are flat, boring and uninspired, the plot ist borderline retarded and it tries to change the canon of what has been established about Predators - in a very bad way. The scenes are edited in a way that you suffer from a whiplash because the movie jumps from one scene to the next while desperately trying to find out if its an action movie or a bad a comedy. In best Hollywood practice, they switched out the Predator in a Suit to an abomination of bad CGI. The Plot of the movie makes no sense whatsoever, and the Characters are merely props to fuel the story. I especially liked how the portrait people with Aspergers and called Autism the next step in the human evolution. Obviously being barely functional somehow makes you a superior to life form. Of course we also need a person who suffers from Tourettes to make fun of.

2.0,30 November 2018,"In the original 1987 Predator, even those muscalur, hardened soldiers feared the Predator. It was a movie filled with tension and was a legit sci fi horror. The soldiers in this movie go through the entire movie taking fighting predators as a complete joke. No fear whatsoever and constantly cracking jokes. It makes the predator feel like a very minimal threat. Even the scientist in the movie don't fear the predator, they willingly run into battle and even match the predators. Shane Black, the director, was in the1987 Predator and still some how does not understand what it was which made the 1987 movie so good. This is hands down the worst of all the Predator movies."
10.0,11 November 2018,By far worst movie of the year. Save please save your $$$$ don't buy this garbage. 👎👎👎
5.0,12 December 2018,"This is by far one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen. It's unbelievable how that thing made it to the big screen, it's beyond me. The cast - 1 star, CGI - 1 star, script - MINUS 1. Actually we need ratings starting with minus for movies like that one.. If I was the director, I would shoot myself or at least I would cut off both of my hands so that I can never ever make something like this."
2.0,17 February 2019,"I don't know how this movie has an above 5 rating.

If I could give a -10 I would. Pure and utter crap. I can normally sit through anything, just to see how it ends, but to be perfectly honest I didn't sit this one through. Thank goodness I didn't spend money to watch this movie.

I would rather get a root canal than try to watch this movie again.

If terrible movies are your thing, this is your Shawshank Redemption."
1.0,20 September 2018,This movie is getting a really bad wrap but its not bad at all and I think people will eventually warm up to it. Its a modern day interpretation of a classic that was butchered in reshoots and in the editing room. All this being said its a highly enjoyable film that really needs to be fixed up a bit in the editing
5.0,6 December 2018,"This movie is a huge spit in the eye for the whole Predator franchise.

The plot is so terrible that the writers Fred Dekker and Shane Black (also director) shouldn't write anything ever again, not even a text message.

The story is a huge cliché, the conversations are brainded and completely unfitting for the situations and the whole script feels as if it was put together by 12 year olds trying to act cool in front of their 10 year old friends.

You can't go lower than this."
3.0,3 February 2019,"I have loved the Predator franchise since I was a kid, but this is just pure junk, bought the DVD last night hoping it's not as bad as the reviews, turned out it was. Shane Black should never be allowed to direct again, shouldn't be surprised seeing as iron man 3 was also total turds."
10.0,7 December 2018,"The Predator character in my opinion is just awesome. This movie however is as far from awesome as you can get. After the 1st ship crashes on earth its 99 minutes of garbage.

The characters are lame the jokes are horrible I mean just pull the pin on one joke and toss it at the predator that'll kill it.

The whole movie is lacking, acting, directing, writing it is all so bad. Why can't a studio just take a Predator comic and make a film the plot, background and characters are already done for you.

It's amazing that the original Predator film is the best and holds up today and that had Arnold barely out of acting classes.

I have to share the blame because every time they make a predator movie I watch it, so I'm part of the reason these bad films are made. Sorry world next time I'll just say no!"
4.0,1 November 2020,"It's like someone looked at the Predator franchise and said, ""hmmm, I like it, but could we mix it up a little? Just spitballing here, but I'm seeing more of a Jurassic World vibe. Can we get some of that Chris Pratt magic in there? And some shenanigans with a kid. Let's add some of that. People love when kids mess with kill-crazy aliens. Then let's add a dose of Spielberg, a fill-up of Pirates of the Carribbean, and a phenomenal misunderstanding of the autistic spectrum. Everyone, I think we have a winner."""
1.0,7 December 2018,"The plot was so irrational, a bunch of people trying to kill the alien for no reason at all. Moreover, the movie was supposed to be horrifying, not to be a comedy show, by the way the jokes were stupid and valid. Overall, this movie is such an insult to the whole franchise and I hope 20th Century Fox will not shut down the Predator series because of this garbage thing."
2.0,31 December 2018,
1.0,13 January 2019,"This was the dumbest garbge i have ever seen... The script and characters were ridiculous and embarrassing, could barely finish the movie, such a dissapointment."
4.0,11 January 2021,This movie is not only one of the worst ones I have ever seen but also disrespects the original. I am literally trying to forget it ever existed. Cannot recommend it to anyone.
10.0,5 December 2018,"If they wanted to ruin a legendary franchise, well, good job.

The whole movie is a disaster. From the incoherent fast paced script, full of holes and action forced scenes ala Michael Bay to the sountrack worthy of a... Michael Bay movie. Seriously, isn't this a Michael Bay movie?

The characters constitutes the usual parade of plain, boring archetypes from start to end: the stubborn scientist woman, the serious stern leader, the jockey, the traumatized soldier, the quiet one and worst of all the authistic ""genius"" boy (who by the by) acts like the adult of the group. Then there are the villains, the human ones, they try so very hard and end up failing so.

The predator(s), let me go straight to the main problem I find with this movie. The mysterious, scary, almost unstopable figure the creature used to represent, here is nothing but a caricature of it. Something well worth of a discovery kids villain. Both predators are a joke, but the (super) predator or whatever it was called here was the worst.

The action, as previously mentioned is too fast paced, too forced and out of place in a context belonging to this franchise. There is not a single scene I can think of as awesome.

Overall this is a bad/below mediocre movie you will only enjoy if boredom is winning over. Shame on the people behind it."
4.0,14 September 2018,"This should've been made for TV is what went thru my mind as I watched this horror show. Couple of really funny lines and that's about it. I don't even know where to begin w this one. Something told me to stay away and I should've listened.

If us have any sense at all - stay far far away from this one."
4.0,21 September 2018,"In the age of massacring beloved film icons because the people in the industry today are absolute hacks, we have Predator as the newest victim. If you have any investment in the franchise, or enjoy actual compentency, keep far away. This is the most abhorrent excuse for a professional production I've ever seen in a theater and it marks the first ""film"" I've ever walked out of. I couldn't believe I made it to the ending, and that's what did me in. Stay far away from this putrid bile of Hollywood, and remedy yourself from the thought of it by watching the original Predator.

I am so glad I didn't spend actual money on this, but I truly feel sorry for those who did."
4.0,14 September 2018,"Just watched it now with my wife and really enjoied it, i was a bit afraid maybe it will not be as good as i expected but it turns to be very good predator film, story performance and special effects suits, dont trust lower rate and see it with your own eyes, this film deserves more points"
1.0,2 July 2022,"We have a ""Super Predator"" who can easily dispatch a normal Predator, but inexplicably lets two humans survive over and over again. Even when he has them by the throat."
2.0,5 December 2018,"Without giving out any spoilers, this film is as incoherent as can be.

Bad script. Bad acting. Effeminate characters. Some mindless incoherent action. I mean mindless. 2nd grade CGI.

What else? Bad jokes. Bad language (goes together with bad jokes). Bad voice work (by acting school dropouts?). Bad whatever.

Everything is political in this film, as if it was created in the Soviet Union. There's feminism, racism, hatred towards the police and the veterans, DNA evolution anti-science, and even the global warming, hahaha. All the usual suspects.

This is bad television. Yes, television, this is no cinema."
10.0,21 September 2018,"Gone are the days of realistic animatronics, great acting, suspense, Kurt Russell's beard, and overall great sci-fi movies. Now they are all bad CGI and nonstop comedy. I'm a huge Predator fan (not to be confused with AVP) and I was looking forward to this movie. Unfortunately, it let me down. Too much comedy, bad CGI, and just really NOT what I was expecting. It DID have an interesting story - which is why I have it a 5, because had this movie been made better, the concept would have been very interesting. Long story short, rent it - 20th century Fox needs to stop hyping these big titles and relying on these series' past successes to drive their new releases and actually just start making good movies again. It doesn't take a $50000000000 budget to make a good movie - see Alien(s), The thing, etc..."
4.0,2 June 2019,"There has never been nor will there ever be a better predator than the original, this movie is a typical crapfest filled with extremely unlikable characters, and i'm glad i didn't pay to see it."
4.0,28 November 2018,"Much like with Alien: Covenant, this film was filled with so much potential and yet for largely unknown reasons, it was massively reshaped at the last minute to turn the whole movie into little more than a mess that attempts to please everyone, but fails and ends up annoying and boring the audience.

Having followed the production of this film since the early leaked images of humans and yautja in tanks, I just feel completely let down by the final product. The second-ish and third acts were completely reshot and rejigged, and oh boy does that show. The second half of the film has a very different feel to it. Rushed and unsure is probably how I'd describe it.

The main storyline of the predators hybridising themselves is largely ignored, the only hybrid animals are reduced to comedic sideshows and the big bad upgrade predator is about as intimidating as a drunk aggressive squirrel. The final act is full of WTF moments that just leave the viewer wondering why that odd moment was included.

The role of the autistic son, although still a main role, is played down a lot in the final cut of the film. Overall it's nice to see autism on the big screen, although maybe stop giving all of your atypical movie characters savant-level abilities.

Overall, this is easily the weakest of the predator films, even compared to both AVP entries. I don't recommend anyone try watching it. For fans, it's a massive disappointment and for the general public, it's just a bit boring. I had such high hopes for this one, especially with Shane Black behind it, and now I'm thinking I'll stick to the expanded Alien/Predator universe than these newer films."
3.0,13 September 2018,Its remain me about the first movie of predator.. overall this movie is good.
3.0,16 January 2019,"Everything about this movie is stupid. If you watch it you will be feel stupid. Start with a script that is both silly and ridiculously more vulgar that it needs to be, add really crappy acting, really uninteresting Mary Sue characters, lots of illogical plot points, and a director who has no idea what he's doing, and you have The Predator. You know it's a bad movie when the only character you mildly care about is the annoying kid. Honestly, you want the Predator to win. The only reason these idiots succeed is because the plot says so."
1.0,16 February 2019,What a dull silly movie! I had a lot of expectations but this movie is all over the place and doesn't make sense 😑 boring and full of nothing
9.0,5 August 2020,"Sure, there were some good effects. Some not so good. Meanwhile, the movie's story was very weak. There was just too much 'Murica's army is great. Plot holes were a plenty."
3.0,4 February 2019,"How to explain in single word? Garbage

Acting to Fighting sequel Movie was poor in all departments."
3.0,29 September 2018,"The franchise is death, whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy"
2.0,15 September 2018,I thought this movie was done well enjoyed the gore and humor as its a horror. The effects and the way the predators was great. Actually had a good storyline and left the ending open for another movie. I thought 10/10 best movie id seen in a while.
2.0,22 September 2018,From the trailers of this film I could sense it felt like all the other bad sequels that had come before it and I hate when I am right. Shane black has made and wrote some amazing films and that's why I thought this film would have topped them all considering the global hit of Predator '87. I don't like to knock films especially from movie makers I admire but I have to ask myself what were you thinking! The special effects were average and the CGI was awful. Some of the characters were slightly interesting but generally the film looked like it wanted to be a 12a more than a 15. The CGI blood was dismal and don't get me started on the 11ft Predator? Really? The story was cut together poorly and there was no fear or build up to the monsters on screen. The actors were almost lifeless when they saw the creatures too! The only thing I enjoyed was the original music from the First and the Best Predator. Maybe it's time to put Predator to bed or bring back John who could direct it. Shame Shane.
1.0,5 December 2018,"I've never written a review before, so here I go. I was and still am a huge fan of the first film, exciting, pretty well acted in short I gave it an 8. This one, where to start, bad acting, bad script, bad cgi, stupid humour, and so on. Maybe a 7 year old might like it but adults? I doubt it, but hey de gustibus et coloribus. Anyway I think a lot of positive ratings are bought, since the descriptions are always very short. As advice, don't waste your valuable time in watching this thing called film."
9.0,23 September 2018,"A good movie if you want jokes, explotions and alien doggos. This movie is the actual predator killler."
1.0,7 October 2018,"As hard as it may be to believe, Predator 2 and even Alien vs. Predator were much better films and sequels to the original. This was just not a good, entertaining or engaging film.

The film is actually quite confusing as far as the Predator-lore goes, and seems to copy a plot device from Predators. There are literally no charismatic or memorable characters, the whole ""ragtag band of misfits"" motif was not endearing at all.

For all the fuss Olivia Munn made about getting someone removed from the film, you would have thought she would be able to warrant her worth with some decent acting, it's not all Olivia's fault, her character is written and behaves in a way that just did not make sense.

Boyd Holbrook's McKenna is a complete and utter bore for a lead character. Arnold Schwarzenegger will never be confused with an Academy Award winner, but at least he looks and carries his character in Action films. McKenna does not look, sound or even have the presence of being a lead in an action film.

Another fallacy in this film is the gratuitous violence, which you want in an Action film, but this kind of violence just seemed overdone...however, not nearly as overdone by played out use of the F-word...I would have typed it out if not concern for having my review deleted, and the fact the film uses it so much, I cannot fathom uttering the word again for a very long time.

What does The Predator do right...cool CGI?

IF you didn't like any of the previous sequels, this one will not satisfy you, just go watch the original Predator...and get to da choppa!"
2.0,14 June 2019,"Despite the star studded cast, this movie is a complete disaster.

I gave it 5/10 instead of a 4 because Olivia Munn is very easy on the eyes.

This movie isn't worth my time giving it an actual review with thought considering they keep deciding to nuke what could be an amazing franchise.

Peace."
1.0,20 September 2018,
1.0,27 October 2020,The coffin nail for a Hollywood icon. The Predator is the unworthy sequel to an action classic that has rightly failed critics and the box office.
3.0,10 November 2018,"All involved in production and direction should hang there heads in shame. What a shambles.I feared the worse when it was announced Shane Black was the director, the wrong man for the job 100%. Really wanted to enjoy this film , the original is a classic. Someone needs to go ask J.M to direct and save this franchise. How can this drivel be allowed to be made. The music was well below par aswell. Hope this isn't the end ."
8.0,25 September 2018,I tried so hard to like this movie but the storyline was awful. After 30 minutes of watching I still couldn't grasp what the concept of the movie is exactly. I left the theater very disappointed.
4.0,27 September 2018,"I've seen all the Predator movies before this and really only liked the first out of the whole lot. This one is the worst. It actually irritates me by how bad it is. Not just as a Predator movie, but as a coherent movie as a whole."
2.0,23 September 2018,"What the heck happened? Alien ship crashes. Actors and actresses acted horrible. Predator is killed. Government officials turn into bad guys. Plot holes galore. Dialogue is dumb and incompetent!

Action is okay. Giant predator and predator dogs. Then the ending sucks! Do you really wanna watch this movie? Only people who are have low IQ will watch it. Smart people will stay away and far away from this movie.

Thanks for reading my review! Take care!"
5.0,14 September 2018,"Such a awesome movie highly recommend if you like 80s action, and a predator fan!"
1.0,3 April 2020,"I have watched this movie again in 4K to see if my bad sensation on my first watch about this movie was wrong. But, the second time has been worse. I just discovered more plot holes and seen the characters more unrealistic at the end. So, overall a wasted opportunity to create a great predator's film again."
1.0,6 November 2018,This is without a doubt the worst and most horrible Predator movie ever made and it should never have seen the light of day. It is so tragic that I could not even laugh at it. It is a mockery to all the loyal fans of the franchise.
9.0,7 December 2018,I was so exited when one of my family members said another predator movie came out i was super exited because i love the franchise but to be honest when i watched the movie i had to leave after 1 hour in i was almost too heart broken and too disappointed to keep watching it cmon man you guys ruined predator for me thanks alot
4.0,1 November 2019,"I think the easiest comparison for this movie would be with the Alien franchise. As the first Predator would be viewed like the original Alien, intense and full of suspense with some action. The 2018 Predator felt like it was going to be Aliens from the trailers full of action, comedy and from what I think really diverging from the original. Instead it is more like Alien Resurrection, having some big ideas on the table that could have been interesting but instead are left by the wayside never being fully explored. Ultimately this movie is very forgettable but I'd being lying if I said it wasn't watchable. Some moments had me chuckling enough that I can say I didn't hate it when the credits rolled. If you lower your expectations a bit you may well come away and even enjoy it.

Die Hard fans however will probably hate it no matter what and I can't really blame them because the Predator is really a punching bag if I am being honest. He never really showed a cunning side or any type of real hunter specialty during fights. He is just there out in the open like some b movie bad guy; I found that to be a weird choice.

The Predator is certainly watchable and out of the cast I'd say Trevante Rhodes gives the best performance but it is certainly nothing you would expect from a Predator movie. So this is my warning review just be prepared for way more comedy then action or suspense.

5.5/10"
1.0,6 December 2018,"What the hell happened ? What the hell where they thinking , Shane black should change his name to SHAME black after this disaster , this movie makes Uwe Boll seem like a real film maker , seriously it seems it was made by an amateur director , disastrous edits , horrible cgi, stupid decision to make a horror movie a comedy, terrible dissapointment for us predator fans, plz skip this garbage"
4.0,17 September 2018,"I liked it, great characters are the main take away from this. Loved the occasional humour. Been watching predator movies since I was a kid and i wasn't disappointed at all, it was just a new spin on the same storyline and I think they did it pretty damn well. But that's my opinion. Just go see it, make up your own mine about it."
5.0,14 September 2018,"Althore with all the humour success in the film it just does not live up to the hype so if you enter expecting something better then the meg forget it . but you do get tons of bloody scenes on the predator not saying the movie is bad in any sort but its not great either its just a film you should watch expecting nothing from it at all. The film also seems to move too fast for its own good , it was this now its that . at an overall I would rate this movie 5 out of ten"
2.0,10 December 2018,I always do my best to sit through a film that I'm not really enjoying just to give it a full chance. I couldn't honestly do it with this one. It was absolutely terrible! I love the Predator franchise and feel maybe it was just best leaving us WANTING more.
9.0,30 January 2019,One of the worst movies ever made! A disgrace to the franchise. The director should be sent to Guantanamo for the rest of his life with a restraining order that he should never come 100miles near a camera ever again. What's more astonishing is how presumably good actors (e.g. Olivia Munn) sell themselves and take part in this crap.
5.0,16 January 2019,"The stage curtains open ...

Well, shucks ... I had such high hopes for this movie and that it would get things back on track since the disappointing 2010 film, ""Predators"". But it wasn't to be.

When a sniper Quinn McKenna (played by Boyd Holbrook), and his military team are attacked by a Predator, he is able to take it down. Then in order to have proof of extraterrestrial life - he mails pieces of its armor to himself back home. However, because he is overdue with his post office box payments, all the mail kept there is brought to his home location and his son gains access to these very important artifacts.

Now the government is involved, having arrested Quinn and placing him on the ""looney bus"". It is with this ragtag group of insane soldiers that he has to rely on to provide their best chance of survival as the race is on to get to his son and the armor pieces.

I'll have to admit that this particular take on the Predator was fresh and different, but ultimately ridiculous. The attempts of humor in this movie fail to bring a smile, and in fact are cringe worthy. The special effects were good, but most movies can do that these days. The creatures were fun to watch. And then there were the space dogs with dreads. Are you kidding me? (slaps his forehead and woefully shakes his head) - that was the last straw for me.

I guess, to be fair, it really wasn't a bad movie, but it just didn't do much for me. I hope the next entry into the franchise will take a much more serious approach and give us what we've been missing since the very first movie back in 1987."
1.0,6 December 2018,"WTF, who in the world would read the script and say, (yeah I'll do this)!!! They need there brain checked. I grew up with the Predictor. Even the last one was better than this. This is a B movie. Low budget movie. Dumb just dumb."
1.0,5 October 2018,"This movie is very fun and has this action scenes that want to keep you awake. Predator is not a scary movie or character and it will never will be. So this movie has everything on my perpective, dont't know why people rate this movie bad.

10.0,13 September 2018,"Again we've had a predator reboot (although I think that's been denied it is a reboot), but whatever it is it is still a real disappointment to me. I was hopeful of something that followed in the footsteps of the original but really in feel and tone it matches up closer to AvP than to Arnie's classic.

Group of convict soldiers are out to stop 'The Predator', and somehow a scientist is lumped in with them. How these guys are the saviours is best left explained in the movie, but I still don't get how the female scientist got lumped in with them. Actually I don't get how she turned into GI Jane either which was bizarre.

Acting is poor, humour isn't done well either and the action is kind of violent but not as strong as in the original. If anything again this seems to have misread the first movie which is a disappointment after Predators got things back on track.

I still don't get how the Predator always seems to lose but thats Hollywood for you.

I could go on but I'll leave it there. Disappointing.

There is life in the Predator series but this one has shot itself in the foot."

3.0,25 December 2020,"Exciting beginning and I appreciated many references to the original ""Predator"". But then it became hard to follow. It's almost like one person wrote the movie at first, and then someone else finished it and at the same time they ran out of ideas.

Maybe the next movie will be an improvement."

It's like they didn't know of or watch any of the Predator or alien movies. The actors and actresses in this have to be embarrassed of this. If you love Predators, please don't have your day ruined by watching this. Words can't begin to explain how terrible this is. This would be good for a tv SyFy movie that makes fun of the Predator in a comedy. I hope this movie gets forgotten and pretends it never happened. I only give this a 3 star because I feel bad for the good actors/actresses in this."

1.0,19 September 2018,This movie may not be perfect but it's what the franchise needed. As far as lore goes it adds to the predator universe in a positive way. You couldn't have a had another predator chasing soldiers around in the jungle. Everyone would have cracked it at how it wasn't original and it ripped off the first movie. There was enough homage the first and even second to make it feel like a sequel even after all these years. But other than the few references was entirely it's own movie.

1.0,30 December 2018,"Alien movies are nearly always a facility where the aliens infest the air ducts. Alien movies are brilliant. Predator movies stand apart, for better or worse, because each new edition is generally a new scenario. The first was a jungle, the second a city, the third an Earth-like planet. This new movie has some intelligent advantages. Little time is wasted wondering just what the Predator is or what its after. Which makes for an interesting war movie rather than a horror 'who gets it next' countdown. The hero are a ragtag bunch of soldiers again, but, again, intelligently, there is some really entertaining banter between them that, in the long run, makes us like them and care how they go. This is what levers this Predator up to the dizzying heights of its previous incarnations, all of which were brilliant, including the Antarctic Predator vs Aliens. Modern technological flourishes together with an enigmatic child make this a fun spin and a must-see. This movie will make you think more than certainly the first two, but it is no less charming for that fact. Great leads, brilliant actors, a decent baddie, brilliant cgi, action plus .... I'm genuinely grateful for this edition to the franchise. If I have a gripe it's that the deleted scenes given in the special features needed to be in there, to my mind, as they uncomplicated a number of points in overall story. Hopefully they'll be an extended version dvd soon."

2.0,29 September 2018,"First let's start with the facts: I felt obligated to see this movie as I have 3 predator statues in my house. If I didn't see it the movie gods would take my predator man card away. That said, I should've taken that chance. Parts were ok. I've certainly seen worse. But, and I had lowered my expectations going in, I knew that this movie would never be 1/4 as good as the original. But I didn't expect Predator 2 to be vastly better as well. The problem with this movie falls at the feet of Shane Black. It has way to much comedy, all of which is of the profane variety; A stupid plot; and a horrible last 1/4, not that anything before that was much better. The positive? Nunn and the lead were good. I don't blame either for their crappy often vulgar dialogue. They delivered it the best they could. But somebody needs to tell Mr Shane black that 'F-bomb' riddled jokes don't help a movie struggling with a story"

Based on the movie the technologically advanced predator get killed by a ""B"" grade sniper who dies not even get a scratch falling from the space craft head down. The other funniest scene was the ""stupid"" biologist was chasing the rebel predator to tranquilize him when he was all out killing everyone at the military base. That one heck of a biologist who can run faster than the military and run without getting killed by the predator. The sniper dude was a joke-the predator travels to earth with all sophisticated technology where an Asperger's kid could break the predator code-that's one heck of an achievement that Einstein. Also this kid had CIA type computer equipment at his home where the dad was in the military and mom has a less than average job-I guess military paid the dad millions for his 50% accurate sniper targets. The kid can read the predators actions in the space craft and the dad knew how strong the shield were but not his colleagues. Seriously my 5 year old son can write a better script than this garbage.The sniper dude kills a 10 foot super intelligent predator?-FML THIS MOVIE IS A SHAME AND THE BIGGEST DISGRACE.

Miss every episode of South Park that features STRONG WOMAN and throw in a biologist that can get the drop on some soldiers and a predator more times than I sighed OR groaned while watching this film.. A kid with Aspergers who seems at ease with extreme violence, explosions, and gunshots yet he has a meltdown right at the start of the film due to a fire alarm? come on, give me a break.

Look, I cannot even be bothered to talk about how bad this film is. I mean. It is a 15 rating for a start. We all know where this leads.

1.0,1 June 2024,"Without a doubt, we are in the presence of the worst Predator in history, the one released in 2018. For this series of films, I generally just rate. But today I want to leave a warning. If you haven't seen this movie yet, save yourself the trouble. It's a cinematic trainwreck devoid of interest. I would have given it a zero without hesitation, but I only give it a two for two humorous moments. Predator films generally aim to capture the essence of suspense and action, featuring confrontations between humanity and fearsome aliens. Unfortunately, this 2018 version seems to have completely missed the mark."

It has great action in it and good comedy. Yes there is a good bit of comedy in it but it actually works for most of the movie. The Acting is good. And no it isn't as good as the first Predator movie. None of the sequels are and They never will be. Get over it. The movie has awesome Predator action, Great Comedy and acting. That's all you really need in a Predator movie. And the only reason I gave it a 10 is because It needs more praise than what it's getting. I would give it an 8 if there wasn't so much hate. So go see it when ever you have free time and enjoy. Hope you found this review helpful :)"
4.0,10 November 2018,"After watching the trailer I was quietly confident I would enjoy the newest Predator movie. I couldn't understand why it would receive such a bad score. However, after just a few minutes, it became clear. The movie is just one big joke, straying as far from the original as humanly possible. Just one slapstick joke after another.

The over-saturated humour is only surpassed by the liberties taken to make this movie even slightly believable. You will need to take ""suspension of disbelief"" to new heights with this one. The fights between the main character and the Predator is so far fetched that I couldn't finish the movie, I had endured too much.

I do not give any movie 1 star lightly, in fact it is my first. However, this movie more than deserves it. To compare this to the original movie would be insulting. Do yourself a favour and skip this one."
5.0,10 November 2018,"You see soldiers shooting at something in a staircase. It's not a ""shooting blindly into the jungle""-situation... They're very clearly focused on a target. And then a guy gets thrown from the other side. That really sums up this movie. Not a whole lot makes sense. Overall, it's an R-rated movie made for 13 year old teenagers.

It would seem, all you had to do to get a major part in this movie, was be able to either make crazy eyes or squinting to look badass. That's all the main characters do throughout the movie. And please, writers and directors, unless the whole story is about kids, like Stranger Things or Super 8, please don't make a kid a main character. Especially not in an R-rated movie. I can't be alone in thinking an autistic bullied kid is completely redundant in a Predator movie? Again feels like they're trying to make it relatable to kids. As others have said, this is sadly the worst Predator film yet. You wouldn't think the recipe would be that hard to crack... It's an alien who is supposed to be able to stalk and kill anything... But right from the start, it's all out gunfights and explosions. I literally facepalmed when the Predator uncloaked itself in front of our hero within the first few minutes of the film. You could just have put any random bodybuilder-guy as the big baddie... There's not really anything making the Predator special."

3.0,6 October 2018,"Unbelievably bad. I was stunned.

This film would be awesome MST3K fodder as this is at best a poorly made B-movie of the worst kind. Actually I take that back. The MST3K movies that they riff seem to be made with an earnestness and love that is totally absent here. This is some messed up calculated 'product' and not a movie or film. It's actually even worse than Alien:Covenant, and that's saying something. That was a movie that should have revoked Ridley Scott's right to make films and left him stranded and naked in the middle of the Nevada desert.

I have to wonder who is in the drivers seat of these series lately - just one bad decision after another. Either of these series needs a Rogue One kick-in-the-pants to help breathe some life into it. THAT team got it right. Overall it just bums me out that Hollywood is destroying these great franchises. C'mon guys....get it together."
1.0,10 January 2019,"Unlike the person who felt the need to create an IMDB account to slander the good name of this cinematic masterpiece, I created this account with the sole purpose of defending it. I don't believe anything would constitute a ""Spoiler"" to which would prevent anyone from enjoying this film, but I will provide only a brief synopsis: In a poignant and powerful revelation, it is found that the reason the Predators remove the human spine is to collect our DNA and create a new race of hunters, and thusly save mankind. The Predators now have their sights set on a young autistic boy, to create a super-race of autistic-human-alien-predators. Shane Black, known for his directorial debut of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Iron Man 3 (the best of the series) and The Nice Guys breathes new life into the Predator story with his artful direction. Co-Written by the great Fred Dekker (Monster Squad and Robo-Cop 3) this film has starlet Olivia Munn (Zoolander 2, The Slammin' Salmon) as Casey Brackett, exchanging provocative dialogue with Quinn McKenna, played by co-star Boyd Holbrook (The Host, Very Good Girls) and introduced the world to the veritable force of Canadian child-actor Jacob Tremblay (Shut In) who plays Rory McKenna, the unlikely Autistic hero of the film, who deciphers the alien language and saves humanity. The film was certainly not lacking other household names which have left their marks incontrovertibly etched into the celluloid of American film history. Jake Busey (PCU, Christmas with the Kranks) masterfully portrays Keyes, (Sean Keyes, son of Peter as portrayed by Gary Busey in Predator 2) and succumbs to much the same fate as his father before him. Keegan-Michael Key (Hell Baby, Pitch Perfect 2) provides part of the one-two comedic punch with his role as Coyle, with brilliant one-lines such as ""What's the big one? What's the big one, Doc? Is that like the male?"" The Amos to Key's Andy and number-two of the knock-out punch combo comes in the way of Thomas Jane (Dreamcatcher, The Sweetest Thing) who plays Baxley, who's Tourette Syndrome provides such hard-hitting and genuine dialogue, I am unable to quote it here. Rounding out the all-star cast is Trevante Rhodes (Open Windows, The Night is Young) portraying Nebraska Williams, whom not only utters the iconic line ""Get to the Choppers"", he has a pivotal role in saving the group misfits when he expertly lobotomizes one of the hell-hounds which the Ultimate Predator brought with him to hunt, by shooting it in the head, point-blank, with a single bullet. Once lobotomized, the hell-hound serves as a loyal companion to the group, assisting in the demise of the Ultimate Predator at the hands of Brackett and McKenna. Rounding out the band of unlikely saviors is Lynch, played by Alfie Allen (Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination London, Freestyle) who was the first member of the team to come to his demise as the dreaded 3-dots of justice from the Ultimate Predator focused their attention on him. The struggles to combat the Predator, Ultimate Predator, and Hell-Hounds were compounded by the existence of Will Traeger, played by the great Sterling K. Brown (Righteous Kill, Our Idiot Brother), the conflicted government agent, whom ultimately falls victim seemingly at his own hand. The entire film is driven by the powerful score composed by Henry Jackman (Puss in Boots, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter).

I challenge anyone to provide an example of a more complete, and perfect example of cinematic perfection than that which Shane Black has created."

The decision they clearly made to turn a thriller franchise into a action comedy similar to transformers style writing is clearly the reason Schwarzenegger passed on reprising his role for a cameo. For me it is a sub par sci-fi movie that has been crowbarred into the aliens franchise.

Spend your cinema ticket money on a take away and rewatch the original... a far better use of your money."

Seriously what the F, I gave up hope of a good movie right there.

Predator is supposed to have a science fiction serious horror tone, this isnt lethal weapon, they pepper this thing with cheesy jokes that never land every step of the way.

I am going to be honest I want this movie to succeed so bad so they make more in the franchise...but this thing is crap.

4.0,14 September 2018,"""The Predator"", the Fourth Film in the Predator franchise is somewhat an Entertaining, Fun, Science Fiction, Action movie. But Due to a Non-Convincing story, with little to No logic, a lot of forced humor, and weak storytelling, all crammed into a 2 hour running time, the film falls short of being a great one.

The biggest flaws with ""The Predator"" is the Editing and Pacing which are both very fast. The movie starts off in a ""big bang"", viewers are thrown into the middle of Action and never slows down until it's final minutes. The pacing of the movie is so quick that roughly all of the characters and sub plots don't get enough time to stand out and feel as though they just appear and vanish out of nowhere. The Editing is very quick, so quick all information is ""shouted out"" to viewers hoping they can keep up. The film's narrative is rich with Predator Lore, which fans of the franchise will enjoy, but most of it is told through only inferences or mentioned briefly. The movie has tons of information and sequences all happening at once and a lot of that gets distracted most of the time from a lot of forced dark, silly, jokes from a lot of the characters and their actions.

Visually, the movie is not bad, but a lot of it is very noticeable, especially the CGI. The movie has good Action bits, the action is very 80's style. The movie itself plays like a typical Marvel Movie meets ""Commando"" and ""Lethal Weapon"", with a strong ""Predator 2"" Vibe to it. It's a lot of action with a lot of humor. The story is ridiculous and non-believable, but in a fun way, there is little to no logic at all in this movie which can be annoying but it doesn't hurt the movie too much.

On a final note, if you are a big fan of the original 1987 Masterpiece, you probably may not like this Predator movie. If you like/love the franchise for the Predator Character and all the lore and pop culture of the Predator, there is fun enjoyment here.

Personally, I found this Predator movie interesting but nothing more. I'm not to sure what the Director and Writer Shane Black was going with this, but if his goal was to make the movie ""fun"", it definitely does just that. I would say this is the Third Best ""Predator"" movie in the Franchise. It's an ""OK"" fun, Sci-Fi, Action Flick. (5.5 out of 10 Stars)."
5.0,17 September 2018,"I don't really care for sequels because there's a lack of effort aka a reasonable continuation of the quality that made the original worth piggy backing.

You see, ""The Predator"" focuses mostly on a young autistic kid who apparently can read and understand alien text and use Predator technology like it's a Gameboy. Plot B of the film focuses on a rag-tag team of spec-ops soldiers, one of which is the kid's dad. They are basically like a B-grade A-Team; The A-Team you call when B.A. Barracus and Hannibal are too busy lounging by the pool eating ham sandwiches. This team also includes Keegan-Michael Key as the most annoying face-punchable jokester to ever grace a spec-ops team, and Thomas Jane, who was basically told to act like a disgruntled old geezer for two hours. Oh and then we get Olivia Munn who stars as an school science teacher that can apparently shoot guns, do matrix-style acrobatics, and run hundreds of kilometers to catch up with alien spacecraft in mere seconds. To be honest though, she probably thought that she was still filming X-Men: Apocalypse. Finally, after you sit through lame jokes, a stupid convoluted plot involving a team of no-bodies fighting and escaping from another team of no-bodies, you're treated to 15-20 minutes of actual man vs Predator combat which relies mostly on a giant 15ft CGI Predator that looks absolutely horrendous. I don't know what he budget was spent on, but clearly not enough was invested in the film's special effects. The Predator franchise has always mostly relied on an actor wearing an actual Predator costume combined with some CGI finishing touches. Not this one. The Predators are completely CGI and they don't look good at all. Their movements, their shading, etc...are not even SyFy Channel standards. How could this mess of a film go so wrong? All they needed to do was put a guy in a costume throw him in a jungle and make him fight a bunch of Rambos. That's it. That's all they had to do. Why they layered it with all this extra unnecessary garbage is beyond me. Shane Black should have known better! He was in the original Predator with Arnie. He knows what the story is all about. My guess is he tried to do it ""better"" and felt entitled to do so since he was there from the start. Look, I wasted an hour and 58 minutes of my life on this ridiculous stupid film so you don't have to; avoid this movie like the plague, especially if you're a fan of the original Predator. This is not a reboot, this is not a remake. It is not a sequel. It's a really bad re-imagining that does absolutely nothing to move the franchise forward. I thought Predators with Adrian Brody was bad, but in hindsight that film was far more entertaining than this garbage. Geez, even Predator 2 with Danny Glover is a much better film than this. I'm not even kidding. I'd rather watch that all day then watch Shane Black's The Predator one more time. Congrats on achieving the rank of worst Predator film ever.

P.S. look out for our official introduction to The Predator's best friend: Predator Dog! And yes, he's got dreadlocks too because.....why not?"

4.0,16 September 2018,"Just got back from the theater. I had a BLAST! It was non-stop fun from the opening scene to the end. I won't spoil anything, because the fun is in following the twists and turns of the plot. Warning - there is a LOT of humor in this film. It can almost be called a comedy-action-sci-fi-horror film, so if you don't like to laugh along with your Predator you may not like it. For me? I loved the humor and thought it worked 90+% of the time. There is a LOT that happens in the movie.... I think it needs a second viewing to catch everything (including all the one-liners that fly by fast!). Not sure why others don't like this - unless they were put off by the humor. Yes, there are leaps of logic. Yes, you will see a female scientist automatically become an a1-shooter/kick-butt action star. Just take it all in stride and enjoy the show. The predator was awesome - one of the best, and I think this movie was far better than 2 and 3 combined.

8/10...."

1.0,24 September 2018,"Basically, space monsters chase a hilarious group of misfit soldiers with lots of gore. It's not a horror flick where characters are picked off one by one in expected succession, and for that I am thankful. The soldiers are individuals, and the viewer is never confused as to who is who, etc. I like the first Predator, was bored by the second, enjoyed Predators, and I'm indifferent to the Alien vs. Predator films, but this one is better than AvP. I'd give the film a 7 or 8, but I'm rating it a 10 to balance out the ridiculous one-star ratings."

Worst thing about it though is that they left a pretty big opening at the end to make another...which I'm sure they will."
5.0,27 December 2020,No sense of pacing or tone. Editing is shotty and rushed. Script feels bland and distasteful. Very by the numbers film and uninteresting far too often. Far more interested in having characters say one-liners than telling a competent story. Forgettable characters.

4.0,24 August 2024,"At no point in this movie did it feel like i was watching anything related to the predator franchise. Most definitely isnt the case, but it feels like a movie written to be something else but then changed into predator for marketings sake.

Also, the predator design with the comically large helmet (not too far off in size from lord helmet in spaceballs), was unintentional comedy gold.

A mess. And i wish it was a mess that was entertaining. But it's just a straight up mess that is painful to watch.

There isn't a single scene with any tension. And if you think there's gonna be some kind of serious moment - some god awful attempt at comedy derails it instantly."
1.0,11 November 2018,While I watched this every minute I thought wow it would be nice to be drunk or high. But after watching it I realize I wish I went back in time and didn't watch this.

2.0,15 September 2018,"I mean, is there really any other way to make a sequel to any 80's movie? Some people praise the first Predator film, but i've never considered myself a die hard fan.

1.0,9 January 2019,"This movie is not terrible. It's watchable but I found myself cringing in my room and feeling embarrassed that the actors had to deliver certain dialogue. As other reviewers have said, this film doesn't add anything to the Predator series. The CGI is on-par with 2018 standards, but certainly not groundbreaking. I just can't help but think it could have been so much better under different circumstances. As a stand-alone action movie, it's decent, but the concepts and story disappointed me."
2.0,18 November 2018,"Ok maybe production was expensive, but this put Predator right side by side with children flick, instead of original that has some ""horror"" or at least very scary, suspense moments.

10.0,6 May 2019,"I can't tell if this was a bad attempt at a comedy, a bad attempt at an action film, or the result of a lost bet that someone forked out serious cash to make. I love a lot of the actors in this: but the garbage script they were given to work with is unredeemable. The concept had potential but the execution was so laughably bad it made me long for the dialogues of 8th grade plays. How is it this hard to make a good film with predators in it?"

1.0,7 January 2021,"The predators have to be my favorite cinematic monster and i cannot with the fact that no one has figured out an interesting direction to take them. In my mind the possibilities are endless. I do not understand why they keep limiting themselves by doing this hunter hunts human thing. It is better than that time they did it in the suburbs. Another movie ruined by humans. Like they have intergalactic travel capacity, they can hunt anywhere. I see they are trying to make another one and while am glad this shame to the predlord didn't kill the franchise, i am very afraid for whatever mess they might push out."
1.0,11 July 2024,"This movie is so bad I feel like 20th Century Fox owes me compensation for wasting 2 hours of my time! I was pretty excited Thomas Jane was in this till he opened his mouth, His acting was dreadful which is a shock because he is a good actor and been in some good movies, not only was it bad he was the worst character in it being extremely annoying and dreaded him coming back in each scene. All the characters was very unlikeable and the macho guy thing they kept doing was cringe worthy! The story, the cgi super predator and them physically talking through tech was hilarious! I can't believe we got this horrific waste of time instead of a sequel to Predators!! They tried to make this modern and cool movie with lots of cgi, comedy and being over the top tough guys, it was so difficult to watch it clearly didn't work at all. I'm thankfully as a Predator fan they decided to give the franchise one more chance and made Prey going back to basics and it was very good, Watch Prey, Predator, Predator 2 and Predators in that order and leave it at that! Avoid this movie at all costs!"

5.0,16 November 2018,"I would not like to say much things about this movie. Rather then being a good predator movie this movie looks a Mockery/ Parody of the Original Predator Movie series. From the very first scene, i could not understand what was going on in the movie. And in the mid of movie a group of prisoners make a team to fight the predator. Whole the movie every body is shown running here and there & the also behind the predator. It has got nothing good to offer you, Cheap Vfx, a loose & meaning less plot & only wastage of time. Please Mr Shane Black if u want to show something different, do not destroy a good & nice Hit franchise from the past only to earn few bucks. Mr Shane Black you have dis appointed each & every body who has expected something good, something nice from u r this movie which u have made. And in return u gave them this trash pasting a tag of The Predator. If u do not want to waste u r 2 hrs time. Do not watch this movie. Instead i will suggest to all of u to watch The original Predator from 1987 which is much better than this even after 31 years also. Trust me !!"
2.0,23 September 2018,I am so pissed off I had to write this review. Those who gave one star on this trash are true Predator fans. Those who says it has good action and good jokes please go watch Marvels. This is Predator for f sake. Nothing here makes any sense. And if you would think it can't be worse wait for another scene. It can! I really think to ask for money return cause I was insulted. Do NOT pay for this crap and if you even think to torrent it I assure you it is only waste of your time.
4.0,27 September 2018,If you like action this movie is for you. Would watch it again for sure. 😀
4.0,30 January 2019,"By far the the lowest peak of the series and probably one of the worst movie ever. Logic is completely avoided and nothing makes much sense, like a beautiful model-looking scientist that shoots as an experienced soldier. There is no tension whatsoever and the movie alternates misplaced humor, gore violence and wtf moments until the end. Is it really funny to see an autistic kid witnessing massive body dismemberment?"
3.0,27 January 2019,After reading so many bad reviews I wanted to give this film a chance to redeem itself but it doesn't in any shape or form. It's as if it is trying to be the scream of the predator franchise and try to revive it but it fails in every which way and form. Save yourself an hour and so and just don't watch it. Awful film.
8.0,11 November 2018,"Like others, I watched the first two films at the cinema during their theatrical releases decades ago. Both of them were memorable, but of course, I was younger then. I thought the AvP films had their charms along with Predators starring Adrien Brody.

This film was just uneven, unfunny and had nothing of any tension or cinematic dynamism.

I didn't get the misfit A-team bit, the alien dogs were pointless, too many pointless deaths, no invention and lots of empty dialogue. Not sure the casting was any good either.

Like lots of other film series it's become too diluted.

Now i've seen it, I wont be upset if I don't see it again.

Must do better!"

And having a mild degree of asperger syndrome myself, I especially liked how the kid was portrayed. A few plotholes, yes, but who cares? I even laughed at the jokes, can't say the same thing about most of the comedies I've watched. If you like sci-fi action and are not a die hard Predator fan who thinks every movie in the franchise should stick to a fixed formula, I guarantee you'll like it."
3.0,11 January 2019,"I read a huge puff piece about this film in Empire (UK) magazine a while back and pre-purchased the download off the back of the excitement generated. I will never ever ever trust Empire again.

This shouldn't have been made like this. Whoever is ultimately responsible for such a wast of franchise, money and actors time should really not be given a second chance.

The plot is poor and the effects from the outset seem B grade. From the outset the direction is at best a cliche. The pace of the movie is off kilter and the pathos is non-existant.

I watch for 50 minutes and then started writing this."

The idea is trash, the script is trash, the entire movie is trash. The only thing that is good at times is a few funny lines that shouldnt even be in there and to be honest its because shane black had them in the original one.

They live of the predator movie from 1987 but this is one of them sequals that you pretend it dosent exsist and then wait for a new remake that just diregard from the bad ones.

Im sorry but this movie is really bad."
1.0,17 September 2018,"A good time all-around. I loved the cheesy one-liners (especially the one involving motorcycles!) and the comedy between the group of heroes played off well. The action/killing/gore was also satisfyingly fierce. There are some parts that made little sense or are glossed over quickly, and the ending could've been better, though. Overall, it didn't disappoint and I have no doubts a sequel would either."
1.0,2 January 2019,
1.0,11 May 2019,I was actually looking forward to this movie. It seemed like an interesting idea of having Shane Black return to this franchise and see what he had to offer as a writer and director. Apparently absolutely nothing. It just falls flat on its face and never recovers.
8.0,18 September 2024,"This film is apparently a loose remake of the original film from 1987. There was already a previous remake released in 2010 which wasn't exactly a box office success. So we wonder as to why they made this film. They surely could have come up with a more creative and thoughtful title than Predators. None the less this film just doesn't have any great essence and simply feels hollow and empty. Boyd Holbrook is a solid actor but does t have the presence of the lead. The child is one of the weaker parts where his inclusion felt to add a wider audience. The designs of the Predator did look great but besides that, there simply wasn't any thrills or suspense. The story just wasn't engaging as they thought to be."
1.0,10 October 2018,"The Predator is a 2018 Sci-Fi Action film directed by Shane Black and written by his friend, Fred Dekker. It stars Boyd Holbrook, Jacob Tremblay, Olivia Munn, and Trevante Rhodes. It was made by 20th Century Fox with the intention of it being a sequel to the first two films. I also saw the film during it's theatrical run.

After an alien ship crash lands in Mexico during a mission in which Quinn McKenna (Holbrook) is providing sniper outlook to a hostage rescue, the crash draws the attention of both and later McKenna is sent to Veteran's Affairs and becomes a military prisoner along with others. Meanwhile, his son (Tremblay) is given Predator armor in the mail and unleashes a beacon for other Predators to come and find the armor and himself.

This is one of those movies in which you are wondering ""Why did this get made?"" and it never truly gets answered. I had confidence in Black since I am a fan of Iron Man 3 and he was even the first soldier to be killed in the original movie. It contains so many baffling choices and decisions plot-wise, editing-wise, etc that I kinda want you to see the move for yourself if you want to know how excruciating it can be at times. But I think some comedy was hit or miss as well as the action and thought the more varied setting felt like a nice change of pace for a Predator film

The Predator has done somewhat poorly at the box office and has done worse reception-wise. And it isn't hard to see why. This had twice the budget as Predators and there may have been just as much hype for it, but that wasn't enough.

Overall, I give The Predator a 5/10"
1.0,11 November 2018,Hope those sub-standard directors stop putting their hands on this Predator series.
1.0,29 September 2018,"The Predator delivered another top notch action movie even while lacking any major action stars. If you want a movie with violence, cheesy action, and over the top deaths, then this is it! If you looking for a intriguing plot you should watch something else. It also doesn't take itself too seriously and delivers some great humor. Lastly, Oliva Munn was a fantastic choice and probably the most well played character in the movie."

Yeah, it was that bad. The story was terrible. I hope Shane Black reads these so he can know how we as fans hate what was done to a promising franchise. I wanted to like it, but couldn't. Nobody in the movie was likeable, and then to politicize it by bringing in Climate Change? Really? Predator, like Alien, could have been an amazing franchise.

2.0,11 November 2018,"The final outcome of Shane Black's PREDATOR-project is unbelievably disappointing. Rarely have I seen a movie this misguided. It might work as a dumb R-rated action comedy flick, but it completely fails as a PREDATOR-film.

1. The story, although simplistic and stupid, still manages to be convoluted.

2. Every single character is unlikable, especially our sterotypical military-tough guy-protagonist - no comparison to the cast of John McTiernan's original PREDATOR from 1987. I just saw the movie and already can't remember a single one of the characters' names.

3. The eponymous Predator just gets a few scenes, then exits the film about half way through, where we are left with a big CGI baddie.

4. The CGI at times is atrociously bad.

5. There is no suspension whatsoever, which is mostly due to

6. THE CRINGY AND GODAWFUL HUMOR that feels extremely out of place throughout the whole film. I really don't know what Shane Black was thinking, but almost half of the entire runtime consists of those ""character moments"", where our protagonists (including the weird scientist) are cracking pseudo-cool jokes that ruin the potential atmosphere of the film. It's baffling and feels like straight out of another movie.

7. To top it off, the last scene is just ... well, see for yourself.

I give THE PREDATOR a 4/10 because it's still watchable for non-diehard Predator fans as a pure action comedy and because they reuse the original score by Alan Silvestri. Nonetheless, this is one of the most disappointing films of the year for sure."
4.0,23 September 2018,"I'm truly heartbroken how crap this was. It's as bad for the Preditor franchise as Genisys was for Terminator.

2.0,18 September 2018,"Your best bet for this movie is to go into it without any expectations. Let me just say that leading up to the release of this film, I was initially very excited, but the press releases that followed already indicated to me that this may be nothing along the lines of the style of the initial Predator film, so putting that aside, the film simply is what it is... It's not deep or visceral, but if you're looking to watch a fast-paced action filled comedy, then you will have picked the right film. So many different things happen in just the first 15 minutes, it was like a whirlwind. There were some pretty funny jokes, paired with heroic feats performed by a rag tag, A-Team like band of heroes. Punctuated with lots of gum chewing and weird laughing by Sterling K. Brown, the movie whips through with a simple ""save everyone from the killer alien"" plot. I don't regret going to see it, but its probably not going to win any awards either. I loved the original Predator, and Predators wasn't even so bad in my opinion, but this film is completely different, and that's ok. At the end of the day, I know now that it's one of those movies that I personally could've waited to see when it comes out on streaming or DVD, but the curiosity would've kept me from waiting. Simply put, it is what it is..."

9.0,26 September 2018,"This movie has: no screenplay, no scenography, no professional acting (except two or three exceptions), no FX (high school kids wound do it better on single notebook). Predator costumes looks like a halloween (?) dress of Seattle Supersonics players. US Goverment agents are presented as simple-minded provincial gunslingers. This movie hurts more painfully then Predator spear. Predators AD2010 collected great actors, acting took that movie high. AVP1 and AVP2 was pretty cool. Predator 2 was also pretty cool. Any fun made Predator movie you can find on YT superiors that piecework. Producers couned on true fans they will check that artwork anyway. This is the greatest baseness. Shame on Shane."

For the first time we discover an alternative reason for the Predators coming to earth for a more reasonable set of concepts than sport. I totally enjoyed this flick,and it isn't a parody of the franchise. The result of having made the film is that a whole new set of doors we can go through now that can take us off world into the galaxy. These negative comments are just immature jealousies coming out from pseudo intellectuals pretending to be legitimate reviewers. Pitiful."
2.0,30 November 2018,"There's no original script worth a watch (99.9%), adaptations fall flat and the remakes or sequels are just as bad if not worst...

Bad script, bad jokes, bad acting, bad casting, bad CGI & visual effects, no suspense, cringe laden scenes, mindless action, badly scripted emotions, predictable plot progression & worst of all; glaring in-continuity along with stuff that defies physics to an extent that you just lose your patience to let go for fiction sake...

9.0,16 November 2018,"Honestly, my initial thought after watching this film was ""how dare they!""... Meaning how dare they take one of the best movie franchises, one of the best alien protagonists ever created and turn it into a B-movie, amateur, sheer mockery of what was (and should be) a horror/action classic!

Being a huge Sci-fi fan, born in the 70's, a teenager through the 80's, i was brought up with such franchises as Alien, Terminator, Predator etc. I always look forward to a new movie release of this genre, not all have been a success, but to me all are always worth a 2nd/3rd/4th watch... I can wholeheartedly say that i will never ever watch this abysmal, unworthy, waste of nearly 2 hours of my life ""movie"" again!

As a stand alone film, some people might find it entertaining, but as a continuance of an already established and hugely successful series of movies, it fails in all departments. Such a disappointment!"

5.0,24 February 2019,"Sure this wont hold up to the original, but it was still great in its own. Honestly, who cares about a plot when it comes to the predator?, cause the second one sure as hell didnt have one. Lots of action, lots of blood. A great fun movie to watch and enjoy."
1.0,5 October 2018,"Huge predator fan. Never have expected much from the stories because they are pretty basic stories. Trophy hunters hunting to collect trophies. The Predator did not live up to the suspense it was created from. Tried to do too much, and tried to change their nature way out of anything that makes sense for Predators. Some parts worked some did NOT. Missed the mark for how much anticipation I had."
1.0,2 January 2019,"This movie makes the first Predator look like The Godfather in terms of quality. The action scenes are a mess, the dialogue is crap, the plot is completely preposterous (yeah, I know it's a fantasy/action movie), and it tries way too hard to be funny way too many times. It had all of the potential there to be much better than what it was, but in the end it was a waste of time. Don't bother paying for this - not even for a rental - wait until you can see it on cable for free."

So, i had somewhat ""hopes"" for this one, because it was made by Shane Black, that's some guy who was involved with the first one. but all we got was another sequel that no one needs, with some of the worst ideas ever, at the end i was shaking my head in disbelieve. and there's almost no fan-service, something i kinda expected given the track record of Shane Black. And the kid, who asked for a kid in an R-rated movie? i mean, could be alright, but here, No! I was already afraid of that when i saw the trailer..yet another dissapointment. Guess all my favorite franchises are dead now, thanks Hollywood! RIP Predator. 3/10"
1.0,16 December 2018,"The movie was good and the story direction makes sense. The reason people are being harsh is because they were expecting something like the first one. Like seriously, would any movie be good if they kept repeating the same plot over and over again. Good example is the Rocky franchise. Eventually they had to go different ways which is why Rocky loses in Rocky Balboa and which is why the story is focused on Creed's son. The Predator is trying to go a different direction this time to open up the plot for more interesting outcomes. Proof the movie didnt suck, every person who knows nothing about the series gave high reviews. Because the story was pretty good. Not some lame repeat that's been done to death."
1.0,25 January 2021,"I really wanted to like this. But it starts with dialog that is just awful. It's poorly written and the delivery makes the dialogue worse. Keenan Michael-Key and Thomas Jane are funny together and that is one of a few redeeming qualities. And the thought that a biologist would suddenly be so proficient in combat techniques, is crap. It makes the second AVP film look good. This is the worst of the entire franchise."
5.0,15 September 2018,"I know predator looks cool. But I want it as a monster. Not a superhero costume. There is two kind of predator. One with mask, one with 4 fang. And masked one is good one and bad one doesn't. Not even that bad one doesn't act like predator. It act like godzilla. Giant monster can nothing to do except swing around and being stupid. They say it's new breed like jurassic world. Hybrid species. So it's more strong. But actually it's not. Because it doesn't do the things that predator did. So it's very easy to kill.

For me, this is the worst predator movie. There is no suspense. Also this is not a movie. It's comic book. The way of telling the story and the structure is not a movie format. If you watch the movie you'll see what I mean

For me this was awful as much AVP2:Requem. Frankly maybe it could be worse."

I'm a huge fan of the predator franchise and this was painful to watch, disrespectful with the franchise. This is not an action/terror movie, this is action/comedy and they totally miss their shot.

It's classic hollywood humor, very boring and out of place in an action/terror franchise. If you're 10-12 years old, give it a shot and you probably like it. If you're a hardcore fan of the franchise, remember, something inside you might die after seeing this movie.

8.0,15 September 2018,"Wow! When I first heard of this movie, which was just yesterday, I thought it would be fun to see. I really enjoyed the original, and I thought this was suppose to be a ""re-do"". Was I wrong! This is the worst movie I've seen in years. It was rated R(18+) here in Canada, so I thought it would be a gritty and bloody- like the original. The moment I saw the young boy, I knew we were in trouble. Then, Olivia Munn to the rescue?? After the audience laughed out loud, for the 10th time (why so much comic relief??), I couldn't stand to watch this train wreak of a movie any longer. It was only rated R because they use the F word like 20 times. Sometimes, it seems like the dialogue was written just for that reason, to use the F word. Garbage. This movie cost me the price of 2 tickets, and a night off work. Save your time and money! Piece of hot garbage."
1.0,13 September 2018,"Like the 2010 Robert Rodriguez Predators never even existed (even if I am one of those rare humans that enjoyed the fun sci-fi/action romp), excitement has been building for a long while now for Shane Black's long-talked about Predator follow-on The Predator.

Unfortunately for all, the more negative talk we've been hearing about Black's film in the month's leading up to The Predator's release, that have included last minute re-shoots and more recently last minute edits after public outcry over the casting of a convicted felon have proven truer than one would've hoped, with Black's film a highly uneven and tonally mixed offering that has some highs, but more predominant lows in a film with a lot of ideas not fully realised.

Far more of a comedy/action hybrid than one might've expected (although this is from the man that created Lethal Weapon and The Last Boy Scout), The Predator is more than likely not the film fans were expecting, meaning there is going to be a fairly divisive line between love and hate for Black's film that is far from a critic's pleaser.

Black is clearly a fan of the franchise, having helped write aspects of and starring in the 1987 Arnold Schwarzenegger original and there are some great fan service moments within The Predator but when creating its own unique destiny and offering fans and newbies alike something new to grab a hold of in regards to ideas and characters, Black unfortunately fall's short of the mark.

One of the greatest problems with the film is the fact that Black has thrown a lot of ideas and potential in the mix but only unearthed very few rough gems, in an otherwise entirely forgettable plot that see's far too many chefs and ideas thrown into the dreadlock themed kitchen.

Some of the film's most frustrating and irritating aspects such as Jacob Tremblay's child genius Rory McKenna, Olivia Munn's world's fastest runner and randomly weapon proficient scientist Casey Bracket and Sterling K. Brown's downright terrible human baddie Traeger (copping the brunt of the worst of Black's dialogue) all could've been cut from the film entirely without The Predator suffering at all, as we could've instead focused on a more streamlined approach of following Boyd Holbrook's elite sniper and his new loopy ex-army friends saving the world from the universes most dangerous hunters.

When Holbrook and this rag-tag crew are on screen the film feels more at home in its mix of comedy and action and while some of the acting by this gang leaves a lot to be desired, it's in this space that Black's real film is evident, providing great dumb fun with some over the top gore and action, what the franchise is really all about.

It's in these moments and the rare opportunities that the films central alien hunters take centre stage that The Predator is saved from the depths of movie doldrums as whenever the film turns its attention to Tremblay's basement activities, Mann's generic female side character 101 or Brown's hysterically laughing government man with a heart of coal the the film feels entirely bad, not helped by a terrible finale that will leave many viewer with a sour taste in their mouths come the films credits.

Final Say -

Not the film we had hoped for and not the film this languishing franchise needed, The Predator is undoubtedly one of the year's big disappointments.

Offering up some big dumb fun that's often lost around some highly unfortunate plotting, characterization and a sense that this is the type of film that failed to properly nail down its identity, The Predator is unable to master any its aspects in a way that was needed to make it truly succeed.

4.0,14 September 2018,The movie was so bad that I wanted my money back! Couldn't believe how they ruined this movie like this!
2.0,15 September 2018,"I loved this movie because I love the Predator character. Most people say there's not much depth to him, that he's just a cool '80s monster who served a discreet but terrorizing purpose in a single film, and that he should not be trotted out every few years to perform his tricks like some aging Russian bear. But I disagree. The Predator is as intriguing and multi-dimensioned as any human character in cinema. Put him against Charles Foster Kane or Michael Corleone any day. Remember early in the first film when the Predator had to choose between killing Jesse the Body and Shane Black? Two people he'd watched run around the jungle for twenty minutes? And then he killed both of them? Talk about inner turmoil. And what about the scene in Predator 2 when the Predator murdered all those drug dealers and police officers with indiscriminate bloodlust? Moral ambiguity! Or that part in Alien v Predator when the Predator helped that lady kill the alien queen? Would a one-note character be capable of such a surprising turn? I love how the Predator continues to evolve as the movies go on, and I was not disappointed by the newest edition. If you enjoy the Predator franchise for its character-driven drama, and if, like me, you find the Predator to be one of the best-developed protagonists in modern film-you won't be disappointed!"
1.0,18 October 2020,"I'm a big fan of the ""Predator"" franchise, and an admirer of the writers' duo (Shane) Black & (Fred) Dekker. With last names like that, they were destined to collaborate. However, I heard and read so many negative reviews of ""The Predator"" that I deliberately delayed my viewing again and again. When the film aired on television, I could finally see it under the perfect circumstances: Saturday night, wife and kids asleep, junk food and soft drinks!

Obviously, the script isn't likely to win the Nobel Price for literature. The plot hangs together with clichés (autistic kids breaking complex codes) and semi-recycled ideas from previous installments (Predators hunting each other), the characters - every single one of them - are hopeless stereotypes (tough female scientist, randomly swearing soldier with Tourette, ...) and the whole thing adds absolutely nothing to the Predator saga. Even more disappointing than the poor content, I found the overload of poorly accomplished CGI and pathetic digital gore and splatter. Particularly because Black and Dekker started their careers with the lovely and traditional horror gems ""Night of the Creeps"" and ""The Monster Squad"", I definitely expected a bit more horror craftmanship.

But hey, enough whining and onto the good aspects! At least ""The Predator"" is never boring. In spite of the disappointing script and ditto action footage, the film always remains fast-paced. Several of the dialogues and one-liners, notably those spoken by Trevante Rhodes and Keegan-Michael Key, are really funny. So funny even that ""The Predator"" works better as a ""buddy"" action-comedy than as a hard-boiled Sci-Fi/horror flick. Alas, nobody wanted that."
3.0,10 November 2018,"The movie starts off fine, giving you the feeling of the jungle spooks we had in the first one. But, then all hell breaks loose and we don't know who's doing what and who's who. The mess was awful. The super predator was a disgrace to the original movie and an insult to the die-hard fans like me. How did they dare? Lousy CG and FX, the super predator and the alien dogs looked horrible in the movie. No no no no, what an insult. It's sacrilege. I need to unsee this."
8.0,15 September 2018,"I felt like being thrown deep into the storyline at the beginning of this film and it did not get any better from there. Predictable characters, blue-water thin script, no mystery about the Predators themselves and a ""try hard"" for a Marvel film end. You can still enjoy this piece if you just want to kill time, but it is a yet another evidence of how Hollywood is declining and perhaps we should not expect anything more from it. It´s also an eye opener to how talent in Hollywood was amazing back in the 70´s and 80´s. It presented such amazing characters in truly entertaining films, Star-Wars, Predator, Alien, Terminator just to name a few and today´s versions of the recreation of some of the characters from that era does not even remotely hold its own water against the originals, i.e. Han Solo. But, hey, times are changing and it seems that (perhaps sadly) the future lies on a set where Boyd Holbrook truly kicks ass in Narcos, and a group of kids take your breath away in a high-octane, sci-fi adventure flick set in a small town in Stranger Things; NETFLIX!"

3.0,12 February 2020,"Doubly upsetting due to the amount of hype, not only because of Shane Black's promising involvement, but also because of how much Black himself promoted the movie as the next big thing. The Predator itself is both satisfyingly brutal and disappointingly demystified; The plot dares to retcon in some terrible new ideas that, not unlike Alien: Covenant, throw some serious spanners into the lore. The Predogs remind me all too much of the dogs in Ang Lee's Hulk, and the Predator ends up being played a little too often for laughs or far too human to be this Alien menace. Black is at home in the isolated dialogue scenes and the cast is terrific, even if only Keegan-Michael Key, Olivia Munn and Sterling K. Brown come out of this OK. Overall it's a bad movie. But it isn't boring. Would I watch it again? No, there's absolutely not one reason why I would. The identity crisis of this film makes it unmemorable and dated, but at least it doesn't feel cheap."

The one thing a Predator film should not be is BORING!!!

First off the team is a crap ensemble with the exception of one good actor that i love in anything & that's THOMAS JANE (Punisher, Deep Blue Sea) & here he's easily the best character in the whole film. Jane is funny in his small role & has a fun little characteristics with his tourettes syndrome & warmth but as for the rest, well they're all boring & very uninteresting characters.

Director Shane Black thinks that a bunch of army guys using foul language constantly is some how great dialogue? It gets boring very quickly!!!

The main lead guy is just another pretty, typical ""Hollywood"" lead with his blonde hair & chiselled looks & is just soooooo bland. The other cast members don't even register.

The Predator fx are pretty awesome as expected with a mega Blockbuster budget but it's all wasted because we have a dull film with a bunch of dull characters.

2010's Predators gave us an awesome ensemble cast of odd characters & it totally worked but ""The Predator"" just fell so flat on all levels.

I've watched this twice now to see if my opinion has changed at all & it didn't at all.

I felt the special effects and character choices were spot on, except for the Busey character, well casted. Don't go to this movie hoping to see an Oscar worthy movie, this is action based fun!!

It seemed like characters aren't afraid of him, duh, they make jokes ALL THE TIME. Even though the movie in general was quite enjoyable, I expected to see something thrilling, bloody, humans trying to survive... For me Predator franchise should be at least a little bit scary and, well, The Predator was the only move in the series where characters weren't really afraid of him."

I loves the original, part 2 was passable for its time, predators 3 was better but basically a retelling of the original on another planet. This was idk what this was. Cool effects just to be fair but corny as hell dirty jokes that were poorly timed...i mean even the so called antihero formula was so incredibly cheezy that the B movie charm that mctiernan originally created was completely destroyed with underacted forced storytelling and no point.

I'm only 35 by the way but films like the original predator, or terminator get ruined by modernised sequels. How highly paid professionals who produce this rubbish don't see that really baffles me Also, adding a new bigger predator isn't a great idea, the producer of this film really needs to step back and see how they can improve the viewers experience. When i originally saw predator 1 I was gripped by it on the edge of my seat, with this film (the predator) I barely showed interest. Boring."

1.0,7 December 2018,"A complete shambles and embarrassingly bad, a shameless rehash of everything that has come before it. Absolutely no tension, no restraint and no mystique.

Building on the 'lore' of the predators only damages the franchise. The less you know about them and the less you see the more intriguing they are. I would have thought that given the complaints of all the previous films this would have been taken into consideration. The predator should take a back seat it's not about the predator and never should be. Its more about the main character's plight against the vastly superior 'predator'.

Its the Michael Bay of predator movies, bigger, louder and more bombastic.. Which results in a massive failure!

Terrible CGI mess.. Let's not even get started on predator dogs..

Its only saving grace is the fact its not a PG-13.

Didn't t want to overcomplicate this review.. Just a simple say what you see."
4.0,13 September 2018,"REVIEW - THE PREDATOR

The long awaited sequel or prequel has finally hit the big screen but is it any good?

The first Predator film of course starred Arnold Schwarzenegger, introducing the Predator in the jungle and fighting tooth nail to survive. The sequel to this saw Danny Glover as a cop investigating strange and unexplained murders. This latest film is supposed to be set somewhere between the two previous so is both a sequel and prequel.

Now to address this latest film is actually very difficult as I don't want to give any spoilers but in essence and this grieves me to say it, this is another 'Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets', all effects, no story, editing appalling, acting lazy, character development none existent and is a direct violation to the established Predator lore!

Why was the Predator delivering the item to Earth? How did the head of Stargazer know? Translator? Why such a revelation about the Hybrid, Alien v Predator (AVP),

I actually left the cinema feeling angry and upon speaking with a few other cinema goers who were in the same screening as me it was surprising that we all felt the same, LET DOWN.

I already know that they had to refilm the last third of this film because of the initial audience reaction during test screenings earlier in the year but it hasn't helped, and the end, noooooooooo!

What is going on????

Don't waste your money or time, wait for this to be shown on TV.

Well I'm sorry to say this but I have to disagree. I thought the film was refreshingly original. I personally like that it was funny and action packed. The acting is awesome. The CGI was good. I didnt feel bored once during this film. So watch it for what it is a new edition to the Predator franchise. The ending left it wide open for more movies so stop hating on this movie. It was awesome. Definitely one of my favorites."

And this movie had the WORST dialogue I have ever seen in anything with a budget to speak of. Nothing makes sense here."
1.0,9 February 2019,"Some fictional movies fair well with humorous content throughout but, this particular franchise has a brand not dissimilar to the Alien franchise which deserves some respect to achieve what is entirely possible. Ask yourself what makes predator so successful in the past and to be linked with Alien, the intriguing multiple storyline possibilities is the answer for both. With complex back stories set for both franchisees they can really shake the boundaries of science fiction on the big screen, yet for some mind boggling reason some Hollywood director who's seen fame from ridiculous humour in other successful action movies in the past thinks he can make another fortune off the backs of other hard working people before him. Sadly not impressed with this, hopefully it will not be the last we see of predator due to someone with a bright idea! I can honestly say I was eagerly awaiting this movie for some time and had plans to see it on the big screen, however once I had seen just the trailer for the title I immediately knew in my heart it would be a waste of time and hard earned money to do so. Tried to keep this short and sweet so someone important might read and understand the pain and take serious note. I like change but not if it changes the value to worthless, and think on that as predator is one of a kind."

1.0,15 September 2018,"Whoever wrote the plot for this movie didn't not do a great job. The story arcs were silly, at times unbelievable and still very entertaining at a basic level. Let's start with what was poorly done:

The writing was bad. The scientist woman who had never seen a drop of military training instantly picks up a gun and goes 100% Mary Sue. For a poorly written reason she pick some up a gun and continues the rest of the movie like a trained commando. Bad.

The story of the protagonists kid being some kind of savant with autism whom the predators want to use his DNA is ridiculous. The autistic child is portrayed as the ""next level of human evolution"". Bad.

There are a number of additional, similar type story arcs poorly done, like The backstory of the soldiers. It was weak and you never care for them.

Now the good stuff: The protagonist is fairly well acted, and you grow to actually care about what happens to him, so good on that.

The movie never takes itself too seriously and neither should the audience. Go in to this movie with an open mind, don't take it too seriously and you should enjoy it. It's entertaining.

This new Predator film is entertaining and enjoyable. It's not anything like the original, but they needed to do something new and for the most part it works. The characters in the hero group are good enough, but you don't really care about them. The scenes with the hero's kid are annoying....we came to watch a Sci-if action flick, not a children's movie. That being said the film builds enough of a hero's backstory that you care for the protagonist on some basic level.

The action is well done, the effects are great and the score is good as well. This is certainly no Oscar winning film, it's a down and dirty sci-if action film that you should think about all that's much. Here are my scores for this film:

Plot and writing: 4/10 Effects: 9/10 Direction: 7/10 Acting: 7/10 Sound score: 8/10 Action: 8/10 Entertainment Factor: 8/10 Lore: 8/10 OVERAL RATING: 7.5/10

For a Predator and Aliens movie fan this is worth the price of admission to go and see. Non-fans probably won't connect with the excitement that watching the Predator brings to the table, but if they like action movies with great effects and a story that's not to deep the you should enjoy it also. Some of the crazy story arcs in this film are unbelievable and that definitely detracts from the relationship with the original film and lore. Overall it's still good, the lore is decent and it's a fresh take on an old fan favourite, worth seeing."

I didnt care about any of the actors or actresses. It was confused, messy, poorly executed, boring, cringe worthy and above all a complete embarrassment. Let's not even go there about the cgi.....

The characters jus don't seem afraid of the predator, they start having a laugh & a joke every chance they get. I think making it into a comedy was the wrong idea. That's what's wrong with it, what's right with it Is the original predator looks awesome, there is 1 good scene that I won't spoil but you probably seen it in the trailer. The original score is back, which is great but that's it, the rest is just boring bland comedy. I can guarantee we won't see another predator film any time soon, this is a franchise killer"

1.0,7 January 2019,"Some military unit is somewhere watching over some drug cartel hostage exchange when a predator spaceship crashes nearby. The unit's sniper grabs the predator's helmet and gauntlet and ships them to his home. His bullied young autistic son opens the package tinkers with the predator technology. In the meantime the sniper is debriefed and put on bus with a bunch of crazy (literally) veterans. The government in the meantime gets some university professor to study the predator corpse. Then the predator wakes up kills a bunch of people and escapes to find his missing tech. So the professor and the loonies join forces to find the son before the predator does and before they're killed by the government unit dedicated to predators.

It's Halloween, the kid goes trick or treating wearing the predator tech. Everybody ends up finding him. Before the predator can grab him another bigger predator arrives and kills the regular predator. Because the kid has mastered predator tech, the government grabs him and takes him to the crashed ufo. That's where his dad and the wacky unit converge to rescue the kid. But then big predator arrives. He wants his ship back and the kid. The government unit and the dad's unit have to join forces when they'll have to fight big predator. There are also some predator dogs. There is some secret technology big predator wants. We learn that the predators are interested in human DNA.

The Predator is one wild ride of a movie. It does hearken back to the 80s, when some movies didn't take themselves dead serious. It thankfully eschews the sickening political correctness Hollywood \so desperately to shove down the audiences' throats for decades now. It's over the top. It's fun. The dialogue is hilarious but also too adolescent filthy. Expect the unexpected because you just can't tell where this movie will take you. For a good chunk of the movie it doesn't even come across as a predator movie and there isn't much predator action. It seem more like an A-Team episode involving a wacky Lincoln Clay from the excellent Mafia III video game. It's better not to ask why or how things happen because some just don't make sense but that's due to re-shoots and the usual director vs. studio drama that plagues movies. Can't these people get their stuff together? How many decades of movie production and there's still this stuff going on? Amazing. At least they all somehow agreed to make an R-rated movie--sadly no nudity though.

But there are also things that annoyed me about this movie. As often happens, the cheap, silly, and obnoxious orchestrated music is too darn loud and constant. Orchestrated music has a place in movies but in this movie it is utterly out of place and ridiculous. Second, this movie is too dark for too long. It's the same tired thing with so many movies-- 20 minutes of daylight followed by never-ending night. If these Hollywood big shots are bright enough to figure out it's cheaper to make movies in Canada when will they realize it's cheaper to film during the day? Try telling in this movie's battles what is being done and to whom. It's impossible.

Despite the shortcoming there's a lot to like here. A shame production was such a mess. The Predator would have made a great one and half hour movie had they trimmed some of the long introductory stuff and had they figured out a whole script in advance."
1.0,15 September 2018,"It's a very bad movie, unfortunately, everything happens too quickly and without thinking about the plot. The game is simplistic and without any depth. You can not connect to any character! The most important part of the first predatory film in 1987 was that they did not see the predator too much, and every time we saw it was a strong scene with a lot of meaning. This film unfortunately has no meaning, plus the action in general, but not anything special. In conclusion: I wish there will be a good movie of the predator but probably it will be at a different time."
3.0,15 September 2018,"This might have been better had Shane ""overrated"" Black bothered to watch Predators 1 and 2. Somewhere in this mess of over acting, great action scenes and utter loss of logic of any kind, might be a decent movie. Too bad this isn't it. We have a good predator being chased by an upgraded bad predator (as to how they're fusing their best prey's DNA with their own is glossed right over) because the good predator is bringing something to earth we shouldn't have. (Which ends up being one of the dumbest ideas in the entire movie). This basically just mushes along from action scene to action scene with no questions asked. In some ways it could be a movie with outtakes from every other Predator movie. Olivia Munn is a bad ass, but we never find out why a biologist is such. The crew that's put together by happenstance is a crude rewriting of the original movies crew, sans Arnold. This is just another movie where Hollywood thinks that just using the name Predator will have people flocking to theaters. I saw it today with 9 other people. So think on that."
8.0,6 June 2023,"What's less plausible; that the world is going to end very soon because of global warming or that predators exist?

Sure, predators have realised that one too many cars has made life unsustainable on earth. Presumably they all watch bbc news and tune into radio 4 as well for the latest updates.

Somewhere in this mess is a hankering for 80s sci fi, where corporate people in suits get off helicopters and out of cars with tinted windows in pursuit of an extra terrestrial being. A bunch of social outcasts are bonded by a shared sense of obligation. There is even a Halloween scene. (It's E. T which has all of these things.). But it's a mess. And big CGI Predator doesn't have the physical presence of a person in costume.

The dogs that roar directly into the camera show the director isn't too fussed about creating tension or being original. Or they think the audience will be impressed. Nope, here's a fact, it looks crap when CGI animals roar.

Overall; Naff."
4.0,26 September 2018,The first three predators were fantastic but this latest film was terrible. Tone of the film was all over the place. Very poorly executed
2.0,6 October 2019,"I loved Predator, really liked Predator 2 and Predators, didn't like AvP but actually liked AvP:Requiem (I know, guilty pleasure, don't judge me!) so we come to The Predator. I want to start by saying I've never walked out of a movie, only fallen asleep to one (Naked Gun 33 1/3) and almost never stopped a movie at home. With this film I only made it about quarter of the way through before turning it off and believe me, that was absolutely stretching my patience! The beginning was good, looked promising but then it descended rapidly into the toilet bowl. I can't believe how both Shane Black AND Fred Dekker could have made this; both gents have more than proved themselves as screenwriters and directors in the past. There is literally too much wrong with it to list. Bad cast, bad script, bad characters, bad cgi, bad acting etc etc. How could they have got so much wrong so quickly? This movie has NO redeeming qualities and is a dark insult to the franchise; which is now, after this travesty, deservedly dead. Such a sad waste of an opportunity. I really wanted this to be good but it was like a punch to the gut. Glad I didn't waste money seeing this at the cinema, I WOULD have walked out!"
1.0,25 September 2018,"I liked the humor, the pace, and the action. Don't care if it's not in line with most predator movies. I don't buy a porno looking for a plot and I don't go to a movie like this looking for an Oscar winner. Tons of people died, I like that bald guy from key and peele, and cgi doesn't bother me because I know it's fake."
1.0,25 March 2021,"This film begins with an alien space craft crash landing on Earth near the location of a sniper by the name of ""Quinn McKenna"" (Boyd Holbrook) who is prepositioned to help in a hostage rescue scenario. Realizing that his immediate mission has been compromised, he swiftly heads to the location of the crash site to investigate further. Once there he and some of members of his team engage in a firefight with the alien but only he manages to escape being killed. Prior to do that he manages to wound the alien and also grabs some of his technology as well. Not long afterward, he is arrested by American officials who seek to keep his knowledge restricted but what they don't know is that he has already mailed the technology to his estranged wife ""Emily"" (Yvonne Strahovski) where he had hoped to pick it up without being noticed. What he doesn't count on, however, is his young son ""Rory McKenna"" (Jacob Tremblay) finding the package and upon opening it accidentally alerting other alien space craft of its location. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I had waited a couple of years to watch this movie and now that I finally have I must say that I was greatly disappointed. Although it started off rather well with a good mixture of comedy and action it soon devolved into one ridiculous action scene after another with some special effects thrown in for good measure. In short, it was a typical action film with nothing really special or unique to separate it from numerous other mindless action movies produced these days. Now, make no mistake-it definitely had the potential. Unfortunately, the director (Shane Black) wasn't capable of achieving it. Again, it was all very disappointing."

5.0,16 September 2018,"Having low expectations helped me with this movie, but if you haven't seen this yet, you may need to lower them further. It's a 5/10, but even that feels like it might be too generous. The violence rules. There are some killer scenes and cool ideas. But they don't save the movie from its own horrendous identity crisis.

1. The kid sucks. His presence seemed to serve only to annoy. And it's corny as corny gets.

2. The attempts at comedy are god awful. I can't stress how not funny the ""funny"" parts and ""jokes"" are. Maybe like Michael Bay humor, but more like sloppy drunk Michael Bay humor.

3. A lot of lazy writing. So, so much.

4. Olivia Munn suuuuucks.

5. The actors have zero chemistry between any of them.

6. There's some shoddy CGI for sure.

7. The super predator's ""Iron Man suit"" you've probably read complaints about is worthy of all of those complaints.

I'd say AVP is honestly better. Not AVP:R though. But that's a low bar. Didn't see that coming.

Keep those expectations low. Like at sea level. Because make no mistake:

Predator 2 and Predators mop the floor with this dumpster fire so badly that I want Shane Black charged with homicide for probably killing the franchise.

It'll probably be a 4/10 by morning.

Update: 30 hours later, I am still mad AF at this colossal disappointment.4/10"

2.0,15 September 2018,"The problem here is they keep trying all these surburban stories involving too many people. What made the first movie great is it's backstory believability. They ruined predators being likeable scary creatures ever since they started allowing children and women to be slaughtered in avp movies, etc. Man versus beast in the middle of nowhere has always been scary and studios just don't get it. Having all this in the city nonsense just adds no originality to it. This is a sad wait for something that could have been great."
1.0,10 May 2022,"The most dissappointing movie ever made. As a civilized man, I will not use profanity to get my point. The beginning is beyond stupid. Some marine dude (I don't care about who anyone is here) watches a Predator wipe out everything, and thinks it's a good idea afterwards to take his alien equipment? There's no story here. Unless you count the kid who can communicate through alien technology, for... reason. The story really takes off when scientist people, talking not-so-scientist-stuff, have a living Predator seemly uncouncious in a lab (not held by anything), surrounded by Predator weapons. And wouldnt you know, the Predator WAKES up and kills of everyone (except from scientist lady, who later proves to be a world class athlete). The prize of the movie? When kid who knows alien tech walks around at Halloween with a Predator mask (never mind it probably would weigh in at 15 kg at least), and kills one neighbour with it. Oh, and it got former Punisher, Thomas Jane as a marine. With tourettes. Or what Shane Black has googled as tourettes. Oh, it's so FUN to hear Mr. Jane stutter profanity on a regular basis. I have to clear my concuess and confess I turned of the last quarter, but I, for some reason, don't think I missed much. Congratz, Shane Black. You managed not only making a worse movie than AvP, but killed and buried the Predator franchise."

My biggest complain are those funny moments that make this movie parody of predator and annoying jokes that completely ruin the movie. It is worst movie in franchises. There was no reazto make this movie other than to destroy franchise. This funny tone does not fit in predator movie. Story is one of the worst you will ever come across and characters are just there they are badly written they are hollow and they are empty. Movie is just ridiculous. This movie is best tutorial on how to destroy one of the best SF movies. Even predators from 2010 is better than this. Stay away from this garbage.
1.0,16 September 2018,"If you'd had told me a film written and directed by the talented Shane Black would end up far worse than the mediocre 'Predators' and quite possibly the dreadful 'Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem', I'd be surprised. As indeed I was when this disaster unfolded in an almost empty cinema on opening day.

The 100 minute mess achieves the impressive combination of being boring and not making any sense. This is almost certainly the result of reshoots but clearly the script lacked any focus as it seems Black wanted to juggle presenting a band of lovable rogues and expanding on the Predator mythology, unfortunately he failed at both.

The cast of characters are vaguely likeable but lack any real humanity, and any characterisation they are given is either painfully cliché or cartoonish, and as a result there is a total lack of engagement with the film. The story is so disappointingly basic, it seems only Predator 2 has managed to avoid the 'gang of tough guys vs. The Predator' plot and in this film it has become truly stale. The dialogue is written as if for a comedy, and while some jokes land, most don't.

The Predator element is also disappointing, the mystery and strength of the legendary creature is betrayed here by its blunt and rushed portrayal. Within the first minute we see the Predator and already have a large scale action scene, and as a result there is no build-up or tension, everything becomes boring very quickly. Parts of the predator mythology are ignored, which proves distracting, it's actions contradict previous films and as a result this feels especially distant from the revered original.

Other elements don't make any sense, the editing is often poor and the action is poorly covered and difficult to see. Also the CGI blood effects are atrocious, reducing the film to a ridiculous cartoon. In fact all of the special effects are poor, the film feels cheap and as if only minimal effort was put into its completion.

It's a tremendous shame, I did enjoy the first act, things were well set up and I was enjoying the characters, however as soon as the action begins it loses momentum, dissolves any tension and becomes just another unremarkable and boring action movie, squandering the potential of an awesome central premise."

THIS IS BY FAR THE WORST THING I'VE SEEN ON A SCREEN. EVER. it could compete with some DIY homemade horror films but at least those had an excuse.

Why waste money on trash like this? as a director or a script writer, why waste such an incredible opportunity that has been given to you? Why come up with this? All that money could produce a film better than the original which was flawed in many ways. But no. They preferred to produce the cheesiest cringy ""comedy"" you could imagine.

I won't get into more details, this has already wasted too much of my time. I watched it in a long haul flight, so thankfully it didn't cost me anything. It was just at about 1 hour in the film that I thought to myself, why waste time watching this offensive junk? So I just turned it off Apparently the last part is ileven more atrocious ; something that I think would not be possible.

4.0,12 September 2018,"I have just returned from the cinema to see this, so will write my quick initial review.

The 3D did not add to the film and made the space craft at the start really highlighted that it was CGI we were watching.

Have directors these days lost all sense of originality? Practically all action films these days have the main character searching to save a family member. 2012, War of the Worlds, San Thingy Fault Line, some of the Jurassic's, and many more. This completely ruins a film! It slows the pace down, introduces an awful mawkish element and brings children in to the story. Three minutes into the film I knew the film would be disappointing. Three minutes into the film a child appeared. Big mistake. Predator to ET in one step!

A group of humorous misfits, a uninspiring lead who tried too hard, long periods without the predator, long periods showing how decent and family loving the main lead is, a female lead who quickly turns from biologist to commando, a ridiculous final spacecraft fight etc. All of this removes tension and any sense of fear. Some of the humour was good but I did not watch to see a comedy. I wanted a scary Predator film. Taking the Alien franchise as a basis, there will never be another tension and action filled Predator film. RIP.

Unfortunately when you dig a bit deeper it's a very misjudged and sloppy addition to a franchise that deserved more.

Considering it is clearly a sequel, it manages to remain disparate with purposefully included links to the previous films not being fully utilised or exploited. Therein is the big flaw. This movie doesn't know if it's a sequel or a reboot and tries too hard to be a mix of both, resulting in a mess of plot, characterisation and story arc.

The attempt at trying to take the film in a new direction is admirable and there are parts that work genuinely well. The pace is quick enough to hold your attention throughout and some of the characters are interesting and engaging, but none of the parts are cohesive enough to each other and the wider franchise which is a real missed opportunity.

Although the movie keeps in the tradition of an R rating, providing the blood splat and gore and finding more ingenious ways to dispatch the humans being hunted, gone is the grittyness, instead opting for a more humourous tone which at times boarders on camp. Also, the CGI is a real let down which takes away the impact of the super predator and falls short of the old fashioned creature suits, which were definitely more effective.

The ending is clearly set up for another sequel, however I found this just plain bizarre and over the top, even by the standards of the genre; a weird, bastardised union of Iron Man and Independance Day: Resurgence.

Fans of the franchise will share my disappointment at the lack of sophistication in the execution of this film and apparent lack of respect to its lineage. However if you leave your brain at the door and treat it on it's own merits, it is at best a shallow thrill ride with enough gags and bangs to pass a little bit of time quiet happily."
10.0,22 July 2019,"This was a complete waste of time. If I could somehow pull this feature out of the Predetor franchise, I would do it in a heartbeat. The story didn't make sense The script was full of bad jokes The characters didn't fit the situation they were put in. For example Somehow a hot young scientist is also a badass who can shoot and kill trained soldier while everything around her explodes. I hope Arnold Schwarzenegger didn't watch it"

1.0,3 April 2023,"Let's start with some basics: this is a film aimed at 10 to 13 year olds. But, it races through plenty of swearing and mindless ultra-violence. This was a fair attempt to apply comic-book story lines and set-scenes - but that's a comic and this is, supposedly, a film. There's a reliance on the junior audience to understand and remember the original concepts from the films of the 80s. That didn't work - so I assume the Producer is just hoping that ""Dad or Mom"" explains the background so that there's some narrative to this mess of a film. I don't think any Dad or Mom would bother explaining anything after five minutes - and then they either let their kids sit through this trash or just leave the movie theatre... or switch channels.

This was a fast-moving dumb exercise, with a significant effects budget and no plan."

1.0,30 May 2021,"Shane Black creates TV shows; it worked with Lethal Weapon, it's soapy elements introduced in each subsequent movie finally reduced itself to an hour long action packed sitcom that can run forever.

He tried again with Last Boy Scout which ends like the start of a tv series, same with The Nice Guys. Tune in next week to find out who says what about stuff....

So it is with The Predator; the setting is conveniently small town backlot, the characters interchangeable wisecrackers who belong together in a sitcom. And then there's the Predator who will return. Next week. The ending is so self consciously left open as to be a pilot episode.

And then there's the child actors; Iron Man 3, Last Boy Scout, The Nice Guys and now The Predator. Each one has to feature a child giving lip to the bad guys and someone for the grown ups to apologise to. Now though he's a savant who can talk Predator, thereby ensuring his return every week in the TV series to help secure the younger demographic.

All of which begs the question whether Shane Black watches TV? In the age of Netflix's Black Mirror or The Crown, 10 years since The Wire or Breaking Bad, 20 since The Sopranos, nearly 30 since Twin Peaks.

It seems his understanding of how TV shows work still remain rooted in the 80s, when Knight Rider and Airwolf were prime time and presumably when he wrote most of these scripts. In those days all you needed was a few cheap sets, a couple of has been actors, a backlot and stock footage for the ""special effect"" bit. Maybe introduce a child savant for the younger demographic (im looking at you Galactica1980). As long as you had a nifty theme tune off you went into 5 seasons of syndication. It didn't matter if it was just the same episode time again, just change some of the jokes. A bit like Shane Black films.

So more of the same next week then..."
1.0,24 May 2019,"This movie is one of the best trash movies I've ever seen. The movie doesn't take itself serious, and so shouldn't you.

It takes a franchise that was already going down hill and makes the worst sequel I have ever seen. This film is a slap in the face to fans of the original. I would advise anyone thinking of going to see this to stop and spen their money on something less insulting of their intelligence. Genuinely one of the worst films I have ever, ever seen."

So i watched the new Predator 2018 movie.. and the director just destroyed everything the first real movie was about and its feeling.

But what where they thinking with this movie i mean younger generation and people that are new to the predator story... have absolute no idea what the hell this movie even suppose to be about. If i would meet the director i really would just skin him like a Predator would and hang him up on a rope in middle of the studio.. and take his head and spine for my trophy but i probably couldn't even bring that back either because my fellow Predator fans would dishonor me for a screwed up job the director did... very very disappointed and my all time best movie titles destroyed."

1.0,24 April 2020,"Absolute trash, not good CGI, not funny at all and it tries so hard to be a comedy. I could not believe what I was seeing, this film gets the predator lore, chucks it in the blender then sets it on fire and serves it to us in a plate. I love everything about the three predator films before this, I even enjoyed the AVP films. If you enjoy films that just do not make sense, not funny crude jokes and do not know anything about predator, then you may able to stomach it but for everyone else?..... Hard pass."

If someone makes THE movie about THE Predator he must know that there will not be any low expectations from so many Predator fans for the result. This movie should just be undone.

Got to watch good ol' original Predator today, now I feel a bit better.

So my advice is - go watch this new ""movie"" only if you're a kid, teen or really drunk."

But it wasn't meant to be. And even forgiving the throwing away of 31 years of continuity and slapping around the creatures who practically created the intergalactic hunter trope, the writing was generally flat, ""the Looneys"" were insulting renditions of mental health that felt like they came from some 8th grader in the early 2000's who watched too much South Park, and as somebody with it, good god. Every time the main protagonist's son or the glorification of his Autism came up I felt myself sinking into my theater seat in shame. It was just all around a terrible portrayal and the ""next step in human evolution"" nonsense was just... So stupid. This has outright never happened to me watching any movie before. So I can't help but feel some extra, admittedly bias spite."
3.0,27 September 2018,As a fan of the original Predator movies I really enjoyed this follow up in the series. It takes elements from the first two Predator movies and advances the story and the lore. Some people may not like that it is not the action/suspense movie that Schwarzenegger starred in or the action movie that Glover starred in but it is a good action movie with comedy elements to relieve the darker moments. Just like Aliens was a departure from Alien it gives you an opportunity to look at the series from a new angle.
1.0,30 September 2018,"Having been a big fan of the original and even the 2nd and 3rd I was looking forward to this. How wrong could I be. The plot has so many holes it's like Swiss cheese and acting, characters and all but the effects are terrible.

1.0,28 September 2018,"It's hard to compare every movie to every movie. For example when rating a movie you wouldn't compare Jurassic Park to Steel Magnolia, it doesn't make sense. But I feel like that's how a lot people rate movies, they compare what they've just seen to the best thing they've seen.

The Predator is catching a lot of heat it doesn't deserve. Does it try to be Predator? No, Does it try to take itself too seriously? Not even a little bit. Is the acting AAA? Not even close. Honestly some of the effects effects are cheesy, the story intros are really generic, it's not the best movie ever made.

But..

It is really really fun to watch, and not even close to terrible. The action scenes are fast paced, the humor stays on track the whole movie, you actually feel a bit of something for the characters, and it's chock full of holy shit moments. They do all this while making it feel like a Predator movie and not just a movie with a Predator in it.

As I said before, it's not the best movie in the world but it is fully solid. Ive got a policy, if my wife skips a film and I feel like I need to talk her into going to see it it gets at least an 8. If you want to listen to the whispered laughs and ""holy shits"" of a theater full of people having fun watching a movie give it a go."

1.0,8 August 2022,"And not a good one.

Everything about this film seemed outdated and outclassed.

The music would have been more suited to a thrilling family adventure. The special effects were serviceable at best, sub-par for the most part. The ""humour"" was inane and massively overused. The characters were routinely lacklustre and clichéd and, in some instances, downright offensive.

On top of this, the story just doesn't make sense. So many things happen that we're just expected to accept.

The guy and the kid playing with the alien weaponry just manage to get it to do exactly the right thing through sheer luck every single time? Yep.

Child instinctively understands aliens motives even when the audience doesn't? Sure.

The alien understands how a US postal address works? Apparently.

If I really had to dig and find a redeeming feature of this film, it would be... ... . . .

Well, I have seen worse. I'm struggling to think of titles right now, but I'm sure I have.

If you enjoyed the original Predator and want a follow-up which is worth your time, watch the recently-released Prey. Now that is a film that understood what made the original work, and yet still managed to take it in a different direction.

The Predator, on the other hand, is everything a sequel shouldn't be."
2.0,4 July 2021,
3.0,19 September 2018,"I think this film has put the nail in the coffin for the franchise.

Some ideas were good and it was entertaining at certain points, but for the majority of the film I wasn't excited at all.

And personally I think Shane black has lost the plot, I really had high hope with him on board to direct, but in the end it was a massive let down.

I would say this is the 4th best predator film (AvP not included). I won't be watching this film again.

It's going to take a miracle to keep this franchise going after this film."
5.0,15 December 2018,"Sadly a mass of reviewers have opted for the 'not the original' spin.. Duh!? Why would you want to do that? Arnold was brilliant, it truly was a classic, but this is not supposed to be a remake, it isn't even a spin like the Predators movie (which was also sound). In fact, it attempts to wrap up a few subjects that probably got asked at various times during the previous movies.

Watching this was initially a ""what can they do that they haven't already?"" moment for me. I believe that they did an amazing job, yes there are times when you cringe, pondering who was responsible for that moments. Yes there are times when you cringe wondering; why the ""same old same old"" car flying through the air for no apparent reason moments happen. Blame the special effects folks, they should no that generally cars don't go airborne for no reason! But overall there is enough 'new' stuff that I really enjoyed the movie.

The action is a wee bit 'too non-stop', there could be a few more moments like the ex-wife's home invasion. But, strangely it seems to keep everything rolling well enough to make you watch attentively and not lose interest as some of the latest sci-fi movies do.

My concern is that because everyone has placed this in the 'franchise' mode that the expectations can't be anything but too high. The consequence of that is the number of reviewers that have slammed this. Fact is that movies like fifth passenger or Occupation (which are basically awful) will get about the same overall rating but if rated based on the same principles would surely get negative ratings!

Synopsis: I liked it, some of the 'humor' is cringeworthy but the acting is good the special effects (except the flying cars) is good and the CGI is good. I believe it is worth the watch and frankly hope that the hinted at; 'The Predator Part II' will happen."

It's a choppy selection of scenes with little to no character development and not a single memorable set piece. A very disappointing effort from Shane Black.

I'm not sure what target audience they were aiming for but I can't really see anyone enjoying the simple storyline of this film. Action overall was quite forgettable and so fast paced you really didn't get to enjoy any of the kills. The first act of the film seemed interesting and just completely fell flat in the last act.

If you're a casual fan you may like it, but anyone who loves the predator series I'd stay far away from this one. The ending had to be some of the dumbest and worst cgi I've seen in a long time."
1.0,12 November 2023,"The same thing has already been said here in several comments, but I have to reinforce: This film is the death of the franchise.

Not that I'm exactly a super fan, but the originals had something that this one simply doesn't have. The amount of CGI (bad CGI) makes it even worse. This new Jurassic Park-style story model, in which everything is epic but they forget about the story or the simplicity of things, which is what often gets the message across to the public, makes it almost impossible to see.

I confess that I'm giving a review to a film that I haven't watch it to the end, and it's rare that I don't watch movies to the end, but for some reason I give these films 1 or 2 stars.

Hero decomissioned is stuck on a bus with other former soldiers who all have mental issues and cant fight no more as they are probably more dangerous to their own country than the enemy. Of course you have the funny/chirper guy, the tough guy, the smart guy and the fully mentally unstable guy. All of them are from different origins of course.

Hero's an absent father to his bullied son of about 8 years old. Son is also smarter with computer and electronics than any army scientist with a PhD. Hot scientist inadvertently joins the team, she is asian because there was no asians with the team of nutjobs from the bus ride.

So all these crazies, outnumbered every time, take over every special forces by the government. When head bad guy has the hero at his mercy, instead of killing him he gos to chat with him and of course loses focus and gets taken down.

Lady scientist shoots military grade weapon with precision.

Autistic kid mother is a tough chick who tells government great lines like ""you mess with the wrong family""

10.0,15 January 2024,"Thought I'd give it a try as I liked 1 & 2.

Let me repeat what most are saying.

It's virtually a comedy, a parody.

The main characters are stereotypes often seen in really bad military movies. They must have needed the money badly to audition for this junk.

And when there's a child playing a main part, did the writers think about the crude language, would that child actor even be allowed to see the premiere???

But the really irritating parts are where the story does not connect with the following scene. The protaganists just appear at a shootout with no explanation as to how they got there unnoticed. As for the ""surfing"" on an alien space craft, please don't insult the intelligence of the viewer, no way would they hold on. And these scenes are typical of what the movie goers are meant to believe.

Without being full of bad language, this is a film for kids.

The movie is passably entertaining. The action is pretty cool and the attempt to add humor to this series lands well some of the time, though certainly not always.

However, you absolutely cannot take this movie seriously if you hope to enjoy it. Much like Pirhanna, Snakes on a Plane, or ""Sharknado"", the only way to like this movie is in a ""it's so bad it's good"" kind of way.

The plot is horrible and riddled with holes. Much of the dialogue is cringe worthy, both because of the writing and the acting.

In short, unless you really like bad movies, have nothing better to do, or have plenty of money to spend, you can pass this up at least until it's streaming for free."

Too many characters of which none i cared if they died, the predator was boring and medicore. And for the record I loved the first predator film , the second was decent still, and Predators with Adrian Brody had it enough of the originals vibe to keep it heads above this new film. what a pity they screwed this series up..."

To me the biggest loss of the movie is that the Predator stopped being a ""Batman of villains"" where he uses surgical precision and awesome gadgets to kill and terrify people; instead, he became a senseless butcher. And I think they fired the editing team for the last 20 minutes or so because its complete chaos there...

10.0,16 February 2019,"Less than fantastic, indeed.

Cannot believe how good this starts off and then literally goes to sh;t in the last half. I have not seen this messy of a second and third act since 2015's Fantastic Four. And what a waste.

With almost zero new stuff to tell in the fourth (sixth) Predator film, we have too many characters fighting, offing each other, making old jokes and telling a completely incoherent story about people we would care more about had the script passed just the first draft phase. Hell, maybe this was just the rough draft, even.

Hard to write a synopsis, but suffice to say, despite the title, it's Predator v Predator and a bunch of dead meat to get in the way. Really that's it. Okay, it's also about an autistic son who instantly adapts to alien technology because he's supposed to be the next X-man.

The CGI blood and kills were distracting, the editing a mess and the most outrageously bad script made this such a disappointment...especially when I found myself liking the first 40 or so minutes.

Of the (technically six) Predator films, this is the absolute worst. I seriously don't know how they can come back from this.

***

Final thoughts: No spoiler, but they must've known something was wrong when they tried to mimic the Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem finale. If you wrongfully watch this, you'll see what I'm talking about."
2.0,15 September 2018,"Well...its been eight years since the alien hunter last stalked the silver-screen and now he's back and bigger than ever, literally. 'The Predator' is the fourth entry in the franchise (AVP 1 & 2 excluded) but does it have the spine to prove itself better than the original?

1. After hearing that Shane Black would be at the helm of this film, I was beyond excited. Not only am I a fan of Black and his directed features thus far, this one is undoubtedly the lesser of his works. 'The Predator' has an ambitious start but falters the more it goes on. This review is spoiler-free so no need to worry. The plot involves sniper Cpt. Quinn McKenna (Boyd Holbrook) encountering a Predator and its crashed spacecraft while on a mission in Mexico. With the government wanting to keep the events quiet, Mckenna is held in custody with a group of other military veterans. However, when a newly enhanced Predator arrives to Earth intent on a particular hunt, its up to the rag-tag platoon of misfits to stop him. As interesting as the story might sound, the writing and subplots ultimately weigh the movie down. Shane Black is famous for being a great script writer, but his talent doesn't shine here.

2. The one element a Predator film needs to have is horror, unlike this version which presents itself as more of an Action/Comedy. That being one major issue. another is the introduction of McKenna's autistic son Rory (Jacob Tremblay), who's purpose in this film is boarderline idiotic. Let's just say that this kid has a talent for something which makes him a target for someone so that they can use him for this other thing all because he's retarded. Makes no damn sense either way you approach it. If Tremblay was the only useless character in this film, that would be one thing but Olivia Munn as Dr. Casey Bracket, serves little purpose in the story. Not only do we not know what kind of doctor she it, but her reason for being there is to simply ponder on the revelation of something and partake in the action just to satisfy Hollywood's feminist agenda.

3. With Shane Black and Fred Dekker both contributing to the script, there are some funny moments scattered in between that will make you chuckle. Needless to say, the acting is sub-par overall. Sterling K. Brown, Olivia Munn and Jacob Tremblay are by far deliver the worst performances in this film. Not to say they all haven't proven themselves as good actors prior to this, but if this is the first film witnessing them in, you'd be severely disappointed. I suppose the action was well done with my favorite sequence being the one in which a captive Predator breaks free in the lab he is being held and proceeds the brutally kill everyone during his escape. With the exception of that sequence, never did I feel the suspense nor thrills I got from the prior films. Despite all the underwhelming performances, Trevante Rhodes as Nebraska Williams and Thomas Jane as Baxley, were probably my two favorite characters.

4. I like Boyd Holbrook as an actor but he is horribly miscast as the lead role in this film. He unfortunately plays his part as McKenna rather bland and lacks the charisma that Schwarzenegger, Danny Glover and even Adrien Brody had when carrying their respective 'Predator' films. I'll give credit to the design and make-up department as the practical Predator looked fantastic and scary whenever he had his brief moments. This is easily the most bloodiest and gory of the four films, but that still doesn't lend itself to the movie's credit. If it were up to me, I'd make a sequel from where 'Predators' (2010) left off, with Adrien Brody and Alice Braga still stuck on the Predator hunting planet. As distasteful as this film had become during the climax, the last 5-7mins of this movie was utter garbage. The big secret is not worth yours or anyone else's time waiting in that theater to see what it is.

I desperately wanted to love this film since I had such admiration for the previous ones. If nothing else, I wanted to be entertained at least, but it failed to deliver even in a fun way. I can see why Schwarzenegger refused to return for a cameo having read the script.

'The Predator' is not a faithful or even half-way decent sequel moving forward and is probably best suited for the small-screen as a rental. Though my faith in Shane Black hasn't been shaken by this, I honestly cannot and will not recommend anyone go see this ""spine-less"" Predator in theaters."

It is dark, you can barely see anything, characters are moronic, action is confusing, and at no point does the audience feel any kind of pleasure from watching this. Several times during this film I couldn't even watch the nonsense on the screen, and I found myself switching off. This is such rubbish, it fails to generate interest even in the final act.

4.0,31 August 2023,"Each film in the Predator franchise has its own brand and something that makes it stand out, even if it's not a perfect film, but ""The Predator"" is just another generic action movie involving alien invasion. The script is despicable, nothing in it is good or develops the story in an interesting way. The characters are generic and don't develop well, even if the script tries to do that at times, but it always seems forced. The actors don't deliver any charisma, so you don't care about the death of certain characters or even what might happen to them. The special effects are horrible at times and even that the original is better. There is no doubt that this is the worst film in the entire franchise, there is nothing that is good or at least garlic that stands out."

How people knowingly create these shallow cashgrab jokes for movies off of the backs of beloved franchises is preposterous. The only things I enjoyed about this was the score.

Since, there are just a few movies bad as this one, it has to be said, that Hollywood (read Holýúd) very successfully begins to destroy bilion-billing blockbusters like .hit off a shovel. Why? Two reasons... Either the producer are running out of ideas (since there so many remakes like never before) or the audience is simply too dumb to demand more and consumes whatever... I do not know. But this movie, is a joke people, really. Bad writing, you do not give a .hit about - no one from the cast. The Predator (de)evolved... It gets bigger, advanced and pimped like everything in Holýúd, but nor does it add to quality or some emotional response from public. For an action B movie it is almost to weak, there are no emotions, no horror, no mistery, suspense, logic or drama... You´d be better served to spend the 108 minutes with a shrink in a mental hospital, not with a completely retarded group of people who had not read the script, a space dog with lobotomy and a Predator who is just seconding the movie. ""Evolution"" is a purebred mix of the second ""Predator"", (hunting in a crowded area) ""Independence Day"" (do not shoot, we're going to help you!), ""Mercury"" and tons of other transgender beasts that give together a direct show movie .hit. And the conclusion is already on the edge of an absurd parody with a hot candidature for the Golden Raspberry. So bad, not worth, can I give a 0 (zíró) rating?"

In fact, it is the total opposite of Predator 1: it's more of comedy rather than a horror/action movie. It's filled with tons of garbage-joks that are everything but funny.

The Predator was a difficult production as shown by the third act reshoots and poor green screen work.

This was a film filled with baffling decisions like setting the film in suburban, bringing in a lot more comedy, and worst of all having the Predator coming down to Earth to steal autism, which is insulting to anyone who has autism.

There was some decide action and violence and the moment where Olivia Munn gets trapped in the decontamination area was an effective moment of tension, but the humour was mostly misses and the story was poor. It was a dumb, pointless film."

That's an opinion not fact. This is SHANE BLACK at his VERY BEST. I loved it."
2.0,12 December 2018,"Despite its unwavering popularity through the decades, the Predator franchise has failed to find its feet ever since it took off in 1987 with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Carl Weathers battling an alien foe in the jungles of South America. It's sequel, Predator 2, was an overblown mess, and it took twenty years for the threequel, Predators, to arrive and instantly be forgotten. The thirty years that have passed ever since John McTiernan's original seemed to have been one constant effort to steer the series back on course, so it must have seemed like a no-brainer to hire Shane Black, who played one of Arnie's unit first time around, to reignite some interest in the rasta-haired intergalactic travellers. After all, directors with their own sense of style and vision are rarely hired for big-budget blockbusters, and perhaps Black could inject the same level of wit and zip as he did with the likes of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and The Nice Guys.

It pains me to say this, but how tragically wrong they were. This effort to reboot a dying franchise fails on almost every level, from the recycled plot and cast of stock characters, to the forced humour that never so much as raises a giggle, despite the actors' attempts to convince you that they're all having a good time. From the get-go, Black hits us with gun-toting action and CGI blood-spraying, and does so at an alarming rate. One can only wonder if Black had hoped we would be too distracted by the carnage and endless exposition to realise how stupid the film actually is, but it's hard not to notice when the main character begins the film by mailing alien tech back to his family from Mexico under the government's nose. Former army sniper turned mercenary Quinn McKenna (Boyd Holdbrook) is busy on a retrieval mission when he witnesses an alien craft crash to Earth. His crew are wiped out, but Quinn manages to flee with an alien helmet which he sends to his estranged wife Emily (Yvonne Strahovski) and autistic son Rory (Jacob Tremblay). While Quinn is interrogated by the government, the Predator is taken to the lab for experimentation. Yes, you've already guessed what happens next.

As the Predator wreaks havoc and more arrive for the fight, Quinn is thrown in with a bunch of military prisoners, who all are crazy in their own way. They consist of Trevante Rhodes, Augusto Aguilera, Thomas Jane, Keegan-Michael Key and Alfie Allen, and provide most of the film's 'humour'. They are supposed to be lovable but really aren't, but Quinn evidently trusts them enough to leave them alone with an unconscious Olivia Munn. Had they been given a personality, or some actual funny lines of dialogue, the gang may have helped cover up many of The Predator's flaws, but the film has the same uncomfortably conflicted feel of Black's Iron Man 3, which struggled to juggle the director's independent sensibilities with the restrictions of a franchise. It's flashy, colourful and rarely pauses for breath, but doesn't have a style of its own. People are thrown into huge objects to get up like nothing has happened, there's military tough-guy speak, and somebody at one point even yells ""get to the chopper!"". It's a bunch of thrown-together Easter eggs and action beats you've seen a million times before. I doubt this is the last we've seen of the extraterrestrial trophy-hunter, but it's certainly time to lay him down to rest for a while."

The first predator with Arnie is my favorite movie and I even loved Predator 2. So, needless to say I was really looking forward to this movie and was extremely let down. I actually walked out of the theater after an hour. I just couldn't handle anymore. First of all the plot made little sense. The scenes were all kinda mashed together with poor editing, the tone and pacing was all over the place. They tried to make it somewhat of a comedy but it just came off as forced, cheesey and even cringy at times. Second, the characters were lame and completely cliche with the heroic loose cannon rebellious soldier, badass empowered female, the genius autistic child who is miraculously an expert in deciphering alien language and technology and of course the funny smart ass black guy that for some reason every movie has to have these days. Third, the action scenes sucked. The film was so dark I was squinting the whole time and still could barely tell what was happening. Mix that with the camera changing angles every millisecond during the action scenes and it just looked like they haphazardly pieced a bunch of random scenes together. I would be willing to forgive some of those things if they put in some good Predator footage, but they only gave you quick glimpses of them with bad CGI. The worst part is that this movie was so bad that another will probably never be made. Don't trust anyone who gave this movie above a 3 rating.

3.0,28 February 2019,"The worst thing a movie can be to me is boring. The Predator is anything but boring.

Funny and memorable characters, great special effects, badass action scenes, plenty of gore. Its just mindless fun to watch with friends while munching on popcorn, and I loved it.

I should warn you, if you are looking for a horror or anything remotely serious, this is the wrong movie for you."

4.0,15 November 2018,"What a joke a lot of movies have become. This is no exception. The writing is so bad, every scene is just another exposition, i.e. letting the audience in on a bunch of information they were too lazy to show, or too lazy to introduce characters in a clever natural way so a character quickly goes through the names and background of each other character to get us ""up to speed."".

Forget about the cast. All good looking people that have positions of expert biologists and doctors. You know, like the ""real world."" Olivia Munn? Supposedly wrote the book on biology and of course a master weapons export and handler. Because why not? HAHA Then, Jake Busey, a Government scientist? Sure. Only in ridiculous Hollywood land.

I'm not gonna waste much more time going over how bad this was. Just skip it!"
10.0,30 January 2020,"Welcome to the Predators circus on earth!

The movie is so bad, that I'm at loss at where to begin and after a long thought decide that saying the bare truth would be the best course of action.

The team of writers ruined the glory of the first two Predators movie by making a joke of this one. An insult to the intelligence of almost ALL viewers. How dared they?!

On top of that, this silly piece of .. contains most stupidly gory scenes that one can ever imagine in motion pictures. Personally, I don't care much, don't especially enjoy nor do I hate it, but it begs the question whether they were sky-high to provide the audience with tons of unneeded and gore-feasty 'incidents'.

I just hoped that Yvonne Strahovskiy wasn't in it. To my horror, she did nothing useful! A skeleton of a script for almost everybody, but the boy, who surely enjoyed being there very much.

That's a movie, which goes straight to the museum of Neanderthals. Farewell quality..."

1.0,15 September 2018,"It was the worst predator movie made to date. The premise is bad. It has the parts of a predator movie. A bunch of military dudes come together to fight a predator. Include a strong woman scientist and then put them together at a secret lab to go on to fight a predator. Add the evil government guys trying to capture and collect the alien tech in pursuit. Large wooded areas. It's all there but it goes horribly wrong. Adding the father and son angle was ridiculous. Someone has some father issues they need help with.

The story asks a lot from the viewer. We are expected to swallow some foolish dialogues and dumb plot points. Using a high school microscope in a RV we are to believe that the character can determine a scientific reason behind what is happening. That's gold Jerry, gold.

Is is so bad that they have Olivia Munn's dog in the movie for a brief moment only to be to scooped up the government guys that come to get her and she is told ""we will take care of your dog ma'am"". Sorry I'd not be leaving my dog with no government agency. This and other not well thought out story transitions make this movie a complete mess.

They should have rebooted the series or left it alone. Waste of time and money."

If they are going make films like this they need to be scary edge of the seat stuff. All I heard was the f word multiple times and a pathetic plot from start to finish and pointless humour.

Don't make anymore please - in fact can you lot create more original movies please - especially without any superheroes. It is getting very sad and I feel sorry for anyone going to the Cinema to watch this tripe."
3.0,1 December 2018,"Horrible movie. At least AvP movies were funny and bad....this 2018 movie is just bad, unfunny, and full of smart female, and awful males.

Olivia Munn is a bad actress. Horribly miscast by every movies studio. She's a strong, smart, scientist.......who again stronger and smarter than every man ever existed and....she simply slept her way to movie roles.

Predator on earth, a child discovers everything, Munn is a Scientologist or something and group of ""rag tag"" people come together to stop the Predator(s). Did I mention Munn is a Mary Sue?

She is awful actress...which represents this movie. It lacks Machismo, and it tries to draw on the original Predator movie, but is sucked....because they are afraid to do a movie for men because feminism, Liberalism and political correctness.

2 out of 10...but I gave it a 1 because this movie casts Olivia Munn."
10.0,9 November 2018,"Man, I had been looking forward to this movie ever since they announced it. Sure, my heart sank like stone when they announced it was a reboot, but I stuck with it and decided to watch it regardless, because this is a ""Predator"" movie after all.

One of the good things in ""The Predator"" was that they brought in the predators right away and weren't shy of showing them, where as the older movies were more reluctant in bringing the predators to the screen until well into the movie.

And the movie was fast paced, it starts off in a high tempo and never really loses momentum, which was a nice thing.

But that was about it... Oh, well the witty takes on the old classic lines were also hillarious. And Thomas Jane sure carried the movie with his performance.

But that was it. Yup, no doubt about it. Everything else was just bland and felt very superficial.

The elder predator, or whatever it was, just didn't have much appeal to me and I found it to be ridiculous. I mean a giant sized predator. So they went, how do we amp up the predator for this reboot? Someone raises a hand and goes ""uhm, make it bigger?"" And it was voted as a go immediately. It just was so ridiculous to have a bigher predator run around.

The fights were quickly finished and also just felt rushed and bland.

Actually when ""The Predator"" ended, I was sitting with an overwhelming sense of 'was that really it?'. I felt so cheated out of something that had every potential to be great. Sure, this is an addition to the ""Predator"" franchise, but it is hardly a movie that I will return to watch a second time around."

4.0,26 December 2018,I've seen every Predator movie. This one is an insult to the whole series of Predator movies. IT does not compare to any of them. The cheap and empty story line is glazed over with over the top curse words that only makes it worse. There is no suspense. The technology was great but was hindered by filming of the movie. The other films were filmed in a way that gives a genuine presence of danger and thrill. This one seems so candy-coated. This movie does not deserve a star but for a ratings to be posted I gave it a ONE STAR. How could they allow this movie to be produced makes no sense.

9.0,29 December 2018,"Despite all of funny moments, action scenes and thrill, it is just a wrong film. I try to explain that. The Predator's audience are not fun lover kids that like to see Thor in action, Hulk roaring, and Avengers doing save the Earth stuff, neither they are exaggerating themselves to watch some funny characters with music and dance to save the galaxy. ""The Pedator"" (the original) evolved because of its seriousness and horror-packed thrill, and that is what its audience like. When I started watching this , all was OK until that chopper lands and soldiers scattered then a guy (Traeger) with chewing gum came out and giving them instruction.... what he would have given them before landing or at least before they scattered. So what the.....? After 2 or three same out of mind and logic acts, I stopped thinking and said, OK that is what that is, lets have fun with it and don't burden on my brain. But as it went, it appeared to be more annoying than a fun delivering show. Look at the Lab scene, where unconscious predator was lying and they were doing some lab tests on him, the same guy there, munching, i mean chewing the chewing gum, so annoying and doesn't make any sense, BECAUSE in all labs, munching is seriously prohibited, I know because I work in a Pharma lab. Also this guy does not fit in that character, he is more like a comedian, oh wait, that's what they are trying to do? Yes it has its funny moments and jokes and they are not bad, but they just doesn't fit with ""The Predator"" line. WHY THEY DID THIS? The original Predator (1978) was a classic top movie in all aspects and one of the top in its genre, yet it did not get the same attention and fame as compared to The Avengers, Guardian of the galaxy, Hulk, and Thor franchise. What I concluded is this. After the success and popularity of Avengers and The Guardian of the galaxy, they thought to turn that serious stuff into a comedy like action pack to gain popularity, but they did not consider the audience, who had been attached to the seriousness and horror of The Predator. This movie just made a fun of those serious audience. It failed because they try to copy the theme of some kids movie and turn a precarious story into a joke. The film is not bad, but it just not fits itself in that specific environment and it ruined the Predator essence. It is so bad that I consider it just like giving a serious incidence a comedic style. I just get disappointed."
1.0,6 November 2018,"This is a bad action comedy with a predator thrown in. The first 5 mins are exciting, after that this movie is so bad that it's annoying.

Heck, even the previous sequels and spinoffs were somewhat watchable. This is not in either of those categories. It is the cheapest form of hollow and empty Hollywood scripting, character stereotyping and mediocre acting, as we've unfortunately been forced to get accustomed to in recent years.

1.0,8 December 2018,"I couldn't shake the feeling, watching this, that I had watching THE LAST KNIGHT, the most recent cultural atrocity in the TRANSFORMERS series; that we've entered a period of movie making so poisoned by 'studio interests' as to be producing let's-call-them-films that no longer even function as stories.

Nothing that happens in this movie matters. It's a bunch of weird, functionless scenes, nailed together by the Predator leitmotif in the score - a scribble of drums and sound that has been so badly abused over the years, it's astonishing it still evokes the successes of the first movie at all.

It's hard to say that the actors know where the camera is, or when it is on, or what they are supposed to be doing at any given moment. I cannot overstate how compassless and empty this is. I would really urge you not to watch it, because you're going to die someday, like me, and I will never get back the time I gave this...this...un-story, but you don't have to do that. You can walk in the sun."
8.0,7 October 2018,"How did the movie company allow this Shane Black A**Hole make and release this as a theatrical movie. Its not even worth a direct to dvd or television movie. The Editing, Direction, and Characters were horrible. No suspense. The comedy aspect was corny. Comedy will not work for a predator movie. They destroyed a classic franchise. On the bright side for predator fans it was good to see the predator character on screen again. Do yourself a favor Shane, don't ever make anymore movies please dont.... And tthey say Howard the duck was the worse movie of all time lol"
3.0,6 December 2018,"The classic Arnold Predator movie was a suspense action Thriller because the first time you watch that movie, you did not know what was going on nor what was killing the soldiers in the jungle, that was what made that movie great + Arnold & muscle co-cast was interesting to watch. All that suspense and anticipation is not recreated here, its a pure action flick without an interesting plot/story - action for action sake and cheesy one liners for everyone, reminds of Transformers. For a Predator action flick I have been waiting for the muscle to return, nope they gave us old black guy + pregnant lady in predator 2, an uninteresting suicide squad bunch in Predators and now this movie - the loonie MASH bunch. Where's the muscle and the pro-military? They should have kept the first military unit in the movie alive but instead they made the loonie MASH bunch the stars of the show..why?

I am actually quite surprise that they made this movie this way, considering they could have learnt from the past unsuccessful predator movies and an 8 year gap between movies to work on a proper script. Wasted opportunity and wasted money both for the studio and the movie goer. Its no wonder Netflix is becoming more successful than studios. Stop ruining the classic, spend time on the storyline, script and proper casting, stop throwing money into FX as though it can solve all things for Predator's sake."

1.0,17 September 2018,"Let me tell you the parts what I felt are bad: Trying to be funny and comedic, B-grade actors and bad acting without any motif, lacking of strong script and character development. Good parts: Expansion of predator universe, tough guy in lead role, involvement of a young kid in the world of predator, nice action scenes and gore. A decent flick and nothing like the original. I don't understand the negative reviews. I should say people have made up their minds to see big guns,big guys and the predator, so if the movie is taken in new light, they can't digest it. I didn't pay like crazy amounts of money for the movie but I was entertained and it was fun to know new cool stuff about the predator universe"

1.0,11 November 2018,"Awful, simply awful movie. Not only that it managed to tarnish the legacy of McTiernan's action classic, it also achieved almost impossible lows for the franchise. Predator 2 and Predators were flawed films, but with respect for Predator as a character and with (more or less successful) attempts to expand its universe. This steaming pile of crap only managed to be unfunny, formulaic and above all with amateurish acting and pretentious writing and direction. I haven't found any single ""joke"" even remotely funny, the deconstruction of Predator mythology was poorly executed and what surprised me the most was the lack of witty dialogue. Shane Black, the man who created one of my favorite B-movie homages Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang once knew how to write something funny and clever. Obviously, not in this case. Oh, and let's not forget the absolutely horrible creature design! Original Predator never looked more like a guy in a rubber suit and the dogs and the Super Predator looked like SYFY channel CGI. Incredible! All being sad and done, this is one hell of a mess of a movie, probably the worst blockbuster of the year and possibly the harbinger of death to poor Predator franchise. Thank you for messing with my childhood, Shane Black, thank you very much! The ONLY upside of all this sad affair that Arnie passed on this dreck, so at least his legacy as Dutch remains untarnished."

The plot was made by a 10 year old, the cast was awfull (even ""decent"" actors like Holdbrook or Jane). Every reference to the original movie felt like a slap in the face. It was worst than a parody. Awfull. If you want a good Predator movie go watch the first or second ones, or even the last one with A. Brody which was a masterpiece compared to this thing. Don't waste your time. Mr. Black, you definitly killed a franchise; i will never watch any of your movies ever again."
5.0,11 December 2018,"I actually had to retrieve my password so I can write this review upon seeing the flock of wannabe critics with their blinders on, spitting their venom from their mother's basements. I actually enjoyed this movie more than the initial series, it's more relaxed and has a good message if you're willing to see it. If you want a perfect copy of the original movies (so that you can then complain about how unoriginal and too similar to the first movies it is) I'd suggest rewatching the 80s and 90s ones. Kay and the crew carried most of the comedy, making this viewing easy to digest but keeping the message serious enough to not slip it into parody. I wasn't thinking I was going to enjoy this movie as much as I did and I hope they make a new one on the same mold. Maybe by then all the bored people commenting here will have moved to something else or figured out a way to actually enjoy life."

4.0,26 September 2018,"If I was to show future generations a prototypical 1980's ""Machismo, Blood and Guts Action Flick"", I would pull the original 1987 PREDATOR (starring good ol' Arnold Schwarzenegger) off my dusty shelves and show this to them. It is a film so ""of it's time"".

In subsequent years, there have been more films that attempted to use the Predator character - PREDATOR 2 (1990), AVP: ALIENS VS. PREDATOR (2004), ALIENS VS. PREDATOR: REQUIEM (2007) and PREDATORS (2010) - all disappointing. All failing to equal the balance of machismo, action and humor that is needed.

So...it was with great anticipation that I looked forward to THE PREDATOR, a new film written and directed by Shane Black (KISS KISS BANG BANG, IRON MAN 3, THE NICE GUYS) - one of the actors in the 1987 flick!

And...I was disappointed again.

This film fails because it never really got a grip on just what type of film it wanted to be - is it a Sci-Fi film? Is it an Action film? A buddy flick? A gore fest? A look at Autism? Black's script and direction spreads all these items out on the picnic blanket that is this film and then intermittently picks each one of these up to show us - sometimes a couple of them - like a kid trying to decide whether he wants the chips or the hot dogs or the Oreo cookies and just shoves them all in his mouth together.

And that's too bad, for Black has an interesting premise - rival Predators battling on Earth - with a ragtag group of Earthlings thrown in the middle - and what a ""ragtag"" group they are! Trevante Rhodes (MOONLIGHTING), Thomas Jane (THE MIST), Keegan-Michael Key (KEY & PEELE), Alfie Allen (GAME OF THRONES) and Augusto Aguilera (CHASING LIFE) make an intriguing band of misfit soldiers that easily could have been an equal to Arnold's ragtag group of soldiers from the 1987 original.

Unfortunately, they are the ""back-up band"" to the boring Boyd Holbrook (NARCOS) and Olivia Munn (X-MEN: APOCALYPSE) as a couple thrown together to defend Holbrook's Autistic son (Jacob Tremblay - so good in ROOM and wasted here) in a by-the-book ""they hate each other when they first meet, so - naturally - they'll fall in love by the end"" plot contrivance that doesn't work at all.

Add on top of that Sterling K. Brown (THIS IS US) as a ""mysterious"" Gov't Agent who is so much of a bad guy, all he was missing was a mustache twirl and the missed opportunities of actors such as Yvonne Stahovski (THE HANDMAID'S TALE) and NIall Matter (EUREKA) who both just stand around and do nothing. They even cast Jake Busey (Gary's kid) - who would be the perfect ""over-the-top"" bad guy for this sort of film, but...he is just misdirection and wasted as well.

What a wasted effort, a wasted opportunity and a waste of my time.

Letter Grade C_+: The ragtag group of soldiers were at least fun to watch (give Thomas Jane and Keegan-Michael Key their own ""buddy"" picture)!

8.0,11 August 2019,"Absolutely terrible unwatchable garbage with terrible hammy acting, seemingly random editing that left you clueless as to what was going on, CGI that's actually somehow worse that the first film's, an incomprehensible tension-free plot, obvious sets, and crass dialogue that Micheal Bay might have rejected as offensive make this one of the biggest cinematic misfires in recent history.

Seriously, this isn't hyperbole - it really is that bad. After seeing a cruddy supposed laboratory where scientists swear every 5 seconds followed by a random jump to a prison bus where the wold's weediest hard men (and Thomas Jane, whyyy??) swear every 2 seconds and make cringeworthy, fingernails-down-the-blackboard awful racially and sexually offensive jokes I simply couldn't take any more. It's genuinely the worst film I've seen in years and I only saw 15 minutes of it before giving up entirely! Worryingly, according to the brave souls on here who somehow managed to sit through the entire lot I was actually seeing by far the best of it.

It's not just disappointing like Predator 2 or Predators - or even terrible like AVP 1 and 2, it's so bad it makes the turgid and nonsensical Terminator Genysis seem a masterpiece by comparison! It's like what would happen if you gave the Wayans brothers 100 million and told them to do what they wanted with it.

The movie is so shallow, it fails to build up any atmosphere, suspense or connection to anyone or anything. The most interesting character was probably that one Predator dog.

To see a highly anticipated big screen movie with a triple A budget sets a new low benchmark record, is sad. Even the Predator fan movies you find on YouTube are qualitative way beyond this."
1.0,17 November 2018,"I have gave this movie full stars to make up for all the nostalgia snobs harshly downgrading it. No it's not anything like the original , but I enjoyed it. Some funny one liners and plenty of action, what do people expect from a comedy action movie?"
5.0,23 September 2018,"What makes the original predator so good? In my opinion it's the tension, the fear and hunt that sets the film apart from others. There are some jokes but it's still a fairly serious movie. The 2018 Predator is not scary, it never builds tension and there is little to no hunting in this film. I can't believe Shane Black made this, considering his role in the original and directorial career thus far.

There are too many characters, not enough time spent devolping a single one. The action can be fun but it's poorly choreographed. The ending is just plain silly.

The last Predator film was great, it was simple but effective. What a bummer."
2.0,29 October 2018,"Can't understand movie's plot.Though the director tried to break through as much as possible, he did not succeed.I feel that the predator is very unsuitable for making films."
10.0,23 September 2021,"an insult to the audience


Not much to say. This is just a horrible movie..."
4.0,22 September 2018,"Let me get right into it, the original Predator really had us craving to get a glimpse of the Alien monster that rarely appears and kills right behind you before you could turn around and say 'Corn'. In this movie, the 1st predator to appear is a cocky Predator that walks like a human and even has a sense of humor (seriously). Meanwhile there is an autistic child which much like the movie The Accountant, the producer seemed to make him into a super-brain. We then move on to the Super-Predator and this is when things go from bad to worse, this Super-Predator doesn't even know what cloaking is until 90% into the movie, he walks like Goldberg in WWE not giving a toss on whether people on the road have seen him or not, much to my surprise, most people didn't think much of seeing Predators around the suburbs. Even the token scientist was super glad to see one up close, her expressions was like watching a poodle from a window on-sale. If that wasn't enough corn to start a taco business, we're also introduced to a bunch of scumbags with several disabilities, both mental or physical that throw around Y-Mamma-Type jokes which had the cinema full of sad people bursting laughs."
3.0,31 October 2018,"OK, it wasn't a pile of faeces like the last the last Alien movie, but it struggled to be ho-hum. The Predator canon has been set in I and II, and there is plenty of scope to make great movies without adding a load of schoolboy sci-fi nonsense. The screenwriter(s) for this movie should never be allowed to work again.

Like the last Alien movies, I'm left wondering who the hell read that screenplay and thought ""yes, let's spend millions making this movie""? It cost me 10 quid to see this, and I want my money back."
2.0,23 September 2018,"The 1st Predator felt like a regular war movie, but then the Predator showed up and he became the enemy they had to fight. The new predator looks nothing like that. It has gone a more high tech route, but I have never been a huge fan of war movies so I appreciated the change. I am sure there are a lot of hard core fans that will not like the change. The thing that I liked best about this Predator is that it gives some more information on the Predator species, like why they are here. I recently played the previous 3 predator movies and 2 avp movies for my son and his only complaint was that after 5 movies we really had very little background on the predators, so it was nice to get some of that in this movie. This movie also has quite a bit of humor, which we enjoyed."
1.0,14 December 2018,The whole movie i felt really awkward. it embarrased the predator movies. this is the most awkward movie ever. really a bad joke.
2.0,20 September 2018,"I've got to say that this is just plain terrible , watch the original Predator with Arnold Schwarzenegger in and you'll realize how bad this film is . Including the child star into this was a big mistake , this remake should be a rared 18 at least not 15 , what a joke . The ending was so lame as well , Shane Black should hang his head in shame , considering he was in the first classic film , if he'd of watched the original again he'd of known what to make .God I want my £12 back and John Mcteirnan should have got an Oscar !"
1.0,2 February 2019,"To avoid. A poor dated film (already I know) Mental health issues, autism and ptsd are crassly represented. This is nostalgia and gore written and directed by a fan but it seems only for himself. The plot holes are vast and the action scenes underwhelming. Characters and charterization come 3rd and 4th in this movies list of priorities."
5.0,21 September 2018,"The Predator is like a spoof almost of the Predator franchise. Some half decent visual effects & great sound mixing ( I saw this in IMAX) but a terrible script by Shane Black & Fred ""RoboCop 3"" Dekker just brings the tone down. The best line of the movie for me is when Olivia Munn says ""Eat my pussy"".... what does that tell you ?"
5.0,14 May 2023,"The Predator is the worst of the Predator series of movies. The acting is mediocre at best, except for Yvonne Strahovski, who is in a minor supporting role, but does give a good performance.

Plot is wandering.

Action is gory at times, but utterly impossible at other times.

Dialogue is rotten, with meaningless quips and inane commentary. F words abound, including from a child. One character is a heavy smoker, so did some tobacco company paid for product placement?

Unsatisfactory ending, and just left me feeling like I wasted my time. 4 stars for some scenery, some good special effects, and the predator dogs which were kind of an interesting addition."
3.0,4 December 2018,"I don't know why everyone hated this movie. It had great effects, lots of Predator esk gore, and was a fun ride. Don't hate so much, If you would just sit back and take it for what it is its quite enjoyable."
3.0,17 October 2018,"Call John McTiernan, give him a suitcase full of money and scream ""HELP!!"" Why does every Predator movie suck excpect the first one? Storyline is bad, actors suck and jokes are terrible."
8.0,12 December 2018,This has to be a parody? Don't expect nothing in this film. 4 stars and i'm being generous.
1.0,17 September 2018,"I'm a predator enthusiast and was excited to finally get to watch Shane Blacks version. But that quickly turned to immense disappointment. Mr Black should hang his head low, the cast was good, even the general plot was good but Predator isn't a bullsh!t yank comedy and this is where it went disastrously wrong for me. In the original people were captivated by this superior technologically advanced Alien Lizard that hunted for sport with deadly weaponry and accuracy. There was a sense of respect and tension similar feeling when watching Alien 2. This film had none of that and a shadow of what it could have been this film was another big knock to still a potentially brilliant franchise."
3.0,7 August 2020,"The fact that I knew Shane Black wrote and directed it before I saw the film gave me a sense of excitement, but finished up thinking he should have known better. Being from the very first Predator movie I thought he would bring us a version that would finally, at the very least try and stack up to the original (which is very rarely achievable with original franchise blockbusters, albeit a few exceptions), but in the end was left disappointed. Really disappointed.

Still, if you're after a mindless, decently paced action movie where you don't want to think too much, than I suppose it delivers.....just!"
2.0,26 September 2018,Really disappointed with this film as a real fan of the story. It was like the A-Team meets the Goonies!! Truly terrible! If this is the way the franchise is going........No Thanks!
4.0,20 September 2018,"Although not the best Predator movie it was still a fun action packed alien movie. The aline technology weapons were cool and some good CGI in the movie. I saw this movie at Harkins Cine 1 in full Adobe Atmos sound and the it was awesome. Although a few parts in the movie lacked flow with the story overall it was still good if you like the Predatory movies. I was happy to see them all come out in 4K recently and I bought them all. I just wish the vs. Alien movies came out in 4K as one of those was my favorite in the whole series.

I'm shocked by all the bad (1 star) reviews that were undeserved. If you like the Predator movies go see it and enjoy it."
1.0,5 January 2019,

1.0,13 September 2019,"This has to be one of the worst films I've ever seen.

If you love the Predator films, do not watch it. Or, just completely forget about it if you ever watch it.

Acting, terrible. Plot, terrible. CGI, terrible.

PLEASE DON'T WATCH THIS FILM!"
3.0,9 November 2020,"Far to many jokes to be taken serious at all, I enjoyed a comedy all the time, but not in this capacity, I still found myself laughing here and there, but that's all. First off I absolutely love the look and design of the fugitive predator just amazing, actor in the suit just fantastic super badass, then 💩 hits the fan with the stupid CGI upgrade predator, that is stronger and faster, the predator was already wow enough, and Shane Black creates this ungodly abomination, the predator is an unstoppable killing machine, but whatever. I still found the movie enjoyable enough but for what was already stated by others, that all I got the other movies did it far better and are superior to this one."
1.0,19 September 2019,There is something wrong in absolutely every single scene. It has to be up there with Howard the Duck. I could make a better movie with my phone can and a jar of dolmeo.
4.0,21 September 2018,"Hopefully no spoilers here. If you have seen a trailer you can read this. The movie is a fun ride. Story flow was quick. However considering the scenario and why they arrive on the planet this shouldn't be a surprise.

Hilarious. I expected some laughs, the cast set that up but it was the ease of comedic moments that was enjoyable the cast was certainly comfortable while filming.

Scary. Not as much as I would have liked. This movie did have less of the horror element. I suppose after 30 years, and the Predator exposure the creature itself doesn't hold that scare factor it used to. Being said. It behaved like a badass in turn. That seemed to be choiceful knowing it's hard to recreate the vibe the original presented.

The suit. Incredible. What you can do with practical effects, suits and such is top notch today. Especially when the original crew is still involved!

CGI. It's pretty clear which moment were designed. It wasn't the quality that did that you can just tell based on story moments. One criticism regarding for it to me goes to the larger predator. I think they oversized him causing the use of CGI to be necessary to move the story. The creature was too polished imo I thought he could have been a bit rougher in appearance especially with the background information involved..

All in all I can never get back the creepy horror vibe that was present in the original two films. Thats why people feel as they do. Original films are moments in your life. You compare because your hoping to recreate that feeling. Don't watch this with that focus in mind. Its 2018 in a super hero fueled world I think attempting to make this creature that terrifying would be a misstep. Lastly, slower pacing would have been a help. Again, the plot of the movie is covering a singular event. Being that it's not a multi week style of story where days pass will help you understand the pacing. What was appreciated was that its not edited this way to trick you. The film knows its story pace and its straight forward about it. Go see this and have fun."
3.0,4 December 2018,Watched this film on a plane yesterday. I want that 1h 47min of my life back. Terribly contrived. Giving it 2 stars because it had some pretty good special effects. But that's about it.
8.0,22 September 2018,"Big fan of the predator as the movies go, but this movie wasn't what I was hoping for. Good to see the predator again, he look good but the storyline was poor for me. I think it's time for Hollywood to come up with something new as they keep killing old good movies. Shame"
1.0,15 September 2018,
1.0,5 May 2019,"Absolutely awful. Writers and directors have no idea what a predator film is supposed to be, and don't seem to be very intelligent either. You'd think this film was made by monkeys. Studio should be ashamed for letting it be made and treating a franchise this badly."

5.0,9 November 2018,"I was not a big fan of the 1st couple predator flicks, but I must say this new one had me pinned from start to finish. The story was fresh, Great writing, Great cast and the FX had me going WO throughout start to finish. I'm a Si-Fi junkie and PREDARTOR 2018 easily made it into my top ten. I recommend this movie to all, (16+) just make sure you have your drinks and snacks before it starts cause you won't find a dull moment anywhere !"
1.0,2 December 2018,Don't waste your time with this piece of s**t Arnie should have won an Oscar for the original.. and that's being sarcastic. I was drinking a Bailey's with whiskey while watching this dross and I think I sobered up in disbelief!!!
8.0,7 October 2018,"I'm not a fan of predator but I've saw the 1987's movie with Arnold and always said that without him the movie wouldn't be the same, turns out I was right. The story itself sounds interasting but that's it, the story, cause afterwads you only see a movie with bunch of pyrotechnique and special effects. The actors/characters are so bad that even forced me to leave the cinema when it got to the half (Time where you get to pee.) Don't watch unless... You have ABSOLUTELY nothing to do in your life."

3.0,23 September 2018,"Bad. This film had a couple good lines and scenes but overall it was just dull, boring movie. Simply trying to continually capitalize on the first. Let it, like the creature, die."
3.0,22 September 2018,"I am a huge Predator fan. I like the movie because it is a different take on the franchise. Before there were professionally trained groups making contact with the HUNTER Alien, now just imagine a group of family oriented battle fatigued , PTSD challenged veterans with nothing to lose banding together to help a fellow soldier take on a formidable creature. Just imagine what it takes to run towards gun fire or into a burning building. Give the movie a chance and keep an open mind."
5.0,21 August 2019,"I seriously hope they don't consider this movie canon in case they make another Predator movie in the future.

The story is weak. The actors tried their hardest, and sometimes the movie is kind of funny, but that's it. It's not scary, it's not cool, and it's not clever. The decision to make the Yautjas themselves be CGI instead of practical effects just added insult to injury.

Two stars, because it's not the worst movie ever. But it's definitely the worst Predator movie i've ever seen or even heard of."
5.0,26 January 2019,"Saw it 3 times. I found it very well written, acted, loved the humor in it. I really don't understand why ppl rated it so low. CGI is perfect, pay close attention to the actors expressions, emotion conveyed in their eyes and minute facial expressions (saw it 3 times) and they are so believable and rich, the ""loonies"" were awesome - great chemistry from all actors actually. I felt connected to the story and liked the characters right away. Id love a sequel to that particular story and that always coming back alien dog! I watch frequently over 30 hours of movies each week ,and I am very selective, so for me this is really well made movie. I definitely appreciated it more with second and third viewing. P.S. saw Valerian 3 times too, as comparison, stunning CGI, acting ...well not so much, the director needed to push the main actors a bit more. So many flat delivered lines ugh!, The Fifth Element is just SPECTACULAR so I know he is a great director.... Don't write this movie off! If you really want to see garbage try Mamma Mia 1 or 2 (equally bad)! I know different genre (just for the sake of variety), watch it with your girlfriend! Her reactions will tell you allot about who she is.....The question remains how do you get incredible actors to forget how to act!"
1.0,28 October 2020,"I was waiting for a new Predator sequel for a long time. When they announced Shane Black and Fred Dekker, I thought, ""Cool. The Monster Squad is awesome. Surely Shane knows what he is doing considering he is IN the first movie. He must understand the tone."" Wow, was I wrong. Its like he never even saw Predator. Its so bad. Just. So. Bad. Nothing works in this movie, and there are so many bad ideas. Bad decisions. Its just horrible really. So sad. Alien and Predator are my favorite franchises and they just keep getting worse. I would lump this in with the AVP movies because it feels more in line with that series than it does Predator....Which was made for adults. This feels like a weird kids movie. The writing is for kids...but it has too much swearing and blood to actually be a kids movie. It has no audience. I really wish someone else had made this movie. There are so many better ideas out there for a Predator movie."

4.0,11 November 2018,"I say ONE because another should be The Meg but ok now ""The Predator"" is pure garbage this is how a franchise can crash heavy against the floor and leave no survivors at all. From the classic Arnie's Predator (classic 80' awsome film) to Glover Predator 2 (good sequel) to Brody's Predators (good but not great just entertaining) to downhills like AvP (just entertaining but not good enough) to gargabe AvP: Requiem i agree with most of the critics who are sayin that compare to this AvP: Requiem is a masterpiece. Complete nonsense storyline, luaghs (laughs?!?!? This is supossed to be scifi and scary at moments) to complete waste of time in my life and i dont understand the cast is pretty awsome i mean we have Sterling K. Brown (This Is Us, American Crime Story), Boyd Hollbrook (Narcos), Thomas Jane!!! (1922, The Mist, The Punisher, etc.), babe hottie Olivia Munn (yeah i like girls) i dont undertand (maybe money convinced them to make the movie) seriously avoid like the plague if you want a parody/comedy watch it if you want to see THE REAL predator watch Predator, Predator 2 and Predators the rest is pure garbage (AvP, AvP: Requiem and this one).

I give it 1/10 because there's no 0 or negative numbers but seriously dont go the cinemas its a waste of time nor download it via internet to watch or rent it just forget it... THSI NEVER HAPPENED

Thanks"
5.0,19 October 2018,Absolutely love the predator franchise.. quite happily watch any of them in all honesty... but this!!! It's hard to describe just how bad and ridiculous this movie is.. there's atleast a dozen scenes where I've literally laughed out loud at how stupid it was! Why does the black fella chain smoke constantly throughout the film??? Why do we have subtitles when the predator speaks?? It's a disgrace really..

In short bursts, there are signs of competence, but then there is no connection to the next segment.

Interesting premise which is not followed through on."

1.0,19 July 2024,"Not just wasted my time watching this but also a torture. The characters were all scripted so bad it's hard to not hate any of them.

The entire movie had no good sequence. The humor did not blend in and was very badly written. You would want to skip this movie so that it will not spoil the entire franchise for you.

This is a missed opportunity for the director. Not sure what genre this movie falls into humor? But definitely not horror.

Do yourself a favor and skip this movie. Rewatch the original one instead.

The trailer gave a lot of hints but I was hoping it would be any different.

WORST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!"

Good special fx and that is the ONLY reason it gets 2 stars."
1.0,24 February 2019,"Although I do enjoy the original film, the Predator franchise has never been a huge favorite of mine. It does have a lot of elements my wee brain enjoys as a franchise, and yet I have never really been able to attach myself to the handful of films that are under the Predator banner. The Predator is not going to help that either.

I am not sure about the backroom issues on this film, all I know is that it is a mess of characters, plots and a need too make it into a bankable franchise. The Predator is really all over the place, trying to move fast enough to outrun your ability to comprehend what's going on, lest you figure out its all a sham. See, a predator comes to Earth with a MacGuffin that he wants to give to the human race. Instead, he decides to murder any soldier he comes across instead of surrendering the thing and getting along with the people he is trying to save. When a second taller Predator shows up to wreak havoc the movie is over halfway done and I had stopped caring long ago. This movie needed to calm down. It needed to focus on one set of characters that could be built out and cared about. I mean there is like three villains, four ex-wives, one autistic child, a sniper team, an evil organization, two scientists, a set of crazy ex-soldiers, and the main character to introduce in the first thirty minutes alone. All this in an attempt to make this a franchise. Which also means having a bunch of loose ends for the sequel. Concentrate on making a solid first film then expand. Part one needs to stand on its own or there is no hope for your part two.

Anyways, I know that was more of a rant, but I was a bit annoyed that a movie about alien hunters from space with a good budget and director was so damn dull and such a mess. Unless you're a huge fan, skip this."
3.0,8 August 2019,"What a waste of time, very disappointed, was hoping for a true predator movie, this is definitely not. Poor script, poor directing. Mr.Blake shame on you."
2.0,21 September 2018,"This is not a masterpiece. But this genuinely was one of the most fun films I've seen in a long time. Action and genuinely funny comedy which I think was a homage to the banter the guys had from the first film.

At first I thought it was one of the weakest in the franchise until I watched them over the next couple of days. Predator 2 was way worse. I hope the nerds (which I am too lol) don't ruin the future of this franchise with their low ratings and unfair feedback."

3.0,1 December 2018,
1.0,11 November 2018,"Where to begin? Maybe the truth. Objectively, this movie is bad. It felt like watching Blade 3 with the lame puns and characters so over the top that it's impossible to imagine any other life for them than their time in this movie. You don't feel for them. Not afraid that they'll die, not excited that they'll die, it is almost intriguing as how characters can be so weirdly written. The only thing I felt something every time it showed up was the last Predator's dog.

Then something happens. The realization that this movie is a stereotype of stereotypes sets in, and it actually becomes fascinating. Maybe it's because the director/writer is none other than Lethal Weapon writer and Predator (1987) actor Shane Black. But why is it so cliche for someone who made Iron Man 3, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and The Nice Guys? Why every detail has to be left for a few seconds on the screen to make sure people noticed them? After the fascination comes the doubt, trying to make sense of the nonsensical actions of the characters, the kind of environmental friendly plot, the 4 opposite powers (I'm good, you're bad. I'm bad? I'm good. You're bad, you're good) and sooo many details that do not add up to anything. Doubting about if this is a joke or not, and the predator will wake up in its bed, realizing that it was all a dream, then turning on his pillow, looking at the stars through his window and falling back asleep to decimated planets and cross breeding species.

After almost 2 hours, you're left with the feeling that you missed something. Maybe it's the 2h you won't be able to get back, or the fact that this movie actually was profitable. But still, this voice in your head is making you wonder if you should watch it again or if one time was already too much. My conclusion is that if you have 2h to lose and a few friends to drag in this train wreck : you'll have a good time."
1.0,18 September 2018,"So I'll make this short and sweet, it doesn't bring anything really new to the Predator series except for the twist at the end (which I thought would go in an entirely different direction) but it's a fun movie. If you're looking for a blockbuster in every film you see you're going to be disappointed 90% of the time. If you're just looking for some action, some explosions, some sci-fi and another chapter to a popular franchise, then go see it."

8.0,29 November 2018,"Horrible story writing full of extremely cheese and downright magical turn of events where things just happen even when they don't make any logical sense. Acting is mediocre and sometimes just embarrassing where some actors forget their characters have autism and other characters are just irrational and plain stupid. There is no horror of people being hunted down by an enigmatic alien hunter and there is no suspense, despair nor fear. Quite frankly there is nothing about this movie which is actually good because even jokes are at best mediocre.

Predator 2018 is a bad SciFi action-comedy and a bullet destroying Predator franchise."

1.0,19 December 2018,"Big fan of the original and I found this one quite entertaining. Considering how bad movies are these days, this one was OK. Apparently I was the only one who did like it. I know it had a lot of Hollywood nonsense, but don't they all. I may watch it again."
5.0,7 December 2018,"It started off so well for the first 15-20 mins and it just degraded into a cesspool of bad CGI, poor acting, forced jokes and cheesy lines. I was thrilled to see names like Jake Busey, Thomas Jane and Yvonne Strahovski. but they had so little screen time.

Now I understand why this had the comedy tag in it. Do not walk in expecting a sci-fi epic like the 1987 original, look at it as a fan made parody of the predator franchise.

Even the avp duology was far more entertaining and watchable; which by the way is saying a LOT.

Original music score should not have been allowed to be wasted on this abhorrent mess. Shane, you are a direct to dvd director, accept that please."

4.0,17 September 2018,"Given how many sequels/prequels we've received for the Alien series, it surprises me that we hadn't received as many movies from another creature from space movie, Predator. It's been a while since I'd seen the original 1987 movie, but it was a fun survival story staring Arnold Schwarzenegger that had a very cool, well-designed killing machine. It was also unique to see an alien that came to Earth not to conquer or even destroy all the humans, but was there just for sport. Name another movie in which aliens are hunting just for their own enjoyment.

Unlike the Alien series, which has continued to rank in large box office grossings, Predator has had a rougher path. Predator 2, Predators, and even the crossover Alien Vs. Predator have all failed to generate much critical phrase, cult following, or even profits. Maybe the idea of the creature only had enough steam for one movie. Perhaps people wanted something similar to the first movie. But regardless, you'd think that with the extra push from nostalgia that Hollywood studios have done would have brought the Predator back sooner. This time, not only do we have a new sequel, but Shane Black writing and directing (who was also in the original Predator). Lets see if The Predator can crack the code for a good sequel.

Army Ranger Quinn McKenna (played by Boyd Holbrook) witnesses a predator ship crash landing. Though he manages to injure and take part of it's armor, both are captured by government agent Will Traeger (played by Sterling K. Brown for study. Quinn is sent to a VA psychiatric hospital to be hidden away while government scientists try to study a subdued Predator. Unfortunately, the alien wakes up and fights his way out, with only Will and biologist Dr. Casey Bracket (played by Olivia Munn).

Meanwhile, Quinn's autistic son Rory (played by Jacob Tremblay) struggles to fit in and fears he'll be bullied for life. On the same day as Halloween, he receives a package from his dad, which contains a predator helmet (for safekeeping).

While being transported on a bus with a group of loony soldiers, Quinn and the guys escape when the same predator attacks. They all manage to get to the small town where Quinn's family is unaware that Rory went trick or treating with the predator helmet. The race is on to take down this predator and a possible bigger one that may explain the need for the alien's human hunting.

Shane Black happens to be one of my favorite writer/directors today, as he not only knows how to write funny dialogue, but also knows how to make great kid characters. The bad news is that The Predator fails at generating a cohesive story nor evolve the predator aliens. As you can see from the description, the story goes all over the map. What makes even the worst Predator movies still work is that it's a simple story of people against a predator. Here, we have government conspiracies, conspiracies among the aliens, the kid possibly being powerful and still trying to make it an entertaining action movie.

Speaking of which, the characters are entertaining. Boyd Holbrook, Jacob Tremblay, Olivia Munn, Sterling K. Brown all play people that each have their arcs, funny moments and even badass moments. I also give a lot of points for the group of soldiers that Boyd teams up with that also have Keegan-Michael Key and Thomas Jane. They all get a lot of great lines and have dialogue that seems like something of group of immature men would have without coming off too obnoxious.

Once these characters are thrown against the predator, the movie does become a lot of fun to watch. The action is shot well and the predator is an impressive mix of practical and CGI. It's only when they try to make it all a part of something bigger. So why does that work in Alien and not here? I think it has to do with the fact that while we came to the alien and discovered it, the predator came to us and seems more in it for their personal enjoyment. Perhaps someone does know what to do, but I have a hard time making this a major franchise.

I'll give this five predator helmets out of ten. The movie may be insane and all over the place, I certainly had fun watching it and might even watch it again if given the chance. It only get points off for having story elements that are either too complicated or don't work at all. I can't imagine someone hating this, but it won't have the same cult status as the original. At least that has a Schwarzenegger yelling, ""Get to the Choppa!"""
8.0,6 July 2019,"I only enjoyed about three scenes or so, I won't describe them, but were basically gore action bits that worth the 5 of 10 I'm giving. The story is terrible, the characters are terrible, the dialog is always forcing silly and tiring comedy out of stupid characters... The cinematography is not great, the CGI looks bad most of the times... Seriously, when I saw the trailer I knew this would be bad, then the reviews came but I never thrust them, I still gave it a chance, but there's no way I can even say ""this is not as bad as they say"", because it is. Huge disappointment, not that I expected this one to be good, but a waste of a new Predators movie. On top of it, the ending shows the intention of a sequel, but that actually should have happened on the second act of the movie and developed the idea for the third act, that could have saved the movie, but they were already thinking about selling another movie... greedy and stupid. I don't think there will be a sequel to this mess, it's a big direction fail."
1.0,6 October 2018,"I was expecting this film to be not much but entertaining, I wasn't expecting it to be good at all, but this film is unwatchable. If your familiar with the franchise it is not bad but not the greatest either. But the predator killed the franchise for good. RIP Predator"
2.0,16 October 2018,"Predator (1987) is one of my favorite action movies ever. I thought the sequel was pretty good too and I even enjoyed the first Aliens vs Predator.

I never understood the hate for Predators. It was moody, atmospheric and had some good actors in it. Only letdown for me was the Noland character, but hey - you can't have them all.

Another thing I never understood was the hate that Shane Black received for his take on Iron Man in Iron Man 3. I'm into comics and I know about The Mandarin's origins, however I thought it was pretty original to be honest.

HOWEVER, after watching 'The Predator' it suddenly became all to clear to me. He took something beloved, tried to be original but ended up failing so hard on all fronts."
2.0,11 December 2018,People might think I'm crazy or got bad taste in movie for saying this but I actually very enjoyed The Predator for what it is.I know Predator 1987 is a classic and I wholeheartedly respect anyone that prefer the movie over this one but the truth need to be told that In the original whenever The Predator not in the scene I always end up yawning and tired even though I'm not even tired or sleepy so to see the presence of The Predator from start to finish in this movie is a real feast for the eyes.It definitely not intense or nerve wracking like the original which in my opinion one of the downside of the movie but it make up back with the back and forth of the group of ex soldier and the ultimate Predator.I really love to see how the franchise continue from this one especially with the Predator Killer suit in the end so I hope the studio and director Shane Black can get pass all the criticism and make a sequel
2.0,29 November 2018,"I have watched all Predator and AVP movies, this is close to the bottom.

Good:Action, there is plenty of action steadily throughout the movie, it does not slow down. Bad: Inconsistentency, lame attempts at comedy, complete disregard to science, bad directing, no time/space logic, etc.

Examples: guns with endless bullets, normal people doing Captain America level of jumps and no physical damage, people thrown 30 feet away and get up without even a scratch or a broken ankle, endless jokes that are not funny nor benefits the story, worst parenting and billion dollar facilities that has less security than my porch screen door(not an exaggeration).

This movie is on level of Street Fighter(remember) or the GI Joe movies. If you enjoyed them, you could possibly watch this."

9.0,24 October 2018,"I walked into ""The Predator"" not expecting much, the trailers marketed the film like an action film, with sprinklings of comedy throughout, it looked to be a fun turn your brain off type adventure. However, I was not hugely excited for this film. Come time for me to sit down and watch it in the cinema and well. It was not very entertaining. First off, the humour. Dear god the humour. Now don't get me wrong I love some humour in films. When done right and sparely. This type of humour however was another beast entirely.

Let's start with the positives, shall we? The opening scene was very well done it got me hooked on the film instantly. The performances by Boyd Holbrook and Olivia Munn are two of the few positives I can squeeze out of this blood-soaked stone. No sooner that I was hooked, the hook instantly let me go after that scene. Afterwards it's a bit of mess, if I'm honest. The hook never came back and from that point onwards the film, unfortunately fails flat on its face for the rest of the runtime. Onto my pervious point the humour as soon as the main character steps into that bus seen in the trailers. The train derails and the film lost me completely. The jokes come thick and fast and as others have said in their own reviews, it feels like a comedy. I'm honestly strongly inclined to agree with them at this point. The jokes feel out of place, yes a few enlisted a chuckle out of me every once and awhile, but otherwise for me the humour missed the mark miserably on multiple occasions.

In addition, the predator was not all that threatening at all. Especially when pitted with a new version of its species, nether or which give any scares or well-timed frights. It honestly feels like a hybrid of an action comedy with the name ""The Predator"" slapped onto it for marketing and for ticket sales sake. The characters, unfortunately suffer because of the clashing of genres. This is especially true in the character development department. No one in the cast list get basically any character development at all. I learned nothing new about Munn's or Holbrook's character by the ending and that my friends is a wasted opportunity. The main group in the film are referred to as and I'm not joking here ""The Loonies"". This is where for me the brunt of the issues crop up. These characters were not funny, at all. Like Halbrook and Munn's character before they are all are about as funny as sharp nails going across a chalkboard and have about as much development as a wet sponge.

In conclusion should you go see this film? Only if you really want to and are a huge fan of the Predator. But otherwise. I personally would not recommend it to a friend.

5.0,5 June 2021,"I'm not sure why this film was called 'The Predator' as it's in no way a remake of the first one. I'm no film making expert but I think something went wrong with the editing ...I saw it on tv so wondered if it had been cut for tv badly but reading the reviews apparently it was like this in cinemas too. Bit's were missing, one character would ask another if they were ok after they show pain, you'd expect an answer but then it cuts to the next scene and that character is fine. There's lots of examples of cutting to new scenes and not explaining what's happened in the last.

One of the main characters is a child. Why do this in a very adult film? If you're an adult who's spent all day with kids I'm sure the last thing you want to see is more when you're trying to relax. There are thousands of Disney films with kids, if I want to see them I'll watch one of those.

The film seemed to 'start' very quickly, no intrigue or suspense.

Positives. There is some humour and the CGI is ok. There are some new elements and good differences. If you like science fiction it's worth a watch but prepare to be confused."

1.0,6 May 2021,"Olivia Munn is so uncharismaric in this movie, it actually made me feel pain. The dialogs are just stupid with no real point. Many plot holes.

Predator movies were great and just trying to continue this series was just bad idea. But if you are someone that never watched Predator before, it is a okay movie but some of the action scenes are not that great. It just shows typical action moves and cheesy lines and actions. But it is a movie that you will hate after you watch older Predator movie so if you never watched old predator movies before, you can watch it but if you are a Predator fan, DON""T"
1.0,3 January 2019,"I usually start my reviews with a history of the film and my history of the film. But not doing this review. I'll tell you right now I am a huge fan of The Predator series. Mainly the first one and its sequel. They are both action 80's/90's staples for me. I personally think Predator 2 doesn't get enough love. I was all on board for this Predator film. Shane Black was co-writing with Fred Dekker. They got a very interesting cast including Trevante Rhodes, Jacob Tremblay, Keegan-Michael Key, Olivia Munn, Sterling K. Brown, Thomas Jane, and Yvonne Strahovski. But no, this film is not the action suspense horror film we all hoped. This is an over the top gruesome action..comedy? Yes, an action comedy.

The story is as follows, a rogue predator with alien tech comes to earth and his tech ends up in the hands of an autistic young boy, Tremblay, who accidentally summons the deadly beings to earth. The only people that can stop them are a scientist (Munn) and a group of ex-mercenaries with problems (the whole rest of the cast including lead (?) Boyd Holbrook). What follows is a mess of violent actions scene, cringe in the most awful offensive way humor and some really bad CGI. Not even Brown can save this with his over the top but entertaining human villain.

I'm shocked that this came from the minds that brought us The Monster Squad, The Nice Guys, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, and Lethal Weapon. The story is flat. I honestly didn't care about what they were doing at all. I really was hoping to follow this ragtag bunch as they try to take down the Predator, as in the original. But there is no suspense. You know from the opening that not many people are gonna make it out. Even though Black and Dekker give each character a trait, they don't dive deep enough for me. Cut the cast down and have a few of these guys get some real moments.

Holbrook for me was a low rent, Charlie Hunnam or Garrett Hedlund. Either would have been much better in this role. Rhodes is wasted here. The man can act, give him something more meaty to chew into. Key and Jane have the best chemistry of the bunch. But we all know their fate once they come on screen. Munn seems like she's bored. She was much more fun in X-Men: Apocalypse (another bad sci-fi action sequel). The only one seems to be having any fun is Brown. His military character is brash, violent, funny and has some of the films best lines.

The issue that I had that took most offense with me was the comedy. The film tries to hard to be funny. It's not. The jokes all but a very few fall flat. The comedic moments seem forced and awkward. The funniest moment sadly is this very offensive exchange in a hotel between Munn and Jane's character. It seems like Black is still stuck in the '80s. Writing lines with the mindset all school action characters. That just doesn't fly today. It seems like FOX rushed the film to the finish line with the FX. Some of them looked laughably bad. The predator dogs or that end battle stand out in my head. Take some time, they should look real and terrifying.

I just don't understand how this came out so awful. With all the talent they had in front and behind the camera, where did it go? Was everyone just there for a paycheck? It couldn't have been that great with everyone in the cast. I think FOX needs to sit on this franchise indefinitely. Along with Alien: Covenant, FOX's two biggest franchise names outside of the Marvel properties, should get the vault treatment for a long time. Until the company is willing to spend the money on quality talent to takes these franchises in a direction. Shane Black (maybe) to stick in his own playpen instead of playing with other people's toys. Because when he's making his own film they shine, this doesn't."
2.0,27 December 2018,"If you're looking for an adrenaline ride, this movie ain't it. It isn't scary and there aren't a lot of tense moments. That being said, it WAS entertaining. There was some great humor, the actors all put in solid performances, and stuff got blown up. If you're looking for an oscar-quality film you obviously aren't going to try the 27th installment of a franchise that was cheesy from the get go. If you're looking to enjoy some popcorn in an easy chair, this was great fun."

2.0,4 October 2018,"I was really excited for this movie. I love Shane Black and he has made and written some great films, he also starred in the original 'Predator'. So I thought he would know how to properly handle this story. At first glance, the cast looked really good as well. However, this movie has genuinely baffled me.

This movie is a gigantic mess and for a lot of the movie, all sense and logic are thrown out the window. This doesn't feel like a Shane Black movie and I think the studio has got their fingers in and meddled a bit. There was extensive reshoots done for the third act of the film and it is glaringly obvious.

There are no characters in this film, only shells of characters who have little quirks so we can tell them apart. They joke and laugh about being in the intense situations that they are in. This leads to the film having zero tension. Compare this to McTiernan's original, all of the characters were scared, and that lead to the audience caring about what happened to the characters.

The actors are trying their best and they have good charisma with each other but the dialogue is just so awful at times. The movie actually started out promising, for the first 20 minutes it was pretty decent. However, after a character says ""get to the choppa's"" early on, the film goes downhill fast. I also found really shocking was how bad the CGI was at times, it was embarrassing for 2018.

If I had seen this movie by myself I don't think I would've enjoyed the experience as much as I did. I saw it with a friend and at points in the film, I just couldn't breathe. I had tears rolling down my face because we were in uncontrollable fits of laughter at how stupid something was. The laughter didn't even stop when the movie finished because there was so much that went wrong in the film.

This movie is terrible and was really disappointing for me, but for some strange reason I can't not recommend it to a group of friends who don't really care for watching the greatest film ever made and are looking for a laugh.

The continuity of this franchise is pretty awful but hopefully Prey is a bit of a sign it can get back on track. Watching this with my son who is a fan of these type of movies, even he found errors with pieces of the storyline and how ridiculous it was at times.

Would have been better to carry on from the predecessor Predators. It was a better film and was closer to the original roots of the franchise. This movie is semi fun if your a fan of the franchise, but also if your a fan its extremely disappointing. The lead is weak compared to prior protagonists in the series and isnt believable as a bad ass sniper. Watch it if you want , but id stick to prior films for better predator action and story.

8.0,26 September 2018,"For starters, expect a Predator action movie. If you liked the previous ones, you will like this, it's more of the same. If you want it to be like the first, or better than the rest, then maybe you shouldn't. They can't replicate the horror of the first, the mystery of the Predators was uncovered and now the movies are about expanding the lore and getting cool kills and action sequences with some laughs at the side, which the movie delivers, just like the first and second one did, but the movie Predators had too little of.

It is in many ways much like the first one, if it had focused more on action. It has the strange and very different characters that doesn't get much background, and the movie's story instead focuses on the Predators, expanding the lore, which I enjoy very much, except for the sometimes heavy exposition. Although it does focus on the kid for some time in the movie, not long, so even if you don't like it, I feel it's easy to watch and get through.

Can recommend for Predator fans that enjoyed the whole series, not for those which only liked the first."

The predator is also bigger and much more fierce, and that makes it more engaging.

3.0,2 February 2019,I'm the biggest fan of predator and when I heard Shane Black was doing this film I was excited and thought it couldn't go wrong. Unfortunately it did. It ended up being more of a action comedy and completely disregarded the horror aspects the first two films had where you as a viewer was on the edge of your seat praying the characters could escape spines intact. This film did not give you that feeling and felt more like it could of been made by Disney. As a film it was entertaining but as a die hard fan it was a let down. If they make another predator film down the line I hope they take more influence from the comics or AVP games (not the films) and bring back that old school horror/action vibe this one missed.
2.0,14 September 2018,"Disappointing additon to the Predator franchise. The film makers put action high on the list, and put storyline and plot near the bottom. Parts of the movie are just plain confusing and the characters reactions to meeting a deadly alien are silly. As a consequence the movie lacks tension and you don't really feel connected to any of the characters.

Wait for it to appear on TV is my recommendation."

I was well and truely warned about this film so at least I had a heads up, I honesty don't know what to say it's made a mockery of the 87 classic and as all the other reviews already say it makes the dismal AVP look pretty good!!

Who will pick up the pieces after this disaster is beyond me and we may have just seen the last of one of SCI-FI's greatest creation for some time.

I can't believe that Predator 2 (1990) is rated 6.3 on IMDB at the moment, when this is 5.8. That movie is a masterpiece comparing to this utter garbage. You know a movie is bad when Keegan-Michael Key is pretty much the best thing about it."

It's very cartoonish in a lot of ways. Whereas the original Predator had a great story line and interesting characters, this has neither.

10.0,12 April 2019,"How do you make a movie this terrible?

There's a lot of people involved, doesn't anyone go ""Guys, I've got a bad feeling about this...""

The plot makes no sense at all, not in a Predator classic ""turn your brain off and enjoy the ride"" kind of no sense but in an ""even with my brain turned off, that makes NO SENSE"" no sense. The tone is a weird mix of Mercury Rising, the Hangover and the Goonies with a little Iron Man twist at the end which presumably hopes to lay the groundwork for a sequel. Please don't.

The music is a $5 download of ""Great Movie Moods #37"" presumably so they could save money to CGI a comedy alien dog. That's not a joke, there's a CGI alien dog that is played for laughs. In a Predator movie. Savour that thought.

The actors seem a nice bunch but it's really hard to tell if they can act. You could put Tom Hanks in this and still come away wondering if he had the range to carry a big part.

The cruellest bits are the back references to the original Predator. I guess the Director has issues with his time on the movie because it's not enough for him just to rip apart the memory, he has to pick through the shards, find each classic moment and grind it to dust."
1.0,28 November 2018,"This was a bad movie. Not the worst movie I have ever seen but its definitely near the bottom for Predator franchise. Actually I am not sure I would call this Predator. It has none of the atmosphere. It felt more like Transformers with some overwhelming bad guy that gets beaten by silly childish means. Its more of a movie for young teens but given the gore and language its clearly targeted at adults.

Anyway, I hate to see people lose their jobs over hard work but sometimes a bad product needs to sink a business in order for it to be replaced by something better. That is the case for this franchise and movie. I hope if fails if for no other reason that investors and businesses do better work in the future."

1.0,14 September 2018,"I must say that the hype were watered down by the mediocre trailers leading to the premier of this movie so I went to the cinema with a mild expectations, and sad to say, the original Predator is still unsurpassed to this day. The movie was flat and bland, and the action scenes wasn't really that impressive and lacks the suspense and thrill that really put the audience at the edge of their seats. The tagline of the movie, is that ""you don't see it coming"".......but I can predict the plot and outcome from miles away. I could understand that Shane Black wants to stick to the recipe that make the original Predator so successful, to the point that he kept the same intro, same score and crew dynamics, but all these elements somewhat fail to connect with today's sci-fi audience anymore. In the first movie, there's always a sense of curiosity from the viewers as none of us know what the Predator looks like and what are the creature's weaponry and characteristics, but now that we are armed with that knowledge, the hype of the Predator no longer flow inside the movie. The humour were over injected and you don't really feel for any of the characters. Boyd Holbrook's character McKenna was weak and definitely doesn't look like a certified bad ass. Truth to be told, this movie feels like an action movie from the late 90s, and perhaps this is what Shane Black wanted all along.

The Predator franchise has so much potential to become an action packed sci fi blockbuster, but sad to say, no director has been able to take the franchise further after the first two movies. I'm still hoping that one day, Hollywood will come up with a epic Predator movie which explores their homeworld or maybe in a medieval or ancient Japan setting, cause that will really reignite my interest in the franchise again."

1.0,31 January 2019,"This movie was supposed to recon and breathe new life into a dying franchise, and being written in part and directed by Shane Black, it was expected to be everything that we fell in love with back in 87. Regrettably, due to clear studio interference, like it happened to Justice League, the movie turned out to be an incoherent mess, where there are clearly scenes missing, characters that dissappear, never to be heard of again and some truly outrageous dialogue which is clearly not on par with Black's screenwriting abilities. There some salvageable moments, it's got a kick ass start but after that, it falls short of delivering on what it promised. Weak CGI, bland plot and awful editing makes this one of the worst movies of 2018. Not even its very competent cast, Sterling K Brown does a solid turn as a very nasty military commander, can salvage this huge mess of a movie. Very disappointing"

This movie was like a space alien parody without being funny whatsoever. After watching ""The Predator"" you'll feel like you've watched a silly action movie from the 90's to only remember that this was seriously filmed in 2917/2018.

Kind of weird that we didn't have a montage of the hero bulking up for the boss fight!!

You'll think what did I just watch and where did the last two hours of my life go? What life choices did I make to end up in this situation will be the questions that run through your mind after watching this gem.

Sure, if you are a long time fan of the predators, you might not like this movie at all, you might be disappointed in the end that it didnt took anything seriously. But it's directed by Shane Black, right? His portfolio of directing isn't that large but most of them are comedies. The first hour of the movie is great, well directed action, dialogues and a plot that might seem common but for some reasons it stands out better in this movie (maybe because it has ""space aliens with space dogs"". I personally enjoyed the heck out this movie, I had little expectations from it but it's a good time waster if you are in a bad mood. The jokes are by far the best I've ever heard, Thomas Jane and Keegan Michael Key made the best on screen combo here. It's annoying that almost all the characters take the situation with humour, they dont fear that they might die and this might upset most of the people. The CGI is well made, the big ass predators looks so veridic and somethimes you forget that you're watching a man in a suit (probably). All in all, I enjoyed this one, it's not the best in the series but sure not the worst. Ignore the haters that are trashing this."

Lines, although sometimes seemingly deliberate, were too horrible. Characters were just faces with names attached. What a waste of capable cast.

1.0,21 September 2018,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)

I never truly enjoyed the Predator franchise. The first one was fine, but the next installments were really bad (and don't make me talk about the AvP movies). However, Shane Black is an extremely capable director, and he already proved himself with several amazing films (The Nice Guys, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and he wrote the screenplay for Lethal Weapon). So, I was slightly hopeful that he could change this saga into something more interesting.

Unfortunately, not only he wasn't able to do it, but he delivers one of his worst movies. Honestly, I have no idea how such a successful director can film a movie like this. Terrible cinematography (it became a trademark of the franchise), incredibly choppy editing and such a dull story. There are so few action sequences and the hunt that the film promises only starts in the third act.

The other two acts are a failed attempt to build characters so the audience can care about them, but their script is so flat and depthless that I can barely remember their names. Filled with exposition after exposition, one of my biggest issues is how farfetched and unrealistic a specific character's trait becomes unbelievably significant. I don't have a problem with being open-minded and accepting questionable plot points or devices, but I can't be a brainless viewer, and that's what The Predator asks of the audience.

Like I wrote above, the story lacks action, and the character development is so shallow that I didn't really care about a single character, not even the protagonist. Shane Black struggled to control the movie's pacing, and I yawned more than just a couple of times. The mix of comedy and action didn't always mesh well since the jokes are nowhere near the level Black's showed in previous flicks. The most I could express was a smile, and that's due to Keegan-Michael Key being hilarious by nature.

Another disappointment is how the action is handled. Shaky-cam all over the place, poor lighting in the night scenes and a ridiculous work on the editing room makes almost every single set piece hard to understand. There are so many cuts between, for example, a person just throwing something at someone else, or running to a certain spot that it completely loses all sense of space. While I applaud the more bloody and brutal kills (which makes total sense in the Predator saga), the fact that I could barely see anything makes it less notable.

Even the casting is off. Boyd Holbrook (Quinn McKenna) doesn't convince me as the lead, Olivia Munn (Casey) forces her expressions a lot and Sterling K. Brown (Traeger) can't overcome his flawed script. Trevante Rhodes (Williams) is the only one that actually delivers a good performance. Key is funny because he is Key and not because he is portraying a character, he is just playing himself. The rest of the cast is forgettable, and in a film where almost everything fails, that's just another nail in the coffin.

I don't really have what one can call ""pros."" I love Shane Black's work, but his direction and screenplay are surprisingly faulty. When I can see what's going on, the action is good, even though it has too many cuts. Some jokes can provide a few chuckles. Basically, that's it. I don't know what to write anymore besides stating that this is a contender for the worst movie of 2018, so far.

All in all, The Predator is just another failure of the franchise. When even a remarkable director and screenwriter as Shane Black suddenly turns out to be uncommonly bad, that's the number one proof that 20th Century Fox should drop the saga once and for all. The team-up of wretched cinematography and choppy editing brings every action sequence down, and the story is so boring and character-less that I felt desperate for a second of entertainment. I didn't get it, and the cast didn't put that much effort to try and save this disaster. One of the worst films of the year. What else to expect?"

Nothing against boyd Holbrook but Adrien Brody was really good maybe next time Bring him back It's. really easy the movie should be dark thriller mystery and action.

(Btw marvel knows this, which is why they can hire cheap to ride their horse.) The 90's are over, gotta be a little bit more creative and pay attention to detail Mr Black.

Acting was decent although the script was horrible and not consistent. They had the concept down just those lines in between.

DoP was good with the FX.

For a 88M budget...just horrible. If you want cheap thrills you can watch this or sharknado 5.

Oh and the ending...

Laugh Out Loud...

What a joke haha."

1.0,1 October 2018,"A welcome return to the Predator franchise in a decade reunites Shane Black w/the flick I would say started him out in the business. Shane Black was an actor in the original '87 version (he also did some rewrites on it I've read) so he was the logical choice to helm a follow-up as he's become a solid director w/Iron Man 3 & the Nice Guys & he knows the material. Here we have the Predator return to Earth w/a device that will turn the tide in future visits from the marauding hunters. Boyd Holbrook (from Logan) stars, along Olivia Munn, as a sniper who encounters the hostile visitors during a mission only to find himself stateside when things take a turn for the violent. Fast paced, gory as all hell & wonderfully R rated, this flick delivers the goods when the trailers indicated the opposite."

I won't spoil it for you by telling you any actual details but rest assured the script is just dumb, the CGI laughable and the acting so awful I kept my finger close to my ears to silence it when it became too much. I don't get it, it's like Shane Black decided to take all the worst bits of Independence Day, the dumbest bits of Mercury Rising and finally the humour from Adam Sandler movies, mixed them up and gave us a turd sandwich. I've said enough, now leave."

3.0,15 September 2018,"The Predator is one of the worst movies ever made and an insult to filmmaking. The 40 minutes of previews and Geico ads before it were more exciting and better directed. The cast must have taken these roles to keep their health insurance. They are physically game but most cannot act or pretend to express any genuine human emotion. The CGI looks like it was done with Sharpies and masking tape. I have seen better direction when someone asks me to show them how to get to Costco. The script appears to have been conceived and written by two crack addicted methheads. Everything associated with this film should be put in a rocket and sent into deep space, never to return."

5.0,13 August 2022,"There's no need for serious critique here, the conclusion is obvious.

The predator is an absolute insult to the franchise and should never have seen the light of day.

As a comedy spoof it works. I laughed in derision countless times. However, as a true addition to the already saturated predator universe, it is cripplingly terrible.

If your a fan of the original predator, stay far, far away.

If your looking for a film to get hammered to, then your in luck."
4.0,15 January 2019,"Trailers for this film made me nervous but it turned out to be a great film.

Excellent edition to the series!!!"
2.0,27 June 2019,"So dissapointed.. On story, actors, jokes and special effects.."
2.0,30 November 2018,"This has to be, hands down, the worst Predator film made so far. Shane Black grabs hold of the Predator franchise and turns it into a parody of sorts. We have a bunch of pervy-but-in-a-good-way ex-soldiers going after a Predator (oh wait, there's two.. in a plot-twist that nearly renders the entire first couple of acts pointless!) with a genetic scientist (who can surprisingly work guns!) and a kid (autistic genius, mind you!) in tow.

Does the sci-fi part of the film work? No, the giant conspiracy theory that they come up with doesn't even work on paper, let alone on screen. Fine, does the horror element work? Nope, CGI gore does not amount to horror these days; if that's so '300' should have been a horror movie. Alright, at least the set-pieces work? Again NOPE - they are utterly generic with little to no surprises! Well, well, well okay, I hope at least Shane Black's dark humour works? Unfortunately, even that doesn't. We all know that Black has a great sense of humor (watch 'The Nice Guys' or 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang' if you need clues), but in 'The Predator', it just doesn't work.

So is there anything good about 'The Predator'? Yes! But the fact is, they have nothing to do with this movie. The nods given to John McTiernan's original Predator (1987) and Stephen Hopkins' Predator 2 (1990) are, without a doubt, the only good thing about this flick. The new protagonists, played by Boyd Holbrook (who has this 'Oh, I'm so badass..worship me!' aura) and Olivia Munn (who doesn't get any stand-out scenes of her own) don't leave any lasting impressions. As for Jacob Tremblay, son, you're better off doing indie films where you can truly showcase your acting chops!

The movie was in the news for all the wrong reasons and I'm sure the bad energy pretty much translated onto the viewing experience as well. If Black is planning to make a sequel to this piece of trash, then count me out!"
8.0,5 June 2021,Terrible acting awful childish script clearly written by a dunce and in all honesty only a dunce could watch this drivel.
3.0,31 December 2021,"Typical Hollywood movie that afloat barely thanks to strong Predator idea inheritance and special effects. Why I can digest logical holes like Predator walking through specal army units without scratch and then have issues with female scientist and one solider for whatever reason. What I can't get over are stupid comments that planet will be uninhabitable in one generation or that aliens are collecting most capable species which in humans aparently means people suffering from neurodevelopmental disorder.

Without doubt best movie in the series remains first one followed by second. Then it went downhill perhaps with exception of Predators. Please somone pick up the story and make movie. Whoever that will be please do not let Hollywood or anyone from America touch it again even with the long stick."
1.0,25 December 2021,"This is probably the worst ""Predator"" movie to this date! I would say that the script is to blame for almost everything that makes this movie a disappointment. The casting is to blame for most of the rest... Then again: If the script had not been so bad, the casting could have cast actors better suited for a movie like this! So the script might actually be to blame for more than ""almost everything""...

The humor in this movie is completely misplaced! A majority of the main characters would fit better in a satire movie, or a movie like ""Critters""/""Tremors"" or other movies made with a deep undertone of humor. In a series with some horror aspects it is just misplaced and bad writing.

I am uncertain what to say about the acting. It was not good during a lot of the movie. But how could it have been any good with a script this bad??? So I choose to not blame the actors, but the script for this as well.

Technically the movie is well made. Both the sound and visual effects were good. The aliens (no, not THOSE Aliens ;-P ), creatures, space crafts and so on looked good to me. But the ""dogs"" are another example of bad writing, they were just satirical and unnecessary (especially the surviving one).

If you do not believe the bad reviews, like the ""Predator"" movies and have some time to waste, watch this movie if you ""must"". But be warned: You might regret watching it afterwards... If you do not like the ""Predator"" movies, just watch another one, and do NOT watch this one..."
3.0,11 November 2018,"I absolutely loved it. Lots of action, humor and fairly ok story. Don't trust the reviews from old people, fatties with no sense of humor that only sit here, writing 1 star reviews. If you love action, you will enjoy this movie a lot. Aside the first one, I didn't like any of the predators as much. This is the best of them yet. I came with realistic expectations and finished watching the movie content."
1.0,3 December 2018,"Let me review this movie by showing each star first.

* It is a movie ** it does not feel like a B movie *** some CGI effect **** there is a story, but not good enough.. still give it another star ***** The main actor looks like Mel Gibson..

That is all I got for the stars. The bad thing is about this movie is that it drops way too many F bombs... even the little kid did that. I think it backfired. You may not want to let kids watch this movie at all, or they will come out and say ""WTF"" after the movie"
1.0,18 September 2018,"Not sure what happened maybe Shane ""Hawkins"" Black lost his writing touch, I don't know but the story was mixed up we had many more ejections from ship than the numbers of predators showing up.

9.0,3 July 2020,"I think Predator should have been a one-off. None of the sequels have really brought anything meaningful to the table, and the first film is so awesome and got everything right that all the others just feel like inferior retreads. However... unlike many films in this genre at the very least the film takes the time to introduce the characters to the audience, and for the most part they are unique and likeable. The story also has some interesting angles that unfortunately it didnt really make the most of. The climax also felt a bit phoned in. All in all its ok, but the only Predator film anyone needs to see is the 1987 original."
1.0,13 September 2019,"I almost went to the cinema to watch this, I'm so glad I didnt. I probably would have walked out. It recently came out on Sky so I watched it for free.

Hate to wreck your predator world but its NOT REAL it's a movie. I always just watch and appreciate a new version and a new look. Yes it had some hokey scenes especially the soldiers on the spaceship but other than that it was a fun flick. It's a action scifi monster movie, I want action and lots of blood ,we got both! I really liked the comedy it always adds to action films. Can hardly wait to see then next predator."

Another entry in the ""Predator"" series, and weakest yet (no one should ever count the ones where they tango with the ""Alien"" xenomorph), featuring a rogue Army Ranger (Holbrook) teaming up with a group of legitimately loony Marines, plus his kid and a biologist, to fight off our favorite outer space game hunters. Fairly fast-paced, with enough yucks and yuks to appease less-discriminating fans of this kind of programmer. Not especially faithful to the spirit of the previous films--the first couple minutes look like they belong in an action scene from the Abrams ""Star Trek"" universe; the cloaking technology is used more often by the humans than the Predators; and until the last twenty minutes or so, nearly all of the aliens' victims are nondescript nobodies. Contains the requisite number of in-jokes/references (the original music score makes a comeback, Busey plays the son of the character that his own father, Gary, played in the first sequel, etc.). Holbrook is the dullest main protagonist the series has yet produced; Brown and Key steal most of their scenes, though not always for good reasons. Tough to say what's a harder pill to swallow: the autism-is-a-next-step-in-evolution sub-plot, or the epilogue's groan-inducing setup for even more sequels.

Even the credible actors in this reboot provided cringe worthy performances. Please stop making Predator reboots, you have killed what was such a brilliant idea in the first film. At least Robert Rodriguez was able to produce something that honoured the original, this film is simply a mess.

New films will never do well if you can't get past the originals. Lots of people can't get past the 80s and 90s or marvel standards. If I had to pick something out, it would be the new Pred's CGI at times on it's face. I hope for a sequel with Arnie, but if people keep wrecking good efforts, then old franchises will never take off. What ruins films today is the fact they show too much in trailers which spoil it. I.e Terminator Genesys, major spoilers ruined it (plus no Robert Patrick) Any way, everyone's different and I personally thought it was a great comeback!"

2.0,6 October 2018,"Action in all types of settings. Never a dull moment. That's why we go see an action movie and I don't understand why anyone would give this a bad rating. Special effects were awesome. The fight scenes were believable so that's a definite plus.

A previous reviewer said the jokes were written for 7 year olds. The little boy told the secret service guy (the one who kidnapped him) that he understands reverse psychology so the little boy told him ""I don't want you to go (expletive) yourself"". The jokes were off the wall and well written and there were a lot of them.

Another reviewer didn't like the scene where the giant dogs 'just stood there' while they were getting shot at. You must be intoxicated if you can't see the dogs have armor growing on them and they're not going to attack while half a dozen people are shooting at them. And it was for less than a minute. The damage those dogs caused afterwards was pretty awesome though. I don't think their review should be allowed with logic like that LOL.

Another reviewer claimed to be a 'massive Predator fan' and...you guessed it! They gave this movie a bad review. There's another review to ignore.

One reviewer claimed the special effects were 'laughably bad'. This is so not true. Holograms and special effects would take place whenever someone turned on the Predator's helmet. And the force field around the ship was pretty awesome. All kinds of stuff happened in that scene.

Action. Very good special effects. A giant dog that plays fetch with grenades and becomes a buddy of the good guys...I don't think you can go wrong with this movie!"

Horrible mixture of poor story, forgettable performances, weak characterisation and unnecessarily long stretched humours made it worse. The action sequences looked decent though ; it's one of those films where you already know it's bad but nonetheless you would still watch it and have fun. Perhaps the most strong point in this one was the fun factor. It's a popcorn, time pass flick. Which you could enjoy watching with your friends and family without being too invested into the story. It didn't bore me at any moment but a huge number of flaws, cliches, plot holes did bother me a lot. Just go watch it without any expectations at all and you might enjoy it to a certain extent."

8.0,21 August 2022,"I know the ingredients of that first Predator movie will never be replicated perfectly again but come on this is the best they could come up with? A kid with autism means he's a superior being? Seriously??? There's hardly a single thing taken serious about this movie. While the characters atleast aren't bland and can be kinda likable they all act like immature 8-year-olds who just learned how to cuss. They never take any situation seriously and even the sight of the Predator doesn't phase them at all. The Predator itself still looks cool and there's even a giant one in the mix but practically every scene of them is in lit & wide areas that doesn't give off any sense of tension or claustrophobia. The editing is also pretty bad with inconsistent shots & sloppily filmed action scenes.

Despite these major flaws I can't act like I didn't have a good time watching it. The action is still enjoyable & you get some nasty gory kills. Although the humor can be obnoxious I did laugh quite a bit. It definitely fits the definition of dumb fun.

Not the worst of all the Predator films, that honor still goes to AVP Requiem, but no doubt the worst of the standalone movies. Despite enjoying it I'm still disappointed it turned out this way. If you just want a nice brain relaxer then this might do the trick. But if you're looking for something deeper with major stakes than its best to just rewatch the first film."

1.0,18 December 2018,"It was exactly what everyone wanted but it still wasn't good enough. I guess everyone who rated this movie low, expected an Oscar worthy masterpiece. Because the original Predator was so perfect, right? I enjoyed it a lot but that's probably because I don't expect a sequel to a movie about an Alien Hunter, that stared Arnold Schwarzenegger to be anything but an explosion filled, over-the-top, action film. This film delivered everything I expected."

3.0,15 August 2022,"Yeah it's bad, but really fun. In my opinion, it's better to have a fun bad movie than having a boring bad movie. This movie sacrifices the mystery of the predator with over the top action. You already see the predator in the beginning and you never stop seeing him. That's not how it's supposed to work, but honestly, it's nice to have something different. The bad dialogue is really funny. Also, come on, bigger doesn't mean better. This CGI predator is awful. Also, what is that ending? But it's still really fun."

This movie was soo bad I created an IMDb account just let people know that they shouldn't waste their hard earned money on this trash. I can't tell you how disappointed I am with this, no suspense or mystery at all. Shane Black screwed the pooch on this one! The best part of the original predator films was that you hardly ever saw the predator but in this film they are in almost every scene. The music was terrible , triumphant tones like Jurassic park through the movie made it soo bad. Soldiers pep talking each other and.not.one of them looked scared. Utter garbage! Bring back Adrien Brody !!!"

The story makes no sense, the predators don't act in accordance with their lore, everything is just.... terrible. I had extremely bad expectations going in, and the movie was worse than even that.

Next time they make a predator movie, they need to hire a fan to at least lore check the story...

5.0,16 September 2019,"A nonsensical storyline, muddied even further by appalling editing, script, characters and premise. The sound quality was as bad as the movie itself with dialogue almost inaudible at times. Action sequences made no sense and seemed cobbled together without any direction. I'm not sure what this movie was trying to be but it failed on every count and was so ebarrassingly terrible even students from a second rate film school wouldn't have taken on such a shambolic travesty. Whoever thought this would be a good idea and a cracking addition to the franchise should be put in the Predator's craft and spirited away forever."

This sorry excuse for a predator movie starts off lame, with a huge gaff in the wrecked ship crossing into the atmosphere in daylight and then crashing in the pitch black of night. It quickly devolves to stupid and then finally ends in the ridiculous. With three guys hanging onto the outside of a ship flying through the air.

I gave this 4 stars only because I am a fan of Thomas Jane and his character made me laugh.

There is really no story line to this & it's been said in some of the other reviews, it's too comical. Shane should have kept this simple like the 1st one was. Why overcomplicate with monster Predators & Predator dogs that want to play?? This needed some more stronger characters in it & a story, one predator & that's it! Simple. Budget comes to mind with this one, probably on a tight one so we will now generate some strange storyline and...... yep! Go nowhere. You can do better than this Shane, so let's see another one, but a different approach."
10.0,15 September 2018,"No one was more excited than me when it was announced that Shane Black would be writing & directing a sequel/soft reboot of The Predator. Flash forward to today and no one is more disappointed than me in Shane Black's The Predator. Had he not seen the original...which he was in!? This was nearly beat by beat Independence Day Resurgence...with Predators. Even with the cheesy ending with a tagline for a sequel that will never happen; except possibly a Netflix movie, like Beyond Skyline. The plot was weak, the effects were even weaker. The cast does do great with Black's sharp dialogue and does their best to sell the ridiculous plot. In the end, The Predator will make for a decent Friday night rental, but that's about it."
5.0,28 November 2018,".... i cant even.... ok, .... so i thought i was sitting down to something comparable to the previous movies. (no i didnt see any of the previews) Is this April Fools or something? I gave it a 2, 1 of those is for Olivia Munn, i like her even though one of her first quotes in the movie that references a previous is just HORRIBLE. Was the director asleep during making this? (i dont blame her but she should have fought to NOT have to say that line.) From there it was kinda of an ""uh oh, what did i step in"" feel.

Any ways, maybe 1 out of 10 jokes lands. (this is a comedy, right?)

And ive seen a few dozen of other reviews here. It is NOT the worst movie ever. See 'Tusk' before you make that claim. ; )"

2.0,21 September 2018,"I saw The Predator in IMAX with dad. And it was Awesome. Stars a bunch fan favorites and character actors including Thomas Jane from The Expanse and the 2004 Punisher movie, Olivia Munn from X-Man Apocalypse and Jacob Tremblay from the Oscar winning movie room.. The story concerns a soldier whose crew gets killed by a Predator.The soldier takes some armor from the creature and the armor ends up with his Autistic son. So he and a group of somewhat crazy Soldiers including one who makes a lot of jokes( Coyle) and one with tourettes(Baxley) must stop the The creature before it gets to his son. The Action is bloody and enjoyable. A lot of gore. The characters have funny dialogue like you expect in a Shane Black Movie. There is a great meta joke about the Creature's name and you even get to see Predator vs Predator Combat. But one thing that elevates this movie that one of the heros is Autistic like me and his autism isn't treated as a bad thing and we arn't made to feel sorry for his dad for haveing or any such stuff. The kid gets to say cool stuff and be part of the action. There are many twists and turns including the reveal of why there are more than one Predator on Earth. The ultimate reval of what the Predator is after and what the Third act climactic battle is about is so dame Awesome and also pregersive. I won't reval it her but i made me clapp in theaters ! Sterling K. Brown from Black Panther and The People v. O. J. Simpson plays kind one dimensional bad guy who Screws to add conflict and but is not really interesting. Trevante Rhodes from 2017 Best Picture Winner Moonlight is also in it and he does a good job. Australian actress Yvonne Strahovski from the popular tv show Dexter and NBCs Chuck is also in the movie playing the Main character's ex-wife and she plays the part well and even get some nice lines. She also seems like a loving mother who accepts her son autism which i appreciated. Boyd Holbrook( known for being the Villian in Logan) does a nice jobb in the lead( Aloutough it would have fun to see Benicio del Toro play the lead like original planned) His character also seems like loving father who again accepts his son so that's good. Shane Black and Fred Dekker's script is good it has both action and humor. I have not seen any of the other Predator movies but i know what they are about. Despite that i could follow the movie well. Overall a fun bloody, action packad god time and agian it is really really nice to have an Autistic lead character ! Also Comedian and actor Keegan-Michael Key is really good as Coyle. I Recommend it. The movie is a 7 but the Autistic kid bumps it up to a 7,5 and that amazing reval bumps up to 8.

So 8 of 10 !"

The Predator is somehow the worst combination of expensive, boring, stupid, slopy, and stale. The end movie feels like 3-4 scripts for different predator movies crammed into one and then left out to dry. The action feels limp (outside one decent in a dark forest near the end) the gore feels excessive and lifeless all at the same time, and the ending sets up a superhero-style sequel that will never (and should never) come to exist (thank christ).

Not worth the 100 some-odd minutes it takes to watch, let alone money."

3.0,9 February 2019,I was skeptic to this movie after the rewiew it wasn't the worst and it wasn't the best but a solid popcorn flick. Lot's of violence and one liners
5.0,13 September 2022,"I'm not really a big Predator fan, and I think the movies are all okay, nothing more. But I'm a big Shane Black fan. The Nice Guys or Kiss Kiss Bang Bang are among my favorite films and I even like Iron Man 3, as well as the movies in which he worked as a writer. Well, unfortunately, The Predator is not one of them, because this movie is absolutely nothing that makes Shane Black so special.

I think the problems of the movie start with the idea. The second part of the franchise had the idea of a mixture of police movie and the Predator hunt. A new hunting territory and new expansions for the world. Predators had a completely new idea to turn the whole thing around so that humans are the hunters. Or at least should be. Yes, even the AVP films had a better basic idea. But I think the only idea of this movie was: Hey, there hasn't been a Predator movie in a long time... Well, and that's it.

The plot is completely generic and also so boring. Yes, there are this boy and also a few other new ideas. However, these ideas almost border on ideas of a trash movie. The budget, the actors and effects do not indicate, but the plot and everything that needs some brainwax definitely.

Then there are also these characters. Of course, the characters are completely one-dimensional and not really interesting. But there are also some characters who are supposed to cause comedy, but it doesn't really work out. Because they are by no means funny and it just doesn't fit into a Predator movie. Well, and then there are also the two protagonists who are just perfect. I mean Olivia Munn is a scientist, but probably as tough and strong as the rest of the soldiers. Well and Boyd Holbrook can do everything anyway and is the heroic savior in need.

Well, the actors are basically okay in their roles. Nothing earth-shattering, but also not a total disaster.

So overall, the movie just has a lot of problems and I don't really understand how this movie can come from Shane Black. Well, of the Predator movies, this is probably the biggest failure."
4.0,2 October 2018,"I actually liked it. Were there some things that just didn't make sense where you just shook your head, sure. Like the other ones before it, I didn't compare it to the other Predator movies as I don't think any will ever compare to the original. No, I'm not a bot either (smile)."
3.0,30 September 2018,"The Predator is directed by Shane Black, written by Fred Dekker and Shane Black and starring Boyd Holbrook, Trevante Rhodes, Keegan-Michael Key and Olivia Munn.

It's all about the outer reaches of space to the small-town streets of suburbia, the hunt comes home in Shane Black's explosive reinvention of the Predator series. Now, the universe's most lethal hunters are stronger, smarter and deadlier than ever before, having genetically upgraded themselves with DNA from other species. When a young boy accidentally triggers their return to Earth, only a ragtag crew of ex-soldiers and a disgruntled science teacher can prevent the end of the human race.

I'm not a huge fan of Predator, I love their costumes and the CGI, but this franchise didn't do that much for me, it didn't impress me that much.

The Predator is not disappointing for me as lots of people said it is, cause simply I'm a fan of the first Predator movie, but The Predator wasn't that good, it has lots of thing that had no sense!

Let's start with the things I liked about this movie... I liked the costumes very very much, they were really cool, and it's actually the most impressive thing about this movie. The CGI was really good too, but I have a problem with it too, the predators were showing up in the dark, the crew was just trying to hide something, like their mistakes so they made them show in the dark to make it looks perfect, predators showed only one time in the morning, and it was the final fight, and it was so short.. anyways, let's back to the things I liked, the story, I liked the story, it was good and the last thing I liked is the role of Jacob Tremblay, but it went in an another wrong way too!

Now with the things I hated about this movie... I will start with the CGI again, and as I said above the predators in the dark. I didn't notice any drop with the CGI, and of course that's what the crew wanted from us. I guess they were lazy to work hard, so they made them in the night, but then they showed them in the morning, and then I said ""Oh, you're capable to make an amazing CGI, but you were just lazy to do it!"".

Then let's move to the role of Jacob Tremblay, it was really good at the beginning, but then he actually turned into bad-acting. I hated how they made him insult and all of that stuff, I hated it!! The performances in general were bad, all of them were less than fine.

I hated the predator dog so much, they made him a pet after a bullet in the head!!!! It bothered me so much!!!

The story was good as I said, but it was so slow, then so fast, it was really awkward! Because of that, it was boring.

The jokes were trash too, I don't know why they made it at the first place!

The Predator in general is fine, I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it too, I just liked it...

I'm gonna give The Predator a B-.. I think it's a not-bad movie, but it depends on what are you expecting to see, and I as expecting to see a movie that it's gonna break the first Predator movie, but unfortunately it didn't, but close to!

Thank you, guys as always for reading my review, hope you like, and if you have any comment, just say it."
1.0,15 September 2018,"The characters move from scene to scene without any visual or narrative explanation. It's as if all the connective scenes have been cut out. There isn't any attempt at creating a logical story and humans and predators just know stuff for no reason. Predators understand postal addresses now?

It is a random mess with scenes starting in one place and ending in another. The director doesn't care about continuity, character or story. Whoever edited this needs to go back to school."
10.0,17 May 2022,"How can a professional movie director look at this script, look at this movie, and feel satisfied.

The charm of Predator is supposed to be mystery, build up, tension, shocks, disturbing type of gore, survival, stakes, patience, sense of danger, subtle innovation to survive. This movie is the complete opposite of that, and even does a bad job at doing that. The jokes are not funny, the story and plots are lame and uninteresting.

I don't necessarily have high expectations for new Predator movies, but this is just a disgrace and it makes me sad because I absolutely adore Predator 1, and 2 for what it is, Predators was bad but they at least had some of the concept right, but this is one is completely unworthy of using the name Predator.

I saw the trailer of Prey, the new Predator movie that'll come out this summer, I'm afraid it's going to be a disappointing woke fest, sad times.

Every line is a try hard cliche tough guy line, to a point it sounds like they are making a parody of it. I am all for a good gory action flick where you dont need to think much and just enjoy your popcorn. This one was not that. This one was filled with cringe moments that it gets in the way of the action. I am not sure how half the scenes made the cut as they come out so not done correctly and almost sound and look like blooper takes. The plot has more holes than a road in Mumbai. Seriously would have paid to not act in this movie if I was casted after reading the plot."

1.0,19 September 2018,"So the Predator films are some of my favourite action films. Especially Predator 2 with Danny Glover which is my all time favourite. They had action, sci-fi, explosions, Predators, gore, a decent dose of humor when it suits.. not all of them were great but if you take the first 2 into consideration you got a pretty good recipe for success. I even liked Predators with Adrien Brody.

Cutting back to this film now..

It starts well, with good production values, good CGI and I thought it was off to a promising start. And then slowly but steadily it turns into some of the tedious experiences I had to go through..

I mean what a waste of a cast. Whoever wrote the dialogues and the plot should be lobotomised. I don't have anything against Shane Black. I actually really liked 'Nice Guys - 2016' I thought it was one of the funniest films I've seen in a while.

But this? what is this? I was seriously contemplating leaving the cinema during the second act. It was painful to watch.

If you remove those asinine dialogues and characters from the funky bunch in the bus.. I mean just outright delete them, get rid of them and any interaction with the film. You got a film that would score around 7.5-8 out of 10. I mean it has its flaws but while the Predator(s) are on screen things make sense.

The rest of the plot and character decisions are completely and utterly ridiculous.

I thought the Predator was a more serious franchise but I guess it's like CW made this into a film or the sequel is going to be something like Power Rangers or Legends of Tomorrow or something equally dire..

Another franchise I liked systematically destroyed by Hollywood. Don't get me wrong, I love change. But there is change and there is just wrong on so many levels.."
1.0,10 November 2018,"I am a huge fan of the first Predator movie, also liked the second one, and the third one Predators (2010), from the beginning to the end is fun and a lot of action, i really like the fun parts, it makes the movie even better, not horror and action, no a lot of funny stuff and great action.

It has great special FX, and love the music theme for the first Predator movie, i cannot under stand that this movie has only a 5.8, there is nothing wrong with the story or the actors, i love the military from the bus, was laughing a lot, because of the stupid stuff some say, and did, was not happy they all died.

If this movie came out in the 80s everybody would have liked it, a pity so many people now are so serious, would have loved to see movie sequels, but it did bad in the cinema so i think that will never happen.

If you love a good sci-fi - action movie then this is for you, and if your a fan of Predator and are not so serious you would like it also."

Aside from the hard to like characters and an even harder to like storyline, the writing at times seemed comically bad, like they told the writers from Honey I Shrunk the Kids to write a Predator movie. The only redeeming qualities of this movie were Keegan-Michael Key's character, Koyl, and his band of ""military nutjobs."" The movie was so bad it almost seemed like it was on purpose, like in a ""it's so bad, its good"" sort of way.

2.0,17 December 2018,"The Predator

In order to successfully hunt humans you must first cover yourself in their urine.

Or, you can do like the tracker in this sci-fi thriller and bring some hunting dogs.

Quinn (Boyd Holbrook) disarms an alien and mails its armour to his son (Jacob Tremblay) stateside. But when the captured creature escapes confinement, it comes looking for its property. With help from a biologist (Olivia Munn) and some dysfunctional marines (Keegan-Michael Key, Thomas Jane), Quinn tries to keep his kid away from the alien and a duplicitous bureaucrat (Sterling K. Brown).

Serving as a direct sequel to the first two films in the franchise, this jokey instalment doesn't surpass either predecessor. While the action is intense and the subject matter timely, there's very little plot and character development to substantiate this follow-up.

Moreover, the only human who can really stop a predator from harming a child is Chris Hansen. Red Light

That point in the process where the scriptwriters are bored or drunk, or both, and just type any rubbish that comes into their heads. Jokes, dismemberment, whatever.

However this is genuinely insulting, stupid, incompetent film making. Ive never walked out of a movie in my life until now.

10.0,13 September 2018,"I'm sure many will criticise the silliness of The Predator, or the incredulity, or the lack of anything approaching a real character, or the really abrupt and odd ending, or the occasionally awful special fx....and I agree with all of those comments.

But!! The Predator is never boring. It is sporadically funny too, and the cast is mostly appealing without offering much in the way of memorable traits or motivations. Sterling K Brown is a highlight as a pretty nasty piece of work, and there's a nice nod to Predator 2 in the casting of Jake Busey, playing the son of the character his father played in that 90's sequel.

Some of the other cast are completely wasted (who has Thomas Jane offended?!) as the movie careens from one loud shouty gun fight to the next. A fine writer Shane Black may be, but his decision making when directing action is certainly in question.

Would I recommend The Predator? Yes, with caveats. Get a big ol' Bucket of popcorn and don't expect too much and you might come away satisfied by this dark (literally, there isn't a daylight scene until the very final scene) brainless mess."

One of the space dogs is killed and the other one, get this, suffers a blow to the head and spends the rest of the movie aimlessly wallowing around. There's also a super scientist, a woman, who shoots herself in the foot (literally, pun intended) while using some military grade automatic weaponry. There's an autistic kid who is smarter than anybody else in the movie and deciphers alien code easier than Tetris. There's also some evil military personnel led by a black guy in a white jacket who chews gum and acts like a parody of the Cigarette Smoking Man but without the cigarette. The most memorable moment is the grand phrase ""Eat my pussy"" directed to the hot chick by one of the gang fruit cakes which is a moment of pure stupidity nevertheless utterly funny in a moronic way. Then we have the final fireworks and happy end."
4.0,17 September 2018,"I really can't understand the people who gave this movie a low rating. what did you expect from Predator? It was so exciting, had a great story line with a little bit of comedy in it. I will not spoil it but you will like it if you are open minded. People that keep saying that they liked the old Predator remind me of my dad that always complain about todays music, never listen to new music and stuck in 80s and 70s!"
1.0,28 June 2019,An insult compared to the first two films - thus was just gore for the sake of it with zero character development or a storyline that made even vague sense.

1.0,16 September 2018,"I don't go to see many movies in the theater but my son and I were so hyped up that such a great looking addition to the Predator films was coming out that we just had to go. I'm giving it a couple extra stars only because the CGI action was aplenty. The convoluted and confusing story telling, totally unwarranted incessant vulgarity, hack-job editing and the severely strained effort to insert excessive shots at comedy all made for quite a stew of disappointment. It's quite a tarnish to the franchise an no comparison whatsoever to the original. I almost would have better enjoyed staying home to watch real estate shopping shows. Ok, it wasn't that bad, but close."
5.0,18 September 2018,"For all those spitting hate. Shut the Hell up! This is Not the Original it doesn't have Arnie. What it is is a great, Action movie with great quips and people that I really got into, I mean I hot invested in the characters. Shane Black did a great job with this and ties in with the Original two Predator movies.

The effects are great! The story is great. It's an action comedy not action thriller/suspense ok.

My son is very picky (teens think they know everything, like I do) He hated all the Predators movies except the 1st. He liked this one very much. The humor wasn't forced or shoehorned in but fit. Please go and watch it. We may not get another one."

For real now, What were you thinking?"
9.0,10 August 2022,This movie was almost hard to fathom being so bad. Especially with an experienced director. It was more like slap stick. Probably the worst of the franchise.
4.0,21 August 2021,"I'm what you probably will call a 'movie snob'. I like my Lars von Triers and Gaspar Noé. I deem 'Upstream Color' to be one of the best movie ever made. So in theory, I should HATE this.

Well, sorry for all the 'muH franChise' people here, but it was evident from the get go no one was going to pull 'a dark' version of the predator franchise after the number the ""Rambo"" reboot did at the BO.

So instead, Shane Black (Lethal Weapon 1 & 2, Iron Man 3) went the comedy route while adding enough guts and bloods to keep the action going. From the very beginning the mentos-addicted villain sets the tone and you either roll with it or you walk out. Simples.

Yeah the CGI is so-so at times, but most of the SFX is solid. The storyline is what you would expect from hollywood, but better nor worse than ""lethal weapon"". Stop it with the nostalgia or rewatch these movies and rate them today. You're in for shock.

Geeks, your nostalgia is getting the best of you. Why can't you enjoy a good laugh with lines like ""what's with the dreads"" when the predator dogs show up, or the hilarious ""Pardon me, Sir?"" when the villian takes a look at the dead predator and says ""this N**** fucked his S*** up!"". Or how his psychopathic tendencies lead him to kill anyone from his own 'starwatcher' team.

The 'loonies' (a great take on some sort of Neurotic a-team) are well acted throughout, in particular Trevante Rhodes and Sterling K. Brown both delivering really cheesy line with gusto.

No, it's not a 'masterpiece', no, it's not what the 'fans' wanted, no, it won't win any awards, but I've watched, way, way worse rated far higher on IMDB."

4.0,16 September 2018,"! wanted to give this a 1 but alas it made me laugh. This was a very mediocre movie.

1. The score or background music was forgettable. 2. The camera work was typical save one good scene where the Predator emerged from the fog, that was really good. 3. The CGI was absolutely horrendous, distractedly so. No two ways about it. 4. The plot was essentially the same as the movie ""SAFE"" but with predators and executed really bad. 5. Dialogue was really funny at times but this lead to a really wonky tone set 6. The over all tone of the movie was not that of a Predator movie, the jokes created the atmosphere that annihilated tension and gave the sense of a bad Disney super hero film. 7. Olivia Munn's character was poorly written like many of the others but in her case this was especially true. she had like the super competency of a highly trained soldier while apparently just being a scientist, and outclassed actual soldiers in the movie which was weird and jarring. Also she displayed an indestructible arm in one scene.

The Predator 2 movie as well as AVP 2 movies were both done better, albeit slightly. This did not feel like a Predator movie."
10.0,17 September 2018,"Somewhere around the halfway point of this film I realised why I get very little joy out of this series. The problem is that the 'Predators', despite looking very cool and obviously being incredibly powerful, are boring. They have no character to them whatsoever. These films cater to people who are fascinated with a cool looking creature and require no depth beyond that.

For that reason this series feels like it is stalled. Every entry into it feels identical to the last, simply in a new location. There's nowhere for things to go. They've made an effort to set up the next film in this one, but even that next film is just going to be like every other entry, it's very easy to see. The reason for this is that there are only so many ways to shake up such a simple concept. The only thing you can really do is change the look of the 'Predator' and perhaps evolve its powers. Is that enough to get people to keep buying tickets? It shouldn't be.

So while this film wasn't by any means offensively bad, I guess I had just hoped for more. The only character I really cared about the fate of was the kid. That being said I did like the twist of the group off the bus being mentally off-centre. It lead to some humour and did make them more likeable than they otherwise could have been. I also liked the joke about ""Predator"" being an ill-conceived name for the creature because it didn't make sense. I had thought that to myself many times before seeing this movie. Otherwise though everything else was pretty forgettable and not worth wasting your hard-earned on I'm afraid to say."
5.0,1 October 2018,
5.0,15 September 2018,"This movie is a mess. It has the same problems as the later Resident Evil movies in editing, cut cut cut cut cut all over the place. I doubt there's a scene in this movie where the camera holds for more than four seconds. Absolute amateur hour. The editor needs to be sacked. I wanted to like this movie but it's near impossible to watch.

There's also issue with the direction. The camera angles are all over the place which makes knowing where anyone is, impossible. A lot of the shots are too dark. A lot of the shots are too close.

The story board has holes in it too. Characters arrive in places instantly. It's a very localised story with no sense of distance.

The diversity quota's are in full swing which makes the cast ridiculous and there's too many which leads to them all being shallow and pointless. Gung-ho women abound, unbelievable and testosteroned to be equal to males, even threatening to trained soldiers twice their size. It's stupid. The scientist is a fully trained weapon expert it seems, she even starts chasing the Predator with a weapon and leaps onto a moving bus roof in pursuit. Everyone is a superhero in this movie.

People who are in the actual making of props and sets and design must be sick and tired of doing such a great job on hot mess films.

The story seemed like a dozen people had fought over what it should contain. Probably did. An utter bi-polar schizophrenic disaster.

This movie is like ramming all the food in your kitchen into a pot and boiling it up. It wont taste good. All the elements are there but it's too much for one meal and ends up being fed to the dog."
2.0,29 April 2022,"The mentality of the writer and producers is that of an eight-year old in a man's body. The turrets ""eat"" reference is enough to drive away much of the audience on its own.

The writers apparently wanted to cram as many as possible or maybe using the stereotypes as a unifying thread through an incomprehensible plot. The screenplay apparently was written by a few people or the person writing couldn't decide what kind of predator movie it was. One half is bad and the other half is just bolted on for the sake of extending the movie. On top of all this the action scenes are just boring. Don't waste your time."

5.0,9 April 2022,"It starts like an episode of Star Trek. An old episode, with crappy CGI. The predator crashes his ship, and it's during the day. Then, after some crappy editing, we learn that it actually crashed in the middle of the night. And it didn't self-destruct for some reason, even though the predator has ejected from it. Then a guy accidentally kills the predator, who ejected miles away, and it makes no sense for it to be at the crash site within minutes. Then some government agency shows up to search for the predator, and their badass boss reminds them that predators are extremely dangerous. Which is why his team has a whole five members. Then the guy that accidentally killed the predator asks a random person whom he has just threatened to send the gear he took from the predator to an address in the USA, and trusts him to do that, for absolutely no reason. And then we cut to a school where we see some kid who is being bullied... Kids have nothing to do in a predator movie. None of the stuff we have seen so far has any business being in a predator movie. We watch this kid in three consecutive scenes, almost forgetting this is a predator movie. And then you realise at the 13 minute mark that so far this kid had had more screen time than anything even remotely predator related...

Next they kidnap some random scientist and take her to a secret facility that looks like the lair of some Bond villain, because they think she can solve problems that their own scientists. Who have been hand picked and have clearly worked on the predator project for years couldn't figure out. And she does. In seconds. After explaining she is really no major expert and she probably showed up on their list because she was lucky enough that someone referenced one of her articles. The mind boggles.

But it gets better, because they have captured a live predator, who is 'sedated'. Yeaaaaaaaaahhhh..... I can't see how that could go wrong. It's just stupid, stupid, stupid. Meanwhile, another stupid thing is happening. The guy that met the predator and stole his stuff.. Instead of being questioned, he is being taken to some insane asylum along with genuinely ill people, despite the fact they know he is not crazy and most probably has not only vital information, but probably knows where missing technology is. And they strongly suspect he knows it. So why send him away? Because the plot needs him to meet some crazy folks that it wants to shove into this story. That's why. Then the predator awakes and the genius female scientist picks up some weird gun she couldn't possibly know how to operate and starts shooting it and... You know what this looks like? Predator Christmas Special. Like the one with Star Wars.

There is zero horror or suspense here, just lame attempts at comedy. Baffling."
3.0,14 September 2018,"Storyline = 4 tops Acting = 5 tops Sfx = 6 tops

If you watch this for the story, it's nothing more as a 0/10. If you watch it for the acting, it's slightly better but still bad. If you watch this just to see some special FX then you're lucky, that's the part of the movie which is the least dissapointing. Still not worth more as one star tho.

Also, to the 'reviewer' who cited this plot empowers 'people with disabilities': get a grip on reality, that was one of the parts of the movie which is actually true. Many scientist call AUTISM not an disorder but a next step in evolution. Autism isn't a mental disability, it's a developmental disorder ( and disorder only in relation to neurotypical people ). Higher functioning forms of autism are prevalent in many fields like generic IT, cryptography, math and the list goes on.

That review being the one 'liked' the most for this movie is utterly disgusting to me personally. My son doesn't have a mental dissability, he has classical autism and when tested scores entirely average on intelligence. I got Asperger Syndrome and I'm scoring in the 'gifted' range. So please Marcello Veronezzi, stop showing your ignorance by spreading lies. Darwin had an autism spectrum disorder. Einstein had it. Mozart is suspected to have it. Newton is suspected to have it. Bill Gates would probably score as one. Your ranting in regards to this film 'empowering' people with disabilities is offensive and objectively invalid."

If you're wanting to watch this for nostalgia, don't. Just watch the original, or maybe the Rodriguez film from 2010. I don't know if I'm allowed to use curse words here, so I won't. You know what kind of show it is."

I was hoping that I was wrong and that the opening was of someone watching a movie within a movie or playing a video game. Nope. Not sure how you decided to make a Predator movie and have none of the suspense of the original or the sequels that followed. The studio that made this is going to look at the opening weekend box office money and decided to make another Predator with the same formula, not realizing how disappointing this is to the audience that has seen the original. I think I sat through all of it cause of my investment in the tickets, popcorn, candy and drinks."

Truly, deeply awful."
5.0,16 September 2018,"You get in the cinema and there it goes. I didn't expect something brilliant, I mean it's an action movie. The movie opened fine, but as it went my brain took a lot of hits and at the end the feeling was that it was just complete trash. Let me make a list: What I liked about the movie: 1. Ragtag team of comical and actually well developed characters - this was the highlight of the movie, i.e. the one thing they did right. The group was funny and they actually added depth to those characters and maybe you even cared for them a little bit. Good acting on their part. Yeah that was it...

What I disliked about the movie: 1. Swearing just for the sake of swearing. When you can't make a good joke so you just throw a bunch of f-words at the viewers. Real classy. Maybe kids or idiots like that, I wouldn't know. 2. Things that make no sense - so the main plot really makes very little sense, but that wasn't the only thing, oh not even close... 3. Main characters are shallow and very poorly written - the main character was seriously badly written, the dialogue with his son, dear god... His son kills more innocent people than most characters in the movie and is totally okay with it, and all this after they tried to picture the boy like this fragile creature who suffers from bullies because of being different. The female scientist character also follows the main character along those lines. Main bad guy also, horrible role. Not to say these actors were bad, but their roles were horrible. 4. 0 suspense and crappy jokes all the way - the movie really fails to make viewers care about what is going to happen next and generally about the characters. What little suspense they create, they manage to dillute with badly-placed crappy jokes. 5. I'm going to bed soon so I'm gonna stop there. In conclusion, this is a unworthy successor of the Predator franchise. Totally ruins it. Makes you feel cringe and saying to yourself ""What the f is this?"" throughout the movie. Whoever wrote this script and directed this, should not make movies any more. However, after you read this and your expectations are really lowered, you might slightly like the movie, so there's that."

Contrary to false-positives with that argument, who claim that getting what you want behind the barrel of a gun CAN work anywhere, somehow means that the claimed context of needing-to-'defend'-oneself,

this fantasy, had not retained some foothold, in reality, OUTside of countries like Italy, the USA, Russia (neo adoptions of perceived indivdualist incentives), Japan, and to smaller degrees in satellite states, states heavily affected by the influence of those exporting so-called culture-OF superpowers or states that have accellerated technological innovation particularly,

--------

This film is a HOPELESS SHAMBOLIC MESS, of all of the above, as well as poor camerawork / fast-paced action-thriller inappropriate editing (predator was atmospheric and SLOW, for the most part,.. STEALTH like ... except for perhaps the initial raid on the camp) ,

is another of those where many of the scenes are uneccessarily zoomed-in too far, and what ... everyone slows down the time on the DVD player / app, to work out what each character did, scene by scene?

Hmm, or,.. most just pretend as though they caught what just happened, and ACT like they appreciate / like what they just saw.

The same criticism is fair when it comes to MA films, where is too much compressed into too little a amount of actual film-time, and no matter how well chosen and planned the scene has been set up, the capturing and choice of not slowing time down, makes it little more than a blur, and there's little point in actually trying to watch them, in disdain about the trying to out-do each other as MA directors able to 'compress'.

Cybernetics, and maybe GE,.. not skill,..

will allow us to compress our perception of time.

Like that, better SET scenes, portray the MOVEMENT BETWEEN scenes, as the diaglogue, or action, RESOLVES each scene, in between each movement.

I.e.

Scene, movement, scene, movement

overlapping.

But if you're the sort who watches a film expecting this sort of thing and are fine with it, well then I hope you don't have kids.

That really is my major complaint with this film which was otherwise mediocre in content, and so not a patch on the original, but still would have been more or less okay without the language. Sad to think that its producers must have assumed the low brow chatter would be fine with and even attract more of the audience they were aiming at.

Beautiful CGI, excellent casting and acting, some really funny jokes and humor all-round, amazing action, upgrades to the lore itself. It put a spin on the usual predator but paid homage to it.

Shane, you DID make a movie audiences loved. It's a modern take on a classic. It did it justice all the way.

What next? Are they going to film something like ""Predator vs. My Little Pony""? Or ""A Barbie Holliday with Predator""?

The loonies, the genius kid, Olivia Munn's character do not belong in a Predator film. The pseudo-funny one-liners are too stupid.

The predator dogs are so stupid! What were they thinking?

And the thing about the predators using DNA to improve themselves? I guess the were expecting to have a sequel where Predator would like humans, thus saving costume and make-up costs...

Gone is the suspense and the scare factor that sparked so much applause in the original. Instead what we're left with is a dull uninteresting film poisoned with bad language, dialogue and acting. As for the script, only heaven knows what Black was smoking when he came up with this excuse of a sequel. It's the Terminator all over again and it will take a James Cameron to save it.

Avoid."
1.0,21 August 2019,"I have seen many movies and I am quite generous with the stars. However, this is the first movie, which I have ever rated with one star only. Only star is to see Olivia Munn in action :-)

I am a big Predator franchise fan. After well received ""The Predators"" from 2010 , I hoped for further success of the franchise. What ""Predator - Upgrade"" delivered was not only disappointing, it was almost insulting for the franchise fans. The plot was like a comic book for school kids, however with pointless jokes for adults. The actions scenes has no tension at all. The scene with the both Predators was so short and flat (compare to The Predators). In general, the movie reminded me more on Transformers franchise than Predator. I am just happy to see it in TV without paying VoD or theater tickets.

I am so sorry for the cast such as Thomas Jane to be part of this movie disaster."
1.0,21 September 2019,"Linked my amazon account/made an IMDb account just for this. As a movie, a B category at best; pretty bad sci-fi/action and im the type that likes most movies. As a ""predator"" franchise entry, an insult and a reason for shame to anyone who takes upon himself to handle something from the franchise, even compared to the ""avp"" spin-offs. bottom line, b category transformers/suicide squad wannabe/knock-off. shane black, just because you were an actor in the first ""predator""a million years ago..."

5.0,11 April 2022,"The original ""Predator"" movie was great and it didn't take long for me to notice this sequel falls well short. After the sedatives wear off, it felt like a Three Stooges moment. The thing is an alien and the scientists are just treating it like a hostile patient being restrained. The only real draw for me was Olivia Munn, who I didn't recognize right away because of her long hair. Maybe some other day."
1.0,2 January 2019,"This movie was complete garbage. The story made no sense and the script might as well have been written by a ten year old kid. The tone of the movie was inconsistent from the opening scene. Is this an action movie, a comedy or a drama? Apparently Shane Black had no idea either. My only hope now is that this won't be the last entry in the franchise and hopefully the fans can get redemption for being duped into watching this flaming, dumpster fire. This is by far the worst movie in the Predator franchise. Don't waste your time."
2.0,15 December 2018,Just watched predator I can understand the low score bad story gd acting the film wasn't the best I've seen as a reboot but its not the worst compered to the original it was terrible I gave it a 5 just for the effort
1.0,27 November 2018,
1.0,17 September 2018,"Being an Absolute 'Predator' fan , I had to watch this . To start off , IMHO , this has to be the Best Predator movie after the 'Original' . In the 'Original' , the director has to build the plot in the beginning in order to get Audience hooked until the end of the film , but here , the director knows fully well that the Audience knows the base plot of the movie ,i.e., An alien from the sky lands on earth to dominate the human species . Having assuming that the Audience know this plot , the director takes full advantage of that , and zips past the introduction and then zooms straight into the story ,which is why , I'd give 2 thumbs up for that ! .

And man ,what a comfort it is, when you know that you're at the belly of the story and you only know that , this thing can go any which way . The cast is great ,and they move effortlessly with the story . They keep you guessing every moment . All dialogues were quite well written . Olivia Munn definitely adds spice to the movie ,it felt like ,she was only made for this role . She was great .Only thing that I do have a hesitation about is ,the climax action scene , they could've toned it down a little bit ,u know to make it more believable .

Other than that , the pace of the movie which was set during the start of the movie ,never wears off until the end , which is the one thing that future Predator directors have to keep in mind . Not just the pace , but also the story gotta develop beautifully in tandem . If they do that ,nobody will ever get exhausted , even if they make a '100' 'predator' movies in the near future .. you know what I mean ... right ? :)..."

5.0,21 December 2018,"This was so bad. We laughed only because it was literally that bad. The editing couldn't have been worse - you can easily see where things were poorly edited (kid has alien device on left arm, cut to a new angle, its gone, cut back, its there again) and the dialogue was terrible. No believability in the sequence of events and even some of the funniest deaths were glazed over. The ending was just awful. So sad - the last Predator was miles better and i think this just killed the franchise. Wow... Didn't this get run by any test audiences first or a decent editing team? Its that bad... A low level B movie style action with slightly better graphics."
3.0,5 May 2019,The list of things wrong with this movie are too long to list here. You literally could not pay me to watch this mess again...
2.0,26 September 2018,"Predator offers comedy, intentional or not. The best way to describe how I feel the producers approached this film was a lazy attempt at a cash cow. Almost as if the screenwriter's storyboarding consisted in a shed and box's full of Mountain Dew. Bring back the Predator make it fight a bigger one and include a few action set pieces here or there. That's the pitch for the film right there. The one redeeming quality of the film was the improv style acting of the cast which did make me laugh. That laughter continued but in the same aspect sharknado would do. Although it wasn't as outrageous unfortunately, then maybe I might have laughed harder. Personally despite its failure on every level to make just a satisfactory film for predator fans, the film was enjoyable, but not for the right reasons."
1.0,23 September 2018,"I grew up watching action movies with my Dad. Predator is a favorite. And this movie has the feeling of the predator movies while evolving the storyline. The camaraderie between the characters, the acting and the writing I thought wonderfully done. I really don't understand the poor reviews. I cannot wait to see it again."
8.0,23 July 2021,"The 2018 Predator is no longer as terrible as Predators, but it is not near the original dilogy. We can say that Predator 2018 is a soft restart of the franchise with many references to the original and scenes not included in the original film. But the new Predator is still an average film, ranging from a dumb linear plot and a boring action, to just a terribly similar and uninteresting main antagonist. A restart that the franchise did not need. The last 20 years, the Predator series is only tormented, it is better to leave it. And shoot something new and original."

2.0,9 March 2019,"Incase they hadn't quite finished off the series enough with the abominations after the first two movies , they have released this steaming pile of nonsense.

somehow they have manage to turn the series in to even more of a joke, losing absolutely everything that made predator an amazing film and replacing it all with slap stick humour and pointless violence, it's not funny it's full of terrible acting, the story is garbage it literally brings nothing to the table.

It's not good in any way shape or form, I have lost 1.45 hours of my life that i will never get that back and have nothing to show for it other than an overwhelming desire to voice my utter destain on here in the vane hope that some other poor soul will avoid this pile of trash."
1.0,19 September 2018,"I entered the theater and took my seat with an open mind set on how the film can entertain me. Thankfully I wasn't disappointed with the production quality of this film in its entirety. The cast was confident , witty and at times had me wondering what was going to happen next. The first predator or normal Predator as well call him didn't appear to be anything out of the ordinary depiction under the first two Predator films. This is a good thing because it allows me to maintain immersion and the suspension of disbelief. Given minor changes have been made to the Predators abilities this allowed me to maintain the suspension of disbelief. The movie is very visceral and delivers in accordance to the title of the film. The production was solid and I'm glad the changes were made after the test screening. This film is one that I expect to buy on Blu-ray and look forward towards future releases. This film couldn't have happened without talented actors and everybody involved in the creation of this product."
2.0,2 October 2018,
8.0,7 October 2018,The movie isn't as bad as some other movies in the franchise but it doesn't get close to the best of the series the kills aren't interesting for the most part and it's not just predators killing people but people killing people for the most part until about the last 20 minutes the predator barely does anything and there are a lot of plot holes that happen during the movie and the one liners aren't as remarkable as the first predator movie but there are some good one liners and there are some good things like the predators fighting and some of the characters have interesting backstories but overall the movie makes you feel underwhelmed by the experience and wanting more
3.0,15 September 2019,Possibly the worse sequel of all time it played out like a total comedy and I know all predator movies have a dak sense of humour running through thier veins. But seriously I could not believe what I was watching the franchise is destroyed if this is its last incarnation. If you are a fan of predator and AVP movies avoid this. If however you want to marvel at a slapstick send up of predator that has no redeeming qualities go ahead.
5.0,16 September 2018,What can I say? Was it a comedy? Was it a horror show? Was it a parody of its own self? Choose one or all.
2.0,23 December 2018,"It was a very disappointing movie experience for me, to say the least. I tried really hard to take the scenes and dialogues seriously, but none lived up to my expectations. The actors did what they could, maybe the script wasn't so good. They could have just left it as it was back in 1987, Arnold Schwarzenegger and his cast did an awesome job."
3.0,6 January 2020,"This movie was great. Sometimes franchises switch it up like Thor: Ragnorok for example. This movie was entertaining from start to finish and I laughed multiple times with dece action.

All these fanboys are just being a bunch of nerds."
1.0,18 December 2018,"When I heard this film was going to be ""more comedic"" I was nervous. But I was also hopeful because Shane Black recently crafted a solid, smart and refreshing action/comedy in The Nice Guys. I honestly don't enjoy bashing ANY film, especially something like The Predator, which I was excited about. I respect film, and what filmmakers do to make any movie at all is not an easy feat in the slightest. That being said, The Predator just does not work. I was into it and on board the first 20-30 minutes, and then it just tanks. The comedy is actually a bit embarrassing. There are way too many characters and pretty much all of them are useless and only there to add ""comedic flair."" Thomas Jane, who I've always liked as an actor, feels off or maybe just miscast. His characters Tourette's syndrome is only there to generate laughs (which it doesn't), no other reason for it, which just comes off offensive, and I'm not easily offended. It's many unjustified choices like this that plague this movie.

Like I said in the subject line, there is some good Predator action. I think fans will be pleased in small doses, but the rest is particularly bloated and unnecessary. The subplot with Boyd Holbrook's son and his ex takes up way too much time. There's a sequence that takes place on Halloween that I just can't forgive. There are some scenes where I wondered if I was watching a Predator film. These characters are being hunted by a Predator, and yet none of them seem to feel or care that their lives are in danger (except for maybe Holbrook and Munn). They just make jokes instead! It completely destroys the tension and horror that the original (and even the underrated Predator 2) maintained throughout. While the original was simple and extremely effective, The Predator is bloated, meandering and unfortunately stumbles in the process."
8.0,16 December 2018,A very poor action comedy movie. Waste of time and money. Avoid it.

3.0,19 December 2018,
3.0,18 January 2019,"This is not a good movie. The characters are unlikable and completely unrelatable, the motives of the shady government researchers are cryptic at best and the coincidence machine goes into meltdown several times here. The plot has enough holes in it to be considered a fishing net.

It is a pity really, because there are some top rate actors in this. Boyd Holbrook from Narcos, Olivia Munn from X-Men and The Newsroom, Sterling K. Brown from Black Panther, Alfie Allen from Game of Thrones, Jake Busey from Starship Troopers and so many others. It even has Yvonne Strahovski from Handmaid's Tale. I thought it might be the script or direction, but Shane Black has some fairly good writing credentials under his belt and while his direction isn't as stellar, I can't see that being why this film is so bad.

My only thought is that it may have tried to stick too close to a comic it was based on - similar to what happened with Watchmen. Whatever the reason, this is a mess and if you are looking forward to seeing it you'll probably be mightily disappointed. Try to keep the expectations low before watching."
4.0,24 December 2018,First review ever... Shane black is a dialogue master. I cared about the characters. Sets the franchise up for multiple possibilities. Including a way to out think the alien hunters. Lots of great ways to go in the future if studios see the possibilities. It wasn't the first movie... It never will be. But as a movie on its own... With great characters and great ideas. Don't miss it. Hope the studios move the story forward. Great flick.

1.0,23 September 2018,"Welcome to the new age where not all has to be recycled with same formula. Sometimes, when it's worked, it did worked. In fact, it worked really well with current timeline.

2.0,13 November 2021,"This has become a bit of a guilty pleasure of mine. Despite the underdeveloped characters, horrendous dialogue, crappy CGI, unfunny comedy, ridiculous plot-holes, poorly thought-out editing, ineffective sentimentality, and lack of tension, I love this alien and I love watching him do his thing. But on top of that, as someone who has Aspergers syndrome, I can laugh at this movie's ridiculous depiction of it. And I'm just as insulted by it as I am amused.

I don't agree with the idea that Shane Black is a hack;

The Nice Guys

Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang

Lethal Weapon

Monster Squad

Iron Man 3 (I don't care what anyone says, this movie is underrated. I'd go so far as to call it one of the best Marvel movies.)

And when you watch the behind-the-scenes footage and the interviews he gave for this movie, you can tell that he cared. But I don't know how you write something as good as Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang or The Nice Guys and then write something this awful.

There is one thing I can say in the way of praise: 1.) The Predator costume they made for parkour athlete James Alexander Prince was fantastic!

Personal points: Despite it being purely superficial, slapsticky, and poorly filmed it all was, I have fun watching the Predators kill people.

Also, and this is probably an unpopular opinion, but I think Predator 2 is a much worse movie than this one. I can find things to laugh at with this movie. I get little enjoyment out of watching Predator 2. And at least this movie doesn't look hideous and the ADR isn't noticeable."
1.0,9 May 2021,"I held off as long as I could, because I saw it'd be a mess just from the trailer alone. Now, 40 minutes in, I realize this was a huge mistake. What a bunch of drivel this movie is. It even makes AvP: Requiem look amazing in comparison and that's saying A LOT.

Hollywood's latest fad notwithstanding, I thought it would be a throwback to the original thrill and intensity of the first movie. It fails that mission badly. This parody of a Predator film seems aimed at 12 - 14 year old demographic. The jokes and the oddly elongated scenes are cute the first couple times but then get boring. In short too much comedy not enough excitement. The writing has all the finesse of a term paper written on the eve of the last day of class. The Predator is a Darth Vader class icon(stretching a tad). How can these people keep messing this up?"

4.0,7 December 2018,"The tone of this movie really sells it, which... I was not at all expecting. Every character in this movie is a dumb-as-bricks action movie homunculus, the type of person that could not possibly exist in the real world. Like half of the character concepts are genuinely offensive, but oh my god do a lot of the actors sell it. The guy with Tourette's is such a bad concept for a comic relief, but Thomas Jane is absolutely delightful on charisma alone. Olivia Munn takes ""blank slate scientist woman"" and basically plays her like a special forces soldier or something, and it's a frequently pleasant surprise to see her sidestep cliche bs throughout the flick.

Trevante Rhodes is hands-down the highlight as Nebraska - the fact that he is not the hero of this movie is baffling. His character is so exquisitely Predator, done so well. I also honestly loved the over-the-top villain, which again, Sterling Brown fully saves by embracing the shlock and hamming it up. He's great.

The others? Eh? The main character is just John Man: Professional Soldier, and it sucks. I like Keegan-Michael Key but god is he miscast in this. I can't remember any other character, so, yeah, the rest are pretty bad.

Other thing I really wanted to call out is the way they do gore in this, which absolutely rules. I have to imagine a lot of this is practical effects, but even if it's not, they have fun with it and don't shy away from a gross, crazy kill. Action scenes are all over the map - some are genuinely fantastic, to the point that I recommend people to this movie. Others are cosmically bland and uninteresting. The climax of this movie, unfortunately, is one such watch-watcher, where there's all this CG and scene changes and flying around and god, who cares?

This is a movie with some great, great stuff buried under more than enough bland action movie crap to make it overall not very good. The plot, for example, is amazingly bad. The main villain is theeeeee least creative, least interesting idea you can imagine. The monsters - and yeah, this movie has them - are mostly just comical. The locations are all over the place.

But when this movie's good, it is so, so fun.

The plot is"

2.0,17 September 2018,"The Predator. Not the Predator your dad loves.

As a critic of movies, over the years I've come to profoundly love the only two Predator movies that exist in my eyes.

Predator and Predator 2.

We saw the evolution of the franchise and where it was going.

Predator 2 taught us that we already knew of the Yautja race. We were already trying to capture one to see what we could learn.

This film is a great continuation of the story, directly ignoring AvP, AvP: Requiem and Predators. You already knew that, so don't get angry. It's not a spoiler.

From the get go you're treated to the gore and profanity you'd come to expect from a Predator movie, it's not dialed down for the masses.

The hunt truly has evolved.

A continuation, self fladulation and gratitutios appreciation for what came before and what's to follow.

The new team is exactly NOT what you're expecting which refreshes the ideals that you needed.

Shane Black knew exactly what he was doing when he cut the trailers and released them and you, yourselves, will know what I mean when you've seen the film.

It's a solid 8 out of ten.

Sure, it's not without flaw but, what is these days?

Maybe it was a little too short but, the comical aspect and treatment of soldiers was pristine.

Go see it for yourself.

You'll agree."

What's so wrong with that? Even the second ALIEN film, the one with all the soldiers, knew that trying to recapture the once-in-a-lifetime magic of the first film was an exercise in futility, so they went a completely different direction, and it was awesome. This film is kinda' like that. It's not the same-old same-old, and I'm as picky as they come, but I very much enjoyed this fun take on an aging franchise."

1.0,15 March 2019,"Is this an epic, groundbreaking, perfect film? Of course not.

Like every film in the Predator franchise, it's an imperfect popcorn watch with some great moments spread throughout. The rampant hatred on this board isn't a surprise; beloved films often produce a diehard fanbase with unrealistic notions of what the original films were, and unrealistic expectations regarding future franchise entries. But surprise or not, this overreaction is wrong.

If the original movie had been Gone With The Wind or Citizen Kane, you'd perhaps have a reason to decry the choices that this new film makes. But the first Predator film was a cheesy action/science fiction and so is this.

I haven't included any spoilers because all I wanted to do was ask people to give the damn film a chance to breathe. I gave it an 8 in the vain hope of countering the tide of 1s. It's probably not a 8 exactly, but anyone using the 1 rating - unless it's for a Breen or Shore film - is deluded and being totally unfair.

3.0,17 September 2018,Very funny and very violent with interesting message about autism which was actually written about before the film. My cinema was laughing alot and seemed to enjoy this. It's like Stranger Things meets The Predator
3.0,29 November 2018,"I generally like spoofs. When done well they can be surprisingly enjoyable. This movie is neither serious enough nor is it funny enough. If you value your time, find something else to do/watch!"
4.0,23 December 2018,"You had a chance to make something good. The movie is at this Disaster, you have ruined the franchise for ever. No respect for the thriller and suspense of the original.

This movie should erased from the books as if never existed. I want my $5.99 I paid for the rental."
8.0,15 January 2019,"This is a decent comedy movie. The laughs are good and plentiful. But I was seriously wondering if this was ""supposed"" to be a comedy movie. ""The Predator"" does not sound like a comedy when i say it aloud. But lets move on. IT is definitely trying to be a comedy...But why? I am not sure..... That was earth at the beginning? I thought that was an alien planet. Wait, the military is supposed to be keeping him locked up..but so why is he being transported with the regular prisoners?. Do not try to question the movie."
1.0,29 September 2018,Just to reply to this user. The AVP movies are not part of either the Predator or the Alien franchises.
1.0,25 September 2018,"When I found out Shane black was directing this movie I was so excited I would tell all my friends don't worry Shane black is the director if anyone knows what the predator movies are all about its him!!! How wrong was I. Any decent predator fan could of come up with a better way of portraying the predator,This film is a comedy with jokes that my 7 year old nephew would find funny , but at the same time there is enough gore that my wife would go ewww. Who was this film aimed at? Predator dogs that become more friendly than Lassie, a main character that was grabbed straight from Logan and put in to the predator movie . An ending that Tony Stark would be proud of. For all predator fans don't bother watching Am just so gutted not been this let down since terminator 3"
5.0,17 September 2018,This is not a typical predator film. But money well worth spent especially if your a true predator fan. Shane black did a great job with writing and directing this film.
3.0,15 December 2018,Really Shane Black?? This is what all the waiting and build up was for ?.. This was just awful and painful to watch .Hopefully this is not the final nail in the coffin for the franchise.🤞
1.0,6 December 2021,"This is one of worst movies I've ever seen. If it was a parody it would still be bad. They got a great franchise with an established mysterious species that only care for hunting and turned them into a speaking, humanized, stupid, dude giving moral lessons about one of the many species from the many planets they met and never cared about. Absolutely ruining all the mystery and anything interesting about the predators.

The whole plot is stupid. A kid finding the predator's mask... really? That's the plot? I'd expect that from a kids movie, not from a Predator movie. All the characters are as deep as a puddle with a single droplet of water. You can define all of them with a maximum of 4 words. Some even less.

Plus, is it a ""horror""? Comedy? Stand up? Kid's movie? What is it?

Nothing in this movie is even close to be funny. And it tries a lot to be. The hurr ""It's not a predator"" thing is so annoying. The acting is awful, soundtrack is terrible, CGI predator is sad, script is eww.

If it was a standalone movie I wouldn't care. Would've just drop it in the first 5 minutes. But this movie existence makes it waaaay too hard now to make a new predator movie that's good. How am I gonna be scared or intrigued if I'm going to remember that the predator is a CGI dude that watches human TV and tries to give a Twitter's level of moral lessons?

Thank you for ruining it."

Same with latest frenchise installments i suppose...like star wars.. new generation of kis will enjoy it just as much as we did when we were kids. But what the difference was is that the original ones treated us like adults thats what made them so darn cool. This new movie was just for noone. I hope a new Aliem comedy will follow soon or a Terminator rom com and we are done here people!"
8.0,15 December 2018,"Its horrible! The acting is excruciating, but that might be due to the bad writing. It makes zero sense and everything about this movie is so wrong. Its NOT funny, its NOT scary, its NOT thrilling.. It IS however a complete waste of your time! Anyone giving this movie 10 stars MUST be related to someone on set.. I refuse to believe that a person with any modicum of filmic experience would find this movie enjoyable.."
4.0,26 December 2018,"I was being generous when I gave this a 2, the screenplay is terrible and the plot is all over the place, half the time you don't know what is going on. I went into this a massive predator fan and found this hard to watch. It upsets me to find that this is considered a (Sci-Fi thriller) which is very upsetting they have turned one of the most loved sci-fi franchises into this chewed up garbage. I gave this a 2 only because the predator does some cool violent stuff as we expect from this franchise, that is he only good thing I took from this."
4.0,13 July 2021,"The most disappointing part in this film is the unimaginative title which makes you expect the worst. I think it should be called Predator 4. In this case I might even be tempted to raise the rating. What I mean by this that the movie felt at least like a proper sequel, and not an abomination you want to forget for the rest of your life.

It's of course not as good as the first two films (and I haven't seen Predators), but I put it above many other recent sequels. For example I think I enjoyed this movie more than Prometheus and Alien: Covenant, and the latest Terminator films. Somewhere on the same level would be Alien:Resurrection and AVP...which of course doesn't mean a masterpiece but also perhaps not the ultimate bottom of the barrel.

I liked some of the characters, and I thought the plot was interesting enough. Special effects were pretty standard nowadays stuff and the predator was on the screen so often that there was no mystery or suspense like in the originals. In the past Predator used to be this super-cool monster everybody is talking about, but now he's just a quite basic monsterman that could be an enemy in Marvel movies.

Despite the flaws I was surprisingly entertained and not bored. It's quite simple action flick but it kind of works because it doesn't try to be anything more than that."
3.0,8 May 2019,Predator 2018 is not as bad from the reviews others have posted. In fact it is a very good entertaining movie. The main cast is an assemble of outlaw soldiers that have good chemistry and makes the movie work. Many times I laughed at how well each character played off one another to deliver good funny moments. You would think these guys had been friends for years. The Predator scenes were awesome and surprisingly gory as many of the kill scenes showed new and innovative ways the Predator kills his prey. As a fan of all the Predator films this one holds it's own. Good action with just the right amount comedy mixed in made this film highly enjoyable.
1.0,21 September 2018,Who employs Shane black and puts restraints on him. I can understand why fix are being brought by Disney.
1.0,9 January 2022,"Like it's a video game.

This movie was weak, I cannot recommend for watching. Don't count on coherent story or well writen characters whom you can emphatize with."
8.0,20 December 2018,"It is amazing how a member of the original cast who should be proud of the first Predator movie and who should praise and appreciate the original spoiled and put it to shame.... Still the only worthy movie is the first one but I thought Yesss... it can go back to the roots with Shane Black.... but no not at all.... What a pity... or rather... shame. A big expectation went into nothing or rather anger. Shame, shame, shame.... Shan Black should not touch the Predator..."
5.0,15 December 2018,"The original movie was simple, an alien killing soldiers in the jungle for sport.

This movie tries to combine several plots together. We have a mad scientist/soldier, a ""fugitive"" plot where a predator is escaping and there is another predator chasing him down, a bunch of misfit soldiers (one too many by the way), an experiment of some sorts near a waterfall-underground-secret-lab setting and....get this....a smart kid who can decode alien technology..... Did I miss something? Yes, the kid is like some kind of improvement on our current crop of human species....

The movie gets a decent rating out of respect for the actors involved, who have done some decent work in the past. The special effects are also better than the original 80s movie, of course. Otherwise the movie should have been better."
4.0,24 December 2018,"No matter how big a fan of the predator franchise you are, do yourself a huge favor and don't watch this trainwreck.

It's an insult to the original movies. Hell, it's even an insult to the AvP movies."
5.0,25 September 2018,"Made an account to keep people from throwing the movie under the busbecause just like people who saw any of the star wars movies past the original are losing their minds yet again when it goes down a more modern path and bashing it.

1st off I'm very picky with the movies I enjoy I loved the original predator movie with the run for your life horror tone. These films set a basis for future films to be dark gritty and fear filled but let's be honest. In a post marvel movie world there is a specific formula to movies now that just works.

This predator is different from the rest you're not getting some hide in the shadows at all times predator hunting terrified people this time you're getting in your face predator close quarter combat against crazy soldiers looking to take it down because they are literally crazy. You get to finally see this hunter kill at its rawest form. There is CGI and practical effects in this film the CGI is there when needed I hate when people complain about CGI it's 2018 with higher resolution and crisper displays you can see the costumes now guys I'm sorry a guy in a costume isn't going to pull off some of the crazy things aliens can do either like jumping and rolling from a roof at an insane speed without looking dumb. The amount of movement in this film Is great unlike previous predator films where they always seemed static or just overly bulky and slow this film you see it finally open up. There are some cool canon Easter eggs in the film that tie in other films.

Now on to the part everyone is complaining about...the comedy yes there are a few jokes in this film but they work in my opinion. This is not the first time the predator has been to earth at this point the government does know about them to an extent and are way better prepared than they were before... again to an extent. There are only so many times you can make a movie about an alien hunting humans before humans start to hunt back it's that simple. This fresh take blended comedy with action and interesting style of gore I never had to look at my watch and was engaged the entire time this movie even did a great nod to children with gifts. If you detach yourself from your 80's nostalgia and stop wanting the same movie over and over again you will actually enjoy this movie. It's action packed filled with gore and callbacks.

Basically if you hated the last Jedi you will not like this film. Best way to put it nostalgia is haunting the progression of stories it's time to let go get the stick out of your butt and enjoy films again. What worked in the 80's doesn't work in the 2010's."
5.0,1 January 2019,Disappointing predator movie and missed opportunity to reboot a great concept character... like iron man 3 and last action hero Shane Black seems to only have one story line theme which is inserting 12 year old boys into hi budget action film story lines .. it just seems to water down the suspense factor in these movies. I hope Hollywood keeps trying to get this one right
2.0,19 December 2018,"If only the movie stayed a parody throughout the whole run time, this would be an 8. Sadly after 30-40 minutes there is a complete turn in style and tries to be serious, but at the same making zero sense plot-wise."

5.0,17 March 2019,"Usually, even bad sci-fi can be entertaining. This movie is worse than a college project movie. And right out of the gate too. The opening scene looks exactly like two model spaceships swinging from string. Every character is predictable. The soundtrack is the only indication to any possible suspense. The premise is insultingly ridiculous. But the worst crime is, at no point did I suspend disbelief. When Olivia Munn asks, ""Is this a joke?"", I found myself wondering the same thing. I may as well have rolled up $10 and burned it. I can't believe this dog is part of the Predator franchise."

I think the bad reviews come from the general non-seriousness of this movie. It is a more light and funny plot unlike the prior installments. But in all justice this one pulls off both the action and the comedy pretty well. CGI is also top notch. I rate this as an A class scifi/comedy.

Do yourself a favor and watch without any expectations. You may be pleasantly surprised like I was."

3.0,2 November 2021,"The Predator (2018) is a movie that I did NOT enjoy. I feel like due to the creation of so many Predator movies, the creators simply don't know how to innovate the story anymore. The movie's assets are the special effects and picture quality. The story is way over the top! I disagree with what is happening on the screen. I appreciate the effort of trying new things, but I think that the Predator franchise does not benefit from excessive comedic scenes. The acting was fine. I just don't like the direction of the story.

Overall, The Predator (2018) is an average mediocre movie that is watchable if you comply with the story.

Would I want to rewatch it? : Unlikely."

5.0,8 May 2019,"Not exactly on the level of the original Predator movie, but big fun for us Predator fans, adding the evolved super predator into the mix. it was neat to see Theon Greyjoy from GoT in a minor role, and Key from Key & Peele. the juvenile lockerroom humor also made me laugh!"
1.0,13 December 2018,"Not good honestly. Poor writing, mediocre acting, terrible script. This was a sprint between action scenes to eliminate characters whose lines consisted of 80% f-boys and little else. Then to top it off one of the major reasons for the predators coming the earth was ""climate change"". Yes, I am serious. A core theme of the movie was the ""climate change"" without anything th substantiate it. 🙄"
1.0,29 November 2018,"When you ride a roller coaster there's all that build up of anticipation as you ride slowly up towards the big drop and then, when finally do start the plummet, all that energy is released and your whim has been sated. This Predator movie is no build up, only the big drop. There is no tension. There is only the volume cranked up to 10 and the constant ""big drop"" and the terrible one liners that fake real dialogue between the many characters that all have the same personality. Shane Black's The Predator suffers from many things but the worst is not having any build up or time to reflect on what is happening. There is no time to care or feel any excitement. There is only time for disappointment as you plunge into this awful feeling that you've watched a wet dream of some out of touch Hollywood producers. And, while this film probably doesn't deserve the one star rating I'm giving it, it most certainly doesn't deserve any rating over a 4 and all the 10's propping it up to a 6"
8.0,22 January 2019,"The movie was not so good, the only true perfect predator movie is the ""Predator"" the first one of all! Why can't they make another as good as the first one? This movie feels like sort of a parody of the Predator movie."
1.0,29 September 2018,Wasted R rating with Marvel style filming. Potential in the storyline but wasted. Humour presented in the wrong way. I'd give it 10 for effort in ruining the franchise even further. Came across like one big joke. Only got 3 due to the odd interesting glimmer of info in some of the storyline. Let's hope somewhere in the future somebody will take the potential in this and do something with it that doesn't result in watching a film and feeling like somebody is having a laugh at your expense.

3.0,20 December 2018,"I don't even know where to begin with this mess. I'm still in shock firstly how this was ever allowed to be made, and secondly who decided it should be a comedy. I have watched the original predator movie over 50 times and never get bored of watching it, that's how great it is. It is one of the greatest movies ever made in any genre. After 20 minutes of watching this comedy version of the Predator I was bored and didn't last much longer than 30 mins before I turned this absolute piece of cr*p off. Someone has spent $88 million on this. Let that sink in, people starving in the world, people living homeless on the streets, and they decided to splash $88 million on this travesty of a film. Olivia Munn's ""Acting"" is something that would better off be showcased in a Sharknado movie, But never mind, she's pretty so it doesn't really matter right? . The constant swearing and crude language is cringe-worthy, no idea where this idea came from. Everything about this movie is a joke, the story line, the acting, the behavior of the characters and predators, the location, everything. I'm glad to see the last 40-50 reviews on here have given this a 1/10, it doesn't even deserve that, the fact it still sits at 5.5/10 just shows how corrupt and fake the voting is on this site, because pretty much every review I've come across gave it 1/10. If you are a fan of the franchise from the original movies and are curious about this movie, just like I was, please, please...don't make the mistake I did and watch it, it will ruin everything for you and you WILL regret ever watching it. In comparison to this movie AVP is a top 10 ATG movie."
3.0,21 December 2018,"I wouldn't even say it's a B movie, maybe a C or a D. You'd get better quality from a Netflix Original."
8.0,1 September 2019,"Helmed by director Shane Black, THE PREDATOR is an odd creature of a movie that at times feel as much a gene spliced monster as the ""upgrade"" Predator which features as the main antagonist of the story. It splices elements of other movies that audiences seem to drawn to such as the lighthearted snarky comedy of marvel cinematic universe, well written kid characters from the 2017 IT remake, the R Rated violence of JOHN WICK and a relevant social issue which in this case seems to be mental conditions. It is big, it is imposing, but it is not necessarily stronger or more impressive.

Our story begins by establishing our main character: sniper extraordinaire Quinn McKenna. He's a badass with issues. During a mission he encounters a crashed alien spaceship and comes into possession of some alien tech which he mails home to keep it out of the government's reach. But the ship had an occupant too who is captured by the Stargazer project, an extraterrestrial monitoring organisation. Now McKenna's Son, who is autistic, somehow manages to activate the alien tech which draws another meaner and bigger alien Predator to earth to retrieve the tech and crashed ship's occupant, who is soon revealed to be some sort of traitor to his race. McKenna must team up with a rag tag bunch of war veterans, who all have issues, to stop this new threat.

For me, THE PREDATOR is really a step down for the franchise. Take the main characters for instance. In the first movie they all had distinct personalities. In PREDATORS they were all from various different backgrounds. Here, Everyone of those veterans forming the main ""team"" is a snarky foul mouth with a new quip ever at the ready. There are some genuinely funny moments, even tender moments, but much of the emotional aspect is lost amid one too many ""trying to be funny"" scenes.

The director tries to bring attention to various mental issues like Autism and PTSD but unfortunately some of the symptoms are played for laughs. Ultimately the mental issues aspect just serves to give characters some unique tics rather than being used to get a deeper point across. Then again with such bland characters we could use anything to tell them apart.

The action is equally as bland. Most of the movie is set in a American suburban town and nearby forest. There is not much In The way of that suspenseful feeling of being hunted by a superior unseen foe since the foes are revealed in full visible glory early on. The one word to describe the directing is ""pedestrian"". You know, the bland medium shots, jittery cam during action scenes, the kind of camera angles you would expect from a less experienced director than Shane Black, particularly since this is amateurish when to his work on IRON MAN 3. Only the cinematography, courtesy of Larry Fong, adds to the atmosphere of the movie.

Another positive would be the music by Henry Jackman, paying homage to the iconic themes of the original while adding a sufficiently fresh touch. The actors also do their best with the forgettable script they are given. Standout performances include Thomas Jane (PUNISHER) as Baxley, the guy with Tourettes, and Keegan-Michael Kay as Coyle, the vulgar strutting one who is hiding a vulnerable secret.

While not a complete reboot of the franchise, THE PREDATOR does make some changes, especially in the titular aliens' motive for hunting humans. Long time fans will be hard pressed to accept this new direction after years of tie in media painting the titular Predators as honour bound warriors who test themselves by hunting only the most dangerous game. Here, they get painted more as scientists who harvest genetic material to introduce into their genes to improve their species.

I really wanted to like this movie much more than I did. The acting, cast chemistry, music and cinematography is great. But on the flip side it feels too juvenile with its incessant humour, bland action and lack of much depth. It would be intriguing to see how these latest story developments are incorporated in to sequels or tie in media but for now all we are left with is a mediocre movie experience."
4.0,22 July 2021,"It takes a tremendous amount of determination to squander a budged of 88M. The cast is an ill-spent asset. We know most of the actors from some very cherished series like, Newsroom, Narcos, Game of Thrones and The Expense.

This movie is a testament to the fact that you do not need a huge budged and good actors to take your story somewhere meaningful.

Young filmmakers take note: No amount of money will fulfill your movie if your screenwriting is this bad. Shane Black must have had long blackouts while he was filming this movie.

1.0,18 January 2019,"This film does an excellent job bringing the franchise to the modern day. It brings the feeling of the original movie but with its own feeling. Do not listen to the people that say that this killed the series, it is no where near that bad."
5.0,1 June 2019,"I honestly had a little hope for this movie; watching the trailers and being a big fan of action-aliens movies, I thought maybe this would be an innocent little entertainment train, something that maybe could take the stress off my shoulders and make me feel comfortable. But not at all.

I won't go into great detail on how disastrous this movie is, I don't also want to exaggerate the bad aspects of it, but the truth is, it's very bad and I can't think of anything good about it, maybe the only redeemable thing is the design of the predator itself, and yet it's not something that stands out much. The performance is bad, very childish, the dialogues are bad, trying to put comedy in every damn second, the story is very predictable, it's like trying to read a small comic but at the bottom of the page there is always a text that yells at you what will happen next. Not even the action scenes or the gore is something worthwhile, for me this movie was a complete disappointment, a sad attempt to try to revive the Predator saga that only ended up sinking it even more, this movie is ... is bad."
1.0,8 August 2022,"After binging all the different movies in the Predator-franchise, this one fit worst of all.

The movie was totally over-the-top with many unrealistic situations. They clearly tried to convert the Predator-franchise in some superhero-like action movie. At the end this even more confirmed: I will not spoil the experience, but you will know it when you see it. I for sure do not want to see a sequel of this movie in the way that is forecasted at the end.

What is also very annoying is the ""comedy"" they tried to put in the movie. It just did not fit the movie. I also did not like the main actor of the movie.

All-in-all, this movie just does not belong in the Predator-franchise. It is a really bad job done by the writers."
10.0,29 November 2018,"Lost for words! Worse than Predator 2 but not quite as bad as AVP2!! Cliched, desperately trying to be funny, messy and wholly amateurish!"
3.0,24 January 2019,
3.0,29 September 2018,I agree with other reviews. AVP2 is great compared to this crap. So much CGI. No reasoning for anything. And where the hell did those motorcycles come from?! Total garbage. I walked out of theater.
2.0,7 May 2019,"I was surprised to see the low scores for this movie. I'm not sure why people disliked it so much; I think this is probably my favorite ""Predator"" movie barring the first. But that one gets extra points for being the original idea and featuring Arnold getting his Rambo on.

For me, what makes these movies fun is a charismatic cast and a plot that isn't completely absurd, relatively speaking. This is probably the most talented cast in any of the movies, so check there. And the plot, while of course having a number of huge plot holes, actually adds some dimension beyond ""Predator lands, Predator hunts."" We get a little more detail about the Predators and what drives them, and some glimpses into their society, all of which I liked. And the film was smart enough not to take itself too seriously, throwing in some nicely done humor, so again check and check for what I enjoy.

I thought using soldiers with psychological issues was a great choice. Patriotic, as they all served and sacrificed for our country, but also sympathetic because of the frankly all to real trauma they endured. The story does occasionally suffer a little because of the size of the cast; some of the characters don't get fleshed out enough for us to really care about them and their scenes feel shoe-horned in, but I don't think the pacing was too badly damaged.

I suppose the movie could have taken a slightly more serious approach, but that's a fine line. The first movie took itself really serious, and a lot of that intensity has become kind of mockable over time, like a certain infamous scene where two tough guys lock arms and flex in a supposedly masculine show of camaraderie.

But I suppose everyone has their own favorite formula for action movies. I like a movie that's exciting but also relaxed enough to have fun, so this movie was right up my alley. Is it Shakespeare? No, obviously not. But is it fun and exciting? Yah, I think so."
1.0,11 September 2019,
1.0,26 September 2018,"I always admired the predator character for its fierce appearance, warrior stance and magnificent overall power and I wanted to see more of such characteristics when I decided to see this movie. I wasn't expecting too much from the story after reading other reviews but took the chance of seeing the predator in all its glorious magnificence. I have to say I misjudged how badly a very poor story line can affect the experience of a great character and I put it down to a complete lack of respect and I have to add, love, for the character. It was a forgettable movie and not worthy of the extraordinary character that is the predator."
8.0,16 November 2018,"Sorry Shane, this movie took a big steaming dump on top of the already festering nightmare that has become the Predator franchise. I will not bore anyone with a pulse on the many confusing plot angles, parody dialogue (get to the choppa?), dialed-in acting, all ex-military has full auto weapons at home, aaaaaaaarrrrrgggghhh!!!

I've been on imdb for over 13 years. This is the first review I've made, and I bit my tongue on reviewing the latest Mickey Star Wars clap. I'm that fed up.

Seriously Hollywood. please stop farting out trash like this or I'm liable to start reading again!"
4.0,30 September 2018,"This will be the last of the ""new"" movies I will patronize! Sick of the PC trash. The filthy ""F"" word is puked out constantly. Denegrading wemon as sex objects with all the filthy languge vomited out around the child star! Sick!

Global warming lies. ""Climate Change"" is a unproven theory that will kill civilization. Uses the standard Hollywood formula for PC! Disgusting!

The story and dialog ""writers"" stink!"
5.0,13 September 2021,"Yep, that's the highlight. The part where it finishes.

It's not good bad, it's bad bad. Really bad.

Nonsensical story line. Poor CGI. Lame acting, with a lot of the dialogue inaudible.

A complete trainwreck of a film, that I have no wish to ever see again.

The worst £6.90 I ever spent.

Avoid."
5.0,28 November 2018,Well ...... It was very good 🐵 the story was great kept me watching looked on my phone 1ns only so they kept me glued to be fiar well worth the watch suprices galore
2.0,15 December 2018,I wouldn't say the movie was terrible.Its not good either.Its just another action flick with lots of violence.I liked how they stepped on the gas pedal right from the word go without wasting too much time on setting things up.There are a few good action sequences.But there are a few places that are way too defying in logic.Its understandable why die-hard predator fans are pissed off at this movie.
1.0,9 November 2018,"I waited for this movie. really waited. but to watch it and just laugh? it's more of a funny comedy movie with some blood and nonsense. I thought it would be great as the old predator! I wasted my time on it. but still, laughed a bit."
10.0,17 November 2018,"Too much ""F"" words.. even the boy spoke that word.. the title should be the ""f"" predator.."
1.0,15 September 2018,"They... ruined it!! They had SO much existing material to work with between the books, comic books, movies, and games, yet it ended up so bad. I wanted so badly I like this, to log on and say 'well, the critics got this one wrong,' but I can't. They tried to expand it too much and lost the essence. They managed to take away the mystery and the fun of it. A lot of good characters and cast but bad pacing with the dialogue. Far too much CGI. Perhaps my biggest problem is with the sudden change in direction in the mythos. Predator is being turned into all the generic sci-fi's I don't bother to watch. So much wasted potential."
1.0,19 December 2018,"Why can't Shane Black go away? I really hated the cheesiness of the 80s cop buddy movies and was glad when 'Seven' jammed a stake in their hearts. We can't seem to get rid of Hollywood Mega-Hack Shane Black, though.

All the other Predator movies at least have some pretense of occurring in the real world. Nothing like that here as Black jams in every BS 80s action cliche with accompanying BS dialogue.

Hey, I just noticed, Shane Black, SB... BS? Yeah, stuff like that. Anyway there are some entertaining moments in this thing so I didn't give a 1 but I sure hope Black doesn't get the sequel he's fishing for at the end of this turd. No more, please."
1.0,2 December 2018,It was a really good movie and I don't understand what all the hate is about cause it was a well made movie and was really funny and had lots of action

Editing all over the place The score was out of place Characters underdeveloped Stagey in every sense CGI very poor Stupid plot, half of which uneccessary Waste of time Taking the mickey out of original?? It was liking a very bad version of the A Team

Ultimately: utter rubbish"
4.0,26 November 2020,
10.0,29 September 2018,"No hate here just giving my 2 cents. But I HATED this movie lol I literally could not comprehend what was going on. Bad CGI, poor story line, corny lines and jokes. I couldn't take it seriously. Predator is supposed to be scary, intense, keep you on the edge of your seat. This wasn't it man. So disappointed. More of a comedy. I can't believe some of the CGI back then looks better that today's. If you want the cheap CGI corny lines and quick action then have at it. Just my opinion. Should have done a sequel to Predators."
1.0,28 November 2018,"After seeing the ridiculous reviews/individual scores the film receives, I knew I had to watch it myself and hopefully bring some fairness to it. I have seen all predator movies (including the original one). To me the predator films are simply action flicks that involve the hunt, survival, gore and ultimately the death of the hunter. I was never a fan nor a hater of the franchise.

This apple of a film, apart from the cheesy and unnecessary adult humor, does not fall far from the tree. This is what I would expect out of the predator franchise. This film also expects you to already know what a predator is and proceeds straight into the action scenes.

For the action scenes, the CGI is decent and does not make the film less entertaining. Most people need to realize that CGI these days does not only involve space ships and aliens, most of the the 'realistic part' of the world can be composited and drawn using programs as well. It was clearly done by professionals and they did an okay job at it.

People who rate everything at the lowest score possible are either ignorant to the effort involved in making films like these or are just simply frustrated that the perfect script they had in mind after the original predator movie did not come into fruition.

All the predator and AVP series are mediocre at best. They make great popcorn flicks (including this one) but I would be reluctant to watch any of them on big screen. Still, if you have an open mind, enjoy action flicks and not a hardcore fan waiting eagerly for something similar to the first Predator movie. Give it a shot."
5.0,19 November 2018,"The good: The rendering of the predator was excellent. The techo toys and gizmos were also done extremely well. To me the best part of the movie was the interaction of the ""guys on the bus"". Kind of reminded me of The A Team. Each guy on the bus had his own qurky personality. The way they interacted and their dialogue with each other were often hilarious even during what would otherwise have been a ""dramatic"" moment. That was what made what would otherwise have been a ho-hum scifi movie."
1.0,25 May 2019,"So, the original Predator is my favorite movie of all time. This was nothing close to it...but would anything realistically rival the atmosphere and acting of the original anyway? Having said that, this was entertaining and a worthy movie in the series. Lots of haters out there, but those reviewers could and will never be satisfied with any Predator sequels anyway. The music paid a great homage to the original, and it stayed true to the original in many ways while providing a brand new interpretation of the storyline. Sit back, enjoy, and be thankful Ben Affleck wasnt cast in it."
3.0,30 December 2018,"I'm not going to bother with proper arguments against this attempt of a movie. If Hollywood stopped caring, I'm going to do so as well."
3.0,15 September 2018,Not much real point to this film as regards the Predator franchise. No real relation to the original story. Fast paced cheesy action film with little story & generally flat throughout. I was hoping to see a little more from Boyd Holbrook who is a very capable actor. The humour was cringey and unnecessary. Was hoping this would revive the predator frachise but unfortunately not. Easy watch but nothing to get excited about.

waste of my money and time..."
4.0,20 December 2018,I've had the IMDB app pretty much since the beginning of its existence and this movie was so bad that it forced me to give first review. I was born in 79 and I fell in love with Predator the first time I watched it. Probably seen it 100 times and still love it! Predator 2 was at least ok thanks to Danny Glover and Gary Busey but could had been written better. Then the introduction to Predator and Alien at least gave a story but this new version is ABSOLUTE GARBAGE!!!! Hollywood should be ashamed of themselves for even allowing it to make the screen!! You would think they would have a little respect for the Predator franchise! How hard would it had been to offer Schwarzenegger enough $$$ to be a part of a comeback? Maybe he's an older retired mercenarie who is begged to come back to the jungle and help rescue a team! Anything but what they gave us with this! What happened to good directors and respect in franchises!!! Thanks for ruining The Predator you idiots!!! Don't waste your time with this crap!
3.0,21 January 2019,"Are you a Predator fan? Avoid to see this film! All time jokes with a bad story... In anycase, if there is nothing on TV and you want to see something better than last Alien movie could be an option..."
4.0,24 December 2018,Thai was a fun film. Ignore the geeks who are mad because it's not exactly how they imagined it in their heads. Just go and enjoy a predator film. Great cast. Great scripts. A fun romp in the predator universe.

3.0,14 September 2018,"I have seen Independence day 2, Lucy, Pacific Rim 2 and Justice League Well this one is almost in that league. Predator was the first movie I ever saw, it holds a special place in my heart. This movie gave me a heart attack not just because it's a predator movie but also because it's a SHANE BLACK's movie Predator 2 and Predators were better than this. And that ending, that Awful ending, is cringe-worthy"
10.0,22 September 2018,"Very aware not a remake.. not even a sequel, just doesn't have the suspense like the 80s original and him hiding pretty much through the whole movie.

Upgraded Predeator model is brilliant! But story not so good and average acting and not a strong plot."

Considering the film was delayed due to reshots ( I presume to make it even better) well, they might as well not bothered. Of all of the Predator films, this has to be the worst of the franchise. There was people leaving even before had finished. In the end, seeing the ending I which I had!."
1.0,6 October 2018,Very good movie. Has elaborated on the predator species. I don't understand the hate for this movie. It has given the franchise a few new directions. Boyd Holbrook is also a good addition to the franchise.

3.0,27 September 2018,"Predator ???

Please. Stop trying to rebuild the predator. It is the second film that we have to swallow another generic predator to do away with the original. Respect the franchise, the character and the fans. It's a pain to see the predator killed so uselessly by another generic ""predator"". The original predator (Armadira, behavior, strength) was very good. Better until the others, but only until that strange animal appeared 3 meters high ... ridiculous! I will not even mention the plot, because it simply does not.

Stop trying to replace the original predator."
10.0,27 September 2018,"I'll say the typical: grew up loving the original predator.... was amused with the second one... found that Adrian Brosy and troupe were a nice bunch in a fun movie.... even the PvA movies were kinda fun....

But this... oh... this.... how low have the big studios fallen! After I left the theater I couldn't remember ANYTHING from this movie.... The cast was awful... no sense in the plot, I was not entertained at all. I looked at my watch no less than 10 times... actually felt I was robbed of my time and money...

I read some reviews before but I thought the people was actually being too harsh with this. Well, I should have listened and wait until they played this on HBO or even the SyFy channel. It's gonna be a money maker for sure, but for me, and the 12 people in the theater, it was the end of this franchise.

Absolutely worthless, pointless and boring."

2.0,2 January 2019,"You would never know the director of this film was actually involved as an actor in the original. With the original having a gritty and even a realistic tone ( as realistic as you can get about a murderous alien), this latest entry lies more in the sci-fi/comedy genre with a good dose of gore thrown in. At one point the ""vicious"" Predator Dog starts to play fetch with a grenade because it was somehow turned into a friendly earth like dog by a bullet to the head, need I say any more. Very poor I'm sure young kids will like it."

Note to producers: if you plan another predator movie, please keep away Shan Black from the project."
3.0,6 January 2019,"What a waste of time. The Predator offers no sense of mystery or intrigue added with a horrible sense of humor. The movie seems to be an antithesis of how alien films nowadays should be, as it has nothing but mindless action. The movie lack any sort of depth or development, and fails to build any relationship between the characters and the audience. If this is the direction the franchise is taking, they should seriously just kill it off, a pointless addition of a storied franchise."

Saw the movie yesterday and DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMN it was bad... ... 2 hours wasted... what life choices shall I make in the next 6 months to regain balance in my life... ... facepalm.

But I must admid that it helped a little (and even more than that) to see what I presume are americans that don't like the movie and leaving negative reviews - It actual helps a bit and makes me smile. I thought you bought into all the half ass jokes. In my home town movie theater (Denmark - Europe) it think we laughed once...

5.0,29 November 2018,"I just wish the Predator existed in real life and instead of the jungle, he hunted in movie sets where remakes and reboots are made...

This movie is not just an insult to the previous films. It's not just an awful film. This is Shane Black's revenge on the franchise for killing him in the original movie.

I mean you have to be a hater to create a film with this background the way Black did. I can't explain it otherwise.

Anyway, i know this was more of an accusation rather than a review but i'm really angry and dissapointed about the future of cinema...

Oh and one last thing in case some filmaker sees it, STOP TRYING TO MAKE FUNNY A MOVIE THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE DARK, SCARY AND VIOLENT!!!

And if someone tries to do a remake in the future, my advise is this.... SEE THE ORIGINAL AND UNDERSTAND WHY IT KICKS ASS!!!!

Now ""Get to the chopper"" and leave this franchise to rest in pieces...."

1.0,14 September 2019,"First ever review so don't expect it to be any good. It's a fun movie if you like the Predators and watch these movies because you are interested in them and their lore. The hero and his gang fits for this movie. Cool scenes with Predators being badass. Lots of silly jokes and 80s action moves. It's not a good movie if you compare it to award worthy films but for entertainment it is great. I hope there's a sequel to this story. Preferably with even more focus on the Predators and space.

Btw The original movie wasn't a horror movie ffs. It was an action."

The overall plot was decent and the special effects were also above average, which is why it gets 3/10 rating. I understand this is a fantasy/sci-fi film, but so many times the dialog and decisions of the characters were cringeworthy. Acting wasn't horrible, but the script had more f-bombs than I can remember in a film. Don't mind language, but make it have impact instead of saying it in every third sentence. Overall, a big disappointment of what could have been considering the storyline."
4.0,15 September 2018,"If studios are gonna continue interfering with content creators then they will no longer get any money from me.

I read reviews prior going to this movie I expected the really sloppy ending. What was most disappointing is that Shane Black executed an good first half of the movie.

The OG predator was menacing AF! The practical effects were great! The cast, I admit I thought was gonna be a mess but they were a strong point of the movie, the direction from Shane Black was solid, the action bloody and uncensored Predator fun we should expect in this movie. I was enticed by the story as well.

Then.... you (as audience members) can really tell when the studios started to stick their money grubbing noses into the art of producing, directing a movie with their DUMB studio interfering notes! About half way through, the movie seems to drop ALL story points and becomes a shaky cam, quick editing directionless mess, with poorly rendered CGI effects! UGHHHH

The saddest part is with all this talent in front and behind the cameras, passion for the original content material, this could have been a fun rewatchable action flick! But after the second half seems to have been not only douced but fully submerged in raw studio executive sewage this movie will be another stain on the Predator legacy.

SHAME!"

For Aliens/Aliens vs. Predator/Predator fans such as myself, this movie was highly anticipate.

As you remember, the last Predator movie gave us a look at new ""species"" of Yautja that could come into play in this new installment of the franchise. Well, sorry to burst your dream bubble, but this movie did not connect to anything from that last movie.

Ugh, I feel so empty after having just watched the film. Let me break it down for you (without spoilers).

The movie is rather fast paced and it feels as if every exposition is crammed into every free time slot available. The story line was promising for the first 10 to 15 minutes, after which it turned into a sloppy bag of mediocre acting, horrible CGI and B movie level script. Dont even get me started on the last quarter of the movie.

I call that being blinded by your expectations. Granted it's not going to win an Oscars, but as a piece of crowd pleasing light entertainment it delivered. I had no preconceived ideas of what I wanted it too be. I never even watched the trailer. That's probably why I enjoyed it so much, and I watched it twice. 8/10."

The Predator is laughably terrible compared to it's predecessors. It doesn't carry to spirit of the predator name but carries a teen slasher one instead. It's unforgivingly bad with a terrible constructed story and characters. But it does have a couple of intense, cool action sequences involving the predators and develops the mythology in a satisfying way. In the end I do not recommend seeing this film, it's laughably bad and it's deserved."

They need to take a break from butchering this franchise until someone with a decent script & decent actors comes on board.there has been nothing good from this franchise since predator 2."
5.0,16 September 2018,
1.0,24 August 2020,Ignore any and all negative reviews. This is entertaining and it brings the predator movies up to date with intelligent sci-fi and action. Really good movie.
2.0,13 November 2018,"I could write a huge diatribe of criticisms, but I'll spare the details by simply stating that this movie devolved the franchise from A-grade to a cheezy B-grade plot and an over abundance of CGI. Too bad really; I like well done creature movies. Another one bites the dust."
8.0,19 September 2018,"I would rather hang upside down and vomit into my eyes than see this movie again. This movie reminds me of how awesome, and scary and suspenseful the first predator was... and in comparison this movie was the exact opposite. It really, really sucks so bad."
2.0,28 January 2022,"Predator (1987) is a stone cold classic, but also a really dumb movie. Diluted by 30 years of sequels and spin-offs, there should have been absolutely nothing to lead you to believe that The Predator 2018 would be anything more than it is, so it's kinda hard to be disappointed.

Even though the title suggests reboot, it's in no way following the plot of the first film. While the original flirted with keeping the titular creature mysterious, this movie opens on his spacecraft. From there it's the expected barrage of army men, gunfire and alien battles. Barely classifying as sci-fi, this is an action film through and through, and it surely meets it's quota of blood and bullets. The CGI on display is pretty bad and a bit of a let down, but it's otherwise got the budget to back up it's blockbuster ambitions. There are a couple creative kills, and it's all mindless entertainment as promised.

You knew what this would be, and if you watched it, don't be mad. If you haven't seen it, do you feel like using your brain? Yes? Go away. No? Here's The Predator!"
5.0,17 November 2018,"This is a weird movie to review.The movie has an INCREDIBLE Cast, these might be one of the most fun and likable group of crazy men I've ever seen. The actors are a true joy to watch. I actually liked the jokes, I actually loved the dialogue a lot. i did not mind jokes on a predator movie. a lot of people hated the jokes and the humor, people said the humor does not fit the movie, but i think the movie would have been very boring without it And this movie has really really good action, some of the best action from the Predator Franchise. (A lot better than Predators or AVP movies) the action is fast and slick, but clear and without shaky cam or quick cuts (like Most action movies do it nowdays) the action is well choreographed, and well shot.

But this movie is such a horrible mess when it comes to the plot....the reasons they give the predators for doing what they do and the reasons given for the predators to come to earth were horrible, and they ruin the older movies because it changes the motives of the older predators. Also the giant predator is not clever or smart, he is not stealthy. he is a Brute. the new big predator is just a big bully. there is no nuance to the new predator hes just big and loud and rough and very annoying. He's like Big Foot basically. breaking everything around him. this might be the worst predator we have ever seen. not only the way he was made to look in size but his behavior. he was ridiculous. his personality was ridiculous. his arguments were ridiculous.

the story ruins the entire franchise. the purpose for the predators to come here was awful. the reason for the small predator to come to earth was laughable. the ending is so cringe worthy....

very hard movie to review. there was a lot to like, but the story is just so terrible that i think people should just skip it"
1.0,30 September 2018,"The only positive I can seriously think of is Olivia Munn. As fart boxes go her's would definitely get tongue punched. As for the film and the cast it's dire. Arnie's original team would chew these up, as Blaine would say make Cambodia look like Kansas. Definitely no Old Painless Is Waiting for this poor attempt."
4.0,4 December 2021,"This movie was a great take on the original Predator with plenty of action n bags of suspense n tension. Lots of brilliant special effects n cgi.

The ending was enjoyable n not predictable n full of tension.

I highly recommend this movie especially if you like creature features n Sci fi n lots of action."

1.0,6 April 2019,"Like a lot of people, I'm a longtime fan of the Predator franchise. I went into this one with almost no expectations, but I did think that since Shane Black was a cast member of the original he'd be able to at least try and work toward recapturing the magic of that first outing so many years ago. Unfortunately, The Predator is an awkward mess. It feels like something the SyFy Channel would have come up with if they could have secured a large enough budget to cobble together a sequel to Predator 2. There are weird edits, dumb story beats, and just an overall sense that this thing somehow started to unravel during the production process. There are one or two interesting ideas that can be identified here and there, but overall this effort is a total misfire. I wish that weren't the case, but that's where we are. I'm hoping that some years down the road someone will pen a proper sequel that has Dutch return as a paranoid advisor to help deal with some looming Yautja threat. That'd be something worth watching."
3.0,31 December 2018,"This movie is a predator movie. It has... A Predator and a group of people trying to track it down. However. This is one of the messiest movie I've ever seen.

The original is great but I don't want to see the same thing twice, this movie is different but adds to the lore of the predator, while standing on it own"

2.0,23 December 2018,This movie just ruined my night. I wasn't expecting much at all and truthfully didn't think the movie would remotely affect me. Now I sit here pondering and wasting even more time contemplating how much a steaming pile of garbage this movie was. Everything about it blew my mind. I truthfully feel so much more dumb now. I haven't drank in months and I now hold a rum and coke in my hand. I honestly think if Fox gave me 88 million dollars I could do a better job and I have zero experience in the film industry. The plot was so bad. You didn't feel connected to any character. It for sure did not move the Predator universe forward an inch. Olivia Munn tried hard but her action s scenes looked so weak and pathetic. Granted her character was not given a tough persona at the beginning of the film but I truthfully felt like it was the wrong arch for the character to take. Shes not Ripley. The musical score to the movie was so bad I truthfully hope whoever approved it never works in the film industry again.
3.0,29 November 2018,This really is among the worst movies i ever seen. How people can rate this crap with more than 1 star is unbelievable....
5.0,18 September 2018,"Rated R as it should be; plenty of on-screen gore. The predator has a lot of on-screen time and it's a guy in a suit rather than CGI.

There's plenty of humor and the action doesn't stop for the entire duration of the film. Felt a lot like the old classic popcorn flicks of old bit with fancier technological effects.

It may not be a very _good_ movie but it was definitely highly entertaining."
5.0,9 December 2018,"Entertaining, mindless action with some funny lines. If you are here for the story, you may be underwhelmed. But if you are here to watch Predator violence, grab a seat."

10.0,4 October 2018,"Good special effects and some action and different type of comedy. But in the ende The Predator makers should use that money to help disadvantaged children. The worst Predators ever made, even capable of surpass Alien vs Predator."
5.0,14 December 2018,"The only reason this review had more than one star is because I was (with pain and distress), able to make it through the whole movie. But the story line was complete garbage, the acting was just plain horrendous, and the entire movie contradicted pretty much everything about the predators in all the other predator movies. Such a failure of a movie."

1.0,17 September 2018,"It's a ridiculous, gory, action movie jammed full of Shane Black's signature humor. Everything I was hoping it would be, but definitely not everyone's cup of tea."
5.0,26 September 2018,"This movie was pretty much what you expected out of a Predator movie. Stereotypical characters with a predictable storyline, terrible CGI, at times it was okay but when it was bad it was reaaaaally bad. None of the actors really tried here, they were all pretty stale and barebones. Even if you just came here for the gorey stuff like most I still think you'll be left unsatisfied. Most action sequences were nothing but quick slash kills and couldn't tell what was happening half the time. Dumb decisions over dumb decisions. Why would you keep using guns against it when you can clearly see how ineffective they are? Why would you get on top of the ship that you're trying to shoot down? Nothing but lazy filmmaking shown throughout this film. Shame too, I actually liked Shane Black's The Nice Guys a lot. But at least the comedy was on point unsurprisingly. If you're a Predator fan I guess you could check it out but there's really not much to offer."
1.0,19 October 2018,"""The Predator"". What is it with sequels having titles practically identical to the first films' despite having a different story? Anyway, Shane Black, an actor from the 1987 action-horror classic, directed this film and, while that sounds like a good idea on paper, his execution leaves much to be desired.

So, here's the gist: Soldier Quinn McKenna stumbles upon a crashed alien ship, its contents, and its less-than-friendly occupant, making him, his family, and band of crazy cohorts not only targets for a covert government agency, but also an all new, more powerful breed of Predator.

Positives I found in this installment: Solid production value overall, decent action scenes, nice bits of fan service (one of which made my jaw drop) that thankfully don't go as overboard as ""Predators"" (2010), great costume design, okay acting with a few likable characters, and a few neat additions to the Predator lore.

Of all the sequels, this one struggles the most. The film starts with a scene straight out of Star Wars, which pretty much sets the tone for the rest of the story. It has the most humor and that is the biggest strike against it even though a few jokes did make me chuckle. Being too light-hearted made it harder to take anything seriously given that there are alien sport hunters killing people. In fact, only one death scene got a slight emotional reaction out of me; if only the other deaths tried as hard. Both the Loonies and the human villain are over-the-top and hard to invest in. Yes, the other films had humor, but they kept it to a bare minimum, allowing for the suspense and horror to take center stage yet this went the opposite route. A real head scratcher involved a lobotomy on a character, leading to contrived circumstances. While the practical effects are solid, the CGI gets wonky in certain shots, particularly when lit. The use of the F-word goes too far, showing a distinct lack of colorful language. The ending with the big revelation of why the Predators came to Earth this time made me think ""WHAT?"" (a result of reshoots and a rewrite of the script). Also, how come we never get the classic Predator roar these days?

First Alien failed to impress last year and now the Predator takes the spot this year. While I did not have much hype, the film only barely kept me entertained. The new material had potential, but was simply taken in the wrong direction. Apparently, this was due to serious studio intervention, which has unfortunately become much more common in cinema these days. The expansions in the comics and novels offer more to the franchise than ""The Predator"" could, which makes me want to see those adapted to film."

1.0,19 May 2019,What were these people expecting when they came to see this movie? Some high art with subtitles and some deep meaningful look into humanity's connection to the universe?

1.0,2 September 2024,"All the posters make it feel like this is a very dark film. I mean, it is R-rated but the movie is as much as a comedy as much gore is there in it. And that is both the positive and the negative of the movie. It is fairly entertaining but most of the time it's such a stupid comedy that the serious moments rarely work. Including so much focus on mental health and portraying every aspect of it wrong was what really made it bad for me. Even if we look over the most important one, the portrayal of neurodivergence as some superpower, which hurts so many neurodivergent people, it still manages to mess up portraying different kinds of PTSD which is surprising for an American movie considering how much that is used for propaganda there. Nonetheless, I did enjoy a lot of it as an action comedy even if the whole thing was too stupid and by the last twenty minutes it kind of lost the momentum."

5.0,18 April 2021,"If there's one word to describe this movie, it would be BULLCRAP.

Shane Black's direction to this movie led the movie to a downward spiral of hate. Stupid story, idiotic characters, painfully horrible acting, a decent, yet bland soundtrack, incredibly awful jokes, and the CGI is just...oh man.

The worst part of this movie is it's portrayal of autism. Like is this movie SERIOUSLY saying that autistic people represent a next step to human evolution?! As a high-functioning autist, I STRONGLY disagree.

Overall, this movie just sucks, and I DO NOT recommend it at all."

8.0,20 December 2018,I am very sad and disappointed with this movie. Complete garbage. We have today in the end of 2018 movies that are made in the 70s and 80s that are better than this.
4.0,19 September 2018,Hasn't aged well since my last viewing in the theater. There's a little too much comedy and it also goes a bit overboard with the CGI. I do believe there's a good idea and story in here somewhere it's just not executed very well. I'll still take it over AVP 1 and whatever that Rodriguez/Nimrod movie was.
2.0,3 September 2020,"I see a bunch of negativity here. Yes, its different from other the other movies. Honestly, there isnt away to make Predator scary again. You can make stories better but not scary again. Everyone knows who the Predator are and what they look like.

The Predator was good but not great like the other entries. It was corny and funny. I'll be honest, some decisions were bad choices, like the super Predator and suit at the end. Honestly the violence and actions scenes were good. I would honestly like to see a directors cut, from all the original shoots that were left out. Im a fan of Predator, and I love all the films, so I might be biased. Terminator and Aliens franchises are in the same boat, you cant get any better than their originals, so just enjoy and quit knitpicking"

I thought this was better than the second one, and almost as good as the first. Some people just have to dump on a movie because it makes them feel superior.

And I mean all Predators in this movie.Where is the staelthy killer you had in the 1987 movie...the one that used trees to revover his troffee (the body of Blain) ,the one that used stealth to hunt and kill Mac.Instead they get a WWE buffed predator on steroids rampaging all over the screen like Rambo would. Nothing stealthy...and serious every scene of the Predator he just has to growl?I was really really looking forward to this Predator,but as soon as I saw the trailer I was like meh....I wait and watch this online like EVERYONE else and maybe I buy it on Bluray,just to have the complete serie.Man this Predator was BAD. What happened to Nimród Antal's Predator hunter dogs? Those looked like ten x better then these pitbull Predator dogs..things..whatever they are. This movie definetly is the death stab to the whole Predator franchise for sure.You wont burn your fingers on anything Predator after this crap movie I can tell you that. Shane Black should stick to writing and NEVER EVER direct anything that has it's first movie being a masterpiece to be totally butchered by him,by making a ""sequel"" to it!!!!"
8.0,25 September 2021,"Although Predator is not so intense as expected it has its own factors to keep the film engaging. The top factor that made the movie watchable is its utilisation of evolving Predator technology to its core. The violent and surprising deaths succeeds in providing the surprising suicide squad feel the movie gives. Last but not the least, the mind blowing climax surprise,twists and weird characters add on to the movie's pros.

The biggest disappointment of the film is the lack of intense and gritty moments the movie fails to provide. The overuse of CGI predator creatures looks truly outdated considering the other aspects of the movie. Unwanted over usage of adult dialogues were too much and really irritating at times.

In the end Predator fails as a movie but succeeds in evolution of the franchise that adapts to the modern world.

I don't understand peoples regret here. I had a great time watching this. It's highly entertaining and as 'un-boring' as one can get. It's a bit like when Star Wars changed its tone in 'Last Jedi. People weren't expecting this new approach feeling their little Star wars universe got permeated with something other. To me Last Jedi was the best one for years, A film for adults at last. Get over it.

Getting back to Predator, if you want an energetic ride and aren't precious, enjoy !! :)"

1.0,25 December 2018,"You shouldn't be too picky with the plot on a Predator movie, but this movie is a total mess, it makes no sense AT ALL: the kid, the dogs, the military guys, the ending, even the loonies. It's just all put together using scotch tape, trying to make a movie where the plot, the characters' motivation, background story and place in the plot make absolutely no sense or have no relevance whatsoever. I'm pretty sure some of the loonies were there just to die, like ""ok, we need someone to die in this shield scene, let's add another looney to fill the gap"" since their relevance to the plot is 0.

It has like 3 or 4 cool action scenes, but they're way too short and after each one you have like 30 minutes of boring, nonsensical and irrelevant human plot.

If you want a decent predator movie, go watch Predators (2010) if you haven't already and avoid this one."
8.0,1 June 2019,I don't see how people would be disappointed by this movie. I've still seen it now about four times. Entertaining but a little dumb. I still think the best movie outside of the original was the one from 2012. Just do Predator versus Judge Dredd!
5.0,19 June 2022,"On a mission in Mexico, Army Ranger sniper Quinn Mckenna (Boyd Holbrook) is the only one of his team left alive after a Predator alien kills his entire team. Mckenna is able to kill the Predator and is able to send the Predator's arsenal to his P. O. box before being arrested by agent Traeger (Sterling K. Brown) of Project Stargazer, a quasi-governmental operation studying the Predator aliens. In order to keep the operation a secret, Traeger discredits McKenna's credibility by declaring him insane and assigning him to Group 2, a designation for military personnel suffering from mental illness. Due to a shipping error, the Predator arsenal ends up in the hands of McKenna's estranged autistic son Rory (Jacob Tremblay) which puts him in danger of a predator seeking its location. With McKenna's son in danger, he enlists the help of Group 2 and xenologist Casey Brackett (Olivia Munn) to stop the Predator.

Following the decent reception of he Robert Rodriguez produced revival of the Predator franchise with Predators, discussions were ongoing with 20th Century Fox on how to move forward with the franchise. While Rodriguez and Adrian Brody had express interest in a follow-up, eventually Fox announced writer/director Shane Black of such films as Iron Man 3 and Lethal Weapon would helm the new Predator film having previously appeared as supporting character Hawkins in the 1987 original. The movie experienced a lot of negative buzz leading up to its release with the film reshooting its original daylight set sequence, the casting of certain individuals with shady unseemly history, and the handling of the subject of autism. The film received generally negative reviews from both critics and audiences and its $160 million gross against its $88 million budget was seen as something of a disappointment. While the series does continue with August 2020's Prey set to be the franchises next major incarnation, The Predator remains a blot on the series.

To start on a positive note, the movie looks and feels like a Predator movie at least. It's R-rated, the movie delivers on the gore effects for the most part, and Boy Holbrook is tailor made for a lead in a hard edged action role like this. The movie does feature some interesting characters in Group 2 such as Trevante Rhodes Nebraska who's probably my second favorite character of the bunch and the Predator effects look okay barring certain exceptions.

Unfortunately the movie doesn't match the intensity of any of the previous Predator films. One of Shane Black's goals with The Predator was to ""event-ize"" the franchise by producing it on the scale of an event film/tentpole and that's a major reason why this movie doesn't work. There's no point in this film where the atmosphere is built up or tension played up and instead the movie goes for loud bombastic set pieces that don't fit within the world of the Predator. Even in something as over the top as Predator 2, there was a conscious effort to make the Predator feel like a hunter showing the creature's trademarked Infrared POV and watching it lure, mimic, and outwit its prey. For a good chunk of the movie the Predator not only doesn't feel like a hunter, but it doesn't even feel like the focal point of the film as Project Stargazer is positioned as a secondary antagonist alongside the Predator and much like the inclusion of these shadowy government agents in Predator 2 it feels like it detracts from the main point of this franchise with the movie positioning itself with more world ending stakes that overcomplicate the franchise from Intergalactic trophy hunters to borderline super heroic shenanigans. Speaking of superheroics, Jacob Tremblay is a major supporting player in this movie playing an autistic savant who winds up with Predator tech and is able to understand and utilize it because according to the movie's logic autistics are the next step in human evolution....which is basically just a repackage of the age old trope of the ""magic simpleton"" only within the context of a mediocre sci-fi flick. And this isn't the only boneheaded decision at play as a character who survived a suicide attempt later purposefully kills himself to save our main characters in a major ""wait, what!?"" decision that I can't even begin to describe.

The Predator unfortunately doesn't do justice to its monster or its franchise. It's a bloated unfocussed mess of a film with some pretty underwhelming usage of the Predator and the writing falls well below the standard Black has set for himself over his long career."

8.0,29 November 2018,"Not worth to watch it if you are expecting a Predator movie in its glory. The script is quite shallow, and dialogues are abysmal filled with trivial sordid sex slangs. Not one character is worth remembering. The title of the movie is the only thing that insinuates any relation to the Predator movie of 1987. This movie has a preposterous plot and would be abhorrent to the spectators if they have an expectation that this would be in some way pertaining to the predator movie of 1987. The actions of 'Predator' depicted in this is quite ludicrous and is perfidious to the franchise. In brevity, the movie makes spectators baffled about why would someone be a spendthrift by ratifying the production of this movie."

2.0,22 December 2018,"Pure trash. Do not allow anyone to tell you that this movie is decent, ok, watchable or even slightly entertaining!!! This movie is pure trash from start to end. Actors = terrible. Acting = laughable. Story = offensive!!!

This movie is a Hollywood money grab and if you paid to see it in theatres I feel deeply sorry for you. I watched it pirated and I still wanna try and call to find out how to get a refund.

Shame on anyone that made this trash movie and shame on any of these supposed movie critics who are obviously paid to write these reviews.

GD this movie was terrible!!! I made this account just to express how bad and terrible it is!"

2.0,25 January 2019,"I read a review on here which describes 'The Predator' as a parody of the original 'Predator' movies. It's something I thought also as I watched in utter horror over the film's running time. 'The Predator' is that absurd that I am now concerned that Fox were conned into releasing an outrageous parody, there is a pathetic joke or corny one liner ever other sentence and the CGI is that bad that if you didn't know better you'd think that the film was made during the early 00's.

There is not a single redeemable aspect in this film, I'd urge fans of the series to avoid, but the curiousity will be too much for you to resist. Just be prepared to be utterly disgusted."
5.0,1 January 2019,This was terrible. I usually don't write a review but being a huge predator and alien fan. This was a complete joke a waste on what could of been a great movie with great actors and actresses. Movie was not suspenseful or a thrill more tried to be comedic. Predator has always been a thriller and suspenseful gets you off your seat this new Predator could of been great and with the movie being a complete joke it is not something I want to see again. The director Shane Black obiviously had a lot to do with the bust in this movie and also the writers. I feel bad for the actors and actresses in this movie.

5.0,1 December 2018,"I'm 55 years old, I saw the Terminater at the theatre in my 2nd year of collage (lost the love of my life because I ignored her through the whole movie) and the first Predator after I graduated. Since then I've seen abominations regarding the Predator and Alien franchise. This one was different than all the rest in between. Two of the hottest girls that can act (hello Chuck, and Aaron Rogers what were you thinking), and a whole lot of jokes i'm going to pretend are mine at the next AARP meeting. Not to mention the action and graphics and male acting was more than adequate (i haven't heard that in a while). Two prostate glans up."
1.0,3 March 2019,"The original Predator was a success in 1987. I think that reusing the title was a mistake and caused to mislead most of the people. I was also expecting a serious predator movie.

5.0,29 September 2018,"Such a disappointment. How can the person who wrote the original produce this utter crap?

Starts off well but then turns in a slapstick comedy with poor jokes. Couldn't understand the point of either the 2 female main characters in it besides the fact they look good. Space dogs??? Wtf? Instead of sticking to the original format which was an amazing success they've tried to go down the marvel route with stupid banter jokes, and ridiculous anti predator suites?? Omg please just save your money. The franchise has been killed unless they get someone in to do a proper reboot of the original and leave out the lame jokes and get someone who is at least slightly hard to play the lead hero!!

What a shambles of a film."
9.0,25 August 2020,"""The Predator"" is not the worst movie in the world but ... Anyone who has seen this movie without ever seeing the first one will love it, but anyone who has seen the first one will find this movie disappointing as I am. This film started well until there was a group of ""psychopaths"" who turned the film into a comedy, the action scenes are good but for example I found predator dogs in particular wasted ""characters"", as I also thought it was stupid how a kid can communicate with predators ... but as I said at the beginning, many people will love it but many will also hate it."
3.0,25 June 2019,"So, this was marketed as sort of a comedy arm of the Predator series; and also a launch pad to the next generation of Predator movies. I'll simply submit this... the main actor is forgettable. The kid is awful at playing someone with ASD. Like, super bad. He's good in other movies (Room), but ugh. Olivia Munn is good. The rest are OK. It got better near the end. This movie is not critical to the ALIEN filmography. The visuals are pretty fantastic, though, and are nice to watch."
1.0,7 May 2019,They really blew it with this movie. They had such a great cast but such a terrible story to go with it. The original movie is still the best in my opinion. You can't beat the action that movie had and I hope this is it for sequels.
1.0,21 February 2024,"Okay firstly I get why the Predator purists don't like it but.......what a great film!

(No spoilers contained)

Yes it was a whole new spin on Predator, and yes I'm old enough to have watched and loved the original at the cinema so I have a solid understanding of the franchise and I have to say it is the only predator movie where I have felt a connection to any of the characters and actually felt gutted to watch some them die, it's funny, it's clever, it's endearing and it's almost heart warming, it really doesn't deserve such a meagre score, I'm sure if it were viewed as a standalone film and not part of this particular franchise it would have received much more acclaim. Having binge watched the entire Predator, Alien and AVP movies over the last week this was without a doubt the most entertaining, a cult classic in the making......almost as funny as Danny Glover's dress sense in P2......."
1.0,24 October 2021,"The Predator (2018) is a movie I recently DVR'd off FXM. The storyline follows the son of a scientist whose dad is researching alien technology. The son while playing with some of his dads items accidentally triggers a beacon that leads to a predator arriving on his planet and starting a killing spree. This movie is directed by Shane Black (Iron Man 3) and stars Trevante Rhodes (Moonlight), Jacob Tremblay (Good Boys), Keegan-Michael Key (Tomorrowland), Thomas Jane (The Mist), Alfie Allen (Game of Throne) and Jake Busey (Starship Troopers). The writing and storyline for this is absolutely dreadful. I know it went for a ""not taking itself seriously"" style, but it went too far in that direction of mixing comedy in with a Predator storyline. It was so frustrating to watch. The dialogue was painfully disappointing. The cast was talented enough to give us so much more but was under utilized. The special effects and gore were good, which is why the bad writing is frustrating, because they could have made this a modern day Predator 2 style movie...This is really only worth watching for diehard Predator fans and I would score this a 4/10."
4.0,30 December 2018,"I am not much of a Predator fan. In fact I was pretty disapointed to see Yvonne Strahovski and Jacob Tremblay waste their talent on this film. I watched this movie on pay per view over the holidays. Other than an hour and 47 minutes, I do not have much invested in this film Some folks on here call it a parody, I do not think so. Some folks think it's cool for the actors to go around dropping f-bombs every few seconds. I especially detest that kind of language coming from a 12 year-old and none of the adults seem to be concerned. No. I would not recommend this latest film in the Predator franchise."
9.0,29 January 2019,"Such a wonderful Franchise turned into a horrible shambles. Please do not even mention events of this movie in any future Predator movies. The Plot and Script were obviously written by an 8 year old doodling on toilet paper, which might be even insulting to 8 year olds. SHAME ON YOU."
4.0,1 October 2018,"Would still be crap but have loads of people trying to say otherwise.

This is the decade of destruction of the big and epic movies from the 80s and 90s.Either by rip-off or just trying to extend the franchise. Unfortunately for studios it doesn't matter if it's a good script, what matters is if it makes money. That's what a good movie is.

It's a disgrace what is being done by the studios due to the lack of originality and the need to get cash in. And what's with all movies trying to copy the marvel comedy?

It's up to you to stop this madness and don't watch such mvies in the theaters"

1.0,10 November 2018,
1.0,21 September 2018,"I wish I could say The Predator was good, but it's not. This fourth film in the franchise was written and directed by Shane Black, who also appeared in the original Predator. He had since gone on to do great movies like The Nice Guys and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, the latter of which is a personal favorite of mine, so I have no idea how he dropped the ball so badly here. The Predator stars Boyd Holbrook, Trevante Rhodes, Olivia Munn, Keegan-Michael Key (as in Key and Peele), Sterling K. Brown (Gordon from Supernatural), Brian Prince, Augusto Aguilera, Thomas Jane (yes, that Thomas Jane), Alfie Allen (Theon Greyjoy), Jacob Tremblay, and Yvonne Strahovsky, with a couple special appearances by Jake Busey, son of Gary Busey, who starred in Predator 2. If that sounds like a lot of names to you, that's because it is. One of the problems of this movie comes from the fact that it is bloated with far too many characters, half of which barely get any time to shine despite being part of the main group. I also owe it to myself to mention that Thomas Jane's character was so far over-the-top that it annoyed me more than the dumb mistakes made by the child character. Speaking of which, can we all agree not to write dumb or annoying children anymore? If you want to see kids done right, look to 2017's It or Stranger Things. I would, however, like to say that Sterling Brown was by far the best actor in the movie, and I genuinely enjoyed his character. Sadly, the plot, when it's even there, is a complete mess. The ending makes no sense at all, and is completely out of left field. I like when a film doesn't take itself too seriously, but The Predator doesn't take itself seriously at all. It's much more of a comedy than an action flick, and it's not a thriller in the least. There is absolutely no tension anywhere in this movie. I did appreciate the two times I counted where characters directly quoted the original film, and I have to admit that a lot of the more comedic lines were very funny, but that's not what this film should be. Comedy is used in an action thriller to break up the tension, not the other way around. The practical special effects were honestly done very well the scant few times they were present. Conversely, the CGI was pretty bad, especially on the Predator dogs, which were entirely unnecessary and had no reason to be in the film at all. As I said before, this movie is not good. If you are a completionist and want to see this movie just to complete your Predator viewing checklist, knock yourself out. Dedicated Predator fans should probably skip this. If you're just looking for an end-of-summer/early fall action movie, please avoid this one. Go see The Meg or Peppermint instead."

It feels like a comedy version of the original and the acting from most of the cast was horrific. Boyd Holbrook trying to act the hard man? Errr no, I'm afraid not and what a way to waste the talent of Tom Jane. I like two of the characters, Nettles and Casey. All in all this film is a waste of money and I'm afraid it could be the end of the Predator franchise.

What a shame but its up there with Halloween as the worst films I've seen in years."
3.0,9 June 2021,It took all my will power to see this durge through to the end. There is endless profanity and even a racial slur. I can't say anymore as I want to get this tripe out of my mind as quickly as I can!

Avoid at all cost and dont make the mistake i did, 1 hour and 45mins of life i should of spent more wisely on something else.

This movie can't seem to decide whether or not it wants to be a campy Alternate Universe Disney-ish version of Predator, or fitting within the style of the the original Predator.

Is it entertaining? Yes and no. Entertainment value comes and goes. Aside from a number of gruesome graphic deaths, this really could have been a Disney movie. At certain points in time it feels like a bizarre Jurassic Park sequel.

Lots of non canon content in the movie, which id distracting and disappointing.

I gave it five (5) stars because I liked it about half the time I was watching it.

Nice special effects, strange plot line, with plenty of humour injected, yet over all not a credible movie and certainly NOT a credible Predator movie."

But being a massive fan of the ""Predator"", I could not help but write a review about this movie. Except for a few moments of CGI effects, intense, the whole movie is about nothing. Scenes where they've tried to revive the old story, the greatest story of all time...nah...nothing to do with them. I mean, c'mon, we are talking about a badass hunter, an icon, an extraordinary and sophisticated being...an alien. ""Get to the chopper (s)!""...ha ha ha, the difference between the meaning of it, cried by Arnie, and the meaning in this pile of...nothing. Well, my heart and my mind are so dissapointed that suddenly I became happy. Happy that I had a chance to be contemporary with THAT ""Predator"", THAT one, not these ones from today."

The mood and atmosphere created in the original which we loved was completely lost and turned into a screen-writing shambles. Why are they writing every character like they were filming a buddy cop movie with an attempt at a cool joke punchline every 5 seconds. Unrealistic and unbelievable dialogue in this debacle of a movie. Films like this are the reason I won't go see them in theaters and the one positive that a caught it on HBO and didn't pay for it. No substance, character intrigue or plot that's engaging and I'm being generous with this rating."

The writing gets worse, the story becomes even dumber than it already was, and the CGI is just hideous. Also, I'm sick of movies making autism some sort of super power. Like if you have autism you become some super genius or some bad ass assassin. That's not what it's like to have autism.

poor casting
poor script
poor sense of humor


It seems more like a typical direct to broadcasting sci-fi channel flick. But for a serious Hollywood production it lacks about on everything. Not cool - not even funny to watch. Just annoying and not even cult or camp. It's supposed to be a movie with bad-ass aliens and relentless frightening action with a touch of humor from characters drowned in coolness - so in itself that's unrealistic but could they at least have made the dialogues of the humans appear to be a bit realistic and cool?"

8.0,2 January 2024,"Maybe The Predator's initial sin was that it was Shane Black's homecoming. The 1987 film's original Predator featured a brief cameo by the writer-director as Hawkins, Arnold Schwarzenegger's squadmate. The main function of the character was comedic relief; he would make purposefully bad jokes to make his fellow countrymen look foolish.

Sadly, alack, prospective franchise reinstater Nearly everyone is targeted by the Predator to become a Hawkins. Of course, nothing in the promotional materials would lead you to believe such. The titular alien and its scarier cousin, the ""Ultimate Predator,"" are emphasized in the teasers for their badass nature."

I was so hopeful that Shane Black would do a great job, but this movie didn't know what it wanted to be. The characters never acted like they were in danger of being killed. There was no sense of urgency. The tension and suspense that are a big part of a Predator movie were nowhere to be found. I was entertained by the action sequences and jokes (of all things), but I left the theater disappointed cuz I don't know when I'll see my favorite movie character on screen again."

1. Olivia Munn, She is garbage pure garbage, utterly devoid of any acting ability whats so ever. You can virtually guarantee anything she's in will be a big pile of steaming poop.

2. Boyd Holbrook, Well it was a close race for the number one slot is all i will say about him.

3. Some well dodgy SF on the actual predator. I think they spent all the budget on the outer space scenes. (Should of saved money by not hiring Munn and given it to the SF Dept).

4. The gun effects were a bit lacking, If fact if the actors had made PEW PEW noises instead then that would of been better (But not you Munn as you would mess it up with your crap acting).

5. The one-liners, here I'm a little confused as some were really REALLY bad, yet others had me creasing (laughing hard) myself.

Other than that it was a watchable film, Except for the bit's with Olivia Munn & Boyd Holbrook, Which sadly is most of the film.

Very disappointed that in this day and age we could of had a decent Predator film but nope."

1.0,28 November 2018,"I was waiting for this movie a long time. And you know what? It didn't disappoint me. Predator with Arnold is a classic. Not debatable. Predator 2 with Danny Glover is a nice follow-up, with a change of place, its own, a bit darker tone and the main protagonist who's ""lethal weapon"" enough to stay with Arnie side by side. Time tested - passed successfully. Predators with Adrien Brody is a different beast, digging deeper and expanding the Predator universe, not changing the main core of the movie. A worthy successor to carry on the legacy. But what is The Predator? I'll tell you. If you are a fan of Shane Black's work - you will love this one as well. If you are a fan of the Predator - there it might get tricky. I'm a big fan of this movie and as soon as I went out of the cinema I thought to myself: it is back! I surely have got some questions but it is back... and awesome! After watching it tonight again I still think so. The Predator isn't trying to be what it isn't. It's still an action flick we all remember since day one, only this time it is a lot darker than all of the previous entries and with more jokes than you would expect from this kind of movie but it is absolutely not making it a bad movie. It's like that arrogant and overly pompous know-it-all older brother of yours - you can't stand his stupidity from time to time but you love him just the same because he's close to your heart. So, what is The Predator? By the looks of things it is going to be the last entry in the franchise, sadly. But it is a grand one."

The story was okay, the action sequences were just okay but there were way to many tines once again the cgi didn't work. When are film makers going to realise that using cgi is awful and totally spoil films.

Then there was the ending, boy what a let down. This part of the movie could have made it brilliant but alas it became embarrassing from Mr. Black.

1.0,10 September 2024,"I missed this one, and I usually catch all Predator films. This one is done by Shane Black who was the first kill in the original. I thought the players weren't bad or chosen badly. I also think the story wasn't half bad. Certainly some of the dialogue was half baked. The action sequences were mostly computer done, but not terrible. There was enough money to get the ships, and human insertion into scenes serviceable. The Predators themselves weren't awful, but you could tell they weren't top notch like seen in bigger budget fare. It even had a half decent ending which Shane I think assembled a watchable movie for Predator fans. Keep in mind some of it comes off as a tv movie, but that's expected with cutting corners, and not the best of the best in the industry involved. I was always say there's a couple of interesting takeaways with these films no matter how bad. With this one there's not much. No real new tech, but it had a view of ship internals, Predator close-up without vest etc."
1.0,28 November 2018,"Unlike the clueless reviewer who I quoted in the headline, I will not proceed to write 5 paragraphs of meaningless drivel about a movie I hate.

Usually all of the AvP movies, Alien, Predator and the cross overs are at least a solid 7. Of course the original Alien trilogy as well as Predator 1, 2 and even Predators stand out as being very original. The difference between the originals and the spin-offs is clearly the tone they set. In this movie we get a comic book style presented, with by no means bad CGI (dogs looked more real than in Predators for example), a secret research conspiracy, and charismatic heroes getting slaughtered (or not, no spoilers). Just like in the graphic novels, the pace is neck breaking. The ending felt almost rushed, to introduce the new Predator Killer Weapon. It is understandable how regular movie goers are put off by the constant over-stimulation, but I would not want it any other way. The action is over the top, definitely. But there was great attention to detail how the action scenes played out exactly, as opposed to lesser action films in which a flurry of cuts leaves a thinking audience just confused about what just happened.

Sure, I would have loved a darker vibe throughout the film too, especially in the beginning the score reminded a little of a Disney orchestra playing. But ""The Predator"" was a hell of a ride and deserves a special place among the spin-offs."

Anything with Sterling in it is gonna grab my interest. However, I tried watching this movie on five different occasions and just couldn't be dragged into it fully. I finally forced myself to sit down and watch it in its entirety and its nothing to do with the cast they're fine it's just really not that interesting of a story. I can't pinpoint exactly what I think is wrong with it and maybe that's the problem. Maybe this story just doesn't serve a purpose and that's the sour taste it left in me.

Stories that are just marketing ploys never do well and I think this movie is a testament to that fact. This movie has the feeling it was only made so there could be another Predator movie not because it was a story that needed to be told and I'm utterly disappointed that that was the outcome."

Fans of The Big Bang Theory and The Expanse will enjoy a couple of the interesting characters they threw in too.

Ignore the negative reviews and watch it. You won't be disappointed, I'm starting to think imdb reviews can't be trusted as I nearly skipped this movie because of them!

I'm guessing some of the reviewers forgot how cheesy the original predator was and expected something different. They definitely kept the flavour of the original for this but bought it bang up to date with the fx and well used but fun plot devices that work so well in modern scifi."
1.0,29 November 2018,Very disappointed with the movie. Storyline and actors were bad. Like a B- rated movie.

1.0,29 November 2018,"Even if not comparing the first parts of the Predator movie with ""this"", there was zero horror element or tension building. Somehow the ever-cautious predator is now a bad boy who kicks ass. It even can breathe normally in Earth's atmosphere.

The first part of the moveie was somehow okay. Yes, the comic elements were more than the action, more than the tension, more than the fear, horror and aything else. I was just starting to believe that the reviews were underrating it. Then, suddenly everything changed. as if someone said: ""Guys, we have only 20 minutes left, let's finish this piece of crap quicker and go to lunch"". And they listened to him. Applied the standard action film script number 3 and voilla! The script becomes worse and worse, more physics laws broken, Predator behaves as an angry steroid driven teenager, main character is totaly invincible. I was never afraid for his life during the whole movie. And then the standard action film script kicked in: several of these should die, these 3 survive, and we leave open door for sequel. The end.

Music was as if out of Star Wars Racer game. CGI was mediocre."
2.0,29 November 2018,"Bar none, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This is down there with Justice League. This is an atrocity to cinema."

1.0,13 March 2019,"Very pretty Scifi CGI eye-candy for the younger gen, I guess. But most everything story-wise from the original, and its sequels, is now deadened by the bland scripting etc of this one. Similar plot flatline to the Blade Runner sequel. Pressed the Eject button for The Predator disc at about ""chick with numb legs hanging across HD when pseudo-macho ex-sniper dude rescues her after falling from prison bus"" scene. NO REGRETS! In the bin with both these DVDs so I'm not tempted to replay them."

1.0,8 September 2019,I was very surprised how funny this movie was and I was very surprised I enjoyed it. I thought it would be a s#@t show but it's actually a good movie. If you want to laugh watch this movie.
4.0,5 June 2021,Absolutely rubbish. Cheap budget film. Too much unnecessary swearing. Awful film.
10.0,14 December 2018,I loved the first Predator. Although a creature with such hands may seem ridiculous in developing technology. Predetor vs Alien could even be watched. but this time the Predator was definitely killed.

1.0,24 December 2018,"A message to the producers of the franchise, please stop.

PLEASE STOP!

Wafer thin childish plot,coupled with over the top mindless violence.

4.0,15 March 2019,"By how bad this movie is. As a fan of the franchise i have to say that acting, directing, plot, cast, cut and visuals all just sucked. There are so many logical flaws and some scenes are just stupidly funny (fun not intended). This is a really crappy movie.

For Reference : I'd give Predator 8 Stars Predator 2 6 Stars Predators 6 Stars AvP 7 Stars AvP 6 Stars"
2.0,13 December 2018,"It is impossible for another Predator movie to live up to the 1987 McTiernan classic. That being said, Shane Black's film is an entertaining action movie that is incredibly fast-paced, has good action sequences, and is a blast from start to finish. Boyd Holbrook and the rest of the casts' performances are great. The gore is incredible and is a delight to see the Predator have at it with its human targets. Unfortunately, it does get a little silly sometimes, since Black's script is light-hearted and full of jokes. Nevertheless, this is still an awesome movie with sleek direction and a summer entertainer vibe that will pump your adrenaline the minute the movie ends. It honestly felt like an '80s action film which is always a delight"
1.0,14 October 2019,"Guns have never solved any real human problem, ever, yet the testosterone packed solution for the movie is a super killer. Typical Hollywood. There are two reasons I will suggest why writers would conclude the story line the way this movie does and they are, the ending is completely sarcastic, or even paradoxical, presenting a short sighted, moronic military on which humankind must pin it's future OR the writers forgot why the world is in danger as actually stated in the dialogue and then decided to ignore it, thinking the public is just too weak minded to remember the stated problem that faces civilization. This dystopian future is dark either way. Previous Predator movies asked the audience to suspend disbelief that aliens would come to earth to hunt humans , elevating our stock as being worthy somehow even as prey. This movie tries to elevate mankind as genetic lab rats to be sampled from a doomed planet with no hope of salvation from the inevitable apocalypse. Yet a third plot line is presented by the writers using the apocalypse theme, that being, the writers are scholars of biblical revelations who also believe in aliens. How rogue! In any case the plot is imaginative but seriously flawed."
10.0,3 May 2021,"I'm not going to bother describing the plot, the acting or production because it would be utterly pointless.

What I WILL say is that this sort of product of the Hollywood milking machine is making ""made in America"" sound like a syphillis diagnosis, given that most of the ""blockbusters"" are made in America or made with American money.

They are literally churning out garbage after garbage, never stopping to question the integrity, sanity or long term implications of what they're doing. Sooner or later, Hollywoods reputation will become so tarnished, there just wont be any more milk.

This movie is dumbed down to the very lowest common denominator in society and cannot even be considered entertainment by most standards.

Avoid."
1.0,3 March 2019,"I'm not really a fan of the ""Predator"" movies. I liked the first two but then I dropped out. After watching ""The Predator"", I don't feel that I missed out on anything. ""The Predator"" does have some nice action scenes and a (mostly) nice cast. However, its story is kind of silly. So it's a lot of running around for nothing. The boy is the only character that I really cared about. That's a big problem. I never felt like shutting off ""The Predator"" but I'm sure in a few hours I'll forget I ever saw it. Honorable mention: a dreamy Olivia Munn."

3.0,2 January 2019,"Its so stupid its fun. And ironic, really. Predator: ""human, im going to give you a weapon so you can save yourself. But you captured me and treated me very badly, so i am going to kill all of you now. unless you are naked!""

And there's very romantic stuff going on between the Loonies member. I kept saying 'aw' hoping more romantic stuffs shown. They shot each other in the end. That's how much they love each other.

I like this movie, many funny jokes!"

10.0,20 April 2023,"Boyd Holbrook - a sort of love child of Mel Gibson and Michael Biehn - is the army sniper hero (""McKenna"") who finds himself on the wrong end of the law after he and his team encounter the eponymous killing machine in the forest. Lucky to escape with his life, and a few souvenirs from the wreckage, he makes his way to a cantina where he posts his trophies to his wife and son before being taken into custody. Out in space, another of these would be visitors decides it needs to get that stuff back and so arrives duly determined to annihilate all who get in it's way. It turns out that the young ""Rory McKenna"" (Jacob Tremblay) is little short of a genius with AI - and pretty soon he, dad and feisty biologist ""Brackett"" (Olivia Munn) - along with a ragtag band of gung-ho prisoner/soldiers are facing up to their looming terror. Can they survive? Should they survive is probably the better question. Aside from a few scenes at the start and an admittedly lively fifteen minutes at the end, this is almost entirely devoid of the beastie we switched on to see. The dialogue is poorly written, expletive-ridden and banal; the characterisations are really shallow and there are far too many irrelevant sub-plots to distract from the (limited) focus of this 110 minute ramble of a film. The old adage - ""if it ain't broke..."" comes to mind. This is as far removed from the excellent 1987 introduction to this monstrous creature as it's possible to get and is, quite simply, a waste of video tape. There are plenty of adequate visual effects and pyrotechnics, but this film definitely had me rooting for the creature in the mask pretty much from the start!"
1.0,15 September 2019,"This is an embarrassing predator film. Was willing to ignore the reviews but had to switch it off half way through, how did they get the green light to make a predator film that's trying to be funny!? All we want is a load of predators killing everything! Not stupid humans who are weak being the main stars."
4.0,30 November 2018,"I have always been a ""Huge""fan of all the Predator movies, 😂😂😅 but what the hell went wrong here; a huge disappointment. Was this intented to be a kiddies movie?

1.0,9 December 2018,"Here was an opportunity to restart the franchise, and instead we get this silly movie that tries to be a comedy.

I have to assume the female scientist was originally male, and they just changed the sex without bothering to change the script.

What a waste."
1.0,24 September 2018,"Oh dear, only 6 out of 10? I am just back from the cinema which I almost didnt bother going to based on the low ratings. This is a smart, fun and innovative action movie and well worth a trip to the theatre for. Its made me wonder why all the low ratings and it seems to be driven by an agenda of people who still want it to be 1987. Its not though, its 2018 and this is a 2018 movie. And what a movie this is. The main complaints seem to be that the story doesn't make sense. Sorry but it makes as much sense as a movie about aliens needs to. The action scenes deliver, the humour works and it has set itself up to have a very interesting sequel whenever it arrives. This movie does differ in tone from the first two as there is more humour involved and the dialogue is better, theres a few sharp lines which refer to the first movie if your brain is fast enough to pick them up. I am sure that alot of the upset from the fanboys who must now be in their 40s and 50s will be around the joke which points out that the predator, isnt actually a predator. Cue many fanboys throwing a tantrum in their predator PJs. Im sorry but if this type of thing ""ruins your childhood/franchise"" then this movie is simply not for you. Another aspect which may cause offence to that demographic is the story involves a woman and also a character on the autism spectrum. Not everyone is a musclebound mercenary. There is no shortage of action, the technology is great, the story is more interesting than just a bunch of people being killed and the jokes keep the momentum of the movie going. Simply put this is a predator movie of its time. Dont let the low ratings put you off, its a great action movie. Its just not a carbon copy of the 87 movie, which is what a small groups seem to wish for. Its not 1987 anymore and we cant go back...This movie is likely to bring younger fans to the franchise, its a pity that some of the older fans will miss out on the fun based on their own judgement. See you at the next one."
2.0,1 January 2019,"Like Mike Tyson and Roy Jones jr., both great in their time. Both stayed in the game way too long and ruined their legacy. This movie is so bad, it feels like you're watching the Syfy network original. I am a fan of the franchise but this movie is horrible even if it was the first.

You want a spoiler alert, you will hate you wasted your time watching this garbage. You've been warned"
10.0,9 November 2018,"This film has put too much effort into trivia and cheap laughs to hold its own in the Predator franchise. Arnold Schwarzenegger turned down an oppertunity for a brief appearence paying homage to his role as Dutch in Predator (1987) in this film. Most likely because he knew at first glance this Predator film would not stick true to what fans loved about the orginal. Childish mash up with emphasis on everything must be bigger and funnier, garnished with a how many explosions does our budget allow sauce.

TLDR; This films is a colossal train wreck."
3.0,9 December 2018,The F..k-o-meter burned in big flames because could not handle the endless f.k words that came like bursts of machine gun ! :-D But that was not the problem for me. The problem was the director and the screenwriter. Worst Predator film ever ! Was bad even for pop-corn I hope they will not hire again the same director and screenwriter for the next Predator sequels. I liked Olivia Munn ! Very hot ! And I hope I will see her in next Predator sequels ! :-)

2.0,13 August 2019,"It becomes obvious fairly quickly this movie is terrible and laughably bad. So if one can get over the fact right away that it is going to underachieve in every way possibly possible then you can laugh at it. Sort of like going on a bad date and realizing it will make a good story later on, as per the idea that life is usually hilariously stupid. Otherwise it is just extremely annoying to watch.

The first of the only two good things in the movie is Olivia Munn. Her bum and breasts and face and hourglass shape are so freaking awesome, it is almost artistic to the Michelangelo degree. If Michelangelo sculpted something when he was a super horny teenager and obsessed with girls, it would be Olivia Munn. She exudes nerd sexy from every pore (sexyness with intelligence behind the eyes). Ohhhhh yes, she is fantastic. I guarantee she must have amazing nipples. Also, her acting is good (that's right, and you thought I was just sexist, but I am noting for good measure her acting is quite good as well). The second thing that is good in this movie is the line that the predator is, ""A Whoopi Goldberg Alien"". C'mon, now that's a pretty funny line. Oh wait, I forgot Keegan Michael Key is naturally funny. Okay three things are good about this movie. Actually, as I write this I am coming around on this movie. Now I'm starting to think it is pretty great ... maybe just in retrospect. Aaaanyways, watch it if you dare!"

10.0,19 November 2021,Awful characters. Bad storyline. Make the kid looks dumb. It all doesn't make any sense. Boring movie. The ending is also terrible. The worst predator movie that i ever seem.
5.0,23 December 2018,"Let me start by saying that I'm a huge fan of the franchise. I even liked Predators and the AVP movies (although none are as good as Predator 1 and 2).

But this movie was bad on a whole other level. Seriously. I can't think of 1 positive thing to say about it. The problem was the basic premise, the terrible disjointed script, and the forced comedy.

If I had paid to see this I would have asked for my money back; it's that bad.

Whoever green lit this for $60 million dollars should be fired."
5.0,29 November 2018,DO NOT AND I REPEAT DO NOT take the time out of your day to watch this today was my first time watching it and it is horrible every other predator movie is better than this I've been watching this since I was a little kid and I am honestly disappointed
4.0,6 January 2019,"Most are saying this is the worst movie on the Predator franchise. It is, in fact, the worst movie ever... anywhere. That includes Hercules in New York which had better acting, better special effects, and a more believable storyline."
1.0,18 September 2018,Now to be honest from what we expect from a predator movie it was exactly what It was supposed to be. it was funny it was good acting it was explosion eveywheres aliens rip out people's heads . it was everything I could ever wanted from an old action movie not to mention a few choice words camos thank you very much for delivery what I've been waiting for for years.

I can endure in cinema a lot but this ,my vocabulary lacks words to describe my fury I liked in AvP the whole ancient civ served predators thing the rest of movie was average but still i was considering it to be a predator movie a last one it sims"

3.0,15 July 2020,"It's The Predator. Not a film. The gore factor honors the original. The characters are surprisingly likable. I found myself chuckling and rooting for them midway through. They brought levity to an otherwise ridiculous premise. I had zero expectation for this movie and I was rewarded. This isn't 1980's anymore. Movies have changed. Stop whining and expecting to relive the past with every franchise movie. It's schlock and treats itself as such. Candy for the brain. A sugar high from start to finish.

What I don't get is why they showed the pit running towards them."
1.0,25 September 2018,"Massive fan of the original even the other two to a certain extent... but wow what a disappointment. I was so looking forward to this film and was serverly let down.

Although I kinda like where they were going with the upgraded Predator and the gorry scenes (it has to be gorry, c'mon... this is Predator), everything else was more or less MEEEH... Loonies were not believeable at all, caracters too obvious, they tried to hard.

4.0,10 November 2018,"I grew up watching the original two predator movies and loved those. This seemed like its own new twist and i really enjoyed it. It went in depth on the predators tech and filled gaps in their background story. Which I think the older movies couldn't do in the past. In my opinion it is right up there with predator 2 and predators. The only thing that was kind of off was the depiction of the soldiers. Maybe have them train as a soldier or something because I could see where veterans would see it as cringey at times but you get that with most movies. The humor I could see as being too simple and the movie maybe as well if I were a predator or movie nerd. For me this was a 10/10 the flaws made it unintentionally funny at times and it went with the tone, WATCH IT!"
3.0,20 December 2018,I was so lucking forward to this film very disappointing.This film has been totally cheesed out Hollywood style.

Not even scary or thrilling at all. They try to put funny jokes here and there but it ruins a good action thriller theme. This is an absolute parody. I couldn't finish watching, lost interest half way through. Only the beginning of the movie is ok.

Also actors are bad. Original plot is so spooky and as interesting as Alien. How it goes so I rather go back to watch the first one again and enjoy a real action movie by playing Schwarzenegger as a tough soldier!!"
8.0,15 September 2018,"I had a fun night at the movies. The bright spot was the ensemble cast. That was delightful. Other than that though the movie was a complete mess and incredibly stupid. The main star is terrible and constanty took me out of the movie.

Film wise, it has no patience, suspense or fear. The editing and pacing was sloppy and choppy.

Also, no one wants to see a giant, lumbering, bulletproof Predator. They are supposed to be tactical, and lethal but not invincible.

Lastly, no film should ever translate the Predator's language into English. Ever.

I understand they were making a fun action flick but they made a bad one. It wasn't Predator movie or a good genre example.

Terrible film.

It makes me wonder why they take the Alien series so seriously and consistently make Predator movies like this."
2.0,15 December 2018,
4.0,30 December 2018,The cursing and language in this movie is absolutely ridiculous. F bombs and mother fs in every other sentance is extremely unnecessary. There are over 70 F bombs over the course of an hour and 45 minutes. It ruins the movie and left me feeling completely disjusted afterwards. The movie also has a unoriginal plot and makes no sense. There are so many words in the English language that could have been used instead. There is even a point in the movie where a 12 year old says an F bomb and the adults encourage it. This is a new low in film making. Its horrifying to hear so much of it in such a short time.
8.0,11 November 2018,"As mentioned in the title please give Shane Black a medal! This is how you stay true to the original franchise and expand the story of a great sci fi action film.

The biggest problem of this movie i think is that it doesnt know what audience it wants to appeal to.It clearly tries to be like guardian of the galaxy with all the jokes, it tries to pay hommage to the original with certain oneliners and the musical score. Its not scifi enough for the nerds, not scary enough for the horror/thriller fans, its not serious enough for the adult movie goer but its to gory for the younger audience. So because it tries to reach as wide an audience as possible it fails to please anyone, at least in my opinion. On top of that the story makes no sence, the editing is jarring and that bloody kid, i hate kids in movies like this. Lets hope that the predator fans of the original like myself and many here on IMDB will one day get the movie this franchise deserves because this movie was not it."

10.0,28 November 2018,This is so far away from the Arnie and Danny Glover films which I'm sure it's supposed to be but they've tried to make it a little comedy like and gone to far! This film is a big mistake in the eyes of any predator fans I'm sure. This should of been straight to dvd
8.0,5 October 2018,"I thought that Predators is bad ,until I saw this. In short, unlikeable and stereotypical characters, Olivia Munn badass (wtf?), some silly plot points , cheesy lines, just I think, there are two many flaws to name here. Overall, the movie looks like it never got out of post production stage. Sorry but this hunting trip is not my cup of tea."
9.0,5 December 2018,Time to let this franchise die if this is the best they can come up with
9.0,26 August 2020,"Ignore every negative review, people comply when they reboot and remake movies over and over again, then you have a movie like this displaying true sequel storyline and everyone complains anyway, the action is violent, from start to finish, the predators are ruthless which is what we came to see, again ignore the negative reviews."

10.0,10 October 2018,"I can't say anything good about this movie I didn't like any of the characters I didn't have a clue what was going on so much didn't make sense.It hard to be be level producers where able to conive studios out of 100 millinial dollars for this mess...There is so much source material for predator why pull scripts out of the garbage pile.

It's Ironic but Venom turned out to be what Predator should have been."
8.0,19 January 2022,"I watched this movie out of boredom. So anyways, I was checking my local tv schedule which was previously showing this movie and I decided to watch it. I honestly never watched a predator movie before so this was my first experience with the franchise and it was average.

The movie begins with predators' ship falling on Earth when Quinn McKenna was shooting in the forest (I don't remember why). And when he tried to attack the extraterrestrial creature, he got arrested and was stuck in a bus with Nebraska and his team, who were soldiers before they were considered insane. Meanwhile at home McKenna's autistic son Rory discovers the alien armour and decides to study it. In the laboratory Casey Bracket accidentally woke one of the predators and it started to attack everyone in there. Luckily Casey survived, but when she tried to escape, she had to go in the bus as Nebraska and Quinn.

I honestly thought that this was a parody because of Nebraska and his buddies, their behavior reminded me of Zohan (Don't mess with Zohan), because they like to tell each other stupid jokes about their former jobs. Speaking of the characters, all of them were forgettable, I seriously don't remember much about them with the exception of Rory, who was very smart for his age by knowing their language and later was taken away by a predator. The effects and CGI were honestly pretty good for a 2018 movie, the animation on the aliens looks very realistic in my opinion. I also like how predators need human DNA to upgrade themselves and they specifically took Quinn's son, because they thought that autism was the next step in the evolution, which I thought was creative, since autism is not usually presented in the movie industry, and the fact that the creators don't insult such people already makes it better.

But if you want my advice, it's best to skip this movie if you never watched a predator movie before. I'm not sure about fans of the 1987 version, but this wasn't the best nor the worst horror sci-fi film I've seen. Also, it's not really scary, sure there's some blood shown, but it wasn't disturbing nor triggering and it's fine for teenagers aged 13-14.

Could've been worse."
8.0,2 October 2018,"I find myself short for words when faced with describing such a catastrophe of a film. There's just so much objectively wrong and so little, if anything, right. I enjoyed the original Predator film and it's sequel but was never really a fan. I went into this 2018 reboot expecting to be disappointed but not nearly as much, and it simply isn't bias. This film somehow manages to be the Fast and Furious of the Predator franchise to a point where you could replace all the actors with sports cars and it wouldn't lose on value, but gain some in comedy, ironically. I say ironically, because the writers try oh so hard to be funny and relevant that they cannot possibly claim to have been self-aware.

I suppose that the most succinct description of how seeing this mess felt to me is this: It's a moronic mess of a film, trying to convince the audience that it's not such, and making itself look more moronic in the process as if self-assuring. I'm not sure if you can appreciate through review, just how ludicrously low-brow entertainment this film is. The rumors are true, this isn't worth anyone's time but the most easily convinced."
10.0,18 October 2018,"Worst movie in a "" predator "" series , please do not make junk movies like that . Is not funny at all, predator is not a comedy it;s a sci - fi horror!!!!!!!!! Story is so childish and pointless. Do not waste time watching this video ... is nota movie it's a video , very lame video !!!! catastrophe!!!!"
8.0,26 March 2019,"I'm a huge fan of the original and Predator 2 and this movie takes the series (in what I feel) is a fresh direction. That is also what I loved about Predator 2, moving the action into the city and centering the script around different characters. We will probably never get Arnie in another Predator film but that is okay with me for now. I can understand why there is dislike in the community for this film. It kind of throws a lot of peril at you from the get go, unlike the original where there's is a huge build up of suspense before we really see any bloodshed. Yes, the child with the Predator gear is a little outlandish, but makes for interesting situations at certain points of the film. The humor is dark and gritty, just the way I like it in Predator films. The action scenes are intense right off the bat and I give applause to the stunt coordinatation and live-action sequences that were pulled off throughout the movie. The crew was very detailed at keeping this story true to Predator's roots, as well as expanding on the mystasism surrounding the Predator. What the storytellers have done is add some modern touches, obviously because this movie takes place in 2018. It felt fresh. I look forward to seeing what follows this movie! Obviously not as good as the original, but I enjoyed it thoroughly."
9.0,5 May 2021,"Poorly written and poorly directed joke of Ridley Scott Alien Franchise.

Watching this is literally a 'Home Alone' spin off in Alien universun. Extrenally poor plot with way poor execution. Wasted time, money and movie film."
9.0,29 November 2018,"This is the worst installment by far. The actors are awful the plot is aweful. "" soldiers"" none of them would be hired to guard a mall. Apparently they didn't hire an adviser to show them how to be a soldier."

8.0,5 May 2019,So this is just so bad. Rollerball remake bad. The fact that some critics gave it decent scores is almost as troubling as the film itselft. I mean its low single digits score and some moron at roger eberts spot is calling it a 7.5
10.0,31 December 2018,"I felt like I was watching Transformers or some stupid Teen movie. So disappointed, it was so completely unlike Predators (2010) which I loved and was visceral, tense, interesting characters, good to great acting, perfect pacing and editing. All elements this one misses. They might have killed the franchise (like Alien: Covenant). Only positive thing is the lovely Olivia Munn."
8.0,14 December 2018,"I dont know why so many people are hating this, I love it, just enjoy the comedy, action fun. I love the characters, it had its flaws but doesn't deserve the hate."

10.0,8 December 2021,"This is the fourth movie of Predator series. It starts great with nice visual effects and much stronger looking predators. However, the script is not well written and characters are all uninteresting. Dialogues are shallow and overloaded with nonsensical one-liners. The worst part is the fights with predators. Director is too protective of the main crew. Some of them can surf on a spaceship and some can even move faster than the speed of laser. They are literally invulnerable. Too bad that another opportunity was wasted."
8.0,28 November 2018,"Watch the first 40 minutes then turn it off, predator on steroids bad humour terrible story it officially marks the death of the predator franchise, RIP............."
8.0,17 May 2021,"After the first movie, creators did not manage to progress the franchise in a decent way. The 2018 installment of the Predator saga is no exception: forced and trivial comedy, cheesy and uninspired lines, very bad acting. The cast is composed by great names and I feel bad for people such as Boyd Holbrok, which I enjoyed in ""Narcos"" and Alfie Allen, that was in ""John Wick"" and ""GOT"".

The main setting is once again the forest, but this time it is an american one. There are tons of different locations possible, but apparently creators stick with this, scared to repeat probably the disaster happened with Predator 2. This time aliens are made in CGI, and are very inconsistent. Sometimes they look good, other times they look really bad. Pretty disappointing for a movie that has 88 million USD as budget, with basically no plot at all. The editing in the first 30 minutes feels very disjointed, the director jumped between different storylines and I did not understood much at the beginning.

If 20th Century Fox wants to save this franchise, it has deep the lore, explaining Predator's origins. The saga is extremely fragmented, as films are released years apart from each other, and people tend to forget very quickly a franchise that it is so badly followed by its creators. They either reboot the entire saga, by keeping it lighter than ""Alien"", or they just drop it and focus on more productive and beautiful efforts."
9.0,5 May 2019,Terrible. Absolutely terrible. Still better than the Last Jedi. 3 stars only for a couple of funny one-liners.

9.0,9 February 2021,"I liked the movie. Good action good humor! The acting is also not bad. Why so negative?? Ofcourse its everybody's opinion, but 1 star?? No way!! With a bucket popcorn and a liter cola I enjoyed this movie. 8 stars."
10.0,20 August 2024,"""The Predator,"" directed by Shane Black, attempts to reboot the franchise with a mix of action, humor, and sci-fi elements. Unfortunately, the film's chaotic tone and inconsistent narrative leave it feeling like a missed opportunity to revive the beloved series.

The plot centers around a group of military misfits, led by Boyd Holbrook's character, Quinn McKenna, who find themselves battling an upgraded Predator that has crash-landed on Earth. Meanwhile, McKenna's son, played by Jacob Tremblay, becomes entangled in the conflict when he inadvertently triggers the alien technology.

Shane Black, who had a small role in the original ""Predator,"" brings his signature humor and quippy dialogue to the film, but it often clashes with the darker, more serious elements of the story. The mix of comedy and horror doesn't always work, leading to a tonal inconsistency that undermines the tension and stakes.

The film introduces the idea of genetic enhancements, with the Predator evolving by incorporating DNA from various species, including humans. While this concept is intriguing, it's poorly executed, with the film's narrative feeling overstuffed and unfocused. The introduction of a ""Super Predator"" and a confusing subplot involving government conspiracies further muddle the story.

Despite its flaws, ""The Predator"" does have some redeeming qualities. The cast, including Olivia Munn, Keegan-Michael Key, and Trevante Rhodes, delivers entertaining performances, and the action sequences are well-choreographed, with plenty of explosive battles and Predator-driven carnage. The creature design remains impressive, and there are a few nods to the original films that longtime fans will appreciate.

Ultimately, ""The Predator"" fails to live up to its potential, offering a disjointed and uneven experience that tries to do too much at once. While it has moments of fun and excitement, it doesn't capture the suspense or intensity that made the earlier films in the franchise so memorable."
8.0,14 September 2019,This movie makes Mortal Kombat 2 looks like a masterpiece. I need to watch predator 1 again to get my brain straight again.
9.0,2 October 2018,"Am an all-time predator fan... Just wanna say it could not disappoint me more...
it is one of the weakest predators, sequel by sequel the predators get weaker
and weaker. This is by far the weakest of all. And we've got the Upgrade predator, the much bigger, more sophisticated but...guess what? He is nothing impeccable compared to the precedent versions.
And the predators have no characters this time. It just shows up whenever
it is expected to, to what? to fight...it has no personalities compared to previous sequels where some are vicious, some are lenient, some perhaps serious about real challenge or hunting sports, but this is completely zilch! nothing!"
9.0,28 November 2018,"This movie is what is wrong with movies these days. A confused mix of an action movie wanting to be a comedy. You will laugh from the terrible dialogue and oh so lame half hearted attempt at jokes.

The story line, is so full of holes

Save your eyes save your soul

This a national lampoon predator"
8.0,5 May 2019,"I'm not a big Predator fan after the first one. In fact I don't know if I've seen more than the first two. So for those looking for something in line with the Predator franchise I can't help and can only accept what so many reviews familiar with the franchise say which is this is a terrible addition. But the actors in this strangely work well together, the comic lines are almost non-stop. So for that reason alone it's worth watching."
9.0,19 January 2019,Don't know how this got such bad reviews. I loved it. No Predator sequel will compare to the original but in my opinion this is right up there. Great movie!
9.0,2 March 2019,"Just save yourself the disappointment and watch the Arnie or Danny version and be grateful that they made in the first place. Had a lot of hype and with Shane Black involved I was expecting a decent movie but this is on a par with the second AvP movie and that was terrible. Like I said, such a shame."
9.0,29 December 2018,Sitting here watching right now with hubby and teen son and I am glad I rented it and not went to the movies to see it. Like someone else said: more of a parody then anything. A lot of cussing if you like that. Storyline makes no sense so far and to be honest some of the characters got on my nerves so I was rooting more for the predators than I was the humans
9.0,21 October 2018,"I think the movie was good. Great scenes, love the big ass predator."
9.0,24 September 2018,"I had low expectations given the (nonsense) imdb reviews. I almost didn't bother with it the reviews were so bad. I'm so happy I decided to watch it! What a great follow up movie for the franchise. Sure there are some minor points to criticise, but overall it is exactly what you would expect from a Predator movie. Directing: 8/10 Acting: 8/10 Script: 7.5/10 I won't give away too much, but I will say the development of the story line with this latest round of alien hunters is the polar opposite from what the negative reviewers are saying. It continues with the old movies and moves into new territory and then finishes with surprises that I can't wait to see in the next movie that I can't wait to see. If you want an action packed, entertaining sci-fi movie, then I highly recommend this one."
8.0,27 December 2018,
8.0,20 September 2018,Iv just watched this movie today and I came away pretty happy. It's a fun action flick don't be expecting Shakespeare just switch your brain off and have fun. Boyd Holbrook is a pretty decent lead and I love most things with Thomas Jane in and this is no exception. People have been far to harsh on the predator. Give it a go if you enjoyed the previous predator films (not AVP) you'll not regret it.
10.0,3 October 2018,"I really like this movie because the animation is very real and the plot is exciting. Without doubt, I will watch it again!"
10.0,23 September 2018,I enjoyed it as much as all of Shane blacks films. I didn't want to see something that was too much of the copy of the original. I enjoyed as much mainly from getting something I didn't expect. I could tell that maybe the reshoots may have been some studio meddling. But it was fun and enjoyable. I try to get into all movies work a clear head and don't have expectations other than to get a good story and be entertained.
10.0,16 May 2019,Really? 1-2 ratings? I love classic Predator. This was not classic Predator but it was a good sci-fi. It was nice seeing Theon not be a little b**ch.

I enjoyed the original Predator but including the Super Predator was quite a great treat. The cast worked very wonderful together and the action scenes was the biggest highlight. Not too much comedy, but just enough to balance such a great showing. Introducing a new concept was smart and hopefully they explore more of the Super Predators."
9.0,6 August 2021,
8.0,22 August 2021,"While nowhere near as good as the original, this entry into the franchise is pretty damn good, probably because it doesn't take itself too seriously. This film delivers great pacing, tons of comic relief, & reads like a comic book. Anyone accusing this film of being the worst in the franchise is just stupid."
9.0,4 October 2018,1. Movie is good. Not great. Worth watching. The team.of soldiers made up for what the movie lacked in story element and common sense. I was not a fan of the ending but I would rank this movie under the original but above the last Predator movies. Maybe even above Predator 2. Simple.
8.0,2 July 2021,"The Predator's as always were impressive though this was made after dad died, so it lost its fluff some. The general story is not good, and the chick is annoying but hey i'm a woman hater. The tall Predator was impressive but hey the little one was working fine. I heard Arnie wouldn't do a cameo for his fans. He should have. 8 stars for the Predators."
10.0,12 September 2021,"I don't understand those who hated this movie. It was a really good movie with tons of action. The story line was great, the characters were great, and the premise was great.

And yes, I'm a long time fan of the franchise. I understand there are purists, but I don't see how this movie stepped on their toes.

I was really hoping for a sequel to this one."
9.0,19 September 2018,"It has tone of Thor: Ragnarok, so if you expect serious tone of the first movie, then you will be disappointed, but if you don't mind cheesy humour, intentional cringe and tons of on-liners you will love it."
8.0,12 November 2018,"Honestly, what more do you want in a movie, this one had the lot! Action, Science fiction, Aliens.... well actually Predators and a fast paced well developed and original take on the Predator franchise. With all the Predator movies that have came before this one, we had only been drip fed small amounts if any back story on the Predators. now like Predator 2 it becomes real, not out in a jungle , not at the Antarctic, but right smack bang in a populated area. the story line gives a reason and some depth as to the why. I thought this was right up there with the best of 2 hour escape sessions around in this the new era of the slow burn 15 part series. loved it. get a life all you critics, this was a great movie

Spx & muah perfect. Didn't feel like a video game. The sound effects & sound didn't confuse or kill my ears.

I don't understand d.u.m.b people who criticize it, they just don't have arguments to do it, they just repeat what others ignorants say, people who didnt like it, it's because they don't have a smart brain to not follow the masses and give their own opinion, the film is AMAZING, 100% recommended, don't hear bad reviews, it's from people who don't understand about cinema, script, and specially THE PREDATOR WORLD!"
9.0,10 November 2018,"What is you people's PROBlem? you underrate some, overrate others... when i'm considering seeing a movie, i gauge my expectations according to available information...genre, director, actors...and reviews. this one woulda been fun in 4DX(a multifaceted tech used by some of the Pathe theaters here in NL). but i shined it on b/c of the reviews. in any case, it was entertaining... i don't care if part of it(the beginning) was a lot like the first one. tribute. appreciated, if that was the case. it IS, after all, one of the movies that gave the schwarz some credibility. and a big surprise, overall, i remember. i don't even care if it was formuLAic..(the kid and dogs...'gotta have that youth appeal and endangered innocent', i hear the screenplay book writers whispering). i thought it had good pacing(it broke from action every once in a while), very well done action scenes, even though we've seen these many times before by now. and, best of all, they used lots of 'coolness' cliches in the right places. so that they were funny again. there were, imo, subtle touches of good writing... and i exPECT a movie of this sort to NOT be credible! so if that's ANYone's complaint, my response is...'ya gotta be KIDding me!' in any case, i thought this movie deserve about a 7.0, overall...so i gave it an 8.0 to balance out the haters. granted it's FAR from the best of its sort...but it wasn't BAD! it was...'ok'. and i just don't know what more people want, reaLIStically, from a movie of this sort...just kick back and have fun, people. it's MADE for that..."
8.0,17 December 2019,"This recent entry in the Predator Movie Franchise is the first time that it tries to adapt it's own story in the style of the legendary Dark Horse comics in the Alien and Predator universe that started all the way back in the late 80's and still continues to this day. I think it's actually pretty good despite the people that moan and complain about movies like Predator 2 just because they didn't read on the lore of their films through what was already established by Fox and the Thomas Brothers as Canonical. Shane Black did a fine job inventing that Lethal Weapon style humor into a sort of semi-sequel to what was to me the greatest movie in the series and the one that really established itself from all the other movies.(Predator 2) The ending is a little bit flawed but I see what they were trying to go for because it's basically been done before in the Dark Horse comics where Predators can actually recruit some humans into their hunting parties, this would have been the beginning of something really great if people gave it more of a look, it's not the greatest film of the franchise, but it's certainly close to that, I'd reccommend that you give it a watch."
10.0,19 August 2021,"I see a lot of people criticizing the ""CG"" predator. The predators in this movie at least the first one is NOT CG. And it's obvious. Super predator not so sure.

Second, it's funny af and better written then the original when it comes to dialogue.

Is the story as good? Well it's different, this is more fun and goofy. I suppose it's a somewhat different feel in that but it's a lot of fun.

It's violent Af, manly af, and funny - what's not to like? Not enough close ups of Arnold and Carl weathers' biceps handshakes?

This movie is PERFECT."
10.0,18 September 2018,"Look, Shane Black delivers everything he promised. A well paced action film with laughs, gore and expanding of predator lore. The third act is a little ho-hum and the tone is off because of this, especially in the last 20 minutes where character deaths hold no weight when all the film's likeability built over the previous 80 minutes should have created a greater emotional impact.

Positives +Humor +Soundtrack +Sterling K Brown

Negatives -Third act -Uneven tone

Just check your brain at the door and enjoy the flick. There are some genuinely great moments in the film from the human and alien characters and you could do a lot worse."

And it blows the doors off of the AVP movies. Why are expectations so high? It's entertaining for sure. This is not a paid review I'm just being realistic. Ignore the hate on this for sure. I couldn't believe this had a 5.4 out of 10 considering it's better than all Predator remakes and AVO movies to come along so far. You can't beat the original Predator, period, so take it for what it is and enjoy the ride."
10.0,5 October 2018,I was very entertained by this movie. I didn't have the urge to get up in the middle of the movie because I was bored and needed to stretch my legs. There are a LOT of top movies that bored me to tears and I left 3 or more time while the movie was playing. If you want to be ENTERTAINED - this is a great movie.
10.0,18 September 2018,Once this gets going it was just awesome. Most of the complaints I am reading here were addressed in dialogue. I would guess the haters were glued to their phones instead of paying attention to the movie. If you are a predator fan don't miss it.

8.0,9 December 2018,"Why this movie gets such bad rap and lousy score I cannot fathom. I'm old enough to have watched the original Predator in its prime and I absolutely LOVE this version. Great funny dialog, terrific action and over the top characters. I was prepared to be disappointed, but this is by far the best Predator since the original movie and one of the funnest action movies I've seen for some time. Great entertainment if you don't expect it to be something it's not. This movie hasnt got the seriousness that some people may think it should have (why is that?), but I dig that it plays with the genre and does what it does. It's pretty unique in its own right. Believe you me; this movie will only get a better reputation over time."
10.0,13 November 2018,I dont know what all the bad press is about??? I found this probably the best predator after the the original one. Id say it didnt have a big budget like the other predators but it was a different story than the rest . It worth a watch
9.0,2 January 2019,I am in the minority of someone who enjoyed it. It is not close to the original or the second or even for me avp. But I enjoyed it. I suppose it had its campy moments and that is why people hate it. But to me I could withstand it and actually took it quite well. Like I said this does not come close to the original 2. And comparing this to those would be an insult. But still enjoyable in my opinion.
8.0,2 July 2020,"""A predator kills its prey to survive. I mean, what you're describing is more like a bass fisherman.""

I liked it. It did it's own thing but still gave us predator scenes to enjoy. We getting deeper into the whole predator mystique. It makes you laugh, it's full of typically bonkers Shane Black one-liners. It veers into Spielbergian territory with the Jacob Tremblay kid-meets-alien stuff. I get that some fans wanted something different and were disappointed, but objectively it's a good movie.

""It's like an alien Whoopi Goldberg."""
8.0,1 December 2018,"Let's be honest. Predator, as a franchise, had been dead since 1990's attempted sequel to the good movie that was 'Predator' in 1987. This was a fun movie to watch and the first movie in a long time that actually had me not wanting the members of the team to die - though, of course, that's all they are there for. Thomas Jane is enjoyable. And I loved the way that ended. So sweet! Don't watch it sober! And enjoy!"
8.0,14 February 2019,Wish it linked in more than it did with 1/2 but black wanted his own vision. This film is a great new take and sets up sequels. I don't understand why this has bad reviews. You must judge this against the other films. Leave your brain at home and enjoy. Plus the humour is great
8.0,29 May 2020,"Dont get me wrong the story needed a bit more work but overall I really enjoyed it, all these fanatic fans really need to calm down it was funny, plenty Gore and Plenty action what more do u want from these films?"
8.0,17 September 2018,"One of the best Predator movies ever!! The movie has great sense of humor and comedy, interesting action and brutal kills !"
10.0,30 September 2018,I was worried about going to see this due to the poor reviews but I went last night and both my girlfriend and I throughly enjoyed it. I am a long time fan of the Predator franchise and she had never watched one and we both found it very entertaining and may not have the best plot and a rushed 3rd act it had me entertained the whole way through the movie.
8.0,10 August 2020,
8.0,4 October 2018,"Anyone going to the movies that's familiar with the predator series knows what they are going to get. This isn't fine art and storytelling. This is just pure entertainment. And it was objectively entertaining, many laughs, great jokes and good action. The people that rated it so low must have expected a film, this is just a good weekend flic."

9.0,11 April 2021,"Went into this movie blind after going on a Predator movie binge. It was great. Afterwards I saw the low IMDB rating and decided to read the reviews and find out why. It was all a bunch of whiny movie snobs who expected an action movie to be an Oscar contender, so they gave it 1 star ratings. I could see how it could be a disappointment if you went into it expecting a serious action movie like the original, but to hate on it enough to write a bad review saying it was the worst movie they ever saw? I normally don't write many reviews, but I had to do my part to let people know it's a actually a solid flick with great actors and a hilarious script. Not surprising it's the same director as Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and Nice Guys, both of which have similar humor. If you love all types of movies and want to be entertained for a couple of hours, watch it."
8.0,3 November 2020,"Clever concept, some hilarious dialogue (where appropriate), and great action. Have watched it several times already."
8.0,19 July 2020,"The story was poor,the music was good and the action scenes they were awesome all fights and deaths were amazing,the characters the whole gang and lady was fun and hilarious,the father-son bond was amazing,the ending fight was little lazy but good and the post-credit type scene it was literally awesome ""the predator killer"",the Overall comedy was amazing and the situations was good although the story and execution was bad and some scenes felt very dumb but it was fast-paced entertaining movie!"
8.0,16 August 2020,"I don't know why this movie Is rated so lowly. I think it's one of the three best. A new take on the series. Yes, the Treager character made guesses about the alien's intent on coming to earth To explain the plot, but other than that, the plot And the acting were good. Lots of action, of course, and some humour to lighten it up."
9.0,3 February 2019,It is just not as good as previous predator titles. I had no idea what was going on half of the time. It was a really good movie but could be improved..
8.0,8 October 2024,
8.0,12 May 2021,"If you love predator dogs, this in the film for you. Also, the bully in the story thinks Asperger's is a type of food."
8.0,22 August 2021,"What is wrong with everyone? This movie is great, long time predator franchise fan this was a GREAT edition. Actually the best predator film to date, great amount of action and sci-fi, just enough comedy to be funny and not ruin it. The story made sense and the acting was fine. Waaay better than AVP2, AVP, Predators, Predator 2 and Predator. Shane Black, keep it coming!"
9.0,15 January 2019,"Action and SciFi movies of the 80s are untouchable. You cant recreate them, so why try???

'Predators' did the serious, moody thing really well, so why try and beat it???

That's what Shane Black has thought here....

This movie takes the franchise in a whole new direction - it's now funky, fresh, still full of gore, now has endless possibilities, and, most importantly, veers away from the Alien franchise faster than a Predator scout ship.

Yes, some of the acting is, shall we say, debatable. Some of the action scenes are highly improbable and make you laugh when they shouldnt, and should, and some of the reactions to grave situations are understated or missing all together.

But so was every movie of it's kind pre-1997 right!!??

The mythology is supported well and goes in a direction all comic book fans will recognise and appreciate.... so dont worry about that either!!! If you read any of the comics, you'll appreciate this movie.

The one liners come thick and fast, the blood flows almost constantly.... enjoy this movie for what it is and not what the never-happy-keyboard-warriors expected it to be.

Thank you Shane Black."
8.0,11 November 2018,Bloody and funny just loved new take on it ! Shane black i want a second movie !
10.0,28 May 2021,"Some people seem to forget that the Predator franchise is built on cheesiness, action and a lot of blood. You can find all of those things here. This movie is far from perfect, but it brought just enough new things to the table to justify it's own existence."
8.0,2 August 2020,"The franchise is long and meandering. I lost interest in it long ago, because frankly, there were some pretty low lows. Based on comments here, I watched this movie without any expectations based on the franchise, and didn't care about breaking any ideas from the franchise. It was fun. Full of plot holes, of course, hilariously tropy dialogue. Who cares. You watch it for the kicks, of which there are plenty. Those wanting epic Shakespeare are looking in the wrong place, and this film should not be rated by that criterion."
9.0,7 June 2020,
8.0,22 December 2018,I thought the movie was great I'm tired of all the wanna be critics saying how bad it is or it's a piece of crap totally waste of time it killed the franchise look I'm no critic or paid to say anything good about this movie I happened to really like the movie yes all movies have some issues no matter what movie it is every single one has its ups and downs if you say they don't you need to have your head examined of course this movie might have issues but who really cares if you like to watch movies and enjoy watching a good action movie with comedy thrown in then you'll love this movie If I cared about what people say about movies then I would never watch movies everyone has there opinions I say don't listen to my opinion or anyone else's watch the movie for yourself keep an open mind
4.02,26 January 2020,"WHERE are the bad reviewer's better scripts for this title? Shane Black did a great job of directing and co-writing this. The action is fantastic.So's the cast, esp. Boyd Holbrook. Jacob Tremblay's ""Rory"" was excellent. The effects, the two ""sub-species"" of monsters, loved it all, and once again, Where are the better scripts, you who don't like this film??"
4.02,12 November 2018,I don't understand why this movie gets so many bad reviews I think it's okay . Thomas Jane is funny in this one .
4.02,17 March 2021,"It is a good movie in terms of the acting,graphic and funs. All the other actors are well too. Overall t seems just fine and above average. The plot is ok as well. I have been struggled to watch just because of the low rating however I finally managed to watch it at the end it just quite entertain. For me this movies shoud at least above 6.8 point in average. For me i would rate it 7.3 personally. The lower rate here encourage me to just more than just that."
4.02,28 January 2019,"I was looking forward to this movie after seeing all the rest over the years, but I got concerned over the amount of negative reviews, But I watched it anyway. If your a die hard nerd wanting the Arnie style predator movie you probably won't like it. If you want a good movie to kill some time and don't care about nerd stuff you will like it."
4.02,12 December 2018,"There are a lot of poor reviews for this film, with also a poor box office return, and i understand their upset, but if you look at the Predator series ( excluding the Alien V P films ) each Predator film is different with it's own individualism and still part of a series. This film, has the great music, it has the Predator and more, it has the ultra violence and gore, runs smoothly with great production values, good acting with some nods to the other films. You are warned that there is more humour in this one than the others, but only adds to the entertainment, a worthy addition to the Predator series, when 'Asylum' films take over the production .. then it's time to worry, enjoy this one, it stands well with the others."
4.02,5 October 2024,
4.02,23 September 2018,I watched this in 3D IMAX on day of release. I thought it was quite good. It is a modern take on the predator franchise. It has some really good and interesting ideas. Lot's of CGI and cool special fx. It is just what we needed and have been waiting for from the series. I came away thinking good effort.
4.02,11 January 2019,"Don't understand the harsh negatives. The characters are well done and fleshed-out. The action is top notch and fairly original. Special effects are as good as they come Finally, I like the writing. Solid story with dialog that offers humor and drama.

There is a new advanced predator, more back story, new predator vs. predator storyline and a bit of a cliffhanger at the end.

Oh yeah - predator puppies - very cool!"
4.02,15 November 2018,"I never saw the predator franchise, never felt like watching bcoz of the dark and horror feel but this movie is very different its a comedy action movie loved it, especially the cast All the actors did very well. I dont know about the real predator story but this story is also good."
4.02,27 August 2021,"I gave this 10/10. It's a good film and really doesn't deserve the 5 star rating it has at the time I'm writing this review. So my full marks 10 is to rebalance that very unfair score I feel it has.

I like what they've done with the franchise. You'll always get the fans who hate where it goes because they don't agree. Take Star Wars as a good example.

I do hope there's a sequel because the final hook to the next film looks promising and I really like the main actor.

All the actors in the film were excellent.

As for the film it has some great characters who you end up loving. A bunch of army misfits on their way to an army looney farm makes for some great comedy and loveable characters.

It's like ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" created its own ""A Team"".

You'll get Sci-Fi, Comedy, Tragedy and plenty of action all rolled into one.

This is definitely the best of the Predator/Alien films that has been made in the last decade or more."
4.02,21 January 2024,"I love the idea of the group of soldiers who are broken and crazy. The ""Looneys"" they call themselves and rightfully so. I watched the making of the movie and it seems like everyone was having so much fun on set and it wasn't surprising because it makes it through in the acting. They all have this chemistry that was refreshing to see.

Man, I can't imagine where the sequel would have went, but it was definitely setting one up.

Me and my brother saw this and had a great time. I showed him the reviews of everyone bitching about it and they have some good points, but a 1 out of 10? Good lord you're emotional. Get a rag and change your review to a 5 at the least.

True, it's not as scary as it could have been I'll give you that one, but it was definitely something new and could have been much worse. There was a lot of hard work done to make this come to life. I'd watch the sequel day one."
4.02,1 February 2019,"I watched this on a flight recently and I loved it. I was looking for a fun action movie and this delivered. Sure there was some cheesiness but I am not looking for a clone of the original series and am open minded. It was more ""fun"" than scary/horror. Despite poor reviews I say give it a chance."
4.02,6 January 2019,"This is a retro movie with modern elements and good characters. The story line is a bit weak but but bad. Compered to the AVP2 movie, this one is amazing. This can be the beginig of war againt the predators. I like this movie and cant wait the next step. In a pc game maybe?"
4.02,3 November 2020,"If u hate this movie then I suggest u watch it again and realize that they are evolving. The Predator and Predators are the best 2 movies that followed the original. At least these 2 show a progression instead of regurgitating the same BS over and over. This movie was smart, funny and well done. Thankfully there was no stupid Alien to F-- up this movie. I hope there's a follow up to this so I can see that Predator Killer in action."
4.02,16 February 2020,"I thoroughly enjoyed this sharp, witty reboot, the action, the use of an autistic spectrum character, the excellent score, really retro and reminded me of back to the future. The lead army character was pretty fleshed out for one of these films, the family was wholesome and likeable.

I don't know what people expected from this but it's certainly not 5/10 bad."
4.02,14 April 2019,I totally understand the fact that one of the reasons people don't like this film is because it has new ideas and just a comical tone to the movie. When me and my dad went to go see this movie we where really hopeful and we where more than surprised with the movie and we thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It has gore and comedy just like the original film.
4.02,13 May 2019,This was better than most of the other sequels. You still had action and gore galore. If you like those things but don't like to laugh occasionally then this isn't for you. You had tech and spikes and a fairly clever plot. All you haters just fear change.
4.02,12 November 2018,Most of the comments on this movie that gave a low grade tends to compare this movie with the old ones. I personally love the old ones but I don't see this as a remake. Instead they have created a new storyline based on previous work and taken it into the new century. I really liked it!
4.02,30 December 2018,No it's not a classic but it is a pretty tough and suspenseful film. It's a good movie that stands on it's on. It's not for old worn out movie critics but is a film designed for action movie and sci fi fans. The Predator does come short on having a thin plotline and needs more depth however it really is an entertaining addition to the franchise. Would love to see a sequel what happens NEXT. Oh yeah they leave you on a cliffhanger but it's super cool!
4.02,5 October 2024,
4.02,11 November 2018,"I enjoyed the heck out of this movie! The casting was spot on and everyone had a great chemistry with each other...The lead is new to me but man, he was perfect for that role and olivia munn just rocked her part...sassy, tough and funny...the storyline had my interest and so did the lead and olivia right from the get go...This was a fun ride, with all the predator element from previous movies and a plotline that expanded on who they were and Why they were here. this one blended humor and the best collection of mercinaries since the 1st movie..I gotta say I liked this directors take on the predator movies ...Thumbs up from me for a fun, scifi that blends humor in the mix with over the top action an expanded look at the underlying motivations and end goal of the aliens.."
4.02,23 September 2018,"I saw it with my family and everyone enjoyed it. We're all hardcore Predator and Alien fans. This movie didn't disappoint. I don't understand some of the reviews here. Just seem strange that people would rate it so low. Almost as if they have an agenda. Anyway, I'll be buying this when it comes out and adding it to my Alien/Predator collection."
4.02,29 January 2019,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie. I read a few negative comments and then tuned out from user feedback because ultimately I wanted to see the movie regardless and I'm glad I did. I found the journey this movie took quite fun. The explosions, kills, tech, humor, and the twists and turns it takes made it a solid popcorn flick that fit right in with the other movies in the series. The original trailer for this did the movie no justice as out of context it looked overly corny. In many respects this movie adds and expands the Predator franchise. No spoilers. IF you have any interest in the franchise, then give the movie a watch. It probably won't be your favorite movie of all time, but it'll scratch that itch for more on the Predator franchise. I'd also recommend watching Predator, Predator 2, along with Predators to get some of the lore this movie leans on."
4.02,2 October 2018,"Didn't know what to expect going in and that was what worked for me. If you go in expecting something specific, 9 times out of 10 it isn't what you expected and then you have a big cry about it. Quit whining and just enjoy a movie for what it is. The way I look at this, is the same when I saw Thor Ragnarok, it was a surprisingly fresh take, but maintained the audiences interest and just worked. Guess they can't please everyone though"
4.02,30 November 2018,
4.02,30 September 2018,"I really dont get the hate i mean i know this movie isnt amazing or even ""good"" but it still managed to be enjoyable with good action scenes and some funny moments,i know its not perfect but come on since when the original predetor was perfect ? 8/10"
4.02,27 February 2021,"It seems like most people drank Haterade instead of Coke and munched on dingleberries instead of buttered popcorn when they watched The Predator.

The Predator is exactly what it's supposed to be; a fun, fast paced, crude humored , gory good time. There are a few issues with it but at the end of the day it's all of no consequence because The Predator is one killer ride.

The Predator is an homage to its own pedigree. It pays tribute to the first film in spades and in both serious and tongue in cheek ways. There is quite a bit of suspension of disbelief but when you're dealing with a film about aliens from another planet coming down to earth and sport hunting humans...everything kind of fits right on in.

Dialog is witty and humorous. Yes, a bit politically incorrect but that's a welcome breath of fresh air for me considering all the bland dialog other movies have these days because everyone is so afraid to push buttons and get canceled. A appreciate the testicular fortitude displayed by Shane Black and Fred Dekker.

Gore is on point. Blood flows, limbs and bullets fly all at a frenetic pace. Music and sound effects are spot on. Not sure what else anyone expected.

Bottom line; if you enjoyed first 3 Predators this will not disappoint, unless you have a large stick lodged up your bum. Then maybe watch The Avengers instead."
4.02,11 November 2018,"It's clearly not an Oscar winner. But if you want a to watch a good action film that does not take itself to seriously this is for you. From it's throwback 80s feel tongue and cheek comedy to its action packed scenes, this is a none stop FUN to watch film. If you want to watch something spectacular that you can absorb into your soul then watch The Shape Of Water. However if you want to watch something that does what it says on the tin, give this a go. Have some fun people!! Not everything needs two PhDs to watch!."
4.02,15 November 2021,
4.02,8 January 2019,"Great action / sci fi / comedy. Not the rest of the series, but it's a good entertaining moment. With epics catchphrases like old action movies, cute alien animals and lots of beheadings."
4.02,11 September 2021,
4.02,2 December 2018,I found this to be very entertaining. While not quite as elaborate as the previous editions I give it equil ratings to the others. This goes to my list of favorites.
4.02,27 September 2018,"Well, my wife and I really enjoyed this film. It was fun, thrilling and fast paced. Although different from what I was expecting, it was still good fun and very entertaining.

Just watch it for entertainment value and don't compare to the original, though there were some great links, and it made us smile.

8 out of 10."
4.02,21 January 2019,This movie doesn't get near enough credit. Anyone who knows predator lore will greatly enjoy this movie. This movie was risky and that is what made it great!
4.02,4 December 2018,Thought it was almost as good as the first one. Hope to see a sequel or a continuation of this Predator!!!!!
4.02,21 August 2024,"Well now... that title is most assuredly for sake of irony because none of those were met in this production.

That said, the movie had some merit and also entertainment value -- so long as you aren't someone who gets pissy over canon or versus the theatrical predecessors. I have no intention to spoil anything, but I do offer the following non-spoilers: .. core storyline was less Predator than any predecessor

.. the acting was decent (a great, even surprising line-up), but they couldnt prevent feeling off-ish because of the utilized polt -- give it the chance though. Even if you just abhor it, it's canon now... take that bite and swallow.

.. they really need to stop using the word 'Predator' in production titles, I mean c'mon... I essentially learned of the movie watching deep-fan series analysis. It wasn't just me either, when I brought up this 2018 Predator movie to my closest sci-fi loving friends, not a one of had any knowledge of it... and it's six effing years later.

Opinions: .. they weird bits, even the ones that will anger the most hardcore fans, we're all 'fresh' and could lead to other, fruitful future productions. I wouldn't blame anyone for being skeptical, though.

.. most of us appreciated ""Predators"" (2010) so it's regrettable Fox may have lost their way. Maybe they're hiring from their political section."
4.02,5 March 2019,"I love the Predator movies (not counting the AvP ones) and I'm a big fan of Shane Black's work. Regretfully, I was unable to see this in the theaters with my old buddies that grew up in the eighties, and after the extremely mixed reviews, I was a little hesitant to watch the movie at all. Well, I finally did, and I loved it! It doesn't take itself too seriously which is probably what pisses most die hard fans off, but I loved the slight campiness. It's got the writing and zaniness of an 80s action movie but with all of the slickness of a modern flick. I wasn't crazy about the suit at the end and I don't think I would want another movie that followed that plot line, but, otherwise I thought it was great!"
4.02,2 February 2019,"I really enjoyed this movie. It had a nice mix of action and comedy. It has a nice cast of actors and the sets were nicely done. I wish that the soundtrack would have been more original, but I had a good time with this movie. Thank you to the production team."
4.02,1 April 2019,"I enjoyed this movie. Everything you expected from an action movie. It had some added story line with the one guys family. I found this to be a positive. I know there are those who feel the first Predator is the end all, be all, but I liked this one much more. Guess the original is one you needed to love when the movies were still pretty cliche and cheesy. This version is on par with action films of the current era. Olivia Munn is kick ass!"
4.02,25 January 2019,
4.02,27 September 2018,"As of many i adore the original movie but hey sometimes you have to move on.This is not a bad film if you open your mind and forget about Arnie and co.It's got plenty of action,comedy and gory violence.I enjoyed it and liked the story."
4.02,23 September 2024,"Watching this for the first time in 2024 this movie is refreshing. As far as a predator movie the hardcore fans might not like it, but this is a fun action packed well acted movie. Some of the light heartedness is well placed and while the movie stays very gory. Another thing that makes the movie is all the military/veteran characters who seemed to riff off of each other very well. Im guessing all the low rating are from the hardcore predator fans, but if you are just someone who wants to watch a good r rated movie. Look no further! Also want to add that the cast is very diverse, but doesn't feel forced like most movies now a days."
4.02,1 October 2018,
4.02,5 January 2019,"Went to see this at the cinema and seen it again just now and it was pretty good. It kept me interested and had mostly good points, the only downside was it was not deep enough with the story, it was simple but that's not all bad.

A platoon is wiped out after an alien ship crash lands nearby and one sniper then wounds the Predator and as proof of aliens landing he takes an arm cuff and a face mask from the Predator and sends it home. His son opens the package and inadvertently sends a signal to the alien ship and a race to save all commences.

The soldier meantime is arrested and placed on a bus with other convicts and well they all end up as a motley crew trying to get to his son and save him along with a biochemist who was inspecting the stunned alien in the government lab.

It's a great film, lots of action and even some humour. I really can't remember the original predator film which I would think doesn't need to be referred to as this is a stand alone remake."
4.02,19 July 2020,"So many cinephiles writing scathing reviews like the other Predator movies were Citizen Kane. Don't get me wrong, this isn't the best in the series but let's tone down the hate a few notches, giving it a 1 star review, saying it's the ""worst movie you've ever seen"" really? This is a Predator movie, it's not a deep inner meaning Christopher Nolan/M Night Shyamalan movie. I bet if the majority of 1 to 3 star reviewers on here went into the movie with an open mind then this would have a much higher rating."
4.02,24 December 2018,This movie totally destroyed the PREDATOR franchise. Damn!!
4.02,24 December 2018,
4.02,14 September 2019,Somebody should have 3 red dots on them for making this.
4.02,14 August 2021,"I watched 16 minutes of this thing and I can already tell it's the worst Predator-related movie yet. (Which is saying a lot - AVP was painful to sit through, but at least I sat through it.)

It's nothing but muscular wish-fulfillment and clumsy stereotypes without any actual depth or intention. Don't waste your time."
4.02,12 December 2018,"I've waited for years for this movie. I even read the paperback of the first movie. Was built up to be as good as the first. Why why why does Hollywood think it has to introduce comedy to movies. Happening so often now. For God sake give us an adult movie that's got omg that's powerful. Not I'm embarrassed for the writers. Like when you make a joke and nobody laughs. That's The Predator. Unfunny comedy

Why did you do it??"
4.02,11 November 2018,"A movie that fell out of time. It would have been a B-Movie cult classic 30 years ago. Releasing it nowaday as a major production is weird and a let down with its medicore production value, dated writing and flaws through and through. It can be enjoyed as a parody of movies like Halloween or Hellraiser. Watched seriously its just tons of wrapped together garbage of 80s movie clichees that would not stand for itself."
4.02,7 August 2019,
4.02,28 September 2018,"There are 3 aspects of the film that I believe makes it a good basic sci-fi if not a good sci-fi horror film which are the main theme on autism, the predator technology and finally the basic story development.

First of all, nothwithstanding the violence, the gore or the low level plot that demands careful listening in order to understand the story , one aspect of the film's written reviews on The predator that is missing, is not having focused on the central theme which is autism.

From the beginning when we first encounter Rory McKenna (Jacob Tremblay) we sense something peculiar with him. When in a classroom he reveals to be autistic the story goes on to have him discover how the alien technology functions and later that the Super predator wants to capture him to take his DNA.

In addition, Casey Bracket (Olivia Munn) mentions that the future generation of humans will be autistic, nothing more is said on how that will come about. Will it be by a new alignment of planets? The increase of vegetarian meals? A rise of non smoking societies? Vaccines supposedly responsible for the rise of autism children will be forced on children in order to have superchildren? Or...

The second aspect which makes it a good science fiction film is the alien or predator technology. Let's admit it, the predator technology is just grandiose. I hope such technology will exist in case a new world war is started. It will give hope to humanity that the war won't last long. Especially when we see the predator armour at the end and Quin McKenna (Boyd Holbrook) says it will be his armour.

Finally, the basic plot based on low humour, gratuitous violence that some scences could have been avoided to let more explaining by the characters. The story can't be cheaper than that.

In all a film that I would rate 7/10."
4.02,20 December 2018,"While sniveling fan boys and devotees of 'cinema' decry The Predator, it would be best to admit that while these puerile purists and twenty year olds criticize this latest outing Ned to understand that we are not looking for the Citizen Kane of Predator Movies. Hallo, it's called, entertainment!?! The ensemble cast is inspired, a hunter of Logan, an old shark wrangler with Tourette's? An unmanned stalwart from the Iron Isles? Add in a genius kid with Aspergers who is genuinely likable, a villain who was funny and entertaining. Predator hunting dogs,(technically they're hunting dogs, rather than Predator dogs, I want one) and an eleven foot super Predator. Adds up to a classic, critics be damned."

The Lack Of Suspence

The Dumb Moments (And The Dumb Ending)"
4.02,12 November 2018,"We don't need a comedy Predator movie or a parody like this one! We need a real Predator movie. This one is unbelievably bland and uninterested. There is no suspense, no good action. Only a stupid story and stupid jokes. The whole movie is a joke. The truth is that it's a real disgrace! Please bring back John McTiernan for the next Predator movie! Please!"
4.02,30 November 2018,I can't figure all the very negative reviews. This was as entertaining as any of the Predator movies and definitely as good as the first one starring Arnold....
4.02,30 September 2018,"The movie was good. The action scene were really good, the characters make sense and the plot was really good. My only problem with the movie is the dialogue and the amount of joke told. Other than that the movie was really good"
4.02,5 January 2019,They keep making this franchise worse and worse! I wasted my dollar at the Redbox with this one.
4.02,29 November 2018,A WASTE OF TIME VERY DISAPPOINTING NOT GOOD AT ALL
4.02,18 September 2018,"Mediocre plot, bad dialogue, partially miscast etc.. The predators were basically shown as wimps compared to the originals. It didn't have the same atmosphere as the original or even the weaker sequel. Honestly I was expecting more from Shane Black. No need for a sequel or a another reboot, I think this is just beating a dead horse."
4.02,6 November 2018,"Predator, the 2018 remake of the excellent original, is an absolutely unnecessary, Irrelevant, Weak, lame, Awful and completely crap film. This film has an absolutely awful and crap cast and crap characters compared to Arnold Schwarzeneggers original film 'Predator' and the sequel 'Predator 2' starring Danny Glover and Gary Busey. This film has awful actors such as Keegan Michael Key, Jake Busey and Brian Prince as The Predator as well as absolutely awful acting by the actors.

The 1987 original 'Predator' has an absolutely brilliant cast and stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as Dutch, Carl Weathers as Dillon, Elpidia Carrillo as Anna, Bill Duke as Mac, Jesse Ventura as Blain, Sonny Landham as Billy, Richard Chaves as Poncho, Shane Black as Hawkins, R. G Armstrong as General Phillips and Kevin Peter Hall as The Predator and kicks the living daylights out of this crap 2018 Remake. The action and tension in the original Predator film and the sequel 'Predator 2' is much much more better than the lame action in this awful crap remake. Kevin Peter Hall is absolutely brilliant as The Predator and he was and is the best Predator and you're not gonna beat him. Brian Prince is an absolutely awful Predator, Kevin Peter Hall rules and kicks the living daylights out of the crap actor Brian Prince who plays The Predator in the 2018 remake. Kevin Peter Hall was also awesome in the sequel Predator 2 which also is a much more better film than this stupid, crap 2018 remake. The special effects in Predator were and are much more better than the effects used in this crap remake. This remake doesn't even deserve 5.9/10 it should be 0/10 or 1/10 because it is such an unnecessary, irrelevant 100% completely weak, lame, awful and crap film. There's so much more bad things I can say about this film 1) It's absolute rubbish, 2) It's just atrocious, 3) It's the worst film ever, 4) It's very cheesy, 5) It's lame, the list goes on. If you like sci fi thrillers and you are fan, just don't watch this film because it's absolutely useless and crap."
4.02,25 May 2019,"To have been a part of one of the best sci-fi films ever made . Something any of us fans will never experience. This is the best you can come up with , even with a final 3rd reshoot or thereabouts?? .. I'm going to spend the rest of my life trying to find the words!!! Am I being too emotional envolved over a film ? 😆"
4.02,19 September 2018,Horrible fast paced predictable full of humor disney type movie. Nothing like the original what a waste of my time and money.
4.02,4 October 2021,"In addition to the poor acting, stupid plot, and weird story, this movie doesn't feel like a Predator movie. Rather, it feels like a poorly made sci-if movie and the ""villain"" happens to look like the predator. Also, the whole theme of the movie was the Predator species trying to upgrade themselves with the mentally challenged kid. This just doesn't make sense to me. The only reason I gave it 1/10 stars was the Predator looked cool-ish, but mostly so I could write a review. In conclusion, this movie is a giant ""bruh"" to the franchise and I wouldn't recommend it to Predator fans, or just to someone looking for something to watch."
4.02,6 January 2019,Many funny jokes but an other disrespect to the franchise!!
