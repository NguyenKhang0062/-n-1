5.0,27 September 2024,"As with a lot of shows or movies the ratings are all over the map. My wife and I like to watch a movie or series, usually from one of the streaming services each evening. One of the others reviews asked ""why does this even exist"". Well, it exists for someone who wants to watch something and be reasonably entertained.

We thought it was a decent watch, with good and familiar actors, great scenery, and yes predictable plot, and yes maybe ten minutes too long but we were not disappointed, it served its purpose.

If I could rate it 5.5 I would, which is exactly where its overall rating is right now. So, if your looking for something for your evening watch and dont expect something Oscar worthy this one will work."
7.0,26 September 2024,"Joseph Gordon Levitt and Shailene Woodley both do an excellent job in the lead roles. The script isn't anything groundbreaking, but its still well thought out and will keep you guessing, while also giving us enough background of the two leads to make them relatable.. This is billed as noir, but the only thing Noir about Killer Heat is the narration from Levitt. It was filmed on Location in one of the brightest locals in the world Greece, so if the director wanted to make noir he should have filmed elsewhere. Otherwise, this is a decent enough mystery to entertain and its running time is short enough to not become bored. This wont win any awards, but its enjoyable enough to watch."
7.0,29 September 2024,"After selecting this for movie night, my wife told me the IMDB rating of 5.5, so I read a few reviews before watching. We both decided to give it a try even after reading some of the low-star reviews.

Sure, there's a couple of parts that make you wonder about certain actions, but everything is there for a reason. I found it to be a good story with decent twists. Sometimes you just have to go with the story and not think that you can write better material; the story is the story, and that's that.

The acting was really good, especially Shailene Woodley, who really delivers at the end with a very believable reaction (which I won't spoil).

I'm glad we watched it, and both of us film fans can be very critical (I've also written scripts & directed a few of my own ideas, but I put that aside)."
7.0,29 September 2024,"I give it a 6.8. I don't get why this movie has such a low rating. It's not a groundbreaking plot or one filled with a bunch of twists but it's not crap either. The mystery aspect of the story I doubt you'll be guessing either. (Which I believe is or almost is the most important part of a mystery movie.) It's a detective story through n through. The acting is also pretty solid, no one had a bad performance. I think Shailene Woodley always gives as great performance, which was also true here. Joseph-Gordon Levitt was pretty good. Was t his best work but wasn't bad either. Visually the movie is also pleasing. Some great shots on a beautiful island."
6.0,26 September 2024,"It is the world we live in now, any person can say anything about a movie even if what they say makes no sense. Like here, the first day of release streaming on Prime, one so-called review establishes an account and trashes it and gives it a ""1"" rating. Which is totally absurd and misleading. Makes me wonder the motive.

We are seeing many mediocre to bad ""made for streaming"" movies but this is not one of those. In fact it is a cut above most of them. The actors are good and while there aren't many really novel ideas here it is suspenseful and the last 30 minutes or so reveal a few surprises.

It reminds me of the old 1940s and 1950s detective movies where a Private Investigator is hired to sort out what really happened. Was it really an accident? Or was it murder? Shot in beautiful area of Crete, Greece.

As the movie opens we see a death in the first minute, it is a 30-something man free climbing a cliff in a public assessable area but only by boat. He seems about 2/3 of the way up when he falls, the investigative report estimates he fell about 30 meters, which for us Americans is about 100 feet. The quick investigation rules it an accident but how would they know how high up he was? From the brief glimpse we don't really have much of a clue.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt (early 40s) is a Greek-American private investigator Nick Bali. He is hired by Shailene Woodley (early 30s) as Penelope Vardaki. The dead climber is her brother-in-law, she is married to his identical twin brother, of the wealthy Greek shipping family of the area. She secretly approaches Nick, she hires him to investigate the death because she strongly suspects that it was murder, not an accident, but keep her involvement quiet. We quickly find out there was some tension between the twin brothers.

The movie is made in the style with ongoing narration by Nick, basically telling us what he is thinking and what he suspects. I like both Gordon-Levitt and Woodley and both are excellent in their roles. The cinematography makes good use of the local scenery.

As with most movies nowadays there are few novel ideas, however we watch a movie like this to be entertained and my wife and I found it entertaining. Curiously, we each watched it at different times in different cities. Golf trip..."
5.0,26 September 2024,"While the narration felt a bit unnecessary, Killer heat offers a satisfying viewing experience. The performances were commendable, and the dialogue, though straightforward, served its purpose.

The classic cinematography and well-paced storytelling were refreshing. The movie kept me engaged and entertained throughout.

While there were a few plot inconsistencies that might raise eyebrows, they didn't significantly detract from the overall enjoyment. The music was a good complement to the story, helping to immerse the viewer.

I would suggest toning down the Greek tourism promotion slightly, but overall, killer heat is a worthwhile watch."
7.0,26 September 2024,"A mystery so trite that you see all the (very few) twists from very far and in fact the twist is that there is no surprise at all. Not that it makes any sense by the way when you think about it for one second. This movie is so cliche it borders on parody but it takes itself very seriously.

I guess this was an excuse for all involved to have a vacation in Crete, maybe a tax scheme for the producers also, otherwise no idea why this movie even exists.

It's not even awful. It's ok and if you never saw a whodunit in your life I guess there are worse things to watch but in any other case don't bother."
5.0,26 September 2024,"Watchable and even briefly evocative thriller. Great setting, atmosphere, and more than competent cinematography. Woodley stands out as a femme fatale. Gordon-Levitt makes the most of a generally solid script that has a few missteps. The dialogue, particularly the voice over, drops into heavy-handed pastiche every few minutes and that will probably seem bizarre to anyone too young to have seen Bogart. For all the tried-and-true dedication to the genre, they definitely could have gone for a more cut-throat ending, but they pull the punch at the last minute, which is significantly less satisfying."
7.0,26 September 2024,"It just didn't have any real heart. It was lackluster at every turn occasionally however, some bright spots shown through. A line here a line there.

Beautifully shot in a beautiful location, the cinematography was absolutely great. I just wish they had cut at least 10 minutes out of the film because most Of the character interactions were just fluff, not to mention long periods of nothing happening on screen, for instance, long zooming in shots or too many aerials, looking straight down. It seemed to undermine the setting and atmosphere the creators desired. It was too opposing ideas that couldn't work together.

I will say this, all of the acting was superb, and the choice of actors and characters involved was unique."
5.0,28 September 2024,"Not sure why the low rating: it's a good story, relatable characters, beautiful setting. Some cheesy dialogues make you wonder ""why"", but there is sufficient substance and good acting to put it on high 6 or, if you like the cast, a 7. The main actors can all certainly do better, as they have shown in other movies, but they always keep you hooked and it never gets boring.

As for the story: it's a pretty classic PI, often narrated by a self-reflective Humphrey Bogart voice. The main detective story is interwoven with a flashback story of boiling emotions from the past, which are smartly laced into the multi-layered society of the beautiful Greek island, where the gods make their own rules since centuries."
8.0,26 September 2024,"The son of a wealthy family on Greece's island falls fatally while rock climbing. The death is determined as an accident. But his twin brother's wife believes that he was murdered. So she hires a PI to find the murderer.

One of the drawbacks of Killer Heat is the suspects, ie. Not enough red herring because the list is short. As a commonly noir, ""half-boiled"" detective story, there is the monologue voiceover, half of the time focusing on the PI past, which explains that he is the jealousy type, which helps his line of work -- recognizing the subtle hint that arouses suspicion.

I rarely guess the whodunnit correctly in most movies, though not this one. But probably that's not the point. It's poetic, which brings:

With its unique theme, I believe Killer Heat has potential, but why it misses the target I don't know -- either a little short deficient writing or it's just not working great for screen.

I enjoyed some scenes but was numb with the rest. It is a half-forgettable movie, though I will remember the three actors who have ever been in this one when I see them next in other movies."
7.0,27 September 2024,"A true film noir has its own unique and unmistakable style. At its core, it is more than just a genre- it's an aesthetic built around mood, tone, and an exploration of moral ambiguity. It hinges on morally complex characters, particularly the femme fatale, She's a pivotal figure, luring the detective (or male protagonist) into a web of deception. The detective, in turn, is usually flawed-perhaps weary, disillusioned, or haunted by his past-and finds himself pulled into a situation far more complex than he initially understood.

The plot develops slowly-as a slow burn - emphasizing suspense rather than fast-paced action. It draws the audience deeper into the murky waters of corruption, often leading to endings that are bleak or tinged with moral compromise. No clean victories here -just characters lost in a morally grey world. In essence, a true film noir thrives on fatalism, and the inevitability of betrayal. It's about characters driven by their desires and flaws. Right from the start, I saw this as similar to the movie 'From the start, the movie *Body Heat* felt similar, and as a fan of the genre, I correctly guessed the outcome 50 minutes in. It didn't disappoint."
5.0,29 September 2024,"That sounds actually wrong - especially because I wanted it to be more like meet you ... well no pun intended and as a Greek citizen, I think I am allowed to make a joke about ""my"" country. All that aside though (and nice to see Greek islands being represented in the last couple of years in Hollywood movies), the movie is a decent little thrillers.

I imagine they had more fun doing this, than some will have watching it. But it is supposed to be uncomfortable. And Woodley is as beautiful as ever ... of course you could ask yourself if the twin theme was necessary ... as most will be able to see the twists coming miles away ... just go with the flow and enjoy as much as possible ..."
7.0,27 September 2024,"Ivorian director Philippe Lacôte brings us an adaptation of Jo Nesbø's story and does so in the right way, without any excesses, delivering a film that fulfills its purpose, but that will not set any great records this year.

The film intends to provide us with intrigue and mystery in a correct way and without going overboard, it is simple and easy to follow, and it is entertaining in its final result, in which its director has a lot to do with it, he knows how to place the camera and how to make us part of everything that is happening. The good handling of its director allows us at times to feel like we are watching one of those Hollywood film noir movies from the golden years, but certainly without the glamour or success of those great titles, but the intentions are demonstrated in the identity that its director seeks to convey.

The cast's good work, especially Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Shailene Woodley, who give themselves completely to their characters, which are the ones that are really best constructed within the script, and that is evident in both performances. It's not that they are the best performances of both, but at least they transport us to that detective with complexes and that mysterious woman. The supporting cast also contributes their part without any greatness.

It is an interesting journey that has some well-done moments and others where it loses a bit of strength. Its memorable landscapes of Greece and a photography and soundtrack that enhance Philippe Lacôte's direction allow us to have a correct film that fulfills what it seeks to deliver within the limitations of its script.

A bet for this weekend offered by Prime Video that has that film noir touch, but that doesn't quite reach the pinnacle of a genre that has given us great films. However, it does manage to have moments that will make you spend a pleasant time in front of the television this weekend."
6.0,28 September 2024,"Athens-based American PI Gordon-Levitt, despite some skeletons in his closet, is good at what he does. He commutes to the sunbaked island of Crete that's almost entirely under the influence of the wealthy Vardakis family when he's hired by vampish Woodley--a member of that same family who wants him to anonymously look into the ""accidental death"" of her husband's twin brother, but doing so gets him knee-deep in the tense familial drama. Set up like a hard-boiled crime thriller this offers tidbits of interest and intrigue, plus the scenery is gorgeous, but it's bereft of intensity, fully-realized characters outside of Joseph & Shailene, and has too many moments of implausibility. There are enough story turns to keep a viewer engaged, but De Palma used to do this kind of thing with much more style and verve decades ago. **"
4.0,10 October 2024,"I don't mind a mystery where I predict the end so long as I enjoy the ride getting there. That's the case for this movie.

It's marketed as noir so, like almost all noir, I predicted the end before I even pressed play. That's the problem with the genre. It has such predictable tropes that you hardly need to know anything about it to guess the ending. And this movie really embraced the classic tropes, which is one reason I liked it, and another reason I found it so predictable.

That said, the setting in Greece, the slow and steady pacing, the enigmatic characters... they made this an enjoyable film to watch. The acting was decent and so was the writing. These days, with the constant churn of streaming content where quantity matters over quality, that means something."
7.0,30 September 2024,
1.0,27 September 2024,"A sunshine noir released that falls below expectations. It is letdown by leaning too heavily on the tropes of the washed-out detective story, the devious femme fatale and the crazy twins. The black detective and its dog was a colourful and probably unnecessary supporting act. The voiceover narration was a bit preemptive and grating. The needless recourse to Greek mythology was clever by half, given that the locale is a Greek Island did not warrant the needless tapping. Being lodged with monks is very weird, too. But for some reason, I kept watching until the end, both the false and apparent resolutions of the mystery. It could have been better, but it is good enough to keep one watching."
6.0,27 September 2024,
3.0,26 September 2024,"Predictable from start to finish. Typically Hollywood murder mystery there is nothing special about it and don't even get me started on the unfinished plots throughout the entire movie. Not a single character has any depth nor are you drawn to them or hope they have a happy ending at the end of the movie. The only actor in the movie I was wooed by was the golden retriever and we have no idea what happened to him. Every scene felt really odd and unnecessary and that the plot was compromised for the sake of getting good cinematography and making the most of the rented out super-yacht.

It's a shame because it really is a star studded cast. What a pity to waste such talent actors on this dumpster fire of a movie. Completely and utterly forgettable. Don't waste your time."
9.0,6 October 2024,"As a Greek American, I take offense with the reviews who claim this was a promo for a Greek vacation. Show me where films set in New York, Spain, or Cancun are accused of being desirable just because they are chosen as a movie venue. Rediculous. Greece has been in countless films since the beginning of cinema.

This film does have spectacular views of the island, the ocean, and the world of luxury.

JGL is a good actor who never really found his niche in the film industry after he became an adult, although he's been in some noteworthy films. Yet here, his co-stars are noticeably less seasoned which lends an almost amateur feel to the finished product. Richard Madden is nice eye candy and has been in some decent series. Shailene Woodley has been in several things that the reviewers seem to recall but I only saw her in Adrift where she was not that memorable. But in fact that's the only problem with Killer Heat - none of the actors really stand out although certain things do stand out about them, such as a British accent on twins who were raised on a Greek island who have a British mother with an American accent. But that's nitpicking.

The storyline is, however, intriguing and the plot moves at a comfortable pace. Although it isn't really very novel, it might keep you guessing.

The voiceover by Nick is reminisce of Dragnet's Joe Friday. There a definite noir feeling in the characters and plot.

The monastery was an interesting but sorely under utilized character.

I wouldn't recommend it, per se, but I didn't hate it."
7.0,27 September 2024,"I gave it a go as I like these actors, liked the setting and liked the concept of a neo-noir.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt has been in a neo-nour before, his breakout film ""Brick"" which whilst not perfect is several cuts above this. It's worth a watch if you've not seen it.

Gordon-Levitt's voiceover lends itself to a personality we just don't see on screen, it's a real mismatch, the person we see on screen doesn't seem half as edgy, in fact Gordon-Levitt never gets out of first gear here in terms of showing any range.

Another odd observation was he barely changes his clothes for most of the film even though it seems to be set over quite a few days.

The ""twist"" towards the end was literally my first throwaway thought the moment I realised the film was about twins.

We keep getting flashbacks to Gordon-Levitt's old life and family, only problem is his character isn't likeable enough for us to care and I'm not sure that it adds anything.

There's a lot of talking, really dull conversations that throw names all over the place where quite honestly my mind started wandering.

The only positive is I found some of the scenery and cinematograohy pleasant.

One to avoid."
4.0,28 September 2024,"Another excellent performance by Joseph Gordon-Levitt with his character narrating for maximum coolness, and what's not to like about Shailene Woodley. Stupendous cinematography, a taut premise enhanced by solid supporting actors and a crisp screenplay with well placed flashbacks makes it all quite engaging and gives this effort top shelf entertainment value. The lack of credulity is abated by the backstory of Levitt's dogged private investigator, the monozygotic twins and other distractions. Involving envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries and the like, it somehow builds up to a numbed down all's well that end's well conclusion. Don't miss this one."
6.0,4 October 2024,"A pleasant enough watch, albeit very predictable and forgettable. Reasonably good pacing and acting, with good supporting actors, especially Richard Madden. Why did they choose such an awful name for the movie though?

7.0,2 October 2024,"There was something about this movie that kept me watching, and this is why I'm giving it a 6. At least it was entertaining.

BUT this movie was a little silly. You would think the first thing on the list would be to prove that it was in fact a murder. If you can't prove that, then it doesn't matter if 10 ppl have a motive to mur der you, because it can't be proved that it actually happened. The ""murder site"" was never even looked at. It's hard to push that small detail aside as you're watching, because WHAT IS HE ACTUALLY INVESTIGATING?

That being said, it was still entertaining, despite the big flaw and predictable ending."
1.0,3 October 2024,"In contemporary noir-lite murder mystery ""Killer Heat"" hard-drinkin' private-dick Joseph Gordon-Levitt (likeable if not technically great) escapes his own New York demons (involving wife Abby Lee) by taking a case in Crete for Shailene Woodley, wife of shipping empire heir Richard Madden (son of Clare Holman) whose identical twin's just died in a suspicious free-climbing fall that the po-po (led by Babou Ceesay) have declared an accident... but was it?! Co-writers Matt Charman & Roberto Bentivegna add enough depth to their twists to make it ultimately satisfying, as director Philippe Lacôte brings it all safely home. It's a solid albeit unexceptional, genre entry."
6.0,30 September 2024,"An embarrassment for all involved, especially JGL (although he does get to show off a decent Greek accent). The equivalent of a telenovela, and a poor one at that.

Laugh out loud dialogue that seems like it was dreamt up by a high schooler.

Incredibly bad acting, writing and an overall haze of indifference consume the entire production.

Hard pass that will have you wishing you picked something else to half watch as you scroll through your phone.

There is only so much Richard Madden's abs can do to try and save this mess - and they do try mightily. Save yourself the misery and just look them up online."

The muscles on that man's body should be illegal I damn near fell into a coma just from looking at that man.

Yes. Mine did. They ruptured and exploded and just by the sight of that man's muscles. And do not get me started on how he was all possessive and shadow daddy like. Holy mother of all things UNHOLY I need that man to play a shadow daddy from one of my books BADLY. Anyways, Richard if you're reading this I'm sorry. Maybe I'm not. Actually I'm not.

6.0,9 October 2024,"""Killer Heat"" is a gripping crime mystery that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Directed by Philippe Lacôte, the film stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Shailene Woodley, and Richard Madden, who deliver stellar performances. Set on a picturesque yet isolated Greek island, the story revolves around twin brothers entangled in a perilous love triangle. The plot thickens with the arrival of ""The Jealousy Man,"" a detective with a dark past. The film's strength lies in its atmospheric tension and character depth, though some may find the pacing uneven. Overall, it's a compelling watch for mystery enthusiasts."
5.0,28 September 2024,"Good actors with no interest in their own movie. A predictable movie can be fun even if you know the outcome 10 minutes after it starts. This is not one of those movies. And I love PI noir movies. Watch Brick instead. It is tremendously superior.

The writing is poor and the characters have no character. There is no one to be vested in. It can play on noir tropes, but it has to grab you.

I am sure the source material is much better and gives some background to these cardboard characters.

The scenery is terrific and everyone looks well rested but no one makes an impression. The viewer is waiting for a payoff and it just doesn't come."
6.0,2 October 2024,"""Killer Heat"" is an okay movie. The main and supporting characters deliver solid performances, and the story unfolds through Nick's monologue. The cinematography and outdoor shots are impressive and cinematic, while the styling and wardrobe are well done. However, the pacing is a bit slow. It's best suited for streaming rather than the big screen. Overall, it's a decent film that deserves a 6/10 rating, especially given the many worse movies released in 2024. While the story is good, it doesn't feel particularly unique.

And Black cop in Greece small island is unusual, though he is from Gambia but without african ascent,

For Amazon streaming it's a good choice or I can say one of the best TV movies."
2.0,1 October 2024,"Killer Heat is a film noir, although here in sunshine Greece it feels different. Let me start by saying I'm not a big fan of film noir, I can't remember one movie in this genre that wowed me, but since it was my wife's turn for picking a movie I tagged along. The mystery vibe was already lost for me after twenty minutes as I figured the whole thing out which was not beneficiary to keep me on edge. Joseph-Gordon Levitt should stick to comedies, there where it all started for him, with the brilliant show Third Rock From The Sun. He's not a bad actor but this genre is just not for him in my opinion. All in all it's a watchable movie, that feels like a tv-movie."

5.0,30 September 2024,"Killer Heat, starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Shailene Woodley, and Richard Madden, released on Prime video this past Thursday. Directed by Philippe Lacote and based on Jo Nesbo's short story ""The Jealousy Man,"" this mystery crime drama takes place in a remote island in Greece and centers around private investigator Nick (Gordon-Levitt) who is hired to investigate the death of a member of a wealthy shipping company family.

Despite some really negative reviews, I felt like this movie was pretty good. It is a cautionary tale about jealousy and how dangerous it is. The story is told with a film-noir vibe, and I felt it helped make the story more captivating. Additionally, I really enjoyed Gordan-Levitt's performance, as well as Woodley's as the sister-in-law responsible for hiring Nick.

This movie will not go down in history as ""one of the greats,"" and it will not be celebrated during award season. In fact, I will probably forget about this movie by next week. That being said, I enjoyed watching it and recommend checking it out."

7.0,30 September 2024,"Who wrote this?

It plays into every trope of the Noir movie but in such a hamfisted way, it's like it was written by AI.

Everything is so obvious, it might as well be written in neon light all over the screen from the start, which I guess it kinda is.

To make matters worse, we get scene after scene of exposure and explanation as if the plot was so sophisticated, simple minded folks like us couldn't understand it. Seriously?

Finally as a monozygotic twin, I had to laugh out loud at the ridiculous premise and big (first) ""twist"" of the movie. Twins are not perfect adult replicas of their siblings."
1.0,20 October 2024,"""Killer Heat"" boasts a talented cast and a beautiful Greek island setting, but its predictable plot and slow pacing prevent it from reaching its full potential. Joseph Gordon-Levitt delivers a solid performance as the troubled detective Nick Bali, and Shailene Woodley shines as the enigmatic Penelope Vardakis.

While the film effectively captures the sultry atmosphere of a sun-drenched Mediterranean paradise, the story itself fails to ignite much excitement. The twists and turns feel telegraphed, and the screenplay doesn't fully capitalize on the intriguing premise.

Overall, ""Killer Heat"" is a competent, if unremarkable, entry in the crime thriller genre. Fans of the cast or the film's stunning location may find it to be an interesting watch, but others might be better off seeking their thrills elsewhere."

5.0,13 October 2024,"In a world where convoluted plots and sensory overload rule the day, Killer Heat is a breath of sweaty air - a solid thriller that dares to keep things (relatively) simple, with the added bonus of that old-school voice-over we either love or roll our eyes at. Call me old-fashioned, but I'm a sucker for a good noir voice-over, especially when delivered by a PI who's seen better days - and worse nights - preferably with a bottle of whiskey in hand. Lucky for me, Joseph Gordon-Levitt steps into those well-worn shoes and makes them look pretty darn comfortable.

But don't be fooled by the noir vibes. Forget rain-soaked alleys and shadowy corners; this plot bakes in the relentless sun of Crete. Yes, you heard that right - Greek summer noir, because nothing says ""gritty mystery"" like sweat-drenched linen and Mediterranean views. Enter Nick Bali, a Greek-American PI whose name sounds like an exotic cocktail but whose personal life is a train wreck. He's hired by Penelope Vardakis to sniff out something suspicious in the accidental death of her brother-in-law, Leo. Why? Because he was estranged from his family that ""owns"" the island?

Penny's motivations are as clear as mud from the start. Her husband, Elias, is Leo's identical twin, but personality-wise, they couldn't be more different - classic plot device, but who's counting? Naturally, Nick teams up with the local police, and in walks Georges Mensah, a policeman whose Greek ancestry is... let's say ""open to interpretation."" Sure, casting a black actor in this role is a bold choice, but in a sun-drenched film, who has time for authenticity?

As Nick slogs through the mystery, it's clear Penny has more up her designer sleeve than a simple case of ""concerned sister-in-law."" After all, who gets this involved with their dead husband's brother unless there's more going on than just funeral arrangements? And yes, the twist - because there's always a twist - won't blindside anyone who's ever seen a noir before, but it wraps things up in a way that's just satisfying enough not to leave you annoyed.

In the end, Killer Heat may not break new ground, but at least it steers clear of most modern-day political correctness pitfalls - except for the casting mentioned above. In this case, the biggest mystery might just be how they managed to make Crete look like the least relaxing place on Earth."

4.0,11 October 2024,"Killer Heat is a noir that burns so slowly it becomes numbing. Everything revolves around a mystery that just isn't very engaging and hindered further by how obvious it is. A gorgeous cast in nice looking locations isn't enough to sustain it, even for a run time that's pretty much ideal. Still, it's the kind of serviceable content that feels like an unfortunately perfect fit for a streamer, where it can be viewed and quickly forgotten about.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt has been back for a while now but it's still really nice to see him appearing consistently. He's low energy by design so his performance feels flat even if he's just matching the extremely slow burning nature of the film. Shailene Woodley gets the best role with the most satisfying conclusion and despite having 2 different characters to play, Richard Madden remains thoroughly one note.

Philip Lacôte's direction goes through all the usual motions of a noir, all the way down to an overused voice over, with no showmanship. There's a handful of nice looking shots interspersed throughout and that's pretty much it. The locations are an easy win as they're suitably extravagant and luscious, confirming that everyone involved would've got a very sunny holiday out of this if nothing else."
4.0,26 September 2024,"It almost instantly made me sleepy. This neo noir wanna be with tired actors, that only wanted to be in Greece, cypress or whatever the hell this movie was shot at. I totally followed the names and not the grades, but it was maybe better to receive the tip of those that have seen this unnecessary movie.

If it wouldn't made me so tired, I would have probably fully guessed each and every twist that this movie had to offer. All of the twists came from miles away and though it wasn't so hard to predict, it wasn't so interesting to flow with it and try to guess.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt is not connecting himself to large productions lately and doesn't seem to want to perform in this one, except the money payment in the end of the process. Shailene Woodley also not seem to care about her part on this production and Richard Madden is grateful that he gets the chance to cause some of the viewers to scratch their heads and try to remember where do they remember him from.

It is based on a mystery novel, that most of the viewers probably don't know or don't care to know about and it is speaking about one of two twin brothers that falls into his death, while the other brother's wife wants to investigate the possible murder option, because they are both are parts of a crime family in the island.

That leads into a movie that seems like was produced several decades before and acts even less than one like this. The base for better performance was there, but the script is written poorly and the cast is acting pretty miserably. No one seems to care for the basic performance of this movie and this creates the final result of it."

I would watch this every five years or so, which means it automatically gets placed in the 7.5-7.9 column. What's not to like about this film? People go into a film like this with unattainable expectations. Sure, the actors are super popular, top of the a list column, so there must be some accountability, but trust me, your children will someday stumble on this film in be entranced. No, it's not spectacular, but it has a 100% Columbo. I was thinking, oh this is Columbo, but he drinks more and he isn't quite as unkempt. But hear me now, this is Columbo-esque. And the noir is present and accounted for all the way. The first person narrative was on point. I think there were just the perfect amount of words, not too many, certainly not too few. They did good with this film. Sure, there are some slow parts, in fact, lots of slow parts. People are too much into high octane these days, because if you compare the action and pace of this film with any from the the 1940's through the 1960's, you'll see they are similar. Now to put it into perspective, what about shows like 'House of the Dragon', or the Rings of Power, those are really slow. And yet, people keep on a-coming back..."
8.0,28 September 2024,"Bad movie. I am a busy man and don't want to waste my time with what this movie is. (boring) Rather, let's talk about how it could have been better. First what we don't change. The setting! OMG it is beautiful in Greece. (tell me it was filmed in Toronto and my head will explode). The music was fine. The cars were nice.

What we DO change: we dump Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Shailene Woodley and recast Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith (in their prime) to add some steam, some lust. (In its present form the hottest relationship is between the local cop and his dog). Then we cut the final 25 minutes from the film because even with Don and Melanie people don't really care who did it they just want to get out of their seats.

On to the only big mystery: You watch closely (if you have time to waste) and make note of how many suits and sport coat changes Mr. Levitt pulls out of that little overnight bag. How is that possible?

The movie desperately needs nudity and at least one car chase through the narrow twisting village streets.

Your time would be better spent getting grandpa's VCR player out and watch Gilligan Island episodes backwards."
4.0,2 October 2024,"I struggle to identify if this is a made for tv movie that was filmed in four days or if it is a big screen flick that was sliced down because it has so much filler that is irrelevant to the plot. It is an extremely slow pace with very little character energy. The story itself is intriguing and the actors gave it a pretty good go, scenery is lovely, but personally it's probably one of the most boring movies I've watched all year. The quality is mediocre at best and I'm sorry to even type that. Direct to streaming these days seems to be getting worse. Again, to be fair, the core mystery is okay, and familiar actors give it a leg up; however, if you're looking for a flick with twists or nail biting moments, find something else."
5.0,8 October 2024,"I wanted to like it. Scenery is obviously great and I really enjoy some of the actors involved, but it is very simplistic and feels like you're being hand-fed everything. The main character is a pitiful PI. Joseph Gordon-Levitt doesn't shine, but then again he's not given much to work with, or maybe it's too much as all of his character's background is again hand-fed to you. There's no subtlety. Yes we get it. He has a drinking problem. Guess that's why it takes the whole movie for him to figure out what I think is apparent from the get go.

Truly the whole thing seems pretty cut & dry from beginning imo & I'm not one who always figures out the whodunnits."
5.0,29 September 2024,"Well I just finished watching Killer Heat (2024) and it is basically everything that I've seen done before only a little bit better than this movie.

Positives for Killer Heat (2024): The performances from Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Shailene Woodley and Richard Madden are all pretty good in this movie. The mystery aspect of this movie is interesting enough for the most part. The final reveal of the mystery is pretty good.

Negatives for Killer Heat (2024): This movie is literally every other murder mystery movie I've seen or heard before this one. The movie's plot is very predictable and I was able to guess the answer of this mystery halfway through the runtime. And finally, the movie doesn't do anything to help itself stand out from the other murder mystery movies and it just feels a little generic.

Overall, Killer Heat (2024) is a passable enough murder mystery that you could throw on in the background and you wouldn't miss anything from it."
3.0,6 October 2024,"I thoroughly enjoyed it actually. The movie was by no means amazing or groundbreaking, but it played its part well. Most movies are regurgitated timeless tropes; it's just a matter of was it done well, and to me it was done well.

Nick (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a PI from Brooklyn hired by Penelope (Shailene Woodley) to look into her husband's death. Once in Greece, Nick starts digging into the family dynamic unearthing treachery, betrayal, control, and jealously.

Nick, Penelope, and the twins all have past hurts and trauma to work through. In one or another, each of their past mistakes or trauma is directly linked to the story. However, the focus is Nick.

Nick knows what it is to be a jealous husband who loses his wife and child due to his own chaotic behavior and mistakes. Throughout the film, Nick works through his pain until he find redemption.

If one takes it for what it is, the film is enjoyable. And if one wants to, the film can be charged with certain problematic themes, but then I think the viewer would be missing the point."
8.0,29 September 2024,"The film feels like a high school project, where students wrote the script, and one of them landed the lead role. It's his first acting experience, so he's trying excessively hard to play the part of a seasoned detective. To look the part, he rents a costume from a shop, but the result is a grotesque mismatch.

JGL is a good actor, but I think he's better in something more dramatic.

The story itself is not original and lacks engagement, and despite the actor's clear effort, his performance comes across as forced and unnatural. The movie's two main flaws are obvious: a poorly written script and an unconvincing lead actor, which together make the film hard to watch and very boring."
3.0,7 October 2024,"A film about a Private Investigator (PI) being hired to investigate a death in a rich family which ok the surface has been ruled an accident but was it? What should be a really interesting film turns out rather forgettable and a bit meh. Some of the best films Chinatown, The Maltese Falcon etc centre around a PI but this lacks something. Shot in lovely locations the story and acting doesn't grip you. In fact if you want to see a better film with Joseph Gordon-Levitt in a similar role go and watch Brick which is fantastic. Did watch the whole film but was more out of this must get better rather than the film itself being brilliant."
5.0,2 October 2024,
5.0,8 October 2024,"Nice scenery, yes.

And that's about all there is.

If you're looking for mystery, there is none. If you're looking for emotion, there is definetely nothing. Not even one of the characters is believable or has any sort of depth to it. The parallels are too literal, the voice over seems like a parody. This is less than a nice try. Performances are not believable, flashbacks are not timely, rhythm is not there, too slow and too shallow. And also, what happens to the dog?

Disappointing is an understatement. And the tittle in spanish gives away too much of the plot.

Don't waste your time. Not even the scenery is worth it."
5.0,8 October 2024,
10.0,3 October 2024,"The Killer Heat attempts to craft a suspenseful thriller but falls flat despite a talented cast. With actors like Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Shailene Woodley in leading roles, you'd expect a film with gripping tension and powerful performances. Unfortunately, even their efforts can't save this predictable, uninspired plot.

Within the first 15 minutes, it's glaringly obvious who the killer is-making the rest of the film a sluggish waiting game for the final, inevitable reveal. For any seasoned thriller fan, the lack of mystery and suspense is disappointing. The script does no favors for its cast, offering shallow dialogue and weak character motivations that leave little room for them to shine. Even the action sequences, which could have provided some much-needed excitement, feel clunky and poorly executed.

Overall, The Killer Heat feels like an amateur attempt at a thriller, and with so many better options out there, it's one best skipped. Save your time for something more engaging and memorable."
1.0,15 October 2024,"A dull, boring movie, without emotion, without action, without purpose. One of the most mediocre 2024 films I've ever seen and definitely one of the worst performances I've seen from Joseph Gordon-Levitt.

Instead of a movie, this looks like a soap opera full of gossip, rumors, lies and superficial things that no one cares about. Even the directing work is very reminiscent of the style of melodramatic soap operas. I am clearly not the target audience for this type of product.

The soundtrack is repetitive to the point of boredom. The edition has visible errors. The only thing notable are the locations and production design, which was horribly misused by the feature film's photography.

In short, a totally skippable film."
4.0,14 October 2024,
5.0,16 October 2024,"Killer Heat, a movie adaptation of Jo Nesbø's short story, is a dull and predictable sunshine noir that wastes the time of those involved and ours. Originally known as The Jealousy Man in print, the mystery plays less like a real movie and more like a case-of-the-week episode of an ITV crime drama. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, reprising his role in Rian Johnson's 2005 thriller Brick, plays a run-of-the-mill private detective named Nick who investigates a seemingly cut-and-dried death on a Greek island. Nick's by-the-numbers investigation begins with flashbacks to his past as a jealous husband and Abbey Lee, hinting at something deeper at play. However, depth is not one of Killer Heat's strong points, with the mystery unraveling with such a formulaic lack of surprise that we are convinced something twistier and more unusual is being kept for the finale. The trudge to get there is without reward, as if we are being punished for being dumb enough for sticking with it. The final reveals are pretty much exactly what one would expect from the synopsis, almost comically so. Killer Heat is a head-scratching follow-up for director Philippe Lacôte, whose imaginative and unconventional prison thriller Night of the Kings was a critical hit after a Venice premiere back in 2020. Aside from brief glimpses of beautiful scenery, this is as drably made, horribly lit, and creatively uninspired as streaming films come, made more distracting by characters insisting on a luxury we never get to see. Thanks to the refundable shoddiness of 2017's The Snowman, Killer Heat will not go down as the worst Nesbø adaptation out there but will definitely be the most forgettable."
5.41,14 October 2024,"Pretty standard murder mystery but I really liked this. 90s style intrigue without gratuitous violence. Has a death-in-paradise 'who done it' theme plus who doesn't love dirty laundry in a stinking rich family.

The plot is pretty straight forward, not complex. Good cast and not so many characters that it becomes confusing. I enjoyed it, though it isn't blockbuster wow and won't impress serious movie critics but still does the job i.e something fun to watch with an old person who enjoys unthreatening detective mysteries.

The movie maintains its steady pace from beginning to end, so just do the '10 minute rule' if you're not sure if it's worth your time."

5.41,21 October 2024,"The attractive feature is the picturesque location as it is shot at the island of Crete. The scenes of life on the island are well presented. Plenty of nice scenery.

The plot in brief. A rock climber has fallen to his death and a detective (Joseph Gordon - Levitt) has been called to investigate. Shailene Woodley is the sister in law of the deceased who suspects that it is not an accident but a murder.

The plot twists are interesting enough though not exactly edge of the seat type. There are a few minor flaws too.

Nothing outstanding about the movie and it could be categorized as Average plus entertainer."
