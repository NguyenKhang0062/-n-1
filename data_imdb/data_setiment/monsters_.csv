0,0,8.0,21 September 2022,"I had high expectations of this. After seeing Evan Peters in AHS, I just knew he would be great in this role. He did not disappoint.

I haven't seen many docos on Dahmer so don't really know that much about his personality or demeanor, but the character that Peters portrays is complex, creepy, and just plain twisted and evil.

One of the most disturbing details of Dahmer's crimes that this series highlights is how the police ignored and dismissed witness reports, and their lack of action allowed Dahmer to stay free and kill more men.

This series is excellent. I suggest you start watching it early in the afternoon as you will want to binge watch the whole series.","September 21, 2022 (United States)",i had high expectations of this after seeing evan peters in ahs i just knew he would be great in this role he did not disappoint i havent seen many docos on dahmer so dont really know that much about his personality or demeanor but the character that peters portrays is complex creepy and just plain twisted and evil one of the most disturbing details of dahmers crimes that this series highlights is how the police ignored and dismissed witness reports and their lack of action allowed dahmer to stay free and kill more men this series is excellent i suggest you start watching it early in the afternoon as you will want to binge watch the whole series,POSITIVE
1,1,9.0,21 September 2022,"This was a hard watch....for many reasons. Having been a young adult when all this happened, it....what do the kids say?...it hits different.

Well, it's the Dahmer story. So by default, it's hard and gross and scary.

The acting is top notch. Every performance...it's like you're right there in the room watching this God awful series of events unfold in real time. How the actors got through this is beyond me.

The timeline shifts can be a bit hard to follow. It's not the kind of thing you can just pause and come back to. You have to rewind or start the episode over.

Overall, arguably...this is the best Dahmer depiction. I would recommend watching ""My Best Friend Dahmer"" prior to watching this, as it accidentally and appropriately serves as a prequel.

Recommend for cast iron stomachs. Don't watch this if you're prone to puking.","September 21, 2022 (United States)",this was a hard watchfor many reasons having been a young adult when all this happened itwhat do the kids sayit hits different well its the dahmer story so by default its hard and gross and scary the acting is top notch every performanceits like youre right there in the room watching this god awful series of events unfold in real time how the actors got through this is beyond me the timeline shifts can be a bit hard to follow its not the kind of thing you can just pause and come back to you have to rewind or start the episode over overall arguablythis is the best dahmer depiction i would recommend watching my best friend dahmer prior to watching this as it accidentally and appropriately serves as a prequel recommend for cast iron stomachs dont watch this if youre prone to puking,POSITIVE
2,2,9.0,21 September 2022,"When I clicked to watch the ""Dahmer""-release on Netflix, I thought it would be the so-many'th documentary on him. But what a surprise it was to see that it is actually a mini-series of the crimes that Dahmer committed. And what a mini-series it is!

The acting is superb. The script is top-notch! The cinematography one of the best that I have seen in a true crime series of a serial killer!

I am a big fan of Mindhunter, the show about the origins of the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit. And I must admit that Dahmer fits right into this type of shows! The show captured me from the first episode and it was a single binge from then on.

I know that there are many other movies from for instance ""People's Magazine"" that portray the crimes commited by notorious killers. But what Netflix has shown with Dahmer, is a complete new level of enactment! The movies from People's Magazine are just amateur hour compared to the Dahmer-series.

Netflix really surprised me big time with this great show! It deserves a solid 9 stars!

3,3,10.0,22 September 2022,"There are no doubts that Evan Peters has killed this role by delivering one of the most engrossing performances of his career, and that's saying something considering the aptitude of his many esteemed performances to date.

The fault of a system that didn't care about helping those who showed signs of psychosis and allowed a young man to fall through the cracks along with a corrupt and negligent police department that chose to turn blind eyes and deaf ears due to the nature of homosexuality and people of color being Dahmer's main victims because of obvious systemic racism...all of it set to Evan's performance was outstanding.

4,4,9.0,22 September 2022,"For those interested in the psychology of a serial killer, there is no more fascinating character study than Jeffrey Dahmer. He was a psychiatric enigma and a profoundly sick individual. A chronic alcoholic from a very young age. A sexual deviant with all manner of unusual fetishes. A necrophiliac. A cannibal.

A pure psychopath and the product of a perfect storm of schizotypal/borderline personality disorder, developmental toxicity (exposure to psychoactive drugs in utero), negative parental influence, neglect and childhood trauma, a morbid curiosity with the macabre, social exclusion at school and deep feelings of loneliness, sexual confusion and insecurity.

He longed to be cared about and loved by his family. He longed to be accepted by his peers. But, at the same time, knew deep down that he would inevitably disappoint his parents because of his inability to live a normal life and that he wouldn't be accepted by friends due to his odd personality.

We all tend to seek out like-minded people and make connections with those we have something in common with. The problem was that Jeffrey knew there wasn't anybody out there with the same interests or outlook as him. Left to his own devices by absent parents and socially isolated, he became increasingly withdrawn and followed a path of introversion and solitude.

He must have felt like he didn't belong in this world, and that there wasn't a place for him within society, so he abandoned all attempts to participate and pursued a voyeuristic way of life. He lacked a clear or positive self-image, meaning his perspective of other people was skewed, which resulted in him fully embracing his warped perception of pleasure and satisfaction. The men he felt attracted to were purely sex objects to him; walking, talking sex dolls. His interest was solely in their aesthetic, or physical appearance.

He appeared to have been a deeply troubled soul from the outset and his behaviours were predominantly a consequence of his genetic constitution, exacerbated by negative life experiences. If his childhood had been a more positive one then he may have been able to adapt better to his personal limitations and dysfunctions, but there is no way of knowing the extent of the damage his upbringing had on him.

It was evident from his own admissions that he felt predestined to live a peculiar and unorthodox lifestyle due to his innately bizarre persona. The conventional joys of life simply didn't float Jeffrey's boat.

I rarely, if ever, feel sorry for multiple murderers, especially ones who commit such heinous and sickening crimes as Dahmer. But I have to admit that I found his story to be tragically sad.

My usual take away from accounts of serial killers is wondering how and why someone could do that to another human being over and over again!? In Dahmer's case, I am left feeling conflicted with a strange understanding of, and empathy for, his actions. Of course I'm not condoning what he did, but I can appreciate how and why the sequence of events transpired.

In his televised interviews he was so open, frank and forthcoming which is exceptionally rare for someone in his situation. He came across as a gentle, thoughtful and articulate person who was genuinely tormented by his inner demons throughout his life. He freely admitted to his crimes in detail, demonstrated that he knew what he had done was evil and offered honest explanations for his actions. He wanted to pay the ultimate price for his sins, resisting advice to make a plea of insanity, and took personal responsibility for the choices he made.

The good part of him wanted to change and stop what the bad part had started, but he required external intervention to do so. The urges and compulsions that controlled him became an obsession and his psychosis led him down a progressively irreversible path that was impossible to resist. The dark side had an unrelenting grip on him.

My personal opinion is that he was clinically insane, due to a combination of psychiatric disorders, but at the same time I feel a legal judgement of insanity would have been an insult to the families of Dahmer's victims and an inadequate penalty for such a fiendish series of killings.

If you listen to him describe how he felt during his childhood and adolescence, it's clear that he should have been under the watchful eye of mental health professionals from an early age. His mother was so wrapped up in her own mental illness and his father preoccupied by work that he didn't receive the emotional support, medication and therapy he desperately needed. This was inexcusable given that both parents were acutely aware of their own emotional problems and the likelihood that these had been passed onto their son.

I can't help but feel pity for Dahmer, and also that the casualties of his maniacal way of life were preventable.

Between his mid-teens and early twenties he was basically a ""walking cry for help"" but nobody seemed to pay attention, try to understand him or find out what was wrong. In any case, because of the appalling and unspeakable nature of Dahmer's fantasies, it's unlikely that he would have felt able to share them with anyone, even those in a medical capacity. This would've made him feel trapped and that he might as well turn his fantasies into a reality because there was nobody to confide in and no way out of his spiralling mental condition. Like a lost cause.

I mean here was a guy who felt completely alone in the world. A total and utter misfit. So reckless and uncaring about what other people thought of him, making absolutely no attempts whatsoever to conform to social norms. A loner without even a rudimentary inclination or understanding of how to make friends, relate to others or find a romantic partner. He didn't seem to know what to look for or what he wanted in a partner. His perverted version of attachment and sexual arousal didn't allow him to.

I suppose all he had experienced was watching his parents at constant loggerheads and in a loveless marriage. This would have left him detached, emotionally stunted and unaware of how to express love and affection. I suspect realising that you're homosexual is a troubling and confusing time for anyone. But for someone like Dahmer, who was mentally unhinged and devoid of emotional support, it was a major dilemma and yet another psychological obstacle to contend with.

He was given such an unstable start to life by bickering, neglectful parents who appeared to be unwilling to put their children's welfare first. This obviously had a massively detrimental impact on his self-esteem and sense of security, leading to an intense fear of abandonment. Hence his preference for duping his victims into spending time with him and then incapacitating them so he could enjoy their company without that fear of rejection. That way he could exercise total control over their lifeless bodies and indulge in his fetishes to his heart's content without contest.

I expect he sank to unimaginable depths of depravity during those private moments, searching for the unachievable, ever-fleeting sense of fulfilment and satisfaction that he desperately wished to hold on to and savour.

I've read quite a lot about Dahmer online, watched a number of interviews and the brilliant film 'My Friend Dahmer'. Evan Peters portrays him with a seemingly effortless and convincing performance that is heavily nuanced and intensely creepy. He absolutely nails the flat affect, monotone voice and distinct lack of emotional expression typical of most psychopaths.

He really conveys the emptiness Dahmer had in his soul; the numbness, subdued anger and sexual frustration which engulfed him. He truly embodies Dahmer and was perfectly cast in this role.

Technically speaking this series is very well researched, skilfully put together and held my undivided attention throughout. The acting by the whole cast, especially Richard Jenkins as Lionel, is first class. The tone is pitched perfectly for such a grim and sordid story. The directors create numerous moments of highly suspenseful and tense drama including some horrifying, darkly-intimate and cringe-inducing scenes, but these are needed to tell the story of Dahmer's debauchery in full.

Episode 6 ""Silenced"" in particular is an exceptional and highly original piece of screenwriting with some of the most absorbing television I've seen for a long time. It was like a mini-masterpiece of melodrama.

I really feel the writers got inside the mind of Dahmer, not only giving us the facts of what happened but allowing us to feel what it was like to see things the way he did. There are a number of minor adjustments or expansions to the narrative, but equally some omissions in order to make the content more palatable for the viewer. None of this affects the credibility of the series in my opinion as we are given ample opportunity to form a mental image of what happened from the point of view of all parties concerned.

Despite having read up on the subject matter beforehand, and knowing how the events of his life unfolded, this excellent series has a real edginess and provides a fresh, unflinching and comprehensive account of the disturbing life of Jeffrey Dahmer.

9,9,6.0,26 September 2022,"While Evan Peters certainly deserves accolades for his particularly engrossing and gripping personification of the monster that was Dahmer, the series - the first half of which was excellent - leaves much to be desired.

Note: A special mention should also be made of actor Shaun Brown who delivered a stellar performance in his portrayal of Tracy Edwards, Dahmer's last would-be victim.

Like a good book that you just do not want to put down and which leaves you wanting to know what the next page will bring, the first episode of ""Dahmer, Monster"" is compelling enough that if you have the time, you will not even think about turning off episode two.

The issues, for me, began around episode 5. This is when the story began to move away from Dahmer and his actions somewhat, and began to concentrate on other aspects of the case and the people who surrounded him. This disconnect just grew and grew into the ensuing episodes, with Dahmer being present, less and less. While some viewers may not have minded this, and perhaps viewed it as being 'thorough', to me, it was fluff and fill. There's is no convincing me that this series would not have benefitted from being two episodes shorter.

10,10,10.0,22 September 2022,"Starting in July 25, 1991, notorious serial murderer Jeffrey Dahmer (Evan Peters) is arrested when Dahmer's potential victim Tracy Edwards (Shaun J. Brown) miraculously escapes and brings the police back to his apartment. Dahmer is arrested after uncovering the various horrors and mementos from Dahmer's murders, we soon go back through Dahmer's past to see what lead him to this point before eventually shifting focus to the stories of the victims, the fallout felt by the community and victims' families, as well as the bureaucratic and law enforcement failures that allowed Dahmer to continue indulging his twisted appetites.

Dahmer-Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story is the latest project from noted producer Ryan Murphy whose prolific work on the likes of American Horror and Crime Story lead to him getting an overall deal with streamer Netflix. Beginning development in 2020, the miniseries is the fourth dramatic take on the infamous serial killer following three independent productions, 1992's The Secret Life, 2002's Dahmer, and 2017's My Friend Dahmer receiving very degrees of responses with My Friend Dahmer arguably the best of the three. When the miniseries was first announced I was skeptical because I didn't think there was any more to be told about Dahmer than we'd already learned from years of rubbernecking let alone three film attempts, but much to my surprise I found this miniseries to not only exceed my expectations, but shattered them as Dahmer-Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story is one of the year's best TV shows and if you end up seeing only one Dahmer related piece of media in your life, make it this one.

While the show may be titled after serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, he's only half of what this movie is about. While the first 3 or four episodes dive extensively into Dahmer's childhood from age six where he first began to manifest his macabre interest in dead animals and dissecting them through his teens and 20s where we see the effects of Dahmer's unstable homelife, repressed homosexuality, and darkening appetites, the movie places more focus on the lead-up to Dahmer's actions as well as the fallout that came after the horrifying revelations came to light (and not just with Dahmer himself). Intermixed with the scenes of Dahmer socially engineering his victims, struggling with keeping his compulsions in check, or failure to maintain professional and personal relationships, we're shown a series of failures either through incompetence, apathy, distraction or neglect that disregard the obvious warning signs surrounding Dahmer as he deals with barely concealed issues that are missed by parents, educators, law enforcement, or administrative officials with those who actually try to shine a light on Dahmer's actions ignored at best or punished or threatened with punishment at worst. This is a show that despite being set in the early 90s is no less prescient today with issues such as systemic racism and homophobia still very much allowing inaction or harm to victims, and an award ceremony scene where two police officers are rewarded for simply avoiding responsibility for handing a child over to Dahmer will make your blood boil with how little has changed in regards to the ""blue wall of silence"" and the corruption of police unions in keeping unfit officers out of the profession.

The acting is solid across the board. Evan Peters is really good is the titular Dahmer as he captures the tragedy of his situation in the early years, but Peters and the creative team don't try to use this as an excuse or easy answer (an epilogue says as much there's no simple answer) and Dahmer's metamorphosis from struggling confused adolescent to cold calculating opportunistic predator who justifies his actions with a false victimhood complex makes it clear that Dahmer's actions have no ""out"" from his responsibility for them. The movie is an ensemble and features a number of characters either recurring or one off who are integral to the plot. Easily my favorite comes in the form of deaf actor Rodney Burford who plays Dahmer's victim Tony Hughes and the entire episode is anchored to the POV of this character with characters using ASL to communicate, muffling the audio to create verisimilitude, and you feel like you get to know Hughes in a way we've never been allowed to see before. Make no mistake, this is a starmaking performance from Burford so expect to see much more of him in the future, I guarantee it. The show also features terrific performances from arguably the two ""cores"" of this movie, Niecy Nash as Dahmer's neighbor and until now unsung hero of this story Glenda Cleveland, and veteran character actor Richard Jenkins as Dahmer's torn and conflicted father Lionel.

With Nash's Glenda, we get the feeling of powerlessness and helplessness from the people on the ground affected by Dahmer's actions as noted in the movie that Dahmer lived in a cheap rundown part of Milwaukee and targeted mostly people of color as his victims. While Glenda reports the awful smells coming from Dahmer's apartment to the landlord as well as sounds of screening of fighting to the police, not only is she often ignored, but is shouted down by the police such as the infamous incident wherein officers John balcerzak and Joseph Gabrish took Dahmer's word that 14 year-old Konerak Sinthasomphone was actually his drunk 19 year old boyfriend instead of his victim who'd been given an amateur lobotomy by Dahmer instead of an escaped victim despite Glenda's pleas. The movie isn't excessively gory as the gore is limited to only plot important scenes, but just because it's not as bloody as Saw or Hostel doesn't make it easier to watch and in some cases it's actually harder. Richard Jenkins is really strong as Dahmer's father Lionel and the different points of the story that portray him as wanting to help his son but not knowing how are heartbreaking because you see in Lionel the confusion and discomfort that make him unable to give Dahmer the help he needs because he very much denies there even is a problem and tries to write it off as something that can be cured with tough love or firm guidance. There isn't any singular point of blame you can link to Dahmer (as the show isn't about ""understanding Dahmer""), but the show does give us some potential issues such as a mentally unstable mother, a distant father, and internalized feelings of abandonment, but even then these aren't frame as excuses. The show stays good even after the actual crimes of Jeffrey Dahmer are over and done with by the halfway point, as the show shifts focus away from Dahmer and looks at the media fallout, the insane fandom surrounding Dahmer, the exploitation of tabloids and indie comics that trivialize Dahmer and his victims, and to watch these victims and their families be at the mercy of harassing phone calls and invasive pictures by rubbernecking tourists is painful to watch.

If I haven't made it clear, Dahmer-Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story is one of the best TV projects I've seen this year and I can't recommend it enough. My one point of criticism is I felt certain tangents related to Ed Gein and John Wayne Gacy seemed a little out of place and I wasn't sure why they were presented the way they were with such polished detailed flashbacks, but other than that one misstep I really think everyone should see this show.","September 21, 2022 (United States)",starting in july notorious serial murderer jeffrey dahmer evan

community and victims families as well as the bureaucratic and law enforcement failures that allowed dahmer to continue indulging his twisted appetites dahmermonster the jeffrey dahmer story is the latest project from noted producer ryan murphy whose prolific work on the likes of american horror and crime story lead to him getting an overall deal with streamer netflix beginning development in the miniseries is the fourth dramatic take on the infamous serial killer following three independent productions s the secret life s dahmer and s my friend dahmer receiving very degrees of responses with my friend dahmer arguably the best of the three when the miniseries was first announced i was skeptical because i didnt think there was any more to be told about dahmer than wed already learned from years of rubbernecking let alone three film attempts but much to my surprise i found this miniseries to not only exceed my expectations but shattered them as dahmermonster the jeffrey dahmer story is one of the years best tv shows and if you end up seeing only one dahmer related piece of media in your life make it this one while the show may be titled after serial killer jeffrey dahmer hes only half of what this movie is about while the first or four episodes dive extensively into dahmers childhood from age six where he first began to manifest his macabre interest in dead animals and dissecting them through his teens and s where we see the effects of dahmers unstable homelife repressed homosexuality and darkening appetites the movie places more focus on the leadup to dahmers actions as well as the fallout that came after the horrifying revelations came to light and not just with dahmer himself intermixed with the scenes of dahmer socially engineering his victims struggling with keeping his compulsions in check or failure to maintain professional and personal relationships were shown a series of failures either through incompetence apathy distraction or neglect that disregard the obvious warning signs surrounding dahmer as he deals with barely concealed issues that are missed by parents educators law enforcement or administrative officials with those who actually try to shine a light on dahmers actions ignored at best or punished or threatened with punishment at worst this is a show that despite being set in the early s is no less prescient today with issues such as systemic racism and homophobia still very much allowing inaction or harm to victims and an award ceremony scene where two police officers are rewarded for simply avoiding responsibility for handing a child over to dahmer will make your blood boil with how little has changed in regards to the blue wall of silence and the corruption of police unions in keeping unfit

11,11,6.0,1 October 2022,"The show was good and well acted but Glenda Cleveland was given more screen time than any of Dahmer's victims yet she never lived next door to Dahmer, in fact, she didn't even live in the same apartment. So why on a show that aims not to tell the events from Dahmer's point of view did they chose to mainly focus the POV on a woman who had barley anything to do with him? Could it be she is now dead and they don't need her permission to take creative liberties in pushing agendas that (according to reporters at the time) weren't an issue?

The portrayal is insensitive, especially in its depiction of abuse, which is disturbingly sexualized and misleading. It downplays the trauma and paints an inaccurate picture of events. The storytelling feels exploitative rather than informative, and completely left out the testimonies of people seeing abuse go on in the household, aswell as the fact that Jose sexually assaulted other young men.

13,13,8.0,22 November 2022,"Evan Peters has seriously outdone his job here. His acting was top notch and his portrayal of dahmer, from his clothing to expressions, everything was perfect, perfect everything, down to the last minute details. And apart from him, the performances of the other cast members (His father, his mother, grandma, Glenda cleveland and the victims) were excellent too.

Also, the cinematography and music was impressive. The writing and screenplay was decent too, especially the fact that they didn't did much creative liberties, and hence as a result, the story turned out to be close to the actual events. The only thing i found slightly disappointing was the length. The pace was a bit slow, especially in the last few episodes, and i feel the series could've been easily wrapped up in 8 episodes, instead of 10.

But overall, it's a must watch. Especially for the ones who are interested in the crime thriller genre. It's a realistic take on one of the most notorious series killers in our history, where they haven't romanticized him and in fact, called out the ones who tend to do so.

14,14,8.0,21 September 2024,"There are two monsters is this heartbreaking and compelling story, but they are not Erik (Cooper Koch) and Lyle (Nicholas Alexander Chavez), they are Jose (Javier Bardem) and Kitty (Chloë Savigny).

I don't want to delve too deeply into the legal aspects of this case, because this is not a documentary, but a dramatic series. However, let me start by saying, if Erik and Lyle had been Erika and Lyla-two daughters-they would never have spent a day in jail. That's not to say that Erik and Lyle were blameless, but the mitigating circumstances were so overwhelming and compelling that they should have been sentenced to voluntary manslaughter with a 10 year sentence.

Then there is Dominic Dunne (Nathan Lane) a despicable man who trafficked in gossip and celebrity cocktail parties. He was sort of a straight Truman Capote.

I want to highlight Episode 5 'The Hurt Man.' There are only two characters in the entire scene: Leslie Abramson (Ari Gaynor) and Erik. Director Michael Upendahl places the camera about 12 feet away from the table where the two are seated. Abramson with her back to the camera (we never see her face) and Lyle facing. Slowly, imperceptibly, the camera pushes in on Erik until it passes Abramson and ends with a close up of Erik as he explains the title of the episode. Riveting!

Cooper Koch does a tremendous job throughout, but especially in that episode. Nicholas Chavez is also terrific as Lyle.

Episode 6 is probably one of the saddest and sweetest pieces of television I've ever witnessed in 52 years of being alive. If you know the history of Dahmer you'll know what's coming which makes it even more heart breaking.

17,17,8.0,21 September 2022,"This is a mini series chronicling the horrible crimes of Jeffrey Dahmer. Evan Peters is very good playing the title role. No campy stuff here, just plays Dahmer completely convincingly and serious.

Makes effective use of flashbacks to Dahmer's childhood and teen years to explain how he turned out the way he did.

Richard Jenkins plays Dahmer's father. He's great as a man broken by years of unhappiness culminating in realization of what his son has become. Penelope Ann Miller is wonderful in her short role as Dahmer's unstable, UFO-chasing mother.

Niecy Nash has a small role as Dahmer's next-door neighbor. Her scenes are some of the most terrifying and unsettling, not for what you see, but for the sounds she endured. Love her in this role.

The acting is pretty good across the board. The actors playing his victims were perfect at conveying terror. Shaun J. Brown plays Tracy Edwards, a victim, in the first episode. The scene had me on the edge of my seat. Without going into detail, the scene takes place mainly in Dahmer's apartment.

Everything has a very dirty look to it, low lit, hazy. You could almost imagine the ""smell"" of the scenes. As horrible as that sounds, it does make for effectively creepy watching.

Again, the subject matter is very dark and hard to endure. The series takes viewers from Dahmer's childhood up through his trial and imprisonment. I felt like Evan Peters completely inhabited his role. Also left me low with immense sadness for the families of the real-life victims, the survivors of his crimes, and the neighbors and others whose lives are left scarred by the actions of Dahmer the Monster.","September 21, 2022 (United States)",this is a mini series chronicling the horrible crimes of jeffrey dahmer evan peters is very good playing the title role no campy stuff here just plays dahmer completely convincingly and serious makes effective use of flashbacks to dahmers childhood and teen years to explain how he turned out the way he did richard jenkins plays dahmers father hes great as a man broken by years of unhappiness culminating in realization of what his son has become penelope ann miller is wonderful in her short role as dahmers unstable ufochasing mother niecy nash has a small role as dahmers nextdoor neighbor her scenes are some of the most terrifying and unsettling not for what you see but for the sounds she endured love her in this role the acting is pretty good across the board the actors playing his victims were perfect at conveying terror shaun j brown plays tracy edwards a victim in the first episode the scene had me on the edge of my seat without going into detail the scene takes place mainly in dahmers apartment everything has a very dirty look to it low lit hazy you could almost imagine the smell of the scenes as horrible as that sounds it does make for effectively creepy watching again the subject matter is very dark and hard to endure the series takes viewers from dahmers childhood up through his trial and imprisonment i felt like evan peters completely inhabited his role also left me low with immense sadness for the families of the reallife victims the survivors of his crimes and the neighbors and others whose lives are left scarred by the actions of dahmer the monster,POSITIVE
18,18,7.0,9 October 2022,"This started off as an incredible miniseries that had me on the edge of my seat. The first episode sets the tone perfectly by luring the viewer into the mind of Dahmer through the experience of a victim. Evan Peters does an incredible job at portraying Dahmer, everything down to voice and mannerism is so well-acted it's borderline creepy.

The show manages to portray the gruesome murders without being overly explicit about it, which in a way only adds to the physical discomfort you get from watching it. Instead of seeing blood you instead get to imagine it, which is way more scary. Combined with being beautifully shot and acted, you feel as if you're almost there seeing the real Dahmer himself hunt down and kill his victims.

Unfortunately the show reaches some sort of blind alley from Episode 7 and forth, when the writers start to take too many liberties with the script. Up until that point the show felt very focused, grounded and straight to the point, but then all of a sudden it becomes a political story about discrimination, police incompetence and racial injustice where the writers hijack the story in order to send a message rooted in today's racial climate as of 2022. I mean, I wouldn't mind watching another show about those things but it felt incredibly forced, especially since Dahmer did not discriminate when it came to the color of his victim's skin - he didn't target black people or minorities, but the last four episodes is all about that which kind of ruins everything that came before. And I hate to break it but it's not just that interesting to watch through 1 hour of the victim's families sitting down talking about how miserable they feel. Most people watch these type of shows because they want to see inside the mind of the serial killer himself.

It also doesn't help that a lot of the stuff in the last four episodes is made up, skewed or deliberately pushed aside in order to fit the ""message"" that the writers wanted to shove down our throats. What a shame.

What bother me about this series is it tries tooo hard to create storylines that just aren't true. If Murphy wants to delve into true-life crime then he needs to work on not taking such EXCESSIVE liberties, especially when choosing someone who is so well documented.

There are so many inconsistencies to the truth here. I understand peppering a narrative with some extra drama to keep it interesting but this is beyond that to me. By the 7th or so episode it just got to be too much, although I did finish the series. The most compelling episode to me was the episode with Tony. Its a shame more time was not spent on the victims.

I believe real true-crime fans would have preferred a more realistic approach to this story. If you want to embellish I to this extent, create your own serial killer and base him off Dahmer.

23,23,8.0,20 December 2022,"The way that this was handled was prefect, there was no glorification of the violence that some series allow. This was a story driven decent into his life where no one can feel sorry for him. We see all moments from his younger ages to his worthy death in prison which is only the second murder we actually see play out on screen.

With so many series that center around serial killers the murders are at the forefront just to satisfy a certain audience. Much like Mindhunter and also the fictional Hannibal the story is well written and completely grounded to be true to the victims. There were moments of shouting at the Tv on how did he get away with so much for so long. Which throws so many questions at law enforcement during this time.

The acting performance from Peters is one of these that should be herald as one of the greatest in tv for being so like the real like person but not the way that quite a few people were reacting during the height of the series popularity.

24,24,8.0,28 September 2024,"Personally, I'm perfectly capable of experiencing a piece of media based on its own merits. In case of media based of or inspired by true events like this one, good chunk of audience is simply too emotional to watch it and review it for what it is - a TV show, project that involved hundreds of people behind and in front of camera, many of them being evidently passionate about their work. Important thing here, this is NOT a documentary, it is NOT an (auto)biography, this will NOT be used as an evidence on the court in any way, shape or form. People who use films and TV shows to form their opinions about real persons or events should probably re-evaluate their mindset in that regard.

That said, this is Ryan Murphy at his best - seamlessly blending camp and melodrama with thrills and plenty of style. It's entertaining as hell but it can also be pretty tough watch. I love the vibrant and poppy visuals that always make these disturbing crime stories even more peculiar considering how those colourful environments radiate sense of comfort and ""fun"".

The performances here are absolutely amazing. Brothers are played by two newcomers, Cooper Koch and Nicholas Alexander, and they are both ferocious here. I'm sure we will definitely see more from these guys. Javier Bardem and Chloë Sevigny are also outstanding and these characters weren't something you do on autopilot but they both nailed it.

28,28,6.0,28 September 2022,"Dahmer's story has been told many times simply because we are horrified and fascinated by what he did in equal measure. His story is also part of the great debate about nature vs nurture and what has to happen to someone to turn them into a monster. This series started off so well as we delved into this very issue. The first 6 or 7 episodes were compelling but then something happened, as though the director suddenly chickened out. Later victims and Dahmer's experiments with injecting his victims in the brain to create a zombie he could control, were completely ignored. A relationship with one of his victims was invented and an occupant of his apartment block was invented. Then suddenly and for no apparent reason, the whole story stopped being about a serial killer and became all about civil rights with it being suggested that Dahmer's motivation was racist. Dahmer was many things but he was an equal opportunities killer. He chose victims because he found them beautiful and the colour of that person was not his concern. I don't understand why the series suddenly went down this cul-de-sac. Yes, he could have been caught earlier if the police had done their job but that is a different story about institutional racism in the USA and nothing to do with Dahmer, his actions or motivation.","September 21, 2022 (United States)",dahmers story has been told many times simply because we are horrified and fascinated by what he did in equal measure his story is also part of the great debate about nature vs nurture and what has to happen to someone to turn them into a monster this series started off so well as we delved into this very issue the first or episodes were compelling but then something happened as though the director suddenly chickened out later victims and dahmers experiments with injecting his victims in the brain to create a zombie he could control were completely ignored a relationship with one of his victims was invented and an occupant of his apartment block was invented then suddenly and for no apparent reason the whole story stopped being about a serial killer and became all about civil rights with it being suggested that dahmers motivation was racist dahmer was many things but he was an equal opportunities killer he chose victims because he found them beautiful and the colour of that person was not his concern i dont understand why the series suddenly went down this culdesac yes he could have been caught earlier if the police had done their job but that is a different story about institutional racism in the usa and nothing to do with dahmer his actions or motivation,NEGATIVE

Evan Peters as Dahmer is totally intensely creepy that I had to keep the lights on while watching. It is amazing how he can play any character tranforming himself. Niecy Nash as the concerned nosey neighbor deserves an Emmy for her role. The rest of the cast are superb as well.

Leave it to Ryan Murphy to fill this with inaccuracies and fillers when perhaps two segments would have been fine. Lots of boring scenes.

That being said, the acting is magnificent all around, no even mediocre performances.

Lyle was played by General Hospital alumnus Nick Chavez. Did someone say soap opera actors cannot act? He was fabulous portraying Lyle as an angry, amoral brat with a trigger temper. Cooper Koch's subtle portrayal of Erik was perfect as the kid dominated by his brother and needing his father's love.

Javier Bardem as Jose will scare the hell out of you, and Nathan Lane as Dominick Dunne will break your heart.

Though I feel with that hair and overt personality, Leslie Abramson wouldn't be that hard to capture. Amy Gravnor was nevertheless amazing.

I didn't know most of the details they showed in the series, so it was shocking to see what Dahmer really did throughout his life. My heart goes out to the innocent victims families, it is really disappointing that people have made this series a joke. There should be no jokes made about what Jeffrey did to these young men. It is dehumanizing and disgusting to do so. I am confused as to why they put Glenda Cleveland's apartment right next to Jeffrey's, when that was not where she lived. I don't know why Netflix decided to include false details about the story. Seeing the police bring Konerak stuck with me watching the rest of the series. How clueless can 2 police officers be? He was an innocent child. What's not included in the series like most, Tracy Edwards who escaped Dahmer's apartment and got him arrested, has been in prison multiple times for many reasons including murder. It is interesting how he almost got murdered by Jeff, and then testified against him but later on murdered someone else. Overall, I believe this series was good. Evan and Niecy's performances were outstanding. I don't know why people are fixated on continuing the entertainment of Dahmer's terrible actions, but it was okay.

48,48,10.0,23 September 2024,"This is a review for the second instalment of the ""Monsters"" saga - The Lyle and Erik Menendez story.

Much like ""Dahmer"" the show started with a lot of promise - set the scene, created intrigue and gave a good reason to continue watching.

The acting for the most part is phenomenal and the fifth episode in particular was remarkable, especially given the single take.

Unfortunately, however, unlike ""Dahmer"" the show took a pretty swift down turn in the second half. It became lost in never-ending monologues revolving around irrelevant stories that served very little purpose or interest to the audience.

The show was also incredibly frustrating at times - the monologues were tiresome, sure, but it almost felt as if some of the characters and opinions were specifically aimed at getting under your skin. This would be understandable if it was there to provide an altered perspective which provoked a feeling of defensiveness, but what you actually felt was as if you were being nagged at incessantly, provoking pure frustration.

The show was also bloated, which appears to be a relatively common trend these days (cash is king after all), but I felt the joy of the show would have been wrapped up perfectly in a simple 4-5 episodes.

49,49,7.0,22 September 2022,"I will start by saying this, I watch a lot of true crime. Whether it be 48 hours, or documentaries, biopics, you name it and i've probably watched it. That being said, I have yet to see something as jaw dropping and moving as this series right here. I am pretty numb to the brutality of all of these events because i've read about them or seen them portrayed so many times in different variations of media, so it is very rare for something to actually evoke a sort of emotion out of me.

Evan peters' portrayal of Jeffrey Dahmer is the best I have ever seen. I'm a fan of his work in previous projects (ahs, american animals, x men etc) so going into this I already knew I was in for a treat. But MAN. I genuinely became nauseous at the sight of the vicious acts displayed in this show, Ryan Murphy held back no punches, and I believe the show is better for it. The reality of what this sicko did is just beyond comprehension, and I truly believe that Evan and Ryan and the entire team involved have truly captured that.

50,50,1.0,17 October 2022,"I have been watching this show and I know almost everything about the Dahmer case, since I enjoy watching true crime shows. I really get confused that they are showing that neighbor lady that is trying to be a hero. That never happened. The only true thing was the complaint about the smell and this actually came from a man and his wife. But they never did anything and for sure never called the police for anything. The show was good until there. It is disappointing that show runners always feel like they have to invent stuff to pump it bigger, by creating a fictional female character that never existed in the real events. Great acting but not accurate. Also when you just watch the interviews with Dahmer that exist on YouTube, you'll see that he is not talking the way he is portrayed. But it is in general still better as I expected, since I find it weird anyway to make films and shows about such horrific things.

I couldn't watch the Dahmer series that precedes this one. I did watch this. I had zero recollection of the brothers, this crime and all the followed.

I have to say that as I stumbled through this it started to occur to me that everyone is a monster in one way or another. The parents. The two brothers. The therapist. The lawyers. There's not a single likable character. They are all terrible people.

It is relentlessly violent and gruesome.

It's not ""clever"" (as is Wyatt Earp and the Cowboy Wars), and has no humor. It is just relentless. It is disturbing and unpleasant. It's awful.

Numerous times I thought I should stop watching it, and yet... I persisted. It's crazy but I did so even though I did not really like it.

There is what I think is very good acting. One episode is just Eric and his lawyer, with the latter's back to the camera. It feels like it was filmed in one take and it is incredible. The actor playing Eric is crazy good.

I don't know if I recommend this. It goes way beyond True Crime. I think it might be good filmmaking though. It reminds me a bit of The Bear in that the episodes are very distinct with a specific topic or subject.

57,57,6.0,29 September 2022,"Essentially this series has two ""parts"" -a retelling of the well known horror (which is what you would expect) and harrowing tales of those that lived on, which isn't something that we usually see in detail. First part leaves you in fear and shock while the second makes you numb

1) The ""what happened"" montage So acting is top notch but I have the problem with overall tone of episodes. Firstly - it is too slow, movements, dialogues, music, zoom ins and outs. The creepy atmosphere is exaggerated. The scary part isn't titular monster being a walking red flag and staring at you, it's the fact that you don't know it's a monster until it's too late. Subtlety would've made this 10/10 since we know how this is gonna play out, we don't need every possible visual or musical cue to be on the edge. Would've preferred the chronological order of events

2) The story of survivors is what made this exceptional and something I honestly didn't expect. Somehow it felt like I was there, alive at that time and place, staring in shock and dissappointment at the world until there was nothing. This would've been a great opportunity to collaborate with the families, to be their voice, to inspire people to do better but none of that happened. They apparently weren't consulted at all. Ironically, Netflix did the same thing people in charge did back then and completely ignored them making way for their own project. It poses a question - how ethical is the true crime genre if all we're doing is satisfying our own curiosity and making profits of destroyed lives? There always needs to be a reminder that this is real life and not entertainment

As a mini series this gets 9/10, props to the actors, cons to extremely slow pace. Netflix gets 1/10, a silver lining being them not making titular monster into a sensation.

58,58,9.0,10 October 2024,"The second season is not trying to make friends (this rating is for season 2 only). It is actually a movie that will infuriate anyone who takes a side on the case before watching. It will infuriate those who believe the Menendez brothers were justified to kill their parents.and those who supported their defence and believe their sentences should've been reflected by their plausible sexual abuse story and those who believe they killed strictly for an inheritance.

This was a difficult story to tell because (a) the subject matter is/was intensely sensitive and (b) the Menendez brothers motive is still being hotly debated today.

You don't have to pick a side. Nathan Lane (playing Dominick Dunne) and the screenplay can lead you either way (Lane, BTW, was brilliant in this).

59,59,7.0,22 October 2022,"If you actually know the full, true story of Jeffrey Dahmer, much of this show is infuriating. It is riddled with inaccuracies and over dramatization. However, it's wise to keep in mind that this isn't a documentary on Dahmer, it's a TV show, so excess and ridiculous drama is expected. The show overall is pretty good, but surprisingly SO slow. Each episode lasted an eternity and was wayyyy too drawn out. I understand this is how shows make their money, but it's rough as a viewer. I was also expecting much more gore and violence. There's next to none. Almost all graphic content is described by other people in the episodes, not actually seen. I really dislike how the show is pieced together as well. The first episode starts with Dahmer being arrested, and we backtrack from there, spring forward, backtrack, spring forward, etc. It seems like a really strange way to tell a story like this. It makes it more confusing than it already is. The timeline they actually lay out for Dahmer's life is wack. Finally, the involvement of basically everyone involved is super exaggerated, but this is how they make the story more compelling I guess. They also make this story 1000x more racially charged than it actually was. However, I was definitely expecting that. My biggest piece of advice before watching Dahmer is to do your research. There's a short documentary on Peacock called ""Dahmer on Dahmer"" that I highly recommend watching FIRST. Even simply reading Jeffrey Dahmer's Wikipedia was incredibly informative and it gives you a knowledge base for this show. The show itself is decently entertaining, but all viewers should keep in mind that this portrayal is not at all accurate. The ratio of accuracies to inaccuracies are 1:10, seriously. It's almost like the writers took the story of Dahmer as a template and made up 5 other storylines and mashed them all together to make a show that is kinda about Dahmer, but really not.

62,62,10.0,12 October 2022,"First of all, Evan Peters is an amazing actor, and if his character wasn't based on a real person this would have been phenomenal. However, I feel the creators did a great injustice by the way they portrayed Dharmer. It comes off as if he was some insecure, sombre, loner when in reality he was a manipulative, confident and calculating sociopath.

It's as if the creators almost want to depict Jeffery Dhamer as being a misunderstood outcast who can't bare to be alone, but the reality was that Dhamer lacked any kind of remorse or empathy for his victims and treated human beings like objects to satisfy his grotesque desires. The real kicker, however, is that the creators didn't even bother to contact a single family member of any victim, re-traumatising them in this process. For a show that claims to 'strive to put the victims' stories and their families' trauma at the heart of the production' they sure have a funny way of showing it. Jeffrey Dhamer is not a brand, he doesn't deserve a narrative.

I've watched lots of true crime, but this series was something else. Netflix has taken a real life event - peoples real trauma (let me remind you that this did not happen thaaat long ago either) - and made it into a tv-show mixed with fictional events. What makes this different from lots of other true crime that I've seen is that they have real actors (who dresses the same as the real victims and of course are named the same thing as them) who they've used to recreate the scenes of the murderers. If you don't find any issues with this ethically yet, please have in mind that lots of the murderers that are shown in this series have made up stuff thrown in to the scenes which never has never happened just to make it more interesting for the viewer. For example the episode that focused on the very sweet deaf guy that unfortunately met paths with Dahmer, that was not at all how his last day looked like. What make this even more ethically wrong, is that Netflix did not even ask or inform the families of the victims first.

It's awful how hard Netflix are trying to capitalize on so many completely innocent young mens deaths. This series never should have been made.

If so, Dahmers himself had some very annoying voice and accent ticks, and perhaps Peters is just doing the best he can. Niecy Nash's performance as Dahmer's persistent neighbour is stellar.

68,68,9.0,25 September 2022,"I didn't want going to watch it at first. After all it is a disgusting and disturbing story, to say the least.

I can say it was mostly done with a modicum of decency. The gore and violence was kept to a minimum.

It was a decenct show until episode 7. Then it became an excuse for people not involved to claim victimhood. The best segment was the background of the sweet young promising deaf man. I really was hoping this would be more like the Versace segment of ACS and focus on the victims.

The police are damned if they do and damned if they don't, aren't they? If they'd have stuck their nose in too far they'd have been accused of harassing people based on race or sexual orientation. They are easy to blame instead of those committing carnage. I think most people in that particular building minded their own troubles and didn't want the law around. The police were told to lay off the gay community. Also, some say Gacywas racist because he only killed white guys.

The acting was good. It was overlong though. It takes a stab at trying to make sense of how Dahmer became a monster. I don't think anyone will ever know. It did show Dahmer as a soulless automaton. Seems pretty accurate. I think this is why he couldn't hold anyone's attention and the reason he had no feeling for other humans. Some reviewers don't believe his personality could have attracted all those men. It didn't. It was the fact he was blonde. A status symbol. A trophy hookup.

69,69,7.0,29 September 2024,"""Monsters"" continues Ryan Murphy's anthology series with another true crime story I was pretty unfamiliar with. I understand the series has faced controversy for its portrayal of the real characters and events, but I am not here to comment on its accuracy. As a series, I think it is pretty solid. The actors do a phenomenal job and the story is mostly engaging.

72,72,10.0,26 October 2022,"Let's get this out of the way first; Evan Peters is nothing short of phenomenonal in the title role. His immersion in the character is evident and the layers to his performance are superb. If you also need any reminder (not that anyone should need it) that Richard Jenkins is one of the most versatile actors on screen today, your proof is here.

My issue, however, is in the tempo and creative licence taken by the writers. Very similar to what happened in The Watcher, the very long, very drawn-out story simply doesn't follow a lot of the well-publicised timelines and movements of Dahmer, and instead paints him more as an unwilling participant in compulsive acts rather than the predatorial individual he was.

Murphy's writing style obviously strikes a cord with many, but it's not without its frustrations.","September 21, 2022 (United States)",lets get this out of the way first evan peters is nothing short of phenomenonal in the title role his immersion in the character is evident and the layers to his performance are superb if you also need any reminder not that anyone should need it that richard jenkins is one of the most versatile actors on screen today your proof is here my issue however is in the tempo and creative licence taken by the writers very similar to what happened in the watcher the very long very drawnout story simply doesnt follow a lot of the wellpublicised timelines and movements of dahmer and instead paints him more as an unwilling participant in compulsive acts rather than the predatorial individual he was murphys writing style obviously strikes a cord with many but its not without its frustrations,POSITIVE
73,73,9.0,1 October 2022,"The first several episodes were pretty good. The last few after his capture felt very rushed and biased with Jeffrey not depicted accurately at all. It was like they got tired and dropped the ball. Watch all the interviews of Dahmer on YouTube and you'll see how they depicted him in prison in the series is nothing like how he really was then. They kept trying to portray him as evil and sleazy even though he was not and was repentant (he was found not to be a psychopath when tested, and even his doctors were genuinely sad to hear of his passing). As a psychology student, Dahmer has always fascinated me for the uniqueness of his psychology and how he wasn't truly evil like other serial killers, just incredibly sick.

The thing that made me want to turn the show off was how they just had to stick in the rumor of Jeff taunting prisoners with food. That is completely untrue, it was a statement made by Scarver (his killer) when he was trying to get a book deal. Originally Scarver had said God told him to kill those inmates, and he also killed someone else at the same time. It had nothing to do with taunting. Also, according to Patrick Kennedy, Jeffrey had been in isolation for his own protection the entirety of his sentence until he finally asked to be released into general population even though he said he knew he would probably be killed there. And at least one officer who worked at the prison said Jeffrey was a model inmate on his way to medium security for good behavior. Inaccuracies like this are predictable but irritating. But I guess the drama and rumors are what make for better television.","September 21, 2022 (United States)",the first several episodes were pretty good the last few after his capture felt very rushed and biased with jeffrey not depicted accurately at all it was like they got tired and dropped the ball watch all the interviews of dahmer on youtube and youll see how they depicted him in prison in the series is nothing like how he really was then they kept trying to portray him as evil and sleazy even though he was not and was repentant he was found not to be a psychopath when tested and even his doctors were genuinely sad to hear of his passing as a psychology student dahmer has always fascinated me for the uniqueness of his psychology and how he wasnt truly evil like other serial killers just incredibly sick the thing that made me want to turn the show off was how they just had to stick in the rumor of jeff taunting prisoners with food that is completely untrue it was a statement made by scarver his killer when he was trying to get a book deal originally scarver had said god told him to kill those inmates and he also killed someone else at the same time it had nothing to do with taunting also according to patrick kennedy jeffrey had been in isolation for his own protection the entirety of his sentence until he finally asked to be released into general population even though he said he knew he would probably be killed there and at least one officer who worked at the prison said jeffrey was a model inmate on his way to medium security for good behavior inaccuracies like this are predictable but irritating but i guess the drama and rumors are what make for better television,NEGATIVE

Usually with serial killer programmes/series they're not good, they feel very fake but this was not.

76,76,8.0,4 January 2023,"""Dahmer - Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story"" from creator Ryan Murphy et al. Is as much an in-depth psychological examination of the prolific serial killer - his upbringing, his relationships, his desires and behaviors - as it is a graphic, unsparing, intimate, highly tense, and disturbing Netflix series. I feel disgusted, disturbed, intrigued, fascinated, and invested all at the same time. Much of the show's success is due to engrossing performances, particularly by Evan Peters in a disquieting turn as Jeff Dahmer and Richard Jenkins as his hard-ass father Lionel. Layer upon layer, the confounding character study unfolds by taking the viewer to different time periods in non-linear fashion throughout Jeff's life, setting the stage with his capture and interrogation. I only wish the pacing was a little faster sometimes, but the slow burn often increases the anxiety through anticipation and dread. The show also looks great capturing a retro and seedy atmosphere and the details of several locales from the 70s through the 90s. If you're fascinated by serial killer studies, then this is a must-watch, but if you are squeamish, then look away.

77,77,7.0,16 October 2022,"This series looks at the life and crimes of Jeffrey Dahmer, his early years, failed jobs, crimes and victims.

I worried early on that it was going to feel long, or stretched out, ten episodes is quite stretch, it wasn't, at no point was this slow or underdeveloped.

An incredibly chilling watch, it doesn't hold back, it puts you very close to the action, physically and mentally, you'll be left with strong options of Dahmer, and his hideous crimes.

You'll get an idea as to why Dahmer chose the victims that he did, and you'll have an idea as to why he got away with things for so long.

It doesn't follow a straight line, it moves backwards and forwards through Dahmer's life as it progresses, but it does make sense, and it really is cohesive.

Best episode for me was Tony's story, he was the most developed of the victims, you felt his dreams, ambitions and hopes, only to see them dashed by Dahmer.

Great cast, superb acting, it truly is a PowerPoint performance from Evan Peters, he's phenomenal.

79,79,7.0,10 January 2023,"This is one of the most difficult reviews I've written. To start off I'd have to give credit where it is due. It was a very well produced series with excellent performances, but at the same time I was conflicted watching it. Even before they exposed the sick people who became fans of him in the later episodes I wondered why I was watching this to begin. There's something wrong with giving all of this fame and glory to this evil lunatic. Unlike many others I've read in the reviews I didn't feel sympathy for him for one second. There are many individuals in this world with sick fantasies and poor upbringings who don't go on to do what he did.

On the other hand I do think it is valuable to learn the history of these types of events as the show particularly did a good job highlighting the systemic flaws that allowed this flame to become a blazing forest fire. I did check the truth behind much of the series and it does do a good job in this respect as well.

81,81,9.0,25 September 2024,"Monsters: The Eric and Lyle Menendez Story delivers a chilling and captivating portrayal of one of the most infamous criminal cases in American history. The show masterfully explores the complex layers of truth surrounding the Menendez brothers' trial, blurring the lines between what the media depicted, what the public was led to believe, and the deeper psychological nuances of what may have ""really"" happened behind closed doors.

The performances are nothing short of gripping. The actors portraying Eric and Lyle Menendez capture the vulnerability, confusion, and darkness of their characters with haunting accuracy. The way the show navigates the conflicting narratives-the media's sensationalized portrayal of the brothers as cold-blooded murderers, their own defense of long-term abuse, and the stark societal judgment-creates an unsettling atmosphere that leaves viewers questioning who the real monsters are.

What stands out in Monsters is its ability to weave together the cold facts of the case with the emotional and moral undertones. It challenges viewers to reflect on the themes of family trauma, the impact of public perception, and the lengths to which people will go to conceal the ugly truths of their lives.

The direction and pacing are solid, ensuring that even those familiar with the case remain engaged and invested in the unfolding drama. The show doesn't shy away from the raw, uncomfortable truths at the core of the story, while also leaving room for the audience to question their own judgments and assumptions. This isn't supposed to be an easy watch. You're not supposed to condone what they did, but understand why and what mindset they were in.

In the end, Monsters is more than just a retelling of the Menendez brothers' story.

I know his dad tried...a little. But I wish more was done to keep him behind bars or in a mental institution.

Seeing his victims from their point of view was the hardest part of this entire series. Excruciatingly heartbreaking.

I wish shows/movies would show more of this. Yes, we're all intrigued with how someone could be so incredibly messed up. I personally want to see the psychology behind it. There's always a reason.

But we need more focus on the victims, who they were and how it tore up their families up... Forever.

But everything else is just... Boring. It's not supposed to be gore or visceral, but Netflix's approach is a little bit too soft for this kind of story. Not only that, it lacks historical accuracy. By ""saving"" viewers from certain details of Dahmer's crimes, people who didn't know the story beforehand might still be unaware of the full extent of his madness, by the end of this series, and yes, that fact contributes to the feeling of empathy that many of the viewers might develop for him, throughout the story.

Khetphet Phagnasay as one of the victims fathers was also very good. The rest of the cast were adequate.

If you're old enough the story is well known and here was dealt with in an interesting way. It starts with Dahmer's arrest and then is told in a series of flash backs and forward to some of the events in the story, some covered more than once from slightly different points of view. While I quite liked this some people may find it a little confusing.

Where the series looses points for me is that there is too much padding and repetition in many of the episodes making them drag. The series could have been cut down to 5 or 6 one hour episodes without loosing the story and it's impact and would have been far better.

93,93,9.0,6 April 2023,"I'm a fan of Ryan Murphy as his works are real and dig raw and it feels like madness, as he shows the grit and dirty like happenings of raw real life stories so well(evidenced by ""American Crime Story"", ""Impeachment"", ""American Horror Story"", and ""Feud"": Beatty and Joan""). So with this special ""Netflix"" limited series ""Dahmer-Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story"" it was raw, blunt, and brash in it's showcase of one crazy real life monster in serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer(the wicked and good Evan Peters). The murder scenes are brutal and very blood like with nightmarish gore. Still along the way aside from the horror this series goes in depth and in detail about Jeff's troubled life and upbringing that lead him to be a monster, as shown are his being from a broken home, and his early love for road kill, which would all shape his different lifestyle on the Milwaukee streets which involved encounters at bars and bathhouses, after his exile from Ohio, and the military after his bored south Florida stay, in which Jeff passed some time working, staying with grandma, drinking beer and orange crush soda aside from his other strange hobbies. It's like a real life like bio of a serial killer, and you the viewer feel the pain of the victims families, and Jeff's father Lionel(the good Richard Jenkins) suffers the sorrow and heartbreak of what his grown son Jeffrey has become.

95,95,8.0,17 February 2023,"This show is just outstanding, so far I've seen this three times this week.

This is how good it is the acting, direction, editing, casting, cinematography everything is mind-blowing Each and every actor deserves appreciation yes each every actor because of all of them were just pitch perfect especially peters, no joke I've seen this kind of acting after a long long time, he was ridiculously good, he nailed this role(not exaggerating he actually did) this is probably the only show that actually feels like set in 70s, 80s and 90s which is good thing for sure.

Now I've given you a pretty good idea how awesome this show is, the story is based on real events but bits and pieces are still fictional, not to violate the true events too much, the gruesomeness, sexual scenes, violence is shown in a moderate way which a good thing, the makers didn't rely on these factors but a good story and a team of good actors giving their best performances..

Now whatever I've said above has nothing to do with the real life events or people at all, i only talked about how great the ""show"" is I do understand how heartbreaking and terrifying it must've been for the victims and their families, my prayers goes to them, god bless them they sure did not deserve to leave the world like that, Jeffrey dahmer was a horrible and messed up human being who didn't deserve to live, and people who are going to sympathize with him after the show, no you don't...it's Evan peters who did a great job with his acting, give him the credit for that.. This show does not glorify that killer or the pain he caused to the victims and families, it is only a cinematic piece of art, this show clearly showcases dahmer as the ""Antagonist"" and victims and their families as ""protagonist"" this why I liked this very much..

However, special praise goes to Evan Peters, for me the successor to Leonardo DiCaprio. Fantastic acting! I hope for his sake that he will no longer be seen only in streaming series, but will also make it into feature films. He has what it takes!

It's fun to see Evan Peters in the role of the serial killer, and the creators have more than nailed his look as well.

The racist view of the police, who don't take the black neighbor seriously, as well as the relatives of the victims, because they were mainly black, Asian or Hispanic, is well portrayed.","September 21, 2022 (United States)",the first few episodes were good and i really wanted to know what would happen next in my opinion the series was then unnecessarily drawn out it would have made more sense to make it a miniseries however special praise goes to evan peters for me the successor to leonardo dicaprio fantastic acting i hope for his sake that he will no longer be seen only in streaming series but will also make it into feature films he has what it takes its fun to see evan peters in the role of the serial killer and the creators have more than nailed his look as well the racist view of the police who dont take the black neighbor seriously as well as the relatives of the victims because they were mainly black asian or hispanic is well portrayed,POSITIVE

But sometimes it's safer to stay on your side of the fence and mind your business, and that's the aggression this show captured. Sympathy for the victims, also fear and remorse.

99,99,9.0,23 October 2022,"Not enough praise can be heaped on the leading cast. Evan Peters gives an unsettling and nuanced performance, and Richard Jenkins blows it out of the water as a horrified yet still devoted father. I could go on for paragraphs about the strength of the main characters in this show, in both portrayal and script. Although some of the victims' families take offense to this show existing, it is unfortunately part of the territory when you're attached to shocking events, and I felt this show was more respectful than most serial killer fare. Never does it stoop to exploitation or cheap shocks (many of the more gruesome details of Dahmer's crimes are omitted), and care is taken to portray the victims as real people with lives and families. Dahmer himself is not one-dimensional, but neither is he really sympathetic. The show avoids trying to explain why he is the way he is, which I really appreciated.

It is to be expected that liberties will be taken with these real events to condense things, provide better pacing, etc. Most of the changes I thought were fine. Where things began to kind of go off the rails was around episode 6 or 7. After Dahmer's arrest, the show begins to focus heavily on the court proceedings, race relations, and the domestic drama of the grieving families, the latter two delving into straight fiction. At the risk of sounding callous, I found it boring. I don't care that a victim's mother took umbrage at a tasteless comic starring Dahmer and mounted a lawsuit. Dahmer was a killer of opportunity and did not go out of his way to kill minorities, nor did he specifically choose a minority neighborhood to live in. The police did not ignore tips/warning signs about Dahmer because the neighborhood was mostly black, but because of homophobia (an actual issue the show could have explored more). I do not believe cops were making racist crank calls to victims' families, and the man who killed Dahmer was a raving lunatic who murdered someone for $15, not the righteous hand of justice.

Would have been an 8/10 or 9/10 without the drop in accuracy and quality post-episode 7.

101,101,10.0,22 October 2022,"First off, I am an Evan Peters fan. I think he's a terrific actor but I don't really feel like his portrayal of Dahmer was all that great. One of the scariest things about Dahmer was how intelligently and articulately he described his own crimes. The real Dahmer was soft-spoken, but self-aware and charismatic enough to manipulate people but Evan Peters portrayed him as completely monotone and emotionally flatlined. Maybe that's what people expect of someone who's done these kinds of crimes, but it wasn't how he actually was. There are many online interviews where you can see for yourself. I'm sure it was a difficult role, but I feel like EP missed the mark and just played him as a generically non-emotive psycho.

There are also a lot of inaccuracies; many other reviewers have listed them here so I won't bother repeating, but there was a definite narrative being presented that diverged from facts. The real story was intriguing and certainly horrifying enough to not have to make stuff up or editorialize it to a particular opinion, but that's Hollywood for you.

All in all it was worth a watch, especially the first half where the inaccuracies were kept to the minimum and the history of JD's life is presented as events actually unfolded. There's a lot of time jumps that could be confusing if you aren't familiar with his story but that didn't really ruin it for me. What did ruin it were the later episodes where entire episodes are based on fabricated characters and events that are used to ""sell"" a particular narrative. Still it's the best and most detailed look at Dahmer and the horrible, shocking crimes he committed.","September 21, 2022 (United States)",first off i am an evan peters fan i think hes a terrific actor but i dont really feel like his portrayal of dahmer was all that great one of the scariest things about dahmer was how intelligently and articulately he described his own crimes the real dahmer was softspoken but selfaware and charismatic enough to manipulate people but evan peters portrayed him as completely monotone and emotionally flatlined maybe thats what people expect of someone whos done these kinds of crimes but it wasnt how he actually was there are many online interviews where you can see for yourself im sure it was a difficult role but i feel like ep missed the mark and just played him as a generically nonemotive psycho there are also a lot of inaccuracies many other reviewers have listed them here so i wont bother repeating but there was a definite narrative being presented that diverged from facts the real story was intriguing and certainly horrifying enough to not have to make stuff up or editorialize it to a particular opinion but thats hollywood for you all in all it was worth a watch especially the first half where the inaccuracies were kept to the minimum and the history of jds life is presented as events actually unfolded theres a lot of time jumps that could be confusing if you arent familiar with his story but that didnt really ruin it for me what did ruin it were the later episodes where entire episodes are based on fabricated characters and events that are used to sell a particular narrative still its the best and most detailed look at dahmer and the horrible shocking crimes he committed,POSITIVE
102,102,10.0,24 September 2024,"...but it's not a documentary. Murphy relied a lot on Erik's narrative in A&E's THE MENENDEZ MURDERS: ERIK TELLS ALL, because right after I finished Monsters, I rewatched it. I was actually surprised at how much Murphy took from what Erik said in that documentary. I have to give him props for that. He got a lot right, relying a little on Robert Rand's prolific knowledge of the case and people. Where he had to be totally fictitious, IMO, was in the conversations between Kitty and Jose; scenes where it would be impossible to know what was said, because no one else was there. And since The Boys weren't consulted at all for this (I'm sure they wanted nothing to do with it, and who can blame them?), probably their private conversations too. I also would like to know why the maid wasn't a part of the series at all. Maybe because she testified in the 2nd trial she never heard fighting or shouting? (Liar, again IMO).

I'm a huge fan of Ryan Murphy, but this series took me a few episodes to warm up to. However, I was sobbing at the end. I gave this series a 9, because no other movie/series, even the Law & Order one, which was great, depicted for me the deep bond Lyle and Erik had, and still have. I was extremely emotionally affected by that aspect of Monsters; it was visceral. I have always believed Lyle and Erik, mostly BECAUSE of that bond they share. Deep emotional and physical trauma, especially shared by siblings, will either estrange them, or bond them together so tightly nothing can break it.

The end of episode 6, where they pull up in the car with the shotguns while the last verse of Crowded House's DON'T DREAM ITS OVER plays, was a really surreal moment for me. In that moment, when they exited the car and walked into the house ... I don't know, it was like, for a split second, I was there with them, not the fictional Lyle and Erik, the real ones. Just a nanosecond, but it was gut-wrenching and my heart went into my throat, and I immediately started sobbing. I'm sure it was because of the last verse of the song being played at that crucial time. I'm a big fan of Crowded House and Neil Finn, and I know the song so very, very well ... I was 22 when it was released ... and I know all the lyrics, what it's about, per Neil Finn. But in that scene, in that moment, it was like the song was written for the brothers. The choice to name that episode after the song, and end the episode with the last verse, was, IMHO, brilliant. Brilliant.

Enough tangent. I also gave it a 9 because of the casting, with 1 exception. Javier Bardem was terrifying. Cooper Koch as Erik and Nicholas Chavez as Lyle were brilliant. Sometimes I forgot they were actors. Nathan Lane as Dominick Dunne was another great choice. Chloë Sevigny is one of my favorite actresses, but I'm not sure she was right for Kitty. She is too pretty and too thin for what Kitty looked like at that time. She's too, elegant. And the wig was just horrible. It looks like the same one from Swans, lol. I can't think of another actress who would've been more appropriate, but I'm not a casting director. Jose looked a lot older than his 45 years, and Bardem fit the bill. Kitty was overweight, puffy, with sallow skin and horrible dyed blond hair with DARK eyebrows and she for sure looked years beyond 47. Sevigny is just too pretty. I also felt she didn't have a connection with her character.

In spite of the couple of criticisms I have, I am starting Monsters over again tonight, I liked it that much. So a 9 it is.","September 21, 2022 (United States)",but its not a documentary murphy relied a lot on eriks narrative in aes the menendez murders erik tells all because right after i finished monsters i rewatched it i was actually surprised at how much murphy took from what erik said in that documentary i have to give him props for that he got a lot right relying a little on robert rands prolific knowledge of the case and people where he had to be totally fictitious imo was in the conversations between kitty and jose scenes where it would be impossible to know what was said because no one else was there and since the boys werent consulted at all for this im sure they wanted nothing to do with it and who can blame them probably their private conversations too i also would like to know why the maid wasnt a part of the series at all maybe because she testified in the nd trial she never heard fighting or shouting liar again imo im a huge fan of ryan murphy but this series took me a few episodes to warm up to however i was sobbing at the end i gave this series a because no other movieseries even the law order one which was great depicted for me the deep bond lyle and erik had and still have i was extremely emotionally affected by that aspect of monsters it was visceral i have always believed lyle and erik mostly because of that bond they share deep emotional and physical trauma especially shared by siblings will either estrange them or bond them together so tightly nothing can break it the end of episode where they pull up in the car with the shotguns while the last verse of crowded houses dont dream its over plays was a really surreal moment for me in that moment when they exited the car and walked into the house i dont know it was like for a split second i was there with them not the fictional lyle and erik the real ones just a nanosecond but it was gutwrenching and my heart went into my throat and i immediately started sobbing im sure it was because of the last verse of the song being played at that crucial time im a big fan of crowded house and neil finn and i know the song so very very well i was when it was released and i know all the lyrics what its about per neil finn but in that scene in that moment it was like the song was written for the brothers the choice to name that episode after the song and end the episode with the last verse was imho brilliant brilliant enough tangent i also gave it a because of the casting with exception javier bardem was terrifying cooper koch as erik and nicholas chavez as lyle were brilliant sometimes i forgot they were actors nathan lane as dominick dunne was another great choice chloë sevigny is one of my favorite actresses but im not sure she was right for kitty she is too pretty and too thin for what kitty looked like at that time shes too elegant and the wig was just horrible it looks like the same one from swans lol i cant think of another actress who wouldve been more appropriate but im not a casting director jose looked a lot older than his years and bardem fit the bill kitty was overweight puffy with sallow skin and horrible dyed blond hair with dark eyebrows and she for sure looked years beyond sevigny is just too pretty i also felt she didnt have a connection with her character in spite of the couple of criticisms i have i am starting monsters over again tonight i liked it that much so a it is,POSITIVE

There's things missed out on though which are maybe too heavy for the series but it's already heavy enough so why not if they're in the actual accounts confirmed. Why they made Tony's friend black is pointless as he is an actual bigger part of the story than shown.

The performances are expectational, especially PETERS, and a special mention for Richard Jenkins, who puts in one of the best performances I have ever seen in a mini-series.

My only two criticisms surround the last few episodes that seem to focus more on the troubles and tribulations of Glenda rather than the sequence of events. She almost gets to the point of coming across a little sanctimonious, however horrendous her experiences clearly were.

The court case (I know it was a guilty plea) was also covered in the space of 5 minutes, when I can imagine the emotion and drama of his crimes would have reached their peak.

113,113,7.0,14 October 2024,"After watching the latest edition of Ryan Murphy's ""Monsters"" (following the one about Jeffrey Dahmer) and the new documentary, ""The Menendez Brothers"", I've now had my fill of this bit of 90s pop culture. That said, and while there's much that could be discussed and debated, I'll just say I think they should be released from prison. Irrespective of what douchebags they may have once been (or still could be), I think they were ultimately shafted and made to pay in part for the grievous injustice done with the O. J. Simpson acquittal. The series is a typical Murphy production, with innuendo and glossy sheen layered over grotesquerie, with good performances all around and enough questions raised to make it worth watching. Of note in particular is Cooper Koch's brilliant scene in E05 in one unbroken take. The documentary, with their recorded voices from prison, is a good complement to the series, and mainly serves to show they were likely telling the truth about the lifelong abuse, and, so the two brothers have paid a heavy price for helping bring awareness of male sexual abuse out of the shadows where it'd lingered for so long.","September 21, 2022 (United States)",after watching the latest edition of ryan murphys monsters following the one about jeffrey dahmer and the new documentary the menendez brothers ive now had my fill of this bit of s pop culture that said and while theres much that could be discussed and debated ill just say i think they should be released from prison irrespective of what douchebags they may have once been or still could be i think they were ultimately shafted and made to pay in part for the grievous injustice done with the o j simpson acquittal the series is a typical murphy production with innuendo and glossy sheen layered over grotesquerie with good performances all around and enough questions raised to make it worth watching of note in particular is cooper kochs brilliant scene in e in one unbroken take the documentary with their recorded voices from prison is a good complement to the series and mainly serves to show they were likely telling the truth about the lifelong abuse and so the two brothers have paid a heavy price for helping bring awareness of male sexual abuse out of the shadows where itd lingered for so long,POSITIVE

Secondly, the parents were dead and couldn't defend themselves against the abuse allegations.

The first jury was deadlocked despite 30-50 witnesses coming forward saying they were abused.

I DO NOT DISCOUNT THE ABUSE MAY HAVE HAPPENED.

Finally, they killed their parents and they were going to be cut out of the will. Those are facts.

117,117,6.0,26 June 2024,"This is a solid character study that stays away from sensationalization and glorification of Dahmer. If it sexualizes his killings, that's because Dahmer himself sexualized his own killings. If you wish to understand Dahmer a bit more than you currently do, then watch this tv show. The central performance is beyond brilliant and so is the performance of Dahmer's father. These performance alone justify this show's existence.

Moralizers and virtue signallers who protested this show only ended up raising its notoriety and helped make it the no.2 TV show of 2022 lol. They would do well to learn about the Streisand Effect. Nothing contributes to Thing A's popularity like people complaining about Thing A's existence lmao!

Some people say ""Imagine how Dahmer's victim's families would react to this show"", and i reply by stating the truth: their reaction is not my responsibility. I do not care, why should i? No one gets to STOP any piece of art from getting created - no one and that includes them. No one is forcing his victim's families to watch this tv show. They are adults who can avoid watching this show. Stop speaking ""on their behalf"" - all you're doing is putting words in their mouths in order to feel like a hero.

As for people dressing up as Dahmer for Halloween? People have been dressing up as Dahmer since his trial. People even proposed to Dahmer via letters. This is nothing new. You cannot blame this TV show for the fact that a tiny section of humanity is and always has been attracted to serial killers and violent people. How many serial killers have found love in prison? How many have gotten married while serving out their sentence? This has always been going on, the question is: Does this show glorify Dahmer and encourage that sort of behaviour? It doesn't.

Also the people losing their minds over the fact that Dahmer was in fact a good-looking man are crazy. It makes no sense to portray Dahmer as ugly lol. He was indeed goodlooking. His looks lured his victims to his apartment ffs. If he was ugly then this tactic of his wouldn't have worked as well as it did. If you wanna pretend that Dahmer was ""ugly"" then you are re-writing history and dishonouring the memory of his victims. They fell for his trick BECAUSE of his good looks. Pretending like he was ugly undermines his victims' experience.

Instead of diving into the profound emotional and psychological struggles that the Menéndez brothers faced, the series seems more interested in showcasing the glitz and drama of their Hollywood lives. It's as if the producers opted for shock value and entertainment over substance, glossing over the harrowing abuse and deep family dysfunction that fueled the crime.

This case isn't just about a couple of rich kids gone wrong; it's a disturbing reflection of power, manipulation, and the darker side of privilege. Yet, the series reduces it to a spectacle, playing up the glamour and ignoring the humanity. There was a chance to explore deeper themes-like the cycle of abuse, the pressure of living in the public eye, and the psychological impact on the brothers-but instead, we get a shiny, almost voyeuristic retelling that barely scratches the surface.

133,133,6.0,18 November 2022,"""DAHMER - MONSTER: THE STORY OF JEFFREY DAHMER"" made me a little suspicious when the trailer was announced and viewed.

I was afraid that Dahmer's cruel deeds would be used solely to generate quotas and glorify Dahmer.

When you look at it, it quickly becomes clear that this is not the intention of the series at all.

The series does not show the serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer but focuses much more on the person Jeffrey Dahmer.

Dahmer's story is used here as an extreme example of what the consequences can be when a child is not given enough attention by its parents and therefore cannot confide in them.

It becomes clear that Dahmer's actions could have been prevented if he had grown up with a family that paid attention to him and was therefore not alone in his feelings.

So what's the purpose of this show?

It's not a fiction for entertainment, and they are not trying to cover the Dahmer's story and teach us something about that really happened.

137,137,6.0,23 October 2022,"I don't want this review to sound like I'm only complaining. There is a ton about this show to like. It was very well made. Phenomenal acting. Disturbing atmosphere. I really DID enjoy it quite a bit. I would recommend it.

But it goes off the rails exactly halfway through. Up to episode 5, I was hooked. Starting with the 6th it got progressively boring and slow. They threw a whole episode away on the deaf guy and it somehow became the Niecy Nash show.

On top of that, they totally rewrote things to give them some kind of political or social justice edge. Exaggerations to flat out fabrications.

Don't treat this as a documentary in any way. It's WILDLY inaccurate. They basically took the real people/places and tossed them into a sandbox to arrange them how they wanted but much of it is wrong. When you see the little asterisk with *based on true events* take them at their word... lightly ""based on"" with ridiculous liberties. I have to deduct major points for that, especially with how they tried to spin it.

And I wish they would have focused more on the killings but they kind of glossed over it while making it minimally gory. Much is implied but not shown. I'm not a fan of that style when it comes to horror or crime.

One thing I want to say that they did amazingly well, and I don't know if it was even on purpose, was the portrayal of Jeffrey's feelings and struggles with a personality disorder. I was diagnosed in my early 20's with the same thing as Dahmer, Borderline Personality Disorder. In this show he expressed constant and chronic feelings of emptiness, loneliness, and despair which led him to self-destructive behaviors and habits. They really got that right. I felt what Dahmer felt. I've lived that experience.

138,138,5.0,6 October 2024,"I feel compelled to thank Ryan Murphy and team for the emotion they were able to elicit at the end of episode 6 ""Don't Dream it's Over"". This crescendo brought together the complicated and disturbing behaviors of every character in a portrayal that solicits just as much complicated and disturbing emotions from its audience. It's a powerful scene.

Ep 5 is powerful in its own and very important way which also deserves recognition. The script and acting accurately depict the nuance and difficulty for a child who is trying for the first time to speak out loud what happened to them while also managing the internal conflict of loving the parent and despising what they've done to you.

There are critics of this production who want more accuracy in the telling. I don't know the facts but I can confidently say that Episodes 5&6 are successful in powerful storytelling. If the goal is to bring the audience on the emotional journey of Lyle and Erik's life (and a life of male sexual familial abuse) then it was achieved.

This team clearly took care to depict the story with compassion and contentiousness while also giving viewers something sensational to watch unfold. Each character is fully developed, giving us a 360 view of a whole person.

143,143,10.0,22 March 2023,"I was wondering where I was going to finally start this review but now I know: according to the trivia section this was written with one rule in mind: it was not going to be from Jeffrey's point of view.

Dude...if that was your goal, you failed UTTERLY!

This is totally from his point of view. In fact, it feels desperate to make him into the most sympathetic character on screen. Perhaps that's an exaggeration but that was a reason why it took me a while to get round to writing this. I wasn't going to watch it because everyone was talking about it but I had too many direct word of mouth recommendations to not.

Watching this was an odyssey into myself, sort of like Lionel and his own book. I'm not quite sure why I kept making excuses for him. What I saw was a portrait of an individual who, at least at first, was the victim of a callous culture. A better culture than most the world but still intolerant of queer people and where parents either will not or cannot speak candidly with their children.

As we see the very mundane (in the good way) journey of Dahmer into darkness, it is easy to relate to someone who didn't identify well with people (and vice versa) and didn't harmonize with people's strict expectations. His story is one of alienation. It began as a life where he had basically nothing to get excited or passionate about and ultimately was cursed with this one thing that made life more than one long bore.

This is the impression I got from the show. Of course this Jeffrey and real Jeffrey are different people and I have indeed demarcated them in my mind. This is the not the 100% dramatized documentary like Schindler's List or Boys Don't Cry, this feels like just another TV show (albeit a good one). You never forget that it's based on fact which helps with the non-linear (and often meandering) narrative a lot.

Prudently, this sort of begins at the (almost end). We all know there's no real happy ending coming so we get that out of the way and then get straight onto humanizing child-Dahmer.

It is a poignant and bleak tale that (regrettably) isn't above getting a bit sentimental once in a while. It's admirable that they focus on how Jeffrey's crimes are not just his crimes but those of society. Not just through police misconduct but in the culture we leave. He is ultimately liable, I must admit, but considering he gets exactly the punitive measures he deserves, it is difficult to hate this Jeffrey. Like a hurricane that takes many lives and then dissipates the feeling is not anger but a sense of profound tragedy tinged with fear.

Shot with a eerie yellow filter, you get right in Jeffrey's head as an appreciate of the sensual and intimate and as someone who craved connection but couldn't stand the rejection potential of a sentient human.

It's a lot less interesting when we are following anyone who isn't jeff. There's almost no really sympathetic characters hear. The subplot about bad police is pertinent and relevant to the story but was not that interesting to me even though I am part of that ""don't trust the police"" choir.

I thought his neighbour was kind of annoying and obnoxious. Clearly in the right but that's not the point.

146,146,6.0,4 October 2022,"No one will dispute what Dahmer did was morally reprehensible. In dramatising his life, they took pains to illustrate the structural and overt racism that provided the opportunities for Dahmer to escape capture for 13 years and commit many more murders. Ironically, both Netflix and Murphy seem blinded to their own hypocrisy in going through with making this show without due regard for the families of the mostly non-white victims.

The hype surrounding this series is just reaching fever pitch in Australia as the first wave of viewers are now telling others about it. As much as I love true crime, I resisted watching at first because the series is done in poor taste, but curiosity eventually triumphed. The series brings to light certain things I never knew or thought I needed to know about Dahmer. Strangely, the more I learnt about him through the series, the less he seemed the ""monster"" that is in the show's title.

He was clinically diagnosed with borderline and schizotypal personality disorders and psychosis. He has also been called a psychopath and a sociopath. Psychopaths and sociopaths rarely ever show remorse like Dahmer did. Nor would they admit there was anything wrong with them; Dahmer had always known there was something intrinsically different about him. Even though it has not been suggested, I think it is likely that he might have been neurodivergent.

The neurodivergent community would be rightly horrified to be associated with Dahmer. If they were honest with themselves however, they could probably identify with Dahmer's struggles: social awkwardness, the inability to connect with people, the loneliness of being different, the escape into fantasy (and sometimes addiction) to avoid unbearable emotional pain. Unlike most, Dahmer's fantasy unfortunately required people to be dead in order for him to achieve the peculiar kind of control and intimacy that only he craved.","September 21, 2022 (United States)",no one will dispute what dahmer did was morally reprehensible in dramatising his life they took pains to illustrate the structural and overt racism that provided the opportunities for dahmer to escape capture for years and commit many more murders ironically both netflix and murphy seem blinded to their own hypocrisy in going through with making this show without due regard for the families of the mostly nonwhite victims the hype surrounding this series is just reaching fever pitch in australia as the first wave of viewers are now telling others about it as much as i love true crime i resisted watching at first because the series is done in poor taste but curiosity eventually triumphed the series brings to light certain things i never knew or thought i needed to know about dahmer strangely the more i learnt about him through the series the less he seemed the monster that is in the shows title he was clinically diagnosed with borderline and schizotypal personality disorders and psychosis he has also been called a psychopath and a sociopath psychopaths and sociopaths rarely ever show remorse like dahmer did nor would they admit there was anything wrong with them dahmer had always known there was something intrinsically different about him even though it has not been suggested i think it is likely that he might have been neurodivergent the neurodivergent community would be rightly horrified to be associated with dahmer if they were honest with themselves however they could probably identify with dahmers struggles social awkwardness the inability to connect with people the loneliness of being different the escape into fantasy and sometimes addiction to avoid unbearable emotional pain unlike most dahmers fantasy unfortunately required people to be dead in order for him to achieve the peculiar kind of control and intimacy that only he craved,POSITIVE

There are a couple of episodes that are unnecessary, creating a composite character to tell a story that really isn't needed but seems a prerequisite for all movies and tv shows these days.

We do see quite a good deal of the rather more grim elements of the story, the behaviour, but it's been so sensitively crafted that it's impossible not to feel some amount of sadness for Dahmer on elements of his journey in between killings. The loneliness is so expertly depicted. There's one episode that gives us more of a victim POV, I won't say which, that was so beautifully done that, while also exhibiting some additional degree of horror in relation to what happened in the end, that was so beautifully constructed that rather more than horror, I felt an unexpected and considerable sense of grief, even though I knew what was coming.

Anyway, it's almost perfect. Doesn't quite land perfectly at the end, goes on a little long, could have been stripped down to maybe 8 episodes, the ending appearing to drag on a little. Nothing major, it's still all very well done otherwise.

I spent many of the scenes thinking of how would the victims families feel about so much horrific detail in specific scenes. It almost feels exploitative at times of the victims and their families.

On the other hand, I believe it's also one of the best directed and acted (Evan Peters) series I have ever seen. The feel of the show is hard to put into words, Horrifying, Jaw-dropping or Chilling? Either way you cannot stop watching. The Negative reviews about the series being too long or slow are rubbish. Part of the reason the show is rating so highly is due to the depth they go into for some scenes, something that likely wouldn't have been achieved over a series with 4 episode or the like.

His childhood and early adulthood are well documented and other films have been made about his school days such as My Friend Dahmer, and this show references that period in his life to good effect.

Evan Peters is chilling at Jeff Dahmer. I read somewhere that Peters has to take long breaks after filming with Murphy as the characters he often plays are so dark, twisted & vile.... And boy, he plays them so well.

He'll probably have to take a year off after this one... the first episode alone was terrifying!!

165,165,7.0,30 November 2022,"So I almost skipped this because after 2 episodes the story went into gumby mode. If they're getting paid by the video frames I get it but imo they could have produced this in half or a third of the celluloid. Seriously, never thought serial killing could be boring until watching this. Mr Peters is great at his craft and the resemblance is there but this is a fairly one sided character in shallow waters. Most of it is boiler plate, ""sorry dad"" stuff. But most annoying is the ham fisted message that dahmer wasn't caught because he was white. Little mister privileged serial killer who could have been caught so many times if he'd just been born with a different colored skin. I guess the producers never heard of kermit gosnell. How did this guy manage to run his ""house of horrors"" for so long and never get caught except executive privilege. And the producers never sat on the jury I did. The case involved 2 young black men accused of passing bad checks at a bank. The one that actually committed the crime wasn't on trial, but rather turned up to testify for the state and the prosecutor made a point of stating over and over that this young black man came from a good family. His dad, a high ranking police officer and hs mother an administrator with social services. What's that word, 'privilege'. Again, the young black man on the witness stand is the one who committed the crime, and not the one facing the judge. The producers never sat on this jury or listened to 3 days of testimony as the prosecutor laid out the timeline. So what kind of defense did the young black man's attorney put on, who btw was also black. None, nada, nothing. No testimony, no rebuttal, no alternate theories. Just, ""your honor, I rest"". Then in summation when his attorney asked to borrow the multimedia materials the prosecutor put together, I was pretty much dumbfounded and sorry for the defendant but 30 mins to deliberate by a mostly white/brown/not black jury and another young man goes to jail; yeah I felt sorry for him but I also felt he was guilty. Not ironically, I was invited to exactly the same scenario many years later but fortunately I was able to be excused before I had send another black youth to prison. So while the producers might see everything in racial terms, from my personal experience, it's something else entirely. Otherwise how do you explain felony assault on live tv in front of millions of people and not a whiff of prosecution afterwards. And what's up with the guy who killed dahmer in prison. Maybe they should do season 2 all about him; bet it would be a lot more interesting.

I'd only heard of the name, and known that Jeffery Dahmer was serial killer but I didn't know anything else, this turned out to be a ""You need to watch this to believe it!"" kinda story. *smh* The 10ep show, not a movie/doc, is a recreation based on true events and it's about the origins, the period itself, and the fallout of all of the murders carried out by Jeff Dahmer. While doing so, it also throws light on various societal issues because of which these murders continued to happen.

168,168,8.0,26 September 2022,"That's how Jeffrey Dahmer, a man who slaughtered, cut up (and often ate) 17 young men sums up his arrest and indictment. Like many people, I knew the headline of Dahmer's story but little else. This dramatization, starring the great Evan Peters shows the story from the victim's perspective which I found very compelling. In these stories of mass murder, society rarely gets an opportunity to understand the human beings that suffered the most. Sure, we get their stories, but their inner personalities, lives, dreams and motivations in life are never really known.

It's very well done, yes hard to watch, but masterfully directed (four episodes of Season One were directed by Jennifer Lynch). Niecy Nash, always superb, plays Glenda Cleveland, one of Dahmer's neighbors who (in vain) begged the cops to investigate bizarre screams, buzz saws, and the stench coming from Dahmer's apartment. As her character states, ""For years I told you to do something and you did NOTHING."" Nash is simply superb in this role.

Stories are told from at least 10 instances where this monster was nearly caught but time after time, released. Inept cops and judges that give him a pass are simply astounding. So if the father, who makes everything about him.

As always, Richard Jenkins delivers a perfect performance (as the senior Dahmer) Molly Ringwald, Penelope Ann Miller and Michael Learned skillfully play other Dahmer women.

176,176,1.0,30 September 2022,"Incredibly disturbing and gut-wrenching to watch, this rather different portrayal of the Jeffrey Dahmer story makes it the best of what there already is. Despite what you already know about this very gritty case and the movies or documentaries you've seen on it throughout the years, this series won't fail to leave you deeply disturbed but truly stunned. There are some common factual errors, but there's a lot that covers it, such as excellent performances from Evan Peters whose made to look just like the serial killer, as well as bloody fantastic work from supporting actors Richard Jenkins and Niecy Nash. The way this series tells Jeffrey Dahmer's story is incredibly unique and very admirable as well, by focusing on the killer's monstrous backstory and upbringing, the murder victims themselves and the loved ones or others surrounding the Jeffrey Dahmer case, all whilst frequently jumping back and forth in time. There is some really good tension in the first episode, followed by a later episode that's almost completely silent as it looks through the eyes of a deaf victim, and some very disturbing scenes that'll make you want to look away. It's also worth noting that this series doesn't glamourise the monster or other serial killers, as it just portrays the story in an extremely tough, yet powerful way.

177,177,8.0,24 September 2024,"I don't usually review the shows that I watch but, having followed the Menendez Brothers' case over the years, seeing as I was only a child when it actually happened, I feel that Ryan Murphy took a lot of liberties when it came to writing their story to screen. I feel that Mr Murphy took a lot of creative liberties especially when it came to the dynamics of the brothers and their closeness. I don't believe they Erik and Lyle were, at any point in their lives, in an incestuous relationship, like what was being hinted at during the nine episode run.

The acting was top notch, cinematography was amazing and you really felt like both the leads did the story justice.

178,178,9.0,26 September 2022,"Dahmer is one of those shows which, once you start, you're hard pressed to stop until the end. I watched it in two 5-episode sessions over two days, and everything about it was excellent! The atmosphere of dread and filth, the haunting theme song, and the continued unpredictability carries the story from start to finish. The crimes themselves aren't even the ""star"" of the show as much as the acting, writing, and constant tension wondering what will happen next. Have I mentioned the acting is top notch?

Having never heard the Jeffrey Dahmer story, everything was new to me. But after looking up some details and interviews afterwords, the facts seem to be accurately portrayed here.

Not for the faint of heart, I highly recommend this show to anyone interested in a worthy telling of the Jeffrey Dahmer story.","September 21, 2022 (United States)",dahmer is one of those shows which once you start youre hard pressed to stop until the end i watched it in two episode sessions over two days and everything about it was excellent the atmosphere of dread and filth the haunting theme song and the continued unpredictability carries the story from start to finish the crimes themselves arent even the star of the show as much as the acting writing and constant tension wondering what will happen next have i mentioned the acting is top notch having never heard the jeffrey dahmer story everything was new to me but after looking up some details and interviews afterwords the facts seem to be accurately portrayed here not for the faint of heart i highly recommend this show to anyone interested in a worthy telling of the jeffrey dahmer story,POSITIVE
179,179,8.0,11 October 2022,"So, the early episodes are dramatically very strong, if you can manage the non-chronological storytelling. All the acting is top-notch and characters are well developed.

For the writers, I wonder if they think we are empty vessels, waiting to be filled with hit-over-head Social Justice narratives? The semi-fictional reimagining of the (nevertheless highly commendable) neighbour Glenda Cleveland, who did not live in the same building as Dahmer, is just the beginning. The real adjacent neighbours, the Bass's, are written out as I guess they did not fit the narrative. The two cops who failed to act on Ms Cleveland's phone call, were not given an award.

My sense now is that, at least for a generation, all US-produced drama will now be part entertainment and part activist lesson-telling. And therefore, more than ever, viewers will need to see such ""based on true story"" drama as just that - ""based on"" then embellished or fictionalised. Maybe it always was. Just that 20 years ago, the embellishments were for dramatic purposes, and now they are to educate us on Social Justice.

So watch the series, then read the fact-check articles and think for yourself. How much was Dahmer ""allowed"" to commit his crime by racists cops? Was his choice of victims racist?

Dahmer has a completely different feel from the all previous shows. The tension builds nicely from the start and it heavily depends on the story telling by not going for cheap thrills and keeping the gore to a minimum.

184,184,8.0,1 October 2022,"Richard Jenkins and Evan Peters are fantastic in this dark and intriguing recreation of Dahmer's evil yet sad life. A must watch for anyone interested in serial killers or Jeffery Dahmer.

Episodes 1 to 5 are binge worthy and captivating. It's 6 onwards the reality unfortunately becomes fiction and we get back to the 2022 everything has to push a political narrative. In this case like many others a false narrative. Skip episode 7 entirely and you'd of done yourself a favour. Facts of history are changed to push the point of view that Dahmer was allowed to carry on because of racism in the police force.

Reality is most serial killers could of been stopped earlier even those that only killed white people believe it or not. If the police hadn't made mistakes during their investigations. Anyone that knows anything on the subject will be aware of this. It's unfortunate that the police are only human. Mistakes are made. And it's not always about skin colour.

This show could of been a solid 10 for me if they left the laughable false racism narrative at the door and just focused on Dahmer's life. It's an 8 for episode 1-5. Would of been a 10 overall if 6-10 weren't partly fiction.","September 21, 2022 (United States)",richard jenkins and evan peters are fantastic in this dark and intriguing recreation of dahmers evil yet sad life a must watch for anyone interested in serial killers or jeffery dahmer episodes to are binge worthy and captivating its onwards the reality unfortunately becomes fiction and we get back to the everything has to push a political narrative in this case like many others a false narrative skip episode entirely and youd of done yourself a favour facts of history are changed to push the point of view that dahmer was allowed to carry on because of racism in the police force reality is most serial killers could of been stopped earlier even those that only killed white people believe it or not if the police hadnt made mistakes during their investigations anyone that knows anything on the subject will be aware of this its unfortunate that the police are only human mistakes are made and its not always about skin colour this show could of been a solid for me if they left the laughable false racism narrative at the door and just focused on dahmers life its an for episode would of been a overall if werent partly fiction,POSITIVE
185,185,7.0,20 November 2022,"Dahmer is a well made series. It is shockingly accurate and does not spare its audience from the disturbing murders that happened. Evan Peters steals the show in this series and is the embodiment of Jeffrey Dahmer from his voice, mannerisms and acting. His portrayal is so accurate it is creepy and dark watching Jeffrey in action. From the first episode we are given a dark window into the life of this serial killer and it is beyond disturbed. The timeline and pacing is interesting, they start off with him getting caught and work backwards from that event. This works nicely. You feel sympathy and sadness for his victims but not Jeffrey, he is pure evil.

My only criticisms would be I felt Netflix could have shortened this by an episode or two. The heart of the show was his awful deeds which then could have been wrapped up in 2 further episodes. So 8 episodes overall instead of dragging it out to 10. We didn't need to see an episode devoted to Glenda, they already gave her plenty of screen time. Overall not a bad series and I can see why it got so much attention.

186,186,2.0,25 November 2022,"My review has no spoilers, I will just let you know how I feel about this show. This show is a special one, there is so much attention to detail! I've seen all the movies that have been released about Jeffrey Dahmer but none was as good, as accurate and as passionate as this show. Peters was absolutely convincing as Jeffrey Dahmer, giving some extraordinary performances. What you will see in the show is not a 100% accurate but most things are actually based on the real events, which makes the show much more intense, brutal, tragic and dramatic, sometimes you will get a horror vibe. This show is not for everyone, only adults who can stomach this kind of theme should watch it!

While there is pretty much no gore in the show it still is very dark and many times it will make you feel sick, to me responsible for that is mostly Evan Peters and his performance but all the other actors do an amazing job as well. Many shows and movies have tried to get inside the head of a monster/psychopath but they fail. Well this show actually did it successfully! You will feel like you are inside Dahmer's head, you will be able to see the world the way he sees the world. Evan Peters proves once again that he is one of the best actors of our time.

189,189,10.0,4 October 2022,"True It's very well done and realistic which makes it all the more disturbing even though some unnecessary liberties were taken.

STORY The story is about Jeff Dahmer a conficted serial killer who was genuine brutal in these heinous acts. Mostly it's real, although the well spoken real Jeff as seen in his interviews is barely visible mostly we see an awkward TV version of him with fitting dialogue.

ANALYSIS It's a chilling but very interesting watch that dives into the backstory of Jeff. A viewer discretion warning seems appropriate here. But for those that are continuing after the somewhat shocking events of the first episode a true gripping story awaits. The first episode is near perfection. But it ads a lot of made up family dialogue in the following episodes. Towards the last 2-3 episodes, the series tries to reinvent itself and turn into a civil rights discussion. Whilst the topics being inserted are important topics, the way that it is done feels abrupt and bolted on as and afterthought. It also speaks on another infamous person on the end which reminds me of the inclusion of the Nun and the Crooked Man in horror franchises by Warner Bros. A service to the network to plug for another series.

Acting: 10/10 all actors are doing really well. Evan Peters as the titular role's performance is award worthy for its screenplay, even though it lacks the easy talking elements that the real Dahmer has show in recordings and interviews..

Visuals/Costumes (Decor): 9/10 very 90s the outfits take you back to the era.

Musical Score: the background goes really well with the atmosphere. Aside from that make hits from the era are accompanying the scenes and characters which

Liberties taken: there a lot of emphasis on Jeffs obsession with meat, and less on his human side. It is a though balance to make when producing anything on the topic. Humanizing the perpetrator whilst many people fell victim to horrible crimes.

Jeffrey is totally awkward throughout, only in the 6th episode we get the see a more balanced view. In real life there are videos of him being well spoken which explains better how guys were falling for him. Also when it comes to the activities that happened in the bathhouses the amount in real life are much higher. Some of the scenes are almost exactly copied from what happened, whilst some facts like the neighbour lady living next door instead of in another building are made up, this also applied to some of the stories of the victims.

It seems like the reality would have been enough in these situations.

End word: Netflix is here to entertain and make money. And there is a big of an ethical question that will probably always arise when we speak about productions on real life horror stories of murders. But at the end of the day. These stories will find there way to the public and at least in this format the story is told well.

As much as it has something disturbing about it. The story will make it's way to the public. And this story seem more complete then people hearing only details. And for that I will recommend it to anyone intrigued by the topic. Just one final warning, it's really not for the fainthearted ones amongst us. Just whenever you think you are just watching the story unfold 'stuff' happens. And if you really want to figure out the true story, watch a documentary on it on YouTube or elsewhere.

They do a really bad job of making you feel sympathetic to the victims, although you can tell they're trying so hard, to the point where they had to embellish the story. No need to do that. Just tell the story accurately, so someone can watch this ten years from now and this would still feel relevant.

I'm not sure why Netflix can't just produce a historically accurate series.

We are human, we want to know... I understand that technically this was not that long ago and families of the victims are reacting strongly to this series.

I do believe this was one of the better bio pics of a serial killer. I also feel that the way we were introduced and educated about some of his victims back stories was a very brave thing to do, it also added to the whole trauma of the series.

Whether you like it or not Dahmer is and always will be an historical figure. Not all historical figures are good ones, and it is from history that we learn.

We can't strike their existence from history as much as some might want too.

The acting in this series is superb.

And I have to admit that yes at times I felt bad for Dahmer. No body asks to be born that way = completely soulless.

197,197,8.0,26 September 2022,"I won't simply repeat what is being said here by far better reviewers, but yes, Evan Peters deserves an Emmy for this, only because the show is not eligible for the Academy Awards. The other characters were all real. I didn't see anyone ""acting."" The show is creepy, disturbing, and frightening, even if you know the story, and I do.

Suffice to say that I was 20 years old in 1978, a part of the gay community in Chicago, and remember this entire case quite well. Jeffrey Dahmer was EXACTLY as you see him on screen in this series -- Peters nailed it to a fault. Those here saying that he appeared to be an automaton, or stupidly, he had no character arc, WAS Dahmer. He had very little human affect to him. He was robotic, and although I won't try to place blame, in hindsight, his mother's drug use during pregnancy may have been a contributing factor, and his father didn't really come around to being demonstrative with Jeffrey until after his crimes were found out, but again, no actual blame to either of them for what Jeffrey Dahmer did. He did what he did all on his own.

The writers were not kind to anyone except the people that tried to expose and stop Dahmer before he was finally caught. The Milwaukee police of 1991 were taken down handily, and although that Officers of the Year ceremony didn't happen, it merely drives home the fact that the police homophobia and AIDSaphobia, and blatant racism contributed A LOT to Dahmer being able to have the killing spree he did.

I highly recommend this series, but make sure you have 10 hours free because it's doubtful you'll be able to break away from it once you start. Although I didn't find any ""wokeness"" in this series, if you happen to be one of those red-pillers, you might, because you'll be looking for it. Don't do that. It's not really there. Calling something ""woke"" is code for ""this makes me feel uncomfortable because I know it's all true, and that makes me feel icky, but I'm not allowed to show it."" Everything is not a comic book.

Couple of comments: this mini-series comprises Season 2 of ""Monster"", created by Ryan Murphy. I did not watch Season 1 (""The Jeffrey Dahmer Story"") but Season 2 came up in conversation over lunch with a friend, and he told me how much he is enjoying this. So I gave it a try, and SURPRISE (not!), I liked this quite a bit. In fact, I was very surprised how much it turns out I didn't know about what went down with the Menedez brothers. Javier Bardem and Chloey Sevigny are masterful in their roles as the parents. Nicolas Alexander Chavez (as Lyle) and Cooper Koch are an outright revelation (at least for me), and surely we have not seen the last of them. Check out in particular Episode 5, which features a wide-tanging discussion between Erik and his lawyer lasting about 35 minutes, and filmed in one uninterrupted single take.

199,199,8.0,8 October 2022,"It doesn't matter how well-crafted or well acted a show is. None of that matters when the show revolves around the martyrization of one of the most repulsive people on Earth.

Film is supposed to serve a purpose, and this show serves none other than motivating people like Dahmer to take action on their ill fantasies: ""Look at this guy, he's just like me and they made a whole Netflix show about him... maybe I'm not so weird after all.""

Anyone mentally sane will get no benefit from watching this show. We all know mental illness is a thing, we all know bad parenting is bad. We don't need a necrophile cannibal to teach us. While people like Jeffrey Dahmer should simply be forgotten, not only does the show remind the world he existed (I'd never heard of him before), but it goes as far as making him look like the victim. Almost as if you, the viewer, should feel guilty for being part of that same society that made him who he was.

To add insult to injury, the victims' real names weren't changed, and it appears that the victims' families weren't even notified about the show's production, let alone asked for permission to use their names and likeness for a profit, which I think is borderline illegal.

207,207,8.0,22 September 2022,"""Dahmer - Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story"" is a 10 episodes Netflix mini-series about Jeffrey Dahmer. Dahmer is easily in the top 10 most interesting serial killers. A very complex man and his prison interview was fascinating.

This is the third non-documentary movie/series I'm seeing about Jeffrey Dahmer and I think it's fair to say it's the most accurate. Evan Peters is doing a very good job as Dahmer and the production gave a lot of attention to details.

210,210,8.0,21 September 2022,"My initial rating based on episode 1 was a 9; but now that I've seen them all my opinion has changed significantly.

If I had to rate the show itself, at least my by IMDb show standards, it would be somewhere between a 7 and 8. The only good reason to watch this is to see Richard Jenkins' performance as Dahmer's father, because it's some incredible acting.

The show itself is so... confused. It doesn't seem to know what it wants to do. On one hand it's trying to appeal to true crime fans that want to watch and hear about the most lurid and disgusting stuff imaginable. It wants to be a show about the philosophical implications of a person like Dahmer even existing. It wants to talk about the psychological conditions that bring about people like him. And it wants to do some social commentary about the police, racial issues.

As you can imagine, it does none of this, because it doesn't have a focus. So what you've got is the first half that just feels like a personal story of Dahmer's, and the second which is like some boring, cliched drama about the families and the fallout of what's happened.

As other reviews were asking, what is the purpose of this story? Was it to cover Dahmer? That's been done before, and it's not like it appeals to such a huge audience. Was it to explore philosophical questions of good and evil or maybe talk about policing issues in some places? Probably way better cases you could work with if that's your intent.

The reason I'm giving it a 5 rather than a 7 is because the moral messages this show conveys aren't just twisted, they're also hypocritical. It celebrates Dahmer's death at the hand of some lunatic as if that's some great deed. It tries to say that it's a bad thing that some stupid comic featuring Dahmer wasn't banned, even as this show VERY GRATUITOUSLY depicts the killing of his real victims. Like, what?... It's pretending to be this respectful quasi-documentary that's imparting valuable lessons when it's anything but. It's damning what a hubristic view these creators have of themselves.

212,212,10.0,23 October 2022,"With a degree in psychology, I've studied cases like Dahmer's and seen many of the docs offered. My first reaction is this series wants to focus on all the minutia from the first nflx doc where they interviewed the paralegal who recorded all those audio tapes. It follows it pretty closely and actually is not as gruesome, focusing more on the interaction with the victims. I hope they paid Peters a very high salary for not only accepting this role but for his amazing performance.

I feel the film focuses too much on some details that we can ascertain in 45 seconds instead of 3 min. But that's part of the new normal in psychological drama.

My biggest complaint is the extreme focus on Glenda and the unfortunate use of Nash, who comes off as a comedian no matter what the character she plays.

I noticed a lot of reviews claim it turns into libiberal fest (can't use tribigerber words here anymore). But having lived in that time -- in fact being born the same year as Dhamer -- I can say this depicts true situations. I've seen a lot of feedback on films claiming they insert things when really it's just depicting the times. Especially since this is a true story, it is depicting actual events that were, unfortunately, much more common than just this situation.

A psych student states that Dahmer was ill, not evil and I have to strongly disagree that there's any difference. It's common for those studying human psychology to mix up the fact that one deserves compassion with the idea that they were not intentionally evil. Law enforcement and the courts do make the differentiation of whether one understood their actions were illegal, and that definition is not a psychological definition, that's true. We can recognize that Hitler, Stalin, and Bin Laden were just humans struggling with some physical or environmental deficiencies or imposed beliefs but the acts they committed were still evil; whether in the psychological or biblical sense could be up for debate.

And speaking of environmental, Dahmer's environment is not what caused this. Many kids grow up shooting and skinning animals and they don't kill people. But many children do have enormous emotional and psychological trauma from neglect by a parent. Severe abuse includes neglect/lack of bonding or touching and causes a child to withdraw and numb while still craving human interaction. These are the ingredients for a psychopath. Less than 2% of psychopaths become serial killers. Some believe diet can actually help but that's probably 20 years out when society understands the effects of food on self-control and mood/behavior.

Overall a good watch but did fall off the rails the last few episodes like there was a different writer; way too much focus on Glenda with borderline comical acting from Nash. This may be why some viewers feel there was a bent toward focusing on the lack of response from the LE. But in fairness, Glenda did continuously try to get someone over to investigate.

215,215,10.0,21 September 2024,"The actor who plays 'the younger brother' Eric seems to be an older and much more mature person than the actor cast as 'the older brother' Lyle. I can understand casting the best person/actor/talent for the job to a degree (which I would say they did with Eric) but when there's supposed to be a dynamic of older brother/younger vulnerable brother which is based on real life events, it is awkward in my opinion to cast an obviously older actor as the younger brother.

216,216,8.0,24 October 2022,"Overall this show is great and well-made. It has great acting, a compelling story, great casting.

But I don't understand why they insist on so many shows being shown out of order nowadays. This series would have been so much better if it was told in chronological order. Instead, it felt like they took a bunch of clips of the show, shuffled the order up, and showed them to you in a random order. It drove me absolutely crazy. It got to the point where I was constantly lost about where we were in the story's chronology, trying to piece together what happened when. And the first episode gave away the ending immediately, so instead of wondering how it would play out and where it was going the rest of the show was just like filling in gaps.

I suspect so many shows are done this way now so that they can try to hook you with something really compelling by telling you the most interesting in the first episode. That way you don't start to watch it and give up.

It gives a lot of information about Jeffrey Dahmer and the things that he did ... I can't believe what he got away with! The show really does replicate (as close as possible) to what actually happened and it really is shocking what a human can even do..... and what people have suffered from his doings!!

Evan Peters gave a magnificent performance ... He should definitely get an award for his acting.

219,219,10.0,23 September 2022,"I enjoyed this show, however I'm just not sold on the robotic and monotonous performance by Evan Peters. Statements from the neighbors and acquaintances of Jeffrey Dahmer describe him as someone who appears normal. Evan Peters in his role as Jeffrey Dahmer on the other hand, comes across as a complete creep from the very first sentence. The slow deliverance of his lines without showing any kind of emotion is just not how a normal person would speak, and I highly doubt someone would be able to convince so many people to come over to his place by speaking in that manner.

However, the different viewpoints from victims and neighbors keep the show interesting in my opinion, albeit a little slow at times.

I hate to say it but this is 2 different shows. The first 6 eps are some of the best television I've seen in years. Dark, brutal and in many ways real. Episode 6 on its own is a masterpiece - watch it.

Ep 7-10 is a overcooked, netflix central trying to give to much emotion, focusing on side characters when they audience get it and doesn't need to be told how other people feel. That part is obvious. It would have had much more impact 2-3 eps less.

222,222,6.0,2 October 2024,"I have no interest in Jeffrey Dahmer, so I didn't watch Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story. A series about the Menendez brothers, on the other hand, is something that I want to check out. Thus, this review is focused on Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story, and I'm approaching it as if it's a completely separate series-because it should be treated that way, much like The Haunting of Hill House and The Haunting of Bly Manor.

This series was tantalizing, irresistible, and highly entertaining. Ryan Murphy clearly knows how to craft a dynamic story, and he didn't hold back in this well-constructed dramatized account. His intent was to show multiple perspectives and let viewers interpret the crime and its causes for themselves, and he does this beautifully.

Murphy's story-telling approach effectively channeled the sensationalism of the media spectacle surrounding the Menendez trial. The downside, of course, is that this sensationalism often comes at the expense of the real-life tragedy-the victims and their family.

Murphy aside, the cast were the real stars, beginning with Nicholas Alexander Chavez and Cooper Koch, who delivered chilling and mesmerizing performances as Lyle and Erik Menendez. However, for me, the standout was Ari Graynor as defense attorney Leslie Abramson. Her portrayal was solid, sharp, and hard-hitting.

All in all, as a piece of entertainment, this series works because of its stellar cast and fascinating storytelling.

I felt deep emotion watching this - there is not a bad performance in it with Evan Peters Nicey Nash and Richard Jenkins being of course the standouts.

It's kind of weird to write a review about the series knowing that this truly happened and the victims weren't just actors. They weren't just a role-play. They were real people with loving families, breathing, living, hoping.

The others did a great job as well.

And all thanks to a great directing job and to the actor Evan Peters, who has achieved an incredible interpretation worthy of creating terror to the viewer.

We can observe human cruelty in its maximum splendor, but the series proposes us to see it from different types of perspectives, both of the murderer and the victims. At no time does it try to justify Dahmer's criminal acts, but rather it proposes us to think about whether his psychopathic behavior was due to certain factors such as a difficult life in his childhood or simply having a neurological problem or both.

Perhaps many parents will see this and understand that the education of a child is not just giving him food and taking him to school, it is also important to give him attention, and that is what the series shows us.

Every actors has lit up the series with their display. Jeffrey Dahmer is played by Evan Peters and he is outstanding. He gives that serial killer vibe.

Series makes you indulge in itself. Jeffrey Dahmer's story revolves around how he turned into a serial killer. The timeline changes between each scene due to the non-chronological presentation of the story. I like this way of representing a story. We see the event first and then it unfolds itself about how it happened.

Unfortunately, after a few episodes of decent story (but subpar acting), the series goes downhill rapidly. Instead of a story about Jeffrey Dahmer, it becomes a typical Netflix production that focuses on politics and race.

You'll be lectured about AIDS and told in one episode that it impacts churchgoers more than the gay community. Then, the story will shift into a focus on race. You know the drill with Netflix by now: White people bad and Black people good.

If that's not enough for you, wait until you have to watch an entire episode with no sound because the director thinks it's important for you to experience the episode as if you were deaf.

260,260,3.0,3 October 2022,"I knew about the story of Jeffrey Dahmer and was therefore very afraid about watching this show. I thought it would be too disturbing and it took me a couple of days to decide to give it a try, convinced I wouldn't get past the first episode.

Well, I have to say I got through the whole series and enjoyed it quite a bit. Well done, never boring, a great show. I even found myself eating ice cream while watching it.

Because I knew the story and was able to eat ice cream while watching it I substracted a couple of points to the voting I would have given it had it been a work of fiction.

I find the producers used the power of attraction that such an infamous serial killer has, to sell a show that wasn't really his story, let alone the story of his victims. If this show was to honor what really happened, very few people would have been able to sit through the whole thing. In this 10 hour long episodes series there was less information about why Jeffery Dahmer became so notorious than in a two page article of any magazine. It really is difficult to even imagine a more nightmarish way to die than what these men went through, but in the show it's only hinted if not hidden. I found especially disrespectful a scene where the victim's families discuss suing some media for using a distorted vision of Jeffery Dahmer to sell magazines when the show featuring this event was doing exactly the same. I can only imagine what a slap in the face it must be for these people to watch this scene, almost ridiculing them.

Also I will say that in the show I even liked Jeffrey, he seemed kind of funny and darling. Almost just a tad naughty.

On the other hand, I did think they did a good job portraying the attitude of law enforcement and the role that prejudice must have played in this tragedy. As well I found compelling the depiction of the journey of Jeffery Dahmer's neighbor. How terrifying it must have been for her. It shows an angle from these stories we don't often think about.

Another thing that bothered me was the constant time jumps. It didn't make any sense. And then they mixed in some political stuff about race, even though Dahmer also killed white and a latino men. And of course it's all the (white) police fault, according to Netflix. It's true that the police made some horrible mistakes, but of course Netflix had to portray some pure evil white cops.

And the last two episodes get totally ridiculous. They make a charicature of the christian faith. No pastor would ever say 'congratulations, your sins are forgiven' after you're baptized. 'cause that's not what baptism does. Yes, it symbolizes it. But if you don't believe that Jesus died for you, then there's no forgiveness of sins. So, this show is kind of ridiculing the christian faith by telling that Dahmer just gets his peace with God for going down in a bath.

Third, many scenes are just unnecessary. They do not add any value or clarity. Taken out, they wouldn't leave gaps in the story.

The events are not shown chronologically, which could be confusing for certain people, but I thought it was a great creative decision considering some of Jeffrey's killings are not as interesting as other's (still absolutely horrible and victims shouldn't be overlooked), they did a great job at making the whole show interesting.

273,273,9.0,24 February 2023,"I realise at the end that it's focussing equally on the victims.

A lot of these shows come to be about the serial killer and even I've wondered about the injustice in that, since the people who died and their families are the ones who are worst affected.

This one tries to take the focus away from that. You sympathise with the families, you get to know some of the victims and even feel awful at their deaths (one of them the most).

All in all the show was very very slow and boring. But it's fine. I don't think this is one of those series that can be swept aside saying it's boring or even worse, revered because it's entertaining.

This one had a more complex overview of the entire situation, instead of a monotonous investigation+chase feel that The Night Stalker has.

I remember feeling effed up after The Night Stalker because... *Shrugs * He wasn't human.

'Dahmer' provides an intriguing perspective into a killer's crooked mentality, it sheds some light on his corrupted senses of what might be wrong and what might be right!

Albeit the same parameters of judgment often got flooded with contradictory notions and a lack of respect and sympathy towards all the victims and their families. I noticed many had already spoken against the glorifying aspects of this particular portrayal and how it tries to instill empathy for the wrongdoer and I hereby raise my voice as well.

You shouldn't at any expense glorify a vicious criminal like Jeffrey L. Dahmer. Yes, you can create Documentaries all you want; matter of fact, you should show us what exactly made him an aberration, inform other parents about the red flags, about the 'signs' they should be looking for in their children and their recurrent misdemeanors. But don't try to romanticize this stuff, trust me when I say this, there will be consequences beyond your control.

I recommend taking some time off and watching something else when it gets tough. I myself usually binge shows, but with this - for me it wasn't possible.

That being said, it is a beautiful telling of a real and gruesome serial killer - his unspeakable actions and its repercussions. The Dahmer family, the victims families, the police, every angle is tackled masterfully.

Excellent camera work, especially the absurd close-close ups that makes you feel trapped in the room with Jeff. It really gets under your skin...

Lastly, perfect casting! The writing is d*mn good, so ofcourse that helps (Worth noting: some of it is actual words spoken during the real events). But, Evan Peters as Jeffrey Dahmer gets the mannerisms and body movement just right. And it is astonishing with the way he manages to get the tone of Jeff's voice heard on interviews spot on. He's balancing on a razor blade and he's locked in! His performance have been covered widely, but i couldn't help mentioning it.

At ten episodes it's too long to tell this story unless it had more focus on the victims and their story, especially the Laotian family who had two brothers victimized by Dahmer. More development of victims story could have made this more interesting and less disturbing, but more importantly made this about telling the victims story.

295,295,6.0,1 October 2023,"Extremely well-acted, written, and directed series. Presenting Dahmer's case in a thoroughly cohesive and provocative way. Jumping around the chronology of the events sheds light on many other controversies. Such as how he could get away with this for so long and his whole ambiguous reasoning for continuing on despite being acutely aware of what monster he had become.

It is so curious to see through the internet the assertive cries of people who cannot understand why this series was made. The morbid fascination with serial killers and true crime in general isn't anything new. Be it pure fiction or based on true events, particularly here, it's the bellows of people who think Dahmer is being glorified and the victims' families are being lacerated by the sheer existence of this series, and we need to wait for the Ed Gein era for Dahmer where no one who was alive would give a damn and his entire profile becomes public domain folklore.

The fact that a new piece of Dahmer media comes out every few years doesn't bother anyone. No, it's the fact that it's Netflix's biggest hit since Stranger Things; that's the issue people are at odds with.

296,296,9.0,31 December 2022,"Dahmer - Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story is a Netflix mini-series created by Ryan Murphy. Evan Peters definitely deserves awards for his role as Dahmer. The storyline follows the true life events of Dahmer from his days as a young boy when his father played by Richard Jenkins would take him fishing and dissect road killed animals. His mother Shari was played by Molly Ringwald used to take painkillers and other drugs during her pregnancy with Dahmer.

297,297,7.0,31 May 2023,"Dahmer is a new crime series that explores the life of the infamous serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer.

The show is well-watched, but it lacks some aspects.

The acting is pretty much good, with Evan Peters delivering a terrifying performance in the lead role.

The series also showcases the psychological and emotional struggle that Dahmer went through, which is the interesting aspect of the series.

However, the pace of the show can be slow at times, and some scenes feel repetitive.

Additionally the series does not delve deep enough into the stories of the victims, which is a big missed opportunity

Overall, Dahmer is a good crime series worth watching if you are interested in true crime stories. However, it is not an innovative series and does not offer anything new to the genre.","September 21, 2022 (United States)",dahmer is a new crime series that explores the life of the infamous serial killer jeffrey dahmer the show is wellwatched but it lacks some aspects the acting is pretty much good with evan peters delivering a terrifying performance in the lead role the series also showcases the psychological and emotional struggle that dahmer went through which is the interesting aspect of the series however the pace of the show can be slow at times and some scenes feel repetitive additionally the series does not delve deep enough into the stories of the victims which is a big missed opportunity overall dahmer is a good crime series worth watching if you are interested in true crime stories however it is not an innovative series and does not offer anything new to the genre,POSITIVE

299,299,6.0,9 October 2022,"""Dahmer"" is an interesting character study about loneliness, compulsion, and control. The actor who plays Dahmer capture's the character's sense of humiliation and dominance in his quiet, heavy breathing and dead eye stares.

I quite liked the relationship portrayed between Dahmer and his father, which is troubled and sincere, depicting a father who did his best but also may have damaged his son, though unintentionally and without malice.

When the focus shifted off Dahmer and his immediate family, I believe the show began to unravel as the other characters just do not come across as nuanced or as strong. Respect to the victim's families, but I believe there should instead be a different show that can make a fuller effort at getting to know who was impacted.

I did decide to skip through most of the series. I do think ""Dahmer"" is two kinds of tv shows in one, which did not quite work for me, and made the series seem overlong.

I do take issue with the 'vengeful god' death at the end. When you do a series about a serial killer, you kind of have to put aside trying to force a moral perspective. And it felt like the end tried to force that moral lens. So as a viewer to me that felt like an imposition, and like signposting.

Anyway the parts that is a psychological study, I appreciate. The parts that are signposting, I tuned out. That's probably unfortunate as there is legitimate issues brought to light. However, repeating a message in the same way tends to do that. I did appreciate the message the first time though.","September 21, 2022 (United States)",dahmer is an interesting character study about loneliness compulsion and control the actor who plays dahmer captures the characters sense of humiliation and dominance in his quiet heavy breathing and dead eye stares i quite liked the relationship portrayed between dahmer and his father which is troubled and sincere depicting a father who did his best but also may have damaged his son though unintentionally and without malice when the focus shifted off dahmer and his immediate family i believe the show began to unravel as the other characters just do not come across as nuanced or as strong respect to the victims families but i believe there should instead be a different show that can make a fuller effort at getting to know who was impacted i did decide to skip through most of the series i do think dahmer is two kinds of tv shows in one which did not quite work for me and made the series seem overlong i do take issue with the vengeful god death at the end when you do a series about a serial killer you kind of have to put aside trying to force a moral perspective and it felt like the end tried to force that moral lens so as a viewer to me that felt like an imposition and like signposting anyway the parts that is a psychological study i appreciate the parts that are signposting i tuned out thats probably unfortunate as there is legitimate issues brought to light however repeating a message in the same way tends to do that i did appreciate the message the first time though,POSITIVE

306,306,10.0,19 October 2022,"I give it a 10, mostly because of Evan Peters, but the show as a whole is outstanding! I have seen Evan act before in X-Men, Kickass, AHS and some more productions, but this one is a performence of a lifetime if you ask me. I have also studied Dahmer before, as I am fascinated by forensic psychology. You can feel the amount of hard work that was put into perfecting the performance and you can feel it in every scene, every line and in every breath that Peters takes. No other show had ever had that much of an impact on me while watching it. It took me about 3 hours to recover from episode 4. The nausea, fear and depression that it had brought onto me was mind-blowing and a bit overwhelming. I had believed that I was immune to such content, having seen and read so many things about serial killers already, but this show has to be an exception.

I don't think that it is something you can watch purely for entertainment. It tells a true story and the people who have lived it are still alive. It is serious food for thought as it proceeds to show many problems that still can be seen in society. It explains what could have contributed to Dahmer becoming a killer, but in a way that doesn't let him off the hook. Even despite his early years triggering some sympathy, at least in me. However, it does portray his victims as more than just his victims. They are shown as people who are to this day loved dearly and missed and who did not deserved to be killed.

Loved it, especially the 6th episode. The acting is on point, kudos to the guy playing Tony. The Jefferey Dahmer story is honestly a masterpiece, but only for people who are mature enough to draw the appropriate conclusions.

I've read a couple of books about JD, and seen all the interviews on YouTube, and I can assure you that factually this drama has it mostly spot on. Obviously due to the subject nature, it's dark and horrific, but if you can deal with that (or like myself - enjoy it!) - you are in for one helluva ride. It's slow, for sure, but I'm totally OK with that.

And the Emmy Award goes to.... Evan Peters for his portrayal of the man himself. Stunning piece of acting. He really does create the character of Dahmer - to the point that I actually almost felt sorry for the guy. He really does make him human, as opposed to just a cardboard cutout of a monster. And that is not easy to do. Also Niecy Nash must get a mention playing JDs long suffering neighbour. And of course, Richard Jenkins never disappoints - I remember first seeing him back in the 80s in The Witches of Eastwick with Jack Nicholson, and he was great in that.

321,321,10.0,19 October 2022,"Dahmer is a very well made and well acted dramatisation of the life of Jeffrey Dahmer, as if there wasn't a character that Evan Peters couldn't portray but overall it was hard work to watch and not because of the unpleasant subject matter. The series bounces around exploring Dahmer's life as a young man, his serial killer years and then his life in prison, it also focuses on

The first thing that irks me about the series is that it skirts around the more horrific, gory details. That in itself isn't a bad thing but it means that you don't really get the feeling for what a monster Dahmer was and as such there are times you almost start feeling bad for him, the lack of horrific detail also means it can get quite repetitive with each case almost identical. He goes to a club, picks up generally a gay black individual and drugs them (it's then just implied that the person is killed and disposed of).

The second thing is that it feels very slow paced and drawn out with lots of scenes largely irrelevant in the grand scheme of things. The episode featuring Tony (Silenced) was excellent it gives you a feel for the victim beforehand, as you get to see his life and build a connection before he is eventually introduced to Dahmer and the inevitable happens but the following episode focusing on his neighbour (Cassandra) feels very repetitive and unnecessary, in the opening episode we see her shouting and screaming at the police that she has been warning them for ages about Jeff, this is enough to set the scenario and having multiple scenes about her complaining about the smell and the noise just feels excessive (as a viewer, we get it).

322,322,10.0,27 September 2022,"If you know the story of Jeffrey Dahmer, there are no spoilers. If you don't, there are spoilers in my review.

A must watch, great acting, in a true story about an evil human being that walked the earth scot-free for a awful long time before he got caught.

The Dahmer story in ten gutwrenching episodes. The failure of the police to follow up on calls that were made by his neighbour Glenda Cleveland. The neighbour that was dismissed a thousand times and had they listened, there could have, would have, should have been less victims.

There is some great acting by Evan Peters because at no point you feel bad for Dahmer, or even relate a little bit. Richard Jenkins as his dad, Lionel Dahmer, gives a great performance aswell, and Niecy Nash as the ignored neighbour Glenda Cleveland aces her part.

You can almost smell the decay, sweat, stench, mold and the bloodsoaked matrass but the worst smell of the entire series is the story about how this Dahmer got away with his crimes for so long, and how little there was done for the (families of) boys and men who went missing, and how little there was done by authorities for the victims, letting each person who watches this, to have an opinion on who is to blame, if any. But the real 911 call by Glenda at the end of one of the episodes, is witness to the devil may care attitude by the authorities involved, because (so it seems) it was all happening in the black, poor and gay community. So no one, except for her, really cared.

All in all an amazing story telling by. Ryan Murphy (why, at first, I thought they would steer from the true story but the absolutely did not) about a serial killer that didn't have to make so many victims, had they listened to Glenda. Cleveland in the first place.

There are no spoilers for people who know the story. And one can go into detail about the disorders Dahmer may have suffered from, but sometimes some people are just plain evil.

This story does not claim anything about what might have been, or gone wrong with him, it just tells the story of an evil man that for a long time, got away with murder.","September 21, 2022 (United States)",if you know the story of jeffrey dahmer there are no spoilers if you dont there are spoilers in my review a must watch great acting in a true story about an evil human being that walked the earth scotfree for a awful long time before he got caught the dahmer story in ten gutwrenching episodes the failure of the police to follow up on calls that were made by his neighbour glenda cleveland the neighbour that was dismissed a thousand times and had they listened there could have would have should have been less victims there is some great acting by evan peters because at no point you feel bad for dahmer or even relate a little bit richard jenkins as his dad lionel dahmer gives a great performance aswell and niecy nash as the ignored neighbour glenda cleveland aces her part you can almost smell the decay sweat stench mold and the bloodsoaked matrass but the worst smell of the entire series is the story about how this dahmer got away with his crimes for so long and how little there was done for the families of boys and men who went missing and how little there was done by authorities for the victims letting each person who watches this to have an opinion on who is to blame if any but the real call by glenda at the end of one of the episodes is witness to the devil may care attitude by the authorities involved because so it seems it was all happening in the black poor and gay community so no one except for her really cared all in all an amazing story telling by ryan murphy why at first i thought they would steer from the true story but the absolutely did not about a serial killer that didnt have to make so many victims had they listened to glenda cleveland in the first place there are no spoilers for people who know the story and one can go into detail about the disorders dahmer may have suffered from but sometimes some people are just plain evil this story does not claim anything about what might have been or gone wrong with him it just tells the story of an evil man that for a long time got away with murder,POSITIVE
325,325,9.0,2 October 2022,"My Review -Dahmer - Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story My Rating 8/10

I firmly hold the view that censorship should be left up to our individual free choice after all the remote stop button is always at hand . However in this case I think Netflix or The Producers of Dahmer did have a moral obligation to let the relatives of the victims of the monstrous Jeffrey Dahmer know that this ten part series was in production ,especially if they were being mentioned by name in the series.

Rita Isbell, sister of victim Errol Lindsey, wrote an essay for Insider where she states I feel like Netflix should've asked if we mind or how we felt about making it.

Disturbing subject matter like cannibalism, body dissection ,necrophilia and ritual killing of course is distressing and has been depicted before in many movies like Silence of the Lambs, Seven, The Girl With the Dragon Tatoo to name a few but the difference with Dahmer is that it depicts horrible murders some of which occurred just over 30 years ago . Many of the people involved are still living and if they saw this series ,which I doubt they it would could definitely be traumatised .

Apparently the Jeffrey Dahmer killings and his story are well known to my American friends but until I saw this series I had never heard of Jeffrey Dahmer or as he was named the Milwaukee Cannibal or the Milwaukee Monster.

This series like most made today is in my opinion is far to long and drawn out at ten episodes.

It's a Netflix horror drama series and a very grim tale about one of America's most notorious serial killers. It's largely told from the point of view of Jeffrey Dahmer's victims and his family background.

The series also effectively exposes the police incompetence and apathy that allowed Dahmer to go on his multiyear killing spree. The series dramatises at least ten instances where Jeffrey Dahmer was almost apprehended but then ultimately let go including an astounding scene where a deluded Judge virtually pats him on the head and sends him back out into the community.

The success of Ryan Murphy's interpretation of this horrible tale of murder and mayhem for me lie in the casting of the actors that portray the characters involved . The star is Evan Peters who is no stranger to Ryan Murphy's horror genre appearing regularly in American Horror Story in various roles and in Pose as Stan Bowes is spellbindingly compulsive as Jeffrey Dahmer . He segues between evil madness to almost please note I said almost rational behaviour.

A few rare times in this over nine hour marathon I almost had some empathy or understanding for him due to his traumatic childhood. He has to be unhinged in some way with an absent ineffectual homophobic father who encouraged his son to butcher and dissect roadkill as a bonding exercise plus a traumatised hostile mother who was much more than on the verge of a nervous breakdown at the end of her marriage . This upbringing would not equip or encourage any young child gay or straight to have any sort of functional existence the result of this neglect would surely have contributed to his insane behaviour .

The actors cast as the parents are wonderful Richard Jenkins as Lionel Dahmer and Molly Ringwald as Jeffrey Dahmer's mother Shari both give superb performances .

Other standouts for me were Michael Learned from The Waltons fame in this role she plays Jeffrey Dahmer's grandmother living under the same roof with a serial killer for a grandson , who lies and justifies his actions when she dares to suspect something is drastically wrong.

Her fragility and mental capacity especially when his moods turn to rage deteriorates causing her grandson to leave home where he is free to continue his carnage and is free to hunt out his victims.

The other standout for me among a wonderful ensemble cast is Niecy Nash who plays Glenda Cleveland Dahmer's next-door neighbour who lives in the apartment building when he moves in she becomes suspicious.

This is when the worst of Dahmer's murderous and cruel rampage of stalking men in Bars drugging them and luring them back to his apartment takes place. Glenda Cleveland knows something hideous is going on by the stench and the screams that she hears through the air vents but her reports to the Police are ignored and she is just treated as another black woman being hysterical.

As usual Ryan Murphy the series writer and creator and his team have been accused of taking so much ""artistic license"" that the show does not bear a great deal of resemblance to the facts of the case.

I'm not sure if that's so I suspect that's true but I doubt if any television or movie adaptation of actual crime events has ever not used artistic licence ?

It's a dramatic adaptation of events not a true life documentary so in fairness to Ryan Murphy who also went over the top with Inside Look: The Assassination of Gianni Versace - American Crime Story . Ryan Murphy is a storyteller and never lets the truth get in the way of a good story that was most evident in his series Hollywood 2020 .

This series apparently has been one of the most watched series of the year while the disturbing subject matter certainly wouldn't appeal to everyone it's very well done .

This series reminded me of a similar controversy concerning a movie depicting events surrounding factual violent killings being made.

That negative publicity caused audiences to stay away in droves .

It was the excellent 2021 movie Nitram which was about the events leading up to the 1996 Port Arthur massacre in Tasmania . That movie was also an attempt to understand why and how the atrocity occurred . It also had a fine cast that starred Caleb Landry Jones, Judy Davis and Anthony LaPaglia .

These movies I think do serve a purpose and took me back to the 1960's in Sydney when young men were being murdered by William MacDonald The Mutilator, who was Sydney's Most Disturbed Serial Killer.

It truly was a dangerous time and if this series about Jeffrey Dahmer alerts one young man to be suspicious of anyone they don't know taking them home or offering them a drink that they can't see being made it is worth the effort of watching and it certainly deserves to be seen .","September 21, 2022 (United States)",my review dahmer monster the jeffrey dahmer story my rating i firmly hold the

328,328,6.0,6 October 2022,"Evan Peters does a fantastic job! He is legit creepy yet doesn't force the creepiness. He portrays Dahmer as a socially awkward person who really is naturally curious about doing all these horrific acts to people in a mentally sick sort of way.

The slow burn is good and creepy at first. However, it does feel like it drags a bit. The pacing can and should be varied depending on the situation. The courtroom and media frenzy could have benefitted from a faster pace. Slow burn is appropriate for the victim's family's depression in the wake of the trial.

There are some legitimate issues that are interesting but may be missed opportunities. There are minority issues, cop unprofessionalism issues, questioning if it's right for the infamous to have cult celebrity status, questioning if it's right for religion to cleanse the sins of serial killers... Netflix only hints at them without pushing them too much.

Richard Jenkins does a good job, too. His transformation as the younger to older father was well-executed.

Interesting take on Dahmer... all in all a little bit of a fuzzy kaleidoscope into the whole ordeal that feels a tad bit incomplete at the end, be it about Dahmer or his family or his victims or his neighbor (who somehow gets a lot of time at the end). 10 episodes may be a little long, considering.","September 21, 2022 (United States)",evan peters does a fantastic job he is legit creepy yet doesnt force the creepiness he portrays dahmer as a socially awkward person who really is naturally curious about doing all these horrific acts to people in a mentally sick sort of way the slow burn is good and creepy at first however it does feel like it drags a bit the pacing can and should be varied depending on the situation the courtroom and media frenzy could have benefitted from a faster pace slow burn is appropriate for the victims familys depression in the wake of the trial there are some legitimate issues that are interesting but may be missed opportunities there are minority issues cop unprofessionalism issues questioning if its right for the infamous to have cult celebrity status questioning if its right for religion to cleanse the sins of serial killers netflix only hints at them without pushing them too much richard jenkins does a good job too his transformation as the younger to older father was wellexecuted interesting take on dahmer all in all a little bit of a fuzzy kaleidoscope into the whole ordeal that feels a tad bit incomplete at the end be it about dahmer or his family or his victims or his neighbor who somehow gets a lot of time at the end episodes may be a little long considering,POSITIVE

I agree with other comments though with regards to the fact that it's packed with a lot of filler and fiction. I feel like with subject matter such as this it should try to stick closer to the facts as opposed to all the fluff.

Also product placement can be a bug barer of mine, especially when it is included in a scene and the focus on the brand is completely unnatural.

The cast is brilliant. Jenkins delivered a poignant portrait of the father, Ringwald did ok as his wife, and the actress who played the neighbor is fantastic. But nothing compares to Evans' brilliant work as Dahmer. It was very easy to forget it was an actor and not the real Dahmer I was seeing on my TV 3.

345,345,10.0,26 September 2022,"Don't take this the wrong way, but as a lover of all things true crime, I've seen many drama series attempt to portray Dahmer but all have fallen short of capturing the horrors of this man in a realistic way. It's like everyone has been too afraid of how the audience would react. No one ever took the time for any character development so we could try to understand what happened to Dahmer, how he thought and felt... how many scenarios could have played out differently that may have changed the fate of so many lives. How he managed to lure so many innocent lives. What actually led to him to take such drastic, unforgivable actions. And so they diluted the story in so many ways that it always left me wanting more, feeling like they barely scratched the surface.

This series isn't for the faint of heart. Was I disturbed? Yes. Was I disgusted? Of course. Did I need to press pause to ask myself, do I really want to continue... yup.

I'll wrap this up by saying this.

Is it a hard watch? Absolutely. But let's be real - who presses ""play"" expecting to NOT be disturbed? I don't think it's fair to rate this accordingly saying ""it's too hard to watch"". Guys - the man was a sadistic, murdering cannibal who kept pieces, if not entire bodies for his own pleasure. If you're not familiar with the story, listen to a podcast. Watch a series from cable TV. This series goes ALL in.

Dahmer is a cinematic triumph. Ryan Murphy and Evan Peters truly outdid themselves with this series and it's exactly what I've been waiting to see for so many years. Not because I idolize him, but because I feel like this truly depicts his depravities leaving the viewers knowing exactly what happened, to whom and how.

346,346,7.0,30 September 2022,"Evan Peters captures the dull, blunted tone and unnervingly icy - I'm here but not really here - mannerisms of Jeff Dahmer. His acting is on another level and much better than all of the others who have played the man, the monster. While watching Evan Peters in this role, I was reminded of another actor, another character, this one fictitious. None other than Jon Heder as Napoleon Dynamite. Which makes me wonder, knowing that Evan, off set, has a mordacious sense of humor, if he channeled Napoleon D just for some inside craps and giggles. Kind of the way he channeled Pacino's Serpico in Mare of Eastown. Aside from Peters' profound, if somewhat, at times, derivative performance, Niecy Nash is special as the nosey (in more ways than one) neighbor - glad she passed on that gift sandwich from Jeff, and Rich Jenkins logs his finest outing since Six Feet Under and/or Step Brothers. I'm glad they showed not only the monstrous side of JD but also the human side. It's important to show the latter in these kinds of shows as it may help with prevention of crime in the future; you know, early warning signs and all.

He didn't know how to act real. I don't think his dad played a part in making him a killer. This person was born strange. Even tho he accepted Christ in prison, he got what he deserved by another inmate who beat his head in. I'm glad his dad was not allowed to profit off the book he wrote.

I can imagine anybody who didn't have any detailed knowledge of his crimes would be shocked by this but to me there was nothing new. I've seen many better versions of real life murderers than this.

As a person who knows all the avaliable details I'd say the series portraited the whole situation pretty well. There were some shortcuts in the story but I guess the screen time was limited somehow. I especially like that they showed some little situation from Jeff's life that weren't widely known. They also brought more attention to his father who is guilty in a way but was able to con everyone (including his son) that he isn't.

I wish the final episode had more acknowledgement on the victims. There was only the last 10 seconds with small pictures. I would have loved maybe a slide each, maybe some details like if they had hobbies and siblings etc.

397,397,7.0,14 November 2022,"Dahmer - Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story (2022) is a series my wife and I finally finished last night. The 10 episode series focuses on everything about Dahmer - his childhood, his victims, his neighbors, his family, his murders and ultimately how everyone was impacted around him while he was doing what he was doing and after. The one aspect not covered, likely because of potential blow back from the government, was his behavior while in the military and what led to his discharge...which is also an awful tale.

This series was created by Ian Brennan and Ryan Murphy who also created Glee. The series stars Evan Peters (X-Men: Apocalypse), Richard Jenkins (Step Brothers), Molly Ringwald (Sixteen Candles), Niecy Nash (Reno 911) and Michael Learned (The Waltons).

Everything about this series is perfect, especially the way it makes you feel gross with every scene. It's honestly hard to watch and get through. The acting by the entire cast is stupendous, but Evan Peters delivers an Oscar caliber performance. The details in the story telling is outstanding and you also get a good feel for his mindset and approach to everything he did. You get the feeling his family tried not to know what was happening also. It's a frustrating series to watch because it was obvious there were numerous times he could have been stopped. The ultimate resolution for both Dahmer and his victims are well concluded even if not fulfilling.

Overall, this may be the greatest docuseries of all time. I'm excited to see what they do with the contract extension for three more series they got from Netflix. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.","September 21, 2022 (United States)",dahmer monster the jeffrey dahmer story is a series my wife and i finally finished last night the episode series focuses on everything about dahmer his childhood his victims his neighbors his family his murders and ultimately how everyone was impacted around him while he was doing what he was doing and after the one aspect not covered likely because of potential blow back from the government was his behavior while in the military and what led to his dischargewhich is also an awful tale this series was created by ian brennan and ryan murphy who also created glee the series stars evan peters xmen apocalypse richard jenkins step brothers molly ringwald sixteen candles niecy nash reno and michael learned the waltons everything about this series is perfect especially the way it makes you feel gross with every scene its honestly hard to watch and get through the acting by the entire cast is stupendous but evan peters delivers an oscar caliber performance the details in the story telling is outstanding and you also get a good feel for his mindset and approach to everything he did you get the feeling his family tried not to know what was happening also its a frustrating series to watch because it was obvious there were numerous times he could have been stopped the ultimate resolution for both dahmer and his victims are well concluded even if not fulfilling overall this may be the greatest docuseries of all time im excited to see what they do with the contract extension for three more series they got from netflix i would score this a and strongly recommend it,POSITIVE

399,399,10.0,3 October 2022,"The people making the show should have spoken to the families of the victims and the survivors because of course they should have. I don't know why they didn't. Perhaps they thought the poor people wouldn't go for it if they were told the show's intent, and why would they? Now the makers of the show have left themselves open to lawsuits, especially considering the show is re-traumatizing all of those people. Which, of course, raises the question, ""Why are they watching it?"" Maybe for closure? I don't know. If that's the case, great. Then again, I don't know what closure they could find in a TV show. Whatever. My sympathies are with them and have been with them for a long time.

With all that said, let's get to my review:

This show is everything that crappy Zac Efron Ted Bundy movie should've been!

Evan Peters gives a career-best performance as Jeffrey Dahmer! I've seen the interviews with the serial killer and I saw the serial killer, not Evan Peters.

Richard Jenkins was also really fantastic!

This is the first thing I've ever seen Niecy Nash in and now I want to see her in more!

All of the performances were really great. (Also, holy crap, Molly Ringwald!)

It offers more than just an insight into Jeffrey Dahmer's life and psyche.

The goals of this show are to inform, disturb, and upset you and it succeeds in all regards!

I like how it doesn't show the murders being committed, instead having you rely on your imagination. Makes it much more effective, not to mention respectful to the families of the victims and the victims themselves.

The music is very well-done and appropriately used!

It's incredibly well-shot and atmospheric!

The use of colors was great!

The directing was awesome!

It's very well-written!

The editing was very purposeful and unsettling. Although, sometimes the editing was a little annoying in the sense that it felt jarring when it jumped from the past to the present, and the present to the future. At times I felt like the pacing was off. And, personal point, I wish they had kept the whole freak out in the court scene. That actress did a great job by the way!

Hopefully they'll make more serial killer miniseries. Make one for Ted Bundy and recast Zac Efron. Other than the hacksaw scene his casting was the only good thing about that movie. And if these same people decide to make more shows, hopefully they will speak to the families of the victims and survivors of the respective killer.

If you haven't watched this then you should get right on that! But it's not for the faint of heart! This will likely be upsetting for people and it might even keep you up at night because of how blunt and visceral it is.

410,410,10.0,13 October 2022,"With ""American Horror Story"", Ryan Murphy looked at the human capacity for evil. With ""American Crime Story"", Murphy looked at assorted bad things that have happened in the US in recent decades. His new miniseries ""Dahmer"" could get called a combination of these. The main story is of course about Jeffrey Dahmer (Evan Peters) and his hideous deeds. But another facet of the story is how Dahmer's neighbor Glenda Cleveland (Niecy Nash) tried to warn people that something ugly was afoot in his apartment, but her warnings fell on deaf ears. Not to mention that many of the victims were black and gay in an era when AIDS was already ravaging those communities.

I understand that the series has drawn accusations of being exploitative, and that some of the victims' family members refuse to watch it. Maybe so, but I found it haunting just to see what Dahmer did.

414,414,10.0,24 September 2022,"This ten-episode series tells the story of Jeffrey Dahmer. A horrible and shocking story that will probably not only leave you disgusted by the nature of the crimes, but also by a complete lack of professionalism by the local police at the time.

While the story unfolds I did some research on Dahmer and found this series to stay very true to actual events. It's very wel made in every aspect of cinematographic art. Camerawork, acting, scenario and dialogues are above and beyond average. The story sticks.

The quality of this series is not only in depicting Dahmers life and crimes in a truthful way. It places all of the events in the context of that time, which adds to the uncomfortable truth that Dahmer could go on for so long. We see racism within the police force, the beginning and advance of AIDS, a strong religious culture with all of its taboos and 'things not spoken about'. We're also confronted with a sich phenomenon that still exists today: people in full an sick admiration of Dahmer, asking for his autograph and sending him money. Companies that build on the gruesome deeds by publishing comic books on the story. A police force with a culture that makes change hard, if not impossible.

Best written too though that's not saying much, this show still has its rough points. And I mean rough. The obvious one is the flashback childhood scenes of Dahmer which include terrible child actors and really awful dialogue from the younger versions of his parents. There's also the moral quandary some people have with this show which I definitely felt at some points. There just seemed to be some stylistic elements that maybe glorified or put Dahmer in a better or more sympathetic tone than maybe the directors wanted to convey which came off real uncomfortable. Also the fact that the victims families aren't receiving more compensation from the series yet it mentions Lionel Dahmer's troubles with his book, it's just hypocritical. Also it's too long. There. Everything else is either fine or good. The acting for the most part from the adults is well done and they even deliver some poor lines in a way that felt more natural. The series looks great.

428,428,8.0,14 October 2024,"I think it's worth noting that despite how you feel about the show cinematically, it's inaccurate. There can never be an accuracy in a story that has no adage from the people involved in it. Whether or not you believe that Lyle and Erik actually murdered their parents is beside the point. The actual story leaves much to be desired. While there were some very humorous moments throughout the show that really resonated with me, and while it was very emotional, it left a bit to be desired historically. I believe that the characters were definitely portrayed as one dimensional, which can be a problem when dealing with real people and a case that can be opened again in real time. It's important while watching this show to enjoy it for what it is rather than what it could be, and I believe that my rating would be higher had I not viewed it in this light. If you're watching it because you enjoy Ryan Murphy, then there are much better shows on the market. Overall, I give it a six because the ending felt weak and so did the characters.

433,433,10.0,20 September 2024,"I just want to point out how heinously unethical, vicious and cruel this show was, especially in its timing. The Menendez Brothers' case is actively being appealed as we speak, and the infamous nature of their case means that public perception is important.

By the time of their trial in 1993, the media had already fully assassinated their characters, assigned them motives and personalities based on limited and incomplete information, and made it almost impossible to select a jury of people who had never heard of this version of the case before. After a lengthy trial that ended in a hung jury where 50+ witnesses testified about the severe abuse they had both suffered, and even some of the public had come to be on their side, two TV movies ""A Killing in Beverly Hills' and ""Honor thy Father and thy Mother"" were released rife with inaccuracies, lies and omissions of key facts, along with the caricatured portrayals of them as spoiled greedy sociopaths. Many of these claims were easily debunked at the trial but of course, nobody cared. And so yet again, while they were awaiting a second trial and selecting a jury, their hopes of having an unbiased public and jury were thwarted.

And now, after almost 35 years, when the public discourse about this case had just started to shift to empathy, acknowledgement and understanding of the abuse they had suffered and after having filed an appeal in 2023, Ryan Murphy decides to release this intentionally false and cruel fictionalization of their lives to an international audience. Whatever anyone says or does, it can never undo the images, ideas and inaccuracies Ryan Murphy and his team have cemented into the minds of those who watched this.

My question is why? Why make this? What was the need? To further demonize and punish two men who are living out sentences of life without possibility of parole? You really needed to twist the knife?

Hiding behind artistic liberty is not enough to justify the unconscionable lies promoted in this show.

434,434,10.0,23 October 2022,"Netflix did a great job letting us into a serial killer's mind and i cant think of anyone other than Evan Peters to play Dahmer, there were times i could relate to the killer and there were times i was repulsed by him; it proves that Evan Peters was really good at his job. I love that they didnt pick sides (except for the times when the other side was black), they just told the story from an observer's perspective; they didnt try too hard to make us hate this character. I respect that.

I couldnt help but check graphic images related to this case while i was watching these series. I've had pictures of these victims in the next tab, pictures of his apartment and of course the polaroid pics and I must say Netflix made the most realistic adaptation ever! His actual apartment looked exactly the same, I couldnt tell apart his actual father from the actor.

There were times they changed the script to make things more dramatic though. Like the way Dahmer murdered Tony and the way he tried to make him a zombie by drilling his skull.

The only character that seemed too much was Glenda. This character was too extra when you consider that the actual Glenda let alone being neighbors with him and getting offered sandwiches from him, didnt even know Dahmer personally. They wanted to give moral lessons through this character, they wanted to show us the unseen minorities i know. But there were times when the Black investigator and Glenda seemed very unnatural, cartonized and victimized.

Its like Netflix made the best soup ever but when it was time to serve it, they were reminded to ""spice it up"" with moral lessons and ended up making the soup too salty. My point is that the moral lessons were so out of the place that it seemed unnatural and it was like they added these extra lines later because whenever the black investigator made a remark in regards of minorities, there was an awkward silence and no response at all. I didnt like the atmosphere they tried to create there.

I know there was police ignorance and most of the times Dahmer could get away with murder just because he was a white blonde male and his victims were people of color. There were injustice.

435,435,10.0,8 October 2022,"This series triggers many emotions in a person. From horror to sadness. This is due to the built atmosphere of the series. After watching, a person asks himself many questions, whether a person is born evil or acquires evil from the environment. What pushed Dahmer to commit these crimes? Are genes to blame, drugs taken by his mother during pregnancy, operations on dead animals shown by his father, or just simple neglect of his son? I think a little bit of everything. I also think that people are not born evil, but certain people are more prone to this evil because of their genes, for example. The surgeries shown by the father or the neglect of the son may have only perpetuated his ""inner desires"" and strengthened him in this. Of course, this is just my opinion, this topic is so vast and confusing that it is hard to come to a unanimous consensus. The police in this series have been swept up in the mud, and if it's all true, I can't imagine how many such beasts lived to old age later because of the ""broken"" police. And as for the father I continue to have mixed feelings, supposedly trying to help his son as much as possible, and on the other hand trying to make money by writing a book (saying, of course, that it's all for future parents). As for the construction of the series itself, it is done very well, the music perfectly matched. It is not as disgusting as it could be, many of the murder scenes were not shown as well as all the quartering scenes thanks to this it activates the imagination and shows that it is not a typical horror film that is supposed to be disgusting just a film that is supposed to make you think. 9/10 is my final rating for this series, I recommend everyone to watch it.","September 21, 2022 (United States)",this series triggers many emotions in a person from horror to sadness this is due to the built atmosphere of the series after watching a person asks himself many questions whether a person is born evil or acquires evil from the environment what pushed dahmer to commit these crimes are genes to blame drugs taken by his mother during pregnancy operations on dead animals shown by his father or just simple neglect of his son i think a little bit of everything i also think that people are not born evil but certain people are more prone to this evil because of their genes for example the surgeries shown by the father or the neglect of the son may have only perpetuated his inner desires and strengthened him in this of course this is just my opinion this topic is so vast and confusing that it is hard to come to a unanimous consensus the police in this series have been swept up in the mud and if its all true i cant imagine how many such beasts lived to old age later because of the broken police and as for the father i continue to have mixed feelings supposedly trying to help his son as much as possible and on the other hand trying to make money by writing a book saying of course that its all for future parents as for the construction of the series itself it is done very well the music perfectly matched it is not as disgusting as it could be many of the murder scenes were not shown as well as all the quartering scenes thanks to this it activates the imagination and shows that it is not a typical horror film that is supposed to be disgusting just a film that is supposed to make you think is my final rating for this series i recommend everyone to watch it,POSITIVE

Where do I start? I was not let down by this series, in fact, it might be my favourite show of the last few years.

Evan Peters' performance in Dahmer is absolutely incredible, he's played bad and terrifying people before this, but this role takes the cake.

I really appreciated that Dahmer's action were not necessarily glorified, and that we also learned about his victim's lives.

The victims were not just there to be killed by Dahmer, they mean so much more in this portrayal of Dahmer's dreadful story.

The aesthetic and atmosphere were amazing, Ryan Murphy has really outdone himself with this one!

This is too low and of course this cruel killer should not be whitewashed.

I have no questions about Peters at all, he brilliantly played those moments when the authors failed, he carried everything on himself. Overall, the cast performed at a high level, even in those scenes that were either unnecessary or downright weak.

Every time I hear of Dahmer's story being told in a podcast, documentary, movie, etc. I find it infuriating that they always focus on the grisly, gory details and erase everything else about race and the larger systemic issues.

But finally, the parts that were historically erased are amplified. The victims finally get to be full human beings, their families pain gets to be acknowledged, Glenda Cleveland gets a spotlight. The morbidly indulgent fans who glorified dahmer are finally getting shamed. And who knows, hopefully the series will re-spark public outcry against the Milwaukee PD since officers John Balcerzak and Joseph Gabrish have never been held accountable for what they did.

This series is necessary because America needs to see it through a new lens: this time with actual compassion, heartbreak, anger, and accountability.

456,456,10.0,23 September 2022,"At a running time of nearly nine hours, many might wonder why it takes this series nearly 7 hours more than most other films or documentaries on the same topic to capture the life and events of Jeffrey Dahmer...

The answer is because this series offers a rich panorama of both the psychopath's journey as well as all of the psychological horror he inflicts on all of the lives in the crossfire. His apartment neighbor, his father, his grandmother, his victims, and his victims' families.

The tragic series is surprisingly detailed and stays as close to the story as possible. The narrative moves around on several timelines through periods of his life in an unpredictable order. This seems to me to have been done for pacing rather than providing back stories. Though it moves in a more linear timeline in the last few episodes.

What this series does better than most is breathe life and humanity into the victims--mostly through the life of Tony, a young deaf, aspiring black model with a big heart from an incredibly loving family. It may bring you to tears when that episode wraps up. It is just devastating.

All of the acting is sublime. You feel for nearly every character on screen at times, even the monster himself. Standouts to me are Evan Peters, Niecy Nash and Richard Jenkins, as they had the most screen time, but it was well acted throughout.

Besides this monster's drama the show focuses on social problems as well, especially on the fact that the police could not care less that young men of color were tortured or killed.

461,461,10.0,3 November 2022,"A very unfortunate serie, with no purpose to be, no values, not a tribute for the victims but the exploitation of cruelty and human suffering The series goes into gruesome details of the crimes committed, with no shame nor respect for the victims and surviving relatives The acting as good as it might be, the production and directing are inglesa when there is no lesson, but just a point of perpetuating hatred and injustice There is no depth to the characters, just anecdotes that do a poor job of explaining their motives, and actions.

There is no reason to glorify a criminal, bring back a dark moment in time that had a ripple effect on a community and country Ryan Murphy and his cast are very talented and gifted artists, they took an unnecessary risk for the sake of controversy, without stepping back for a minute and reflecting on the live victims.

A brilliantly acted performance by Evan Peters. It was such a creepy and dangerously believable role. The transformation was amazing to see 'Dahmer' develop in each episode and get bolder.

I had heard of Jeffrey Dahmer but didn't really understand the whole story. From the perspective of the victims and the incompetence of the police and judge(s) it was a very shocking experience and a very hard watch.

I would highly recommend watching this series - not to glorify Dahmer who in my view was insane to say the least but to give justice to each and every victim who were robbed of a life and not given the justice they deserve. Most of these men would have been alive today if Dahmer had been stopped earlier, very much earlier.

466,466,10.0,23 September 2022,"This felt like a combination between American Horror Story and American Crime Story. It was mostly done very well and managed to keep you interested through majority of it.

Evan Peters is an amazing actor as always and he managed to carry this very well. I always felt like he (the actor) deserves more recogniation than he gets, and I'm glad he is starting to get more of it now. Nothing but good words to him.

While watching, I felt like the show did a good work showing you the victims side of it and giving them the respect that they deserve. Unlike most shows that maybe end up glorifying the killers by putting all of the focus on them, this one really attempts not to (though it doesn't always succeed because Evan himself is naturally likeable). They really try to make you feel for the victims and their families and how wrong they were treated, not just by the killer himself but also by everyone around them. It clearly criticizes the racism and the dismissive attitude by the authorities, both before and after the killer was caught. It also made sure to show you what happens after the killer was caught, how the story of trauma doesn't end there and people can't just move on with their life. And that's the part of reality that is often ignored in the media - the story doesn't just end when the person goes to prison. It's never that easy.

However, after watching it I read that the families of the victims were never updated about this and that it triggered trauma to some of them. Legally the creators of this series did not have to ask for permission or anything, but as the series showed strong critisism towards the people who tried to make profit from the story after it happened without taking the families into consideration, it did feel very weird to learn that this series was made by people who pretty much did the same thing. Even though the series itself is very well made and probably the best non-documentary adaptation of the story, this fact about the families does leave you with some bad aftertaste in retrospect.

Back to the series itself, the only downside of this series in my opinion is that even though it was interesting through most of it, at some point near the end it did feel like it just got EXTREMELY slow, and even became a little boring, kinda like a lot of the content and dialogs were dragged longer on purpose just so they can have 10 episodes. It was a shame to be so engaged in it through most of the series only to get sort of bored of it near the end, kinda underwhelming. I think it would have been much better if they squished things together a little more and kept it to 6-8 episodes total.

For the accuracy level, to my understanding from a quick research the important parts about the crimes were mostly accurate, while fictional changes were usually related to the stories of the neighbors or the police (unclear to what level, but at the very least some parts of those were not accurate).","September 21, 2022 (United States)",this felt like a combination between american horror story and american crime story it was mostly done very well and managed to keep you interested through majority of it evan peters is an amazing actor as always and he managed to carry this very well i always felt like he the actor deserves more recogniation than he gets and im glad he is starting to get more of it now nothing but good words to him while watching i felt like the show did a good work showing you the victims side of it and giving them the respect that they deserve unlike most shows that maybe end up glorifying the killers by putting all of the focus on them this one really attempts not to though it doesnt always succeed because evan himself is naturally likeable they really try to make you feel for the victims and their families and how wrong they were treated not just by the killer himself but also by everyone around them it clearly criticizes the racism and the dismissive attitude by the authorities both before and after the killer was caught it also made sure to show you what happens after the killer was caught how the story of trauma doesnt end there and people cant just move on with their life and thats the part of reality that is often ignored in the media the story doesnt just end when the person goes to prison its never that easy however after watching it i read that the families of the victims were never updated about this and that it triggered trauma to some of them legally the creators of this series did not have to ask for permission or anything but as the series showed strong critisism towards the people who tried to make profit from the story after it happened without taking the families into consideration it did feel very weird to learn that this series was made by people who pretty much did the same thing even though the series itself is very well made and probably the best nondocumentary adaptation of the story this fact about the families does leave you with some bad aftertaste in retrospect back to the series itself the only downside of this series in my opinion is that even though it was interesting through most of it at some point near the end it did feel like it just got extremely slow and even became a little boring kinda like a lot of the content and dialogs were dragged longer on purpose just so they can have episodes it was a shame to be so engaged in it through most of the series only to get sort of bored of it near the end kinda underwhelming i think it would have been much better if they squished things together a little more and kept it to episodes total for the accuracy level to my understanding from a quick research the important parts about the crimes were mostly accurate while fictional changes were usually related to the stories of the neighbors or the police unclear to what level but at the very least some parts of those were not accurate,POSITIVE

468,468,10.0,26 September 2022,"I think it is tasteless and unnecessary to make shows like this about serial killers. The man brutally murdered more than a dozen people, why would you want to make a tv show about that?

A horror movie is one thing because they are works of fiction, I can see how that makes for a thrilling story, but the difference is that this was a real killer with real victims and some of the families are still alive, how do you think they feel when a new tv show comes out about the man who killed someone they love (almost glorifying him) and it becomes the most popular show on Netflix? Have Netflix really sunk that low?

It would be different if it was an informative documentary, something like a collection of interviews with criminal psychologists, police, and victim's family members if they were willing, don't glorify him in any way, but just talk about what he did and try to explain why he did these things, maybe something positive could come out of that because people could learn how these monsters are created and we could all try to make sure that stuff doesn't happen again, but this is just cheap heat, it shocks people (and it should) but that is not automatically a good thing.

If they really wanted to make something like this then they should have made it about Jack the Ripper or other cases like that, because it happened so long ago that everyone involved has been dead for a very long time. So I'm sure this is probably well made as far as tv shows go, but I think it is very tasteless and unnecessary to make a tv show about this creep, and I think it is even sadder that it is currently number 1 on Netflix.

471,471,10.0,4 October 2022,"This is in many ways an excellent series. It's a biopic of Dahmer, but the makers didn't try to get into his head or point out causes (which could have made for excuses) for his behavior. They evidently wanted to focus on the devastating effect that his crimes had on the families of his victims and on his own family, especially his father. There certainly are some gruesome scenes, but most of the story is pictured in a very slow and cautious way, making the almost clinical way in which Dahmer acts even more sinister and almost unbearable. This is also and very much the merit of Evan Peters, who does an exceptionable job as Jeffrey. But also Richard Jenkins should be mentioned, as the guilt-ridden and desperate, but unrelentingly loyal father Lionel. And Niece Nash as the exasperated neighbor Glenda, who's cries for help were time and again ignored.

In the last episode a judge said something that still lingers in my head: ""we (the victims and their families, the family of Dahmer, the public) have to try and live with the fact that we will never know what went on in the mind of such a serial killer and made him do the things he did"".

473,473,9.0,12 October 2022,"I believe two of the hardest roles an actor could possibly play would be a drug addict, or a serial killer. When I knew Evan Peters would be cast as Dahmer I was compelled to watch. Though no doubt disturbing, and in many cases I had to look away, I believe this film is of necessity to our society today, and I had no idea that would be the case.

In the description for the show it hints to answer the question for why he got away with the continuous murders for 10 years. Throughout the film slowly and then all at once the light is shown on the intense racial injustice, racism in general, and the corruption of the police department. It also touches on just how sick our society can be/oblivious to the reality, (or avoidant of the reality) of what is actually happening.

In short, without being phony, overdone, or insensitive to the victims and their families, this mini series really aced an impeccably hard subject to touch on, and more importantly, how to present it.

474,474,9.0,10 November 2022,"I have never been a fan of Netflix content, but this time I must say that ""Dahmer - Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story"" is an incredible production with a true story that continues to cause controversy. The script based on the already well-known true events of the ""Milwaukee Butcher"" is structured in a non-linear way in most of the episodes, taking us to the 60's, 70's, 80's and 90's, to the different stages of life of its protagonist and his horrible crimes, plunging us into the question of what led him to do them, perhaps his relationship of abandonment with which he grew up? The emphasis on the lives of its victims and their families are quite well represented and lead you to be part of their suffering, to understand the anger and pain with which they fight/fought, in addition to the fact that social criticism remains the same more 30 years later: the incompetence of the police and their view that ignores still marginalized societies. The cast is well chosen, Evan Peters has made a name for himself playing maniacs, but this time he went much further and portrayed Jeff Dahmer as realistically as possible, Andrew Shaver gives an excellent dramatic performance as Lionel Dahmer and Niecy Nash as Glenda Cleveland demonstrates her great histrionic capacity, deserving to be more recognized her career as an actress, these three actors should definitely appear in the Emmy or Golden Globes nominations next year. It should be noted that it is good to see Molly Ringwald again in a quality production, offering a good performance, it should also be noted the performances of Michael Learned who is a tremendous actress and the actors Shaun J. Brown and Rodney Burford whose professional careers are promising. All the episodes are of tremendous quality, but it is worth noting the suspense used in the first episode, the cloudiness of the fourth and the highly dramatic sixth. Jennifer Lynch, Paris Barclay and Gregg Araki are three of the directors of the series, each with great careers and who translate their work into their respective episodes that each one directed. The costume design and the setting are the most noticeable, each decade is shown in an impeccable way.

You feel his victims' terror and you feel the horror his parents must have felt as it dawned on them what their son was. The show charts Dahmer's childhood and adolescence so you can see how warped he was and how people interacted with him - some, like his father, well-meaning others driven away by his weirdness. At no time is his life glamorized or his crimes fetishized. Everything about him is laid bare so you can see just how disgusting a human being he was and just how much pain he caused.

Obviously not to the same extent as they felt at that time, but it has the dread and the eerie feeling to it. They didn't take time to show the gory part too much, since it was filmed as if you were the person in the room with him.

It has been amazingly done, it's crushing, from the perpetretor's family to the victim's, the unprofesionnalism of the police, the racism still in place at that time, it's enraging, and eye-opener.

Yes, it's disturbing what he did to these men, but I felt the directors and producers put this together as tastefully as they could given the events that happened. One thing that surprised me the most was the performance of Evan Peters. He was spot on playing Dahmer. He even got his voice down exactly!

You truly feel like you're getting to know Jeffery Dahmer, as Evan Peters perfectly guides you on a walk through his deranged mind. It's evident Dahmer has always been an outcast, and fact of the matter is he's always known that he was. He had temptations that would never silence, and would get worse and grow louder overtime. I am not sympathizing Dahmer, but there is a reason he was sloppy with his victims it's because he never truly feared being caught, he simply adhered to his temptations, with no ulterior motive to keep on doing it.

Wicked and disturbing to see just how even more corrupt our system was during this time period, while we assumed he was clever and escaped the police; the fact of the matter was during that time frame the police chose to look the other way when it came to homosexuals and the black community.

Now and days we tend to glorify there masterminds in being a serial killer, but this series depicts perfectly how one becomes a serial killer diving into the mind of how it can begin.

501,501,9.0,3 November 2022,"""Dahmer - Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story"" is the next best thing to watch when you've already powered through both seasons of ""Mindhunter"" and you're hungry for the next best thing while Mindhunter floats in development limbo.

This is a creepy, depiction of Dahmer's life, told mostly from his point of view, which at times seems to argue that Dahmer was a victim of both nature AND nurture, and suggesting he deserves some bit of sympathy. And maybe he does, but nothing can justify the evil actions he chose to make. And the show does a decent job illustrating just how heinous his crimes actually were.

It's pretty disturbing, especially for someone not used to seeing things like subjective cannibalism, true crime photos, and horrible reenactments that are highly sexualized on screen.

It's interesting to learn the facts about Dahmer, albeit through a more stylized, produced semi-fictional portrayal. What is it about serial killers that we find fascinating? Maybe it's because they are able to do things beyond our own comprehension or capabilities. Maybe because like the song ""Vicarious"" by Tool, we live vicariously through the most evil and violent characters on TV because they can do the most atrocious acts that we can only imagine, without any consequences, because they are merely characters in a show, and they can get away acting out the most vile thoughts of our own collective imaginations, and we can sit and enjoy it without the fear of reaping any of the ramifications.

I think this is a drama that is more entertainment than fact, such as talking about brother incest this particular plot, Eric's real sexual orientation is what exactly, and a lot of eye-catching footage, the father of the character male prostitute to engage in a role-playing game, but these gorgeous details do not seem to be from the true perspective of events. But from the overall episode completion and quality is also very high, because this drama shooting is very difficult, his relatively simple story volume can support enough nine episodes is a problem, but I saw a lot of ingenuity of the director and the design of the bridge against the past Ryan Murphy's work, as is the case in the past, are from the different perspectives of an event unfolding, so that the audience themselves to evaluate the authenticity of it and the rich world inside the character. Worthy of fans praise is the fifth episode of Eric's self-narrative, in the history of the TV series are rarely expressed in the form, but can make the audience completely quiet to listen to a horror of the past.

Loved the two young new actors, Alexander Chavez and Cooper Koch, they were creating with emotion and had a very interesting personality that flowed out of them in the scene and in interviews, a great chemistry pairing. They were both very emotional and very proud and happy to see this lgbt actor on board, Cooper was very consistent throughout his performance, lots of glances and smiles were captivating.

It's a shame that I didn't see Ryan Murphy's usual actor Cody Fern in this show, he would have been perfect for the role of Eric five or six years ago, and he could have interpreted a great killer with his good looks and solid acting skills. Looking at the projects that Cody has been involved in since American Crime Story, not many of them have been able to generate buzz and discussion, so I hope Ryan Murphy will reconsider casting him in the future!","September 21, 2022 (United States)",first time ive written some movie reviews here and realized theres a word limit so i cant be too short i think this is a drama that is more entertainment than fact such as talking about brother incest this particular plot erics real sexual orientation is what exactly and a lot of eyecatching footage the father of the character male prostitute to engage in a roleplaying game but these gorgeous details do not seem to be from the true perspective of events but from the overall episode completion and quality is also very high because this drama shooting is very difficult his relatively simple story volume can support enough nine episodes is a problem but i saw a lot of ingenuity of the director and the design of the bridge against the past ryan murphys work as is the case in the past are from the different perspectives of an event unfolding so that the audience themselves to evaluate the authenticity of it and the rich world inside the character worthy of fans praise is the fifth episode of erics selfnarrative in the history of the tv series are rarely expressed in the form but can make the audience completely quiet to listen to a horror of the past loved the two young new actors alexander chavez and cooper koch they were creating with emotion and had a very interesting personality that flowed out of them in the scene and in interviews a great chemistry pairing they were both very emotional and very proud and happy to see this lgbt actor on board cooper was very consistent throughout his performance lots of glances and smiles were captivating its a shame that i didnt see ryan murphys usual actor cody fern in this show he would have been perfect for the role of eric five or six years ago and he could have interpreted a great killer with his good looks and solid acting skills looking at the projects that cody has been involved in since american crime story not many of them have been able to generate buzz and discussion so i hope ryan murphy will reconsider casting him in the future,POSITIVE

514,514,10.0,20 September 2024,"""Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story"" tries to tackle a deeply complex, infamous case but ends up feeling scattered and uncohesive. One of the biggest issues with the show is its frustrating attempt to include every possible theory surrounding the Menendez brothers' motives - even the outlandish and unsupported ones. This approach doesn't add depth but instead leaves the audience lost in a jumble of contradictions. The result feels like the show doesn't trust the viewers to form their own opinions and instead throws everything at the wall to see what sticks.

Lyle Menendez is portrayed in such an exaggerated way, it's as if the writers took inspiration from a Nicolas Cage movie. His character often feels more like a caricature than a real person. Whether it's his delivery of lines or dramatic outbursts, the portrayal feels inconsistent and almost comedic.

The episodes themselves feel like they were written by five different people who never once collaborated. There's a jarring tonal shift from one episode to the next, making the story feel disjointed and hard to follow. This lack of coherence weakens the narrative, making it hard to invest in the story or the characters.

The focus on Dunne, a writer and journalist, feels like a self-indulgent inclusion that detracts from the central story.

Overall, ""Monsters: the Lyle and Erik Menendez Story"" is a missed opportunity. While the Menendez case offers plenty of material for a compelling exploration of crime, family dynamics, sexual abuse and justice, this show spreads itself too thin with too many wild theories, uneven character portrayals, and disconnected storytelling.","September 21, 2022 (United States)",monsters the lyle and erik menendez story tries to tackle a deeply complex infamous case but ends up feeling scattered and uncohesive one of the biggest issues with the show is its frustrating attempt to include every possible theory surrounding the menendez brothers motives even the outlandish and unsupported ones this approach doesnt add depth but instead leaves the audience lost in a jumble of contradictions the result feels like the show doesnt trust the viewers to form their own opinions and instead throws everything at the wall to see what sticks lyle menendez is portrayed in such an exaggerated way its as if the writers took inspiration from a nicolas cage movie his character often feels more like a caricature than a real person whether its his delivery of lines or dramatic outbursts the portrayal feels inconsistent and almost comedic the episodes themselves feel like they were written by five different people who never once collaborated theres a jarring tonal shift from one episode to the next making the story feel disjointed and hard to follow this lack of coherence weakens the narrative making it hard to invest in the story or the characters the focus on dunne a writer and journalist feels like a selfindulgent inclusion that detracts from the central story overall monsters the lyle and erik menendez story is a missed opportunity while the menendez case offers plenty of material for a compelling exploration of crime family dynamics sexual abuse and justice this show spreads itself too thin with too many wild theories uneven character portrayals and disconnected storytelling,NEGATIVE

He had no bond with his mother and his father, with whom he seemed to have a beautiful and loving relationship, was pretty much not there for him at all.

Ultimately, however, the victims have experienced so much violence and cruelty and it is incomprehensible to normal people how someone can do so much absurd that there is no excuse for all this.

525,525,8.0,11 May 2024,"Dahmer = 10/10

Positive:

Evan Peters as Dahmer is great. He embodies the role of the killer with perfection and manages to capture the creepy aura and facial expressions of the character. The blank stare, the look and even the way he talks brings Evan Peters across brilliantly.

Contrary to expectations, the plot is extremely complex and is not just your average killer horror story.

All aspects of Dahmer's life are examined in detail and his development into a killer is analyzed from his birth onwards. But his family, the victims and other characters from Dahmer's life not only serve as accessories but are also complex characters, especially Dahmer's father, and have their own plot.

The story tells a lot more than just about the murders, but also asks some moral questions and deals with the impact of this man on society. Topics such as racism, religion and good and evil are covered.

But the series also has a lot to offer in terms of production. The murders are brutal, gruesome and keep you glued to the screen. The dark aura of the apartment, the helplessness of the victims and Dahmer's cruel and disturbing actions are conveyed in a horrific way.

It would have been better to see how they lived before they met their untimely end than to see so much time spent on their killer. Time to stop glorifying the stories of serial killers.

530,530,10.0,10 October 2022,"This show is somehow intense, bingeworthy, and a beautiful artistic show at the same time. I find this combination hard to come by.

I am a regular true crime consumer. I thought I knew a lot about Dahmer already, but watching this show was eye opening. I feel like the writers did a wonderful job of showing us Dahmer's perspective, and what made him the killer we know him to be. It was hard for me to watch at times.

I can't say enough about Evan Peters. He's an underrated, phenomenal actor. He becomes his character. At times, I forgot that this is an actor, not Dahmer. I don't get creeped out easily, but he definitely gave me the creeps. He's truly brilliant!

I've had issues with other documentaries or true crime dramas because they tend to glorify the killer. Not this one! There are times when I might have empathized with him (when he was younger), but he is certainly not glorified. We see a lot more about the victims. I especially loved watching the episode about Tony. The fact that we see the victim's perspective, even in the cinematography and audio, is amazing.

I understand some people have issues with certain liberties that the creators have taken, but I don't think they deviate from the main tragedy or events. I knew going in that Glenda wasn't the next door neighbor, but it didn't bother me.

Some people also have an issue with the show trying to be ""woke."" It's really not. While I can't attest to the prank calls and few other details, much of the frustration we feel with the investigation (or lack thereof) is true. Dahmer was operating during a time when racism, homophobia, and misconceptions around HIV were rampant. Not that these issues have ended, but it was much worse then. We can't deny that.

I think the show is beautifully done, and the actors have done a phenomenal job. It's not a gorefest, but it's disturbing. I went in with high expectations, and the show went beyond them!

536,536,10.0,26 September 2022,"In my opinion, the Netflix DAHMER series might be the best true crime film/show I've seen and brings to light a lot of things that are important and shouldn't be shoved under the rug. It's extremly well written, acted and directed. Depicting a real life tragedy is never easy, and it's bound to make some people angry. True crime dramatization will always be controversial, but I believe the show really means well. It honors the victims and survivors and brings a light to the social injustices and incompetence of the police that led to a killing spree that should never have went on as long as it did. Episode 6, ""Silenced"", was one of the most gut wrenching and well made episodes in any television series I've ever seen and truly started to bring things into perspective after the shocking first half of the series. For those who might have been unable to get past episode 6, I urge you to continue on. The series starts off shocking and full horror, but I have to say the second half is what makes it so good by honoring the victims and the survivors.

I binge watched it, like many others did before me. Everything is of top quality in this show, but the acting is what really stands out. Evan Peters just killed it playing Dahmer. He already did it once before in an American Horror Story episode, another hit from Ryan Murphy. He's perfect for this role and not only because his physique looked very similar to the real Dahmer.

Richard Jenkins as the father was very convincing as well. Good directing from Jennifer Lynch, glad to see she's doing better things than her father David, well that's only my opinion.

547,547,8.0,23 September 2022,"Firstly, don't believe all the hype about this being a gore fest: It's anything but.

The producers and director have done a remarkable job of balancing drama, tension, and storytelling to create a series that explores the human cost and exposes the societal deficiencies surrounding the case of Jeffery Dahmer.

Evan Peter's ( American Horror Story ) turns in an award winning performance as the grisly cannibaliser-however the series dives into Jeff's upbringing and perhaps some of the major events of his life that played a pivotal role in moulding him.

It doesn't push any particular narrative in this respect-and what it does do very refreshingly is expose the incompetence of the police who could have stopped Dahmer had they heeded the warnings of those around him.

I'm reminded of perhaps ( if possible) the worst case of Nathaniel Bar Jonah who's victims were young children in his case and similarly the system failed to properly appreciate the malevolence brooding within these serial killers.

This also pays proper respect to the victims ( both dead and alive) without dousing the viewer in force fed sentimentality or virtue signalling.

All in all a gripping series that is hard not to become engrossed in, with some important social commentary and excellent performances all round.

549,549,10.0,23 September 2022,"I can't take this seriously with all the bad writing and inaccuraricies. Would it kill Ryan Murphy to actually do some thorough research and stick to the source material. It's waaaay more compelling. Also, Evan Peters' one note monotone robotic performance is not realistic (combined with his brown eyes and dark hair). Watch the Dahmer family home movies. He came across as an unassuming nice regular Joe schmo. Maybe it's the writing and direction's fault but there are tons of interviews and trial footage to create from so why make up completely inaccurate scenes that discredit the victims true experience? It does a major disservice to the poor victims. I don't like that, especially considering the situation involving the 14 year old boy (character assassination) ALSO.: (The moment with the cops is almost accurate, but should have been handled differently). The Niecy Nash character didn't even live in the same building as him! Get out of here with this fictional mess.

Yes, there are a tiny few solid moments and some of the production designs are spot on, but the inaccuraricies outweigh the few small good moments combined with a lot of boring filler and too many flashbacks. All in typical tasteless Ryan Murphy fashion (couldn't even think of an original title). Skip and stick to an accurate thorough documentary if you're that interested.

550,550,8.0,26 September 2022,"I hypothesize that aggression and sex co-exist near each other in our brain for they both reward us with pleasure and gratification. Otherwise, how else can you explain away that in all cultures, cussing is always in the form of aggressive sexual expletives? I think our evolution as social animals mandated us to separate violence from sex as a fundamental survival contract between us. A code of right and wrong for coexistence as species. As for this story which is a true story, it is about a young man where his barrier of separation between sex and violence had broken down and the pleasure he had gotten from the combined both became an addictive intoxication which led him to become a predatorial serial killer for the pleasure of his own sexual fantasies. This is a finely crafted series looking to become an Emmy Award contender. Or maybe even Emmy winners, especially for the stellar performances from Evan Peters and Richard Jenkins. Just ace! I do have some quibbles though. The first has to do with the script, it shifted focus from Jeff Dahmer to one of his victims in the second half as a lead-in to espouse on racism. Even though the introduction of the character Tony Hughes was clever, but racism is really a different form of victimization. I think the story pounded too heavily on this point which to me becomes a diffusion more suitable for a different angle and another story based on the same plot. The other quibble I had was how John Wayne Gacy was brought into the story. It was an unnecessary and exploitative spotlight on him just for the sole purpose of underscoring a few lines about repentance from Jeff. My final verdict is a high recommendation but only if you are not offended by the shock of male sex and shocking violence.","September 21, 2022 (United States)",i hypothesize that aggression and sex coexist near each other in our brain for they both reward us with pleasure and gratification otherwise how else can you explain away that in all cultures cussing is always in the form of aggressive sexual expletives i think our evolution as social animals mandated us to separate violence from sex as a fundamental survival contract between us a code of right and wrong for coexistence as species as for this story which is a true story it is about a young man where his barrier of separation between sex and violence had broken down and the pleasure he had gotten from the combined both became an addictive intoxication which led him to become a predatorial serial killer for the pleasure of his own sexual fantasies this is a finely crafted series looking to become an emmy award contender or maybe even emmy winners especially for the stellar performances from evan peters and richard jenkins just ace i do have some quibbles though the first has to do with the script it shifted focus from jeff dahmer to one of his victims in the second half as a leadin to espouse on racism even though the introduction of the character tony hughes was clever but racism is really a different form of victimization i think the story pounded too heavily on this point which to me becomes a diffusion more suitable for a different angle and another story based on the same plot the other quibble i had was how john wayne gacy was brought into the story it was an unnecessary and exploitative spotlight on him just for the sole purpose of underscoring a few lines about repentance from jeff my final verdict is a high recommendation but only if you are not offended by the shock of male sex and shocking violence,POSITIVE

I understand that there has been a lot of backlash to this series, but I found this to be a fresh and authentic take on true crime events. If you're going to click on a series about Jeff Dahmer, you should rightly be prepared to be disturbed, if you're not ok with that, simply don't watch. This is an absolute treat for true crime fans and probably Netflix's best offering in the genre to date. This also leaves much to be excited about for the future, as written into the series were sub plots for other true crime and serial killers to follow in the same realm/style of series. They hinted that Ed Gein and John Wayne Gacy stories could also follow. This is great opportunity for a new collection of series, as after watching Dahmer, you realise it's potential for others.

I wish I had better words to describe this performance, Amazing, outstanding, it's all too common - It was just so totally, absolutely transformative, from even the posture down to the pause before speaking, it's was just perfection! This series itself is just so TENSE and chilling. There's a soft ambient sound that's used in the background that just immediately tenses you up - That sound, and Evan's performance on screen... oh man! It it ever effective! This series should've been a 10, but anyone familiar with Ryan Murphy knows this guys got issues with ""doing too much and knowing when to stop"" - The last two eps were really dragging on and on and on, and it's not that that portion of the story wasn't important to the grander message, it felt totally wedged in... like, it didn't feel organically presented.

I think there had to've been a better way to incorporate that part of they story into the grander Dahmer case - But it's Ryan Murphy so the fact that the show seemed to lose it's way is almost like his trademark.

But don't get me wrong, this one is worth the watch!

566,566,8.0,13 October 2022,"Absolutely nothing about this mini-series will make you feel good. It was a stark reminder that monsters live among us, and they look like everyday people. Regardless of your sexuality, this twisted series will make you truly ponder the dark side of the human soul.

Carl Franklin, Clement Virgo, Jennifer Lynch, Paris Barclay, and Gregg Araki were clearly the best directors for this project. They showed Dahmer for the monster he assuredly was. Writers Ryan Murphy, Ian Brennan, David McMillan, Janet Mock, Reilly Smith, and Todd Kubrak did not play the 'charming killer' card. They portrayed a horrific and twisted person whose story was equally controversial, relevant, and educational.

Great musical scoring by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis - minimal yet effective. Jason McCormick and John T. Connor performed amazing cinematography work - that colour palette was especially good. Set decoration, production design and sound effects were outstanding. Hair-makeup and stunts deserve a special shout-out. Rudy Mance's costume design was aces.

It couldn't have been easy to play this sick excuse for a person, but Evan Peters deserves a sustained round of applause, and several rounds of other stuff to help him forget about this phase of his career. My spine still tingles as I write about him. By playing Jeffrey Dahmer, Peters has definitively proven that no role is too dark for him. One more favourite actor, check.

Richard Jenkins was outstanding as Lionel Dahmer (the father). Shari Dahmer (the second wife), played by Molly Ringwald, was great. Joyce Dahmer (the first wife), played by Penelope Ann Miller, was exceptional. Early-days Lionel Dahmer, played by Josh Braaten, was notable. Early-days Joyce Dahmer, played by Savannah Brown, was superb. The kid version of Jeffrey Dahmer, played by Nick A. Fisher was captivating. Catherine Dahmer (the grandmother), played by Michael Learned, was excellent.

Glenda Cleveland (the neighbour), enacted by Niecy Nash, was brilliant. She brought a good deal of humanity to this series, and god knows it needed plenty of that. Tony Hughes, played by Rodney Burford, was memorable. Shirley Hughes, played by Karen Malina White, was amazing. Mayor John Norquist, played by Raphael Sbarge, was good. Reverend Jesse Jackson, played by Nigel Gibbs, was outstanding. Christopher Scarver, played by Furly Mac, was avenging-angel greatness.

Detective Murphy, played by Michael Beach, was good. And so was Detective Kennedy, played by Colby French. Tracy Edwards, played by Shaun J. Brown, was noteworthy. Ronald Flowers, played by Dyllon Burnside, was great. Somsack Sinthasomphone, played by Brayden Maniago, was quite good. John Wayne Gacy, played by Dominic Burgess, was a sickening revelation in his own right - a good performance from Burgess.

From Dahmer's high school flashbacks, Emma Kennedy as Denise was good. Chazz, played by Colin Ford, had good screen presence. I remember some of Ford's early movies, it was nice to see him on screen again. A rather under-rated performer, if you ask me. Both of them had very little screen time but stood out regardless. Steven (probably Dahmer's first murder victim), played by Cameron Cowperthwaite, was notable.

All other cast and crew were mad enough to be part of this production, and did great work. This unnerving mini-series is now streaming on Netflix.

Important note: It is only reasonable to avoid assuming the worst about LGBTQ+ people based on what you see in this show. One man's despicable actions should never, in all fairness, be used to judge an entire community.

A homosexual splanchnophiliac (one who finds internal organs sexually arousing) sounds like something concocted in a fever dream. However, a slew of news reports, police files, and court evidence have long declared such a monstrous man to be the real deal. Jeffrey Dahmer was a bona fide splanchnophiliac who later took his desire up a few notches and added cannibalism to the list. Regardless of his mental health, Dahmer's actions cannot (in my opinion) be considered human let alone deserving of forgiveness. Some people are just born monsters, I guess.

His actions were insufferable and reflected poorly on the LGBTQ+ community who had nothing to do with his way of thinking. Also, I believe a large part of his aptitude was based on upbringing, circumstances, and surroundings. Goes to show how impressionable the human mind can be, and how swiftly it can be consumed by its own dark inclinations.

The mini-series also bottled plenty of 90s vibes. Great attention to detail all round. They covered ten or so murders committed by this broken human. I especially liked how they spotlighted the sheer incompetence of Milwaukee's (Wisconsin, USA) then legal system and local police force, both of whom failed time and again to keep this animal behind bars. Not to forget the blind eye his own parents turned to his early 'symptoms' and, dare I say it, silent calls for help. His father later managed to spot the monster within his son, though a tad too late.

""Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story"" has established Ryan Murphy and Evan Peters as a creative duo to reckon with. Their work in this mini-series made me feel sick to my stomach but also impressed at how boldly they managed to capture the wanton cruelty of one man. They way Dahmer disarmed and then took advantage of his victims' helplessness... It was sexual predation, period. His pathological lying only added more fuel to the fire.

Get ready to have your heart shattered in episode 6. It was genuinely poignant and surprisingly darker than the other episodes. E07 contained some powerful moments worth appreciating. It balanced out the gruesomeness showcased in the previous episodes. Blame games and accountability also featured strongly in the later epis, and each scene in them was well-crafted.

What a show! And to know that every episode was based on a full-fledged real-as-heck human being and his deeply disturbing desires.

burnside was great somsack sinthasomphone played by brayden maniago was quite good john wayne gacy played by dominic burgess was a sickening revelation in his own right a good performance from burgess from dahmers high school flashbacks emma kennedy as denise was good chazz played by colin ford had good screen presence i remember some of fords early movies it was nice to see him on screen again a rather underrated performer if you ask me both of them had very little screen time but stood out regardless steven probably dahmers first murder victim played by cameron cowperthwaite was notable all other cast and crew were mad enough to be part of this production and did great work this unnerving miniseries is now streaming on netflix important note it is only reasonable to avoid assuming the worst about lgbtq people based on what you see in this show one mans despicable actions should never in all fairness be used to judge an entire community a homosexual splanchnophiliac one who finds internal organs sexually arousing sounds like something concocted in a fever dream however a slew of news reports police files and court evidence have long declared such a monstrous man to be the real deal jeffrey dahmer was a bona fide splanchnophiliac who later took his desire up a few notches and added cannibalism to the list regardless of his mental health dahmers actions cannot in my opinion be considered human let alone deserving of forgiveness some people are just born monsters i guess his actions were insufferable and reflected poorly on the lgbtq community who had nothing to do with his way of thinking also i believe a large part of his aptitude was based on upbringing circumstances and surroundings goes to show how impressionable the human mind can be and how swiftly it can be consumed by its own dark inclinations the miniseries also bottled plenty of s vibes great attention to detail all round they covered ten or so murders committed by this broken human i especially liked how they spotlighted the sheer incompetence of milwaukees wisconsin usa then legal system and local police force both of whom failed time and again to keep this animal behind bars not to forget the blind eye his own parents turned to his early symptoms and dare i say it silent calls for help his father later managed to spot the monster within his son though a tad too late monster the jeffrey dahmer story has established ryan murphy and evan peters as a creative duo to reckon with their work in this miniseries made me feel sick to my stomach but also impressed at how boldly they managed to capture the wanton cruelty of one man they way dahmer disarmed and then took advantage of his victims helplessness it was sexual predation period his pathological lying only added more fuel to the fire get ready to have your heart shattered in episode it was genuinely poignant and surprisingly darker than the other episodes e contained some powerful moments worth appreciating it balanced out the gruesomeness showcased in the previous episodes blame games and accountability also featured strongly in the later epis and each scene in them was wellcrafted what a show and to know that every episode was based on a fullfledged realasheck human being and his deeply disturbing desires do not watch this series if you arent ready to see some crazy st,POSITIVE
567,567,10.0,9 October 2022,"This was extremely extremely difficult to watch. I kept pausing every two seconds 'cause it was getting hard to breathe watching this. My stomach hurt so much throughout the entire show.

Before I started watching, my roommate told me a little about him & I made a joke saying, oh we're so alike, we both love the person for what's inside them. Well, I regretted ever even thinking that when I was watching the second episode.

Throughout the show, the thing I felt towards Dahmer wasn't hate, or anger, or love. It was partially disgust, partially pity, partially confusion, partially sadness and whole lot of being disturbed. Pity, because, his childhood seemed so familiar. Although, I would still say it was much much much much better than mine. Watching this series made me scared I'd end up like him. Hopefully not, I have more than enough friends thank god. Loneliness does make you extremely weird to the world tho, who else would know better than me.

569,569,3.0,18 June 2024,"In my experience, media produced by Netflix, Amazon, or Apple tend to be poorly made and just a waste of time. This is first thing I've seen where it was pretty well done. The approach is very slow and methodical and takes its time exploring the history of Jeff, his family, friends, and those around him. It's not a linear timeline, which somewhat works, though not entirely necessary, as they could've made it entirely chronologically and it would've still been interesting. The actors portraying Jeff, Lionel, and Glenda did a terrific job, and you feel like you're watching those people in real life instead of a story. Evan Peters did a great job creating a creepy, lonely, repressed, and vulnerable Dahmer. The actress for Jeff's mother did a mediocre job, and it felt very artificial, forced, and like you were watching a performance. The show did a great job exploring the situation from all sides. Being a watcher of true crime, I've seen all too often the killer being vilified in absolute terms, as an evil that should be punished at all cost without any context of their background and upbringing. Having a dysfunctional home, being exposed to gore and macabre things during the formative years, and having a lack of love, empathy, and structure in the house are common hallmarks of serial killer childhoods. Dahmer was no exception, and portraying that side of him in a fair way instead of simply casting him as pure evil without reason was a nice thing. Then you also see it from the perspective of the people around him, like Lionel and Glenda, and you can see some of the social and environmental repercussions of Jeff's actions and history. Touching on the shortcomings of the justice system was good, and was definitely a contributing factor in his extended killing spree. I do think Jeff was aware of that during that time period, and used it to his advantage. Some of the dialogue exploring redemption near the last few episodes were great and captivating. Overall, a great series that was methodically done, had great pacing, great acting, and a well-rounded portrayal of Dahmer, his history, and the aftermath.","September 21, 2022 (United States)",in my experience media produced by netflix amazon or apple tend to be poorly made and just a waste of time this is first thing ive seen where it was pretty well done the approach is very slow and methodical and takes its time exploring the history of jeff his family friends and those around him its not a linear timeline which somewhat works though not entirely necessary as they couldve made it entirely chronologically and it wouldve still been interesting the actors portraying jeff lionel and glenda did a terrific job and you feel like youre watching those people in real life instead of a story evan peters did a great job creating a creepy lonely repressed and vulnerable dahmer the actress for jeffs mother did a mediocre job and it felt very artificial forced and like you were watching a performance the show did a great job exploring the situation from all sides being a watcher of true crime ive seen all too often the killer being vilified in absolute terms as an evil that should be punished at all cost without any context of their background and upbringing having a dysfunctional home being exposed to gore and macabre things during the formative years and having a lack of love empathy and structure in the house are common hallmarks of serial killer childhoods dahmer was no exception and portraying that side of him in a fair way instead of simply casting him as pure evil without reason was a nice thing then you also see it from the perspective of the people around him like lionel and glenda and you can see some of the social and environmental repercussions of jeffs actions and history touching on the shortcomings of the justice system was good and was definitely a contributing factor in his extended killing spree i do think jeff was aware of that during that time period and used it to his advantage some of the dialogue exploring redemption near the last few episodes were great and captivating overall a great series that was methodically done had great pacing great acting and a wellrounded portrayal of dahmer his history and the aftermath,POSITIVE

571,571,10.0,30 September 2022,"This is a brilliant show in terms of overall stylistics, imagery, cinematography, and acting. However, it makes you feel uneasy. I had to watch it over a period of several weeks to finish, even though the show was interesting and engaging. Many reviewers admitted that it is disturbing, and I have to agree. Yet, this show is disturbing. The creators make you an accomplice by telling half of the story from Dahmer's perspective. You cannot sympathize with him at any point in his life, not even in childhood. I think it was the main point, though. Dahmer is a monster, and there is no explanation for his deviations and compulsions.

Two downsides for me were the length of the show and Glenda's character. It had to be 5-6 episodes long. The last two episodes were unnecessary. Glenda is unprecedentedly annoying with her obsession with Dahmer.

577,577,9.0,24 September 2022,"First of all, I have to give credit where credit is due. Richard Jenkins delivered a fantastic performance (as usual) playing Dahmer's father. I like most of Jenkins' movies but here he shines as the guilt stricken father of the infamous serial killer. Without Jenkins however, this series would be unwatchable. Evan Peters also delivers a great performance as Dahmer. Now that that's out of the way, I'll get into the problems with the series which is the writing and the extreme and dishonest levels of ""artistic liberty"" the writer, director, and producers take on telling the story. In a nutshell, they took a true story and used it to push a very ""special"" narrative. We've seen this before, the police are a bunch of, well you know what they are. It's gotten so bad I don't even need to say it. And I don't wish to be hunted down by Biden's DoJ for posting a review. Also, the character who plays Glenda is almost more unlikable than Dahmer himself. She is his neighbor and for some reason half of the series is about her. My very first impression of her was positive but that quickly changes as she does nothing but scream and yell and complain about everything under the Sun.

583,583,9.0,27 September 2022,"Anything Dahmer-related conjures feelings of horror, shock, repulsion. The less you think about it, the better it is for your well-being. I am one of many who roll their eyes with a big sigh, ""Why another TV show on this subject? No one needs to see that!"" And then I learn that this new series is another creation of Ryan Murphy starring Evan Peters. Immediately my interest is piqued as I am a huge fan of both. I decide to watch the show for Murphy and Peters' talents, not for partaking in the glorification of a non-fiction deranged cannibal.

""Dahmer - Monster"" is so well-made that you can smell the stench oozing off the screen. The pace is purposely slow to instill dread in you as if you are one of the victims, and it is highly effective at that. Props go to the production team (especially the writers, directors, editors) for creating such an eerie ambience. And the top kudos goes to Evan Peters himself. His portrayal is what makes this series. I expect him to be good, but not this good. It is quite mind-blowing. On par with Peters' esteemed acting performance is Richard Jenkins' depiction of the father. Jenkins is the perfect casting choice. Every awkward and uncomfortable nuance is spot on yet unpredictable. It is as if you are watching Jenkins' genuine discomfort about the show, period.

While the first half of the series showcases the creators' knack for turning gross and creepy into something that you cannot look away from, the second half delves into the educational, which offers some redeeming value and justification for developing this series. We learn and remember the names of the victims. We feel the pain of the families. And we learn that being a serial killer is not a white thing (as 82% of American serial killers are white), but rather that brown or black would-be serial killers typically are not afforded the chance to serial-kill as they would just get caught!","September 21, 2022 (United States)",anything dahmerrelated conjures feelings of horror shock repulsion the less you think about it the better it is for your wellbeing i am one of many who roll their eyes with a big sigh why another tv show on this subject no one needs to see that and then i learn that this new series is another creation of ryan murphy starring evan peters immediately my interest is piqued as i am a huge fan of both i decide to watch the show for murphy and peters talents not for partaking in the glorification of a nonfiction deranged cannibal dahmer monster is so wellmade that you can smell the stench oozing off the screen the pace is purposely slow to instill dread in you as if you are one of the victims and it is highly effective at that props go to the production team especially the writers directors editors for creating such an eerie ambience and the top kudos goes to evan peters himself his portrayal is what makes this series i expect him to be good but not this good it is quite mindblowing on par with peters esteemed acting performance is richard jenkins depiction of the father jenkins is the perfect casting choice every awkward and uncomfortable nuance is spot on yet unpredictable it is as if you are watching jenkins genuine discomfort about the show period while the first half of the series showcases the creators knack for turning gross and creepy into something that you cannot look away from the second half delves into the educational which offers some redeeming value and justification for developing this series we learn and remember the names of the victims we feel the pain of the families and we learn that being a serial killer is not a white thing as of american serial killers are white but rather that brown or black wouldbe serial killers typically are not afforded the chance to serialkill as they would just get caught,POSITIVE

590,590,9.0,30 September 2022,"This movie was excellent on so many levels.

As I first started watching it, the most obvious thing is ""Wow, Even Peters"" is a really great actor. I have always like him for his work on the American Horror Story/ies but his talent was taken to a new level here. He plays a person with a dark secret to perfection and his ability to be flat-out scary surprised me because I thought he was already pretty excellent at it. If nothing else, watch the series for his acting.

While I was watching the series I kept looking up things for their accuracy and apparently it was pretty accurate. Of course there were lots of assumptions made about the interaction between Dahmer and most of his victims but the backdrop around his evolution, depravity, and capture were very close to what actually happened. That sense of authenticity was pretty refreshing.

Probably the biggest thing I appreciated was that the movie focused more on the character Dahmer than the arrest, prosecution, etc. Too many crime movies turn into courtroom drama that is derivative and repetitive and Dahmer was able to avoid falling into those traps which made the story that much more compelling.

It's gets knocked down one star for being really slow at some points. Maybe that was intentional to set the tone but there were a couple of points early in the series where I wanted to turn it off and come back to it later because I wasn't able to keep attention. Once the hook was set in my mind about the end of episode 2, that didn't happen anymore.","September 21, 2022 (United States)",this movie was excellent on so many levels as i first started watching it the most obvious thing is wow even peters is a really great actor i have always like him for his work on the american horror storyies but his talent was taken to a new level here he plays a person with a dark secret to perfection and his ability to be flatout scary surprised me because i thought he was already pretty excellent at it if nothing else watch the series for his acting while i was watching the series i kept looking up things for their accuracy and apparently it was pretty accurate of course there were lots of assumptions made about the interaction between dahmer and most of his victims but the backdrop around his evolution depravity and capture were very close to what actually happened that sense of authenticity was pretty refreshing probably the biggest thing i appreciated was that the movie focused more on the character dahmer than the arrest prosecution etc too many crime movies turn into courtroom drama that is derivative and repetitive and dahmer was able to avoid falling into those traps which made the story that much more compelling its gets knocked down one star for being really slow at some points maybe that was intentional to set the tone but there were a couple of points early in the series where i wanted to turn it off and come back to it later because i wasnt able to keep attention once the hook was set in my mind about the end of episode that didnt happen anymore,POSITIVE

I also wish they'd actually included some of the necrophelia that Dahmer engaged in rather than just talking about it.

Other than that, the story is accurate and engaging. The script seems to draw most heavily on the books Grilling Dahmer by Detective Patrick Kennedy and A Father's Story by Lionel Dahmer.

In this light, it was more of a psychological/detective story than pure horror.

From the first episode you will be blown away from this story but once you settle in, the performances will start rising to the top. Award worthy acting by a few people in this one. Notably, of course, Evan Peters. He explodes well past his other roles like a quicksilver (pun intended) in his portrayal of Dahmer. An unforgettable performance that will stick with you long before you finish watching. (If you dare.. lol) also award worthy, Niecy Nash. Her role as ""the neighbor"" and all she went through was so well done that you actually feel it as you watch. Don't want to give details but a must match!! You have to see it for yourself. She shines here. Another performance that deserves recognition was the roller coaster ride Richard Jenkins puts you through as Dahmer's father. He takes us through a range of emotions from angry to sad from sympathy to culpable all in a drop of a hat from episode to episode. Noteworthy are Penelope Ann Miller as the mom & Molly Ringwald as the stepmom, both are stellar here. I've already gone longer then I wanted but must give a shout out to Ryan Murphy, Ian Brennan, and all the directors involved for a series that will shoot up on everyone's one of the best series of all time list. They tell everyone's side and how all the failures made, by family and society, possibly, could have made things different if better decisions were made.

603,603,4.0,23 September 2022,"As one has come to expect, this Ryan Murphy production continues to grow his amazing stable of cinema treats.

It takes a brilliant writer to explore the character of 'a monster' that, whilst a horrifying psychopath, was also human. A human beyond redemption. Its aim isn't perhaps to show sympathy or even empathy for the nightmare that was Jeffrey Dahmer, but more to include his history, not as an explanation of that, but as allowing the audience to look in horror and wonder how and why this happened. There is more than one monster here. The Police involved made some major mis-steps that could easily have prevented many murders at the hands of this damaged, psychotic individual. The blood of at least one victim lays clearly on their hands.

The pace suits the material perfectly and the viewer may well be surprised at where in the Dahmer story this series begins. At first I thought , 'No, they're not!', but they did. And it's a brave choice by the two writers.

619,619,9.0,29 September 2022,"The explanation of nature vs nurture was just so perfectly portrayed here. And Evan Peters nailed it!

The gun can be loaded (based on our genetic factors) but healthy parenting and a nurturing environment can literally keep that trigger from being pulled. And if behaviors do arise we are able to intervene at an earlier point which creates a better overall society.

Dahmer's crimes were particularly gruesome, involving cannibalism and necrophilia.

Now the bad. There is a lot of inaccurate portrails of law enforcement. Especially the award scene. Didn't happen.

The language used on many occasions did not fit the time period, no one in the 70s said anything ridiculous like ""my truth"".

But the worst part, and I've heard it from a few others as well, is that the series creates sympathy for Dahmer. I felt like I was cheering for him at quite a few points in the show. I don't think enough emphasis was put on how brutal his crimes were, a lot of stuff wasn't shown but implied, which would push the viewer away from sympathizing with him.

629,629,10.0,7 October 2022,"Wow - I had no idea what I was getting into with this one. Dahmer is well written with haunting visuals and great acting. Especially the main performance as Dahmer. This show deals with issues such as neglect, suppression, mental illness, and alcoholism. (And yes, murder and cannibalism.).

Really, this show is addicting right from the start and pulls you into a macabre world of one of the United States most prolific and worst serial killers. Someone whose actions are so deranged, they defy explanation. But this show attempts, and to an extent does a really solid job, of deep diving into his psychology and family life and tries to shed some light into how all of these terrible murders happened.

Also, this show does a solid job of showing how vulnerable the community he victimized was and how much love and heart and hope was there that he preyed on, and how the police had so many opportunities to get Dahmer off the streets and they failed to do their jobs responsibly. Especially of note is Episode 6 which tells the story of one of Dahmer's victims who moved to Milwaukee to search for love and a modeling career and trusted Dahmer. It's powerful TV that breaks your heart and makes you question your perception of humanity.

Really, Dahmer is more than just a show about the code of a psychopath....but it's a show about what happens when parent figures (including The State) fail to protect the most vulnerable among us. Dahmer is a child looking for the companionship je never got from his family or friends, who battles to repress and eventually cave into his demons with catastrophic results.

This show deserves to be top 9 most watched in Netflix history.

631,631,2.0,12 October 2022,"I'm quite a big fan of crime documentaries and I've watched most of the ones available about the most prolific serial killers of the past. The only one I've never really read or seen much about is Jeffrey Dahmer so I went into this series knowing his name but not really knowing what his crimes were. I took the opportunity to google before watching to familiarise myself with his crimes and what happened to him and I also looked for a quick interview featuring Dahmer himself to see how he was as a person in terms of how we spoke and his mannerisms.

I've been a fan of Evan Peters ever since he was in the X-Men films. His transformation through the American Horror Story series was fantastic and he really can turn his hand to any kind of character. He can make you hate him, he can make you feel sorry for him... He really is quite a talent. Now there are obvious similarities between him and Dahmer in terms of looks and this was further Magnified by him having the same hairstyle and colour and the large framed glasses that Dahmer was but it wasn't only a physical aspect. He also has taken a lot of time to evidently study Dahmer and really got into how he carried himself, presented himself, his awkward and seemingly shy demeanour and even how his mouth moved when he spoke. There were times when I was watching this that I completely forgot I was actually watching an actor and it was like I was watching Dahmer himself.

By the end of the first episode I was hooked although it surprised me initially that there were 10 episodes because I didn't wanna watch anything that seemed to glorify Dahmer or his crimes. However after finishing the series I see why there were as many episodes is there was and they were actually quite important because they took the time to tell the story from those who were affected by Dahmers crimes instead Pudding focus on him and glorifying him.

Probably the most poignant episode for me was the story of Tony Hughes. This followed his diagnosis as deaf shortly after birth due to medication and followed his career dreams and aspirations which made the pain of him being killed all the Morrill. The series also took the time to look at the effect it had on those in the community, how people rallied after he was exposed, the trauma his next door neighbour went through in tirelessly trying to bring him to justice... It really took the time to explore all avenues without really focusing too much on the crimes. Yes they are included and yes they are graphic and horrible but they are important to the series and the storyline.

The only episode I struggled with was the last episode when Dahmer has been caught in charge for his crimes and in prison. Whilst initially appearing arrogant, he discovers God and wishes to be baptised. Just as he seems at peace with who he is and seemingly getting his head back on track, he was murdered by a fellow inmate that was disgusted by his actions and felt that he was a vessel for God's well. The problem with the episode was that although it was done really well, it ended up staring at feelings for me where I almost pity Dharma. I don't know whether I pity Danny as a person or whether I pitied Evan Peters version but I felt uncomfortable with the fact that I was feeling pity for such a prolific murderer. It really does make you question.

It really does also highlight the horrific racism, segregation and poor efforts of the police and raises serious questions as to why Dahmer was not given support he needed before and why it wasn't picked up. There was a real sense of white privilege afforded to Jeffrey. Whilst I don't think his crimes were particularly racially motivated, there was definite racial profiling on the sides of the police officers dealing with the case.

Aside from that it's a really good series. It's hard hitting and even though I'm a lover of guts and gore films, knowing this is based on what really happened and how people really suffered, it can be a bitter pill to swallow. However I think it's done very well without giving any clarification or attention to dharma but instead given the chance for his victims stories to be told and their lives remembered.

Evan Peters absolutely shines in this and I can only imagine how hard it was to dive into the psyche of such a troubled serial killer.","September 21, 2022 (United States)",im quite a big fan of crime documentaries and ive watched most of the ones available about the most prolific serial killers of the past the only one ive never really read or seen much about is jeffrey dahmer so i went into this series knowing his name but not really knowing what his crimes were i took the opportunity to google before watching to familiarise myself with his crimes and what happened to him and i also looked for a quick interview featuring dahmer himself to see how he was as a person in terms of how we spoke and his mannerisms ive been a fan of evan peters ever since he was in the xmen films his transformation through the american horror story series was fantastic and he really can turn his hand to any kind of character he can make you hate him he can make you feel sorry for him he really is quite a talent now there are obvious similarities between him and dahmer in terms of looks and this was further magnified by him having the same hairstyle and colour and the large framed glasses that dahmer was but it wasnt only a physical aspect he also has taken a lot of time to evidently study dahmer and really got into how he carried himself presented himself his awkward and seemingly shy demeanour and even how his mouth moved when he spoke there were times when i was watching this that i completely forgot i was actually watching an actor and it was like i was watching dahmer himself by the end of the first episode i was hooked although it surprised me initially that there were episodes because i didnt wanna watch anything that seemed to glorify dahmer or his crimes however after finishing the series i see why there were as many episodes is there was and they were actually quite important because they took the time to tell the story from those who were affected by dahmers crimes instead pudding focus on him and glorifying him probably the most poignant episode for me was the story of tony hughes this followed his diagnosis as deaf shortly after birth due to medication and followed his career dreams and aspirations which made the pain of him being killed all the morrill the series also took the time to look at the effect it had on those in the community how people rallied after he was exposed the trauma his next door neighbour went through in tirelessly trying to bring him to justice it really took the time to explore all avenues without really focusing too much on the crimes yes they are included and yes they are graphic and horrible but they are important to the series and the storyline the only episode i struggled with was the last episode when dahmer has been caught in charge for his crimes and in prison whilst initially appearing arrogant he discovers god and wishes to be baptised just as he seems at peace with who he is and seemingly getting his head back on track he was murdered by a fellow inmate that was disgusted by his actions and felt that he was a vessel for gods well the problem with the episode was that although it was done really well it ended up staring at feelings for me where i almost pity dharma i dont know whether i pity danny as a person or whether i pitied evan peters version but i felt uncomfortable with the fact that i was feeling pity for such a prolific murderer it really does make you question it really does also highlight the horrific racism segregation and poor efforts of the police and raises serious questions as to why dahmer was not given support he needed before and why it wasnt picked up there was a real sense of white privilege afforded to jeffrey whilst i dont think his crimes were particularly racially motivated there was definite racial profiling on the sides of the police officers dealing with the case aside from that its a really good series its hard hitting and even though im a lover of guts and gore films knowing this is based on what really happened and how people really suffered it can be a bitter pill to swallow however i think its done very well without giving any clarification or attention to dharma but instead given the chance for his victims stories to be told and their lives remembered evan peters absolutely shines in this and i can only imagine how hard it was to dive into the psyche of such a troubled serial killer,POSITIVE

634,634,10.0,27 September 2022,"I'm still trying to shake the heaviness this show left with me after binging it over two nights. Evan Peters was outstanding, as he is in all of his roles. I was familiar with Dahmer's background and timeline. I think that made for a more interesting watch.

The best thing this series achieved which sets it apart from other horror-dramas based on serial killers is respecting the victims through personification and humanisation. In this series, Dahmer's victims (including Dahmer's neighbour, Glenda) have there time as temporary protagonists which gives us a window into their lives and how they were destroyed by Dahmer. The series also does a fantastic job at demonstrating events in Dahmer's life that precipitated his crimes, without trying to rationalise them or create room for sympathy or empathy.

The only reason is didn't give this show 10 stars is that the pacing with jumping between time points is a bit off at times.

635,635,8.0,15 March 2023,"I would said that the show was decent overall.

First of all 10 episode of 50+ minutes is way to long to tell this story, that is why they had to drag the plot in some not so interesting arc, like the terribly boring episode 9.

For 8 episodes the show is solid, with a weird construction all about flashback and countless jump in time between different timelines. It would have been better in my view, to tell the story in a more linear way, episode 1-3 Dahmer as a kid-teen, then dahmer adult and the killing era ,then only one episode about the after ( prison time/ neigbour pain/ dahmer parents afterlife).

But no, they had to gave us the Glenda show, do the point i have to ask, is she the real villain here ? She is stealing the pain of the families victims, she is acting like if she suffer as much as the families who lost a dear one ! WTF is wrong with her, Dahmer didnt kill your daughter, so stop being a drama queen. It was to the point my gf and I had to skip scenes with her, she tried to steal the spotlight and the pain. Also when I watch a TV show i want to be entertain, i dont Care about the families victim or worst about a neigbour. You can give them 20 minutes screen time thats it. I want to see the Monster Dahmer do his thing.

In the end If you had to remember one episode, and I will advise you to watch only this one, its the one about the deaf man, this episode was great TV, Overall i give the show a 7.5/10, losing half a point for the crazy Glenda. Also losing points for the joke of a final, Christopher the guy who killed dahmer appear to be a hero here, like if we are supposed to thank him. When in reality he is not at all the decent man it appear to be, he is a bigger psychopath than dahmer and probably a more dangerous person.","September 21, 2022 (United States)",i would said that the show was decent overall first of all episode of minutes is way to long to tell this story that is why they had to drag the plot in some not so interesting arc like the terribly boring episode for episodes the show is solid with a weird construction all about flashback and countless jump in time between different timelines it would have been better in my view to tell the story in a more linear way episode dahmer as a kidteen then dahmer adult and the killing era then only one episode about the after prison time neigbour pain dahmer parents afterlife but no they had to gave us the glenda show do the point i have to ask is she the real villain here she is stealing the pain of the families victims she is acting like if she suffer as much as the families who lost a dear one wtf is wrong with her dahmer didnt kill your daughter so stop being a drama queen it was to the point my gf and i had to skip scenes with her she tried to steal the spotlight and the pain also when i watch a tv show i want to be entertain i dont care about the families victim or worst about a neigbour you can give them minutes screen time thats it i want to see the monster dahmer do his thing in the end if you had to remember one episode and i will advise you to watch only this one its the one about the deaf man this episode was great tv overall i give the show a losing half a point for the crazy glenda also losing points for the joke of a final christopher the guy who killed dahmer appear to be a hero here like if we are supposed to thank him when in reality he is not at all the decent man it appear to be he is a bigger psychopath than dahmer and probably a more dangerous person,POSITIVE

640,640,10.0,3 October 2022,"Summary

A shocking series that, however, does not resort to truculence and focuses on the characters, with a formidable Evan Peters as the serial killer obsessed and marked by abandonment and isolation, fully aware of his uncontrollable compulsions and who strikes fear as perhaps not seen since Kevin Spacey in Seven. The finished psychological painting of him results in a humanization that does not lead to empathy, but rather gives more thickness to his monstrous dimension. On the other hand, the series is not afraid to tackle from the beginning the political and social dimension of the case, even to the point of underlining, with a negligent police officer who deliberately and systematically dismissed or minimized complaints about a white man whose victims were African-Americans, brown-haired and Asian homosexuals. , ensuring their impunity for years.

Review:

The series follows the biography and crimes committed by serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer throughout the 1980s and early 1990s.

The series co-produced and co-written by Ryan Murphy is an accumulation of successes, both in the narrative and technical aspects as well as in the psychological description of Dahmer and his positioning in front of the murderer and his circumstances.

Far from the deliberately overflowing and overloaded style of his other productions such as American Horror Story or Ratched, Murphy understands that such a tremendous story can only be taken seriously and soberly, as he had already done in the remarkable The Assassination of Gianni Versace.

Facing a murderer with necrophilic and anthropophagic elements (he was nicknamed the Milwaukee Cannibal), the first success of the series consists of avoiding the truculence by resorting to successful ellipses and off-screen shots and focusing on the psychological and bonding aspects of the protagonist. This does not prevent (and perhaps reinforces) that Dahmer's encounters with his victims transmit at times an unbearable tension, as he had not seen in stories of this type for a long time. The series manages to shock and horrify, sometimes painting absolutely macabre scenes.

Dahmer describes in detail and builds with the patience of a goldsmith a biography where the protagonist's relationship with his family is a fundamental element, even in his adult life: his mother, his father (a great performance by Richard Jenkins), his grandmother and his stepmother are masterfully painted. Elements of everyday life, some ""normal"" and others not so much, reading comics, situations and signs that in other people would not bring consequences and neglected warnings will have in this case disturbing resonances and consequences like germs of a murderer under construction.

The positioning of the series regarding the vulnerability of his victims is fundamental, making clear the decisive political dimension of the framework of impunity with which he acted. It is clear that Dahmer (and this is not a spoiler) was able to continue murdering in Milwaukee for years thanks to negligent police who deliberately and systematically dismissed complaints about a white man whose victims were black, brown and Asian homosexuals, complaints coming from those same communities, a corporate police that made little or no effort to investigate. The choice of these victims ensured the murderer, then, impunity for a long time. This dynamic is not only clear from the story, but it is expressed several times with words by some characters so that there are no doubts. Because of all this, certain objections made to the series by relatives of the victims caught my attention. It was even questioned that Netflix put the lgtbq label on the series...

Nor is it off the radar of the authors that the story of a murderer does not end with his imprisonment, following the tribulations of the bereaved, the fascination of American society with serial killers and reflecting on the value of the memory of the victims.

In a formidable performance, Evan Peters personifies Dahmer from his adolescence to his arrest and imprisonment, an individual obsessed and marked by abandonment and solitary confinement and fully aware of his irrepressible compulsions. His composition is quite successful at times lethargic, surprised and resigned of a condemned individual with no way out but who premeditatedly exploited the vulnerability of his victims. The finished psychological painting of him results in a humanization that does not lead to empathy, but rather gives more thickness to his monstrous dimension, far from the sensationalism of a fictional Hannibal Lecter, for example. Peters produces a chilling fear as a viewer has not lived since the memorable Kevin Spacey of Seven; he is a predatory assassin with some points of contact with that of The Serpent, but without the glamor of him.

Ian Brennan and Ryan Murphy's script is excellent, as he seamlessly organizes and integrates everything, as the dimensions of history. The staging is sober, with an excellent recreation of the period (but without gloating), perfectly integrated into the cadence of the murderer, with a timeline that comes and goes in time and reproduces some situations by changing the point of view. There are long, breathing scenes that honor and provide the right setting and timing for their remarkable dialogue. It is no coincidence that some chapters with an almost dreamlike atmosphere at times are directed by Jennifer Lynch, David's daughter, where the locations, certain sectors of the houses, the lighting and the off-screen with the sound off also become disturbing. And palpable protagonists.

Perhaps it could be reproached that certain conclusions drawn by the viewer sooner rather than later are later underlined by the dialogues of some characters, so that there are no doubts about the intentions and positions of the characters and the filmmakers.","September 21, 2022 (United States)",summary a shocking series that however does not resort to truculence and focuses on the characters

641,641,9.0,28 September 2022,"This is really one of the best documentaries I've ever watched in my whole life.

The director cared about all the details and he focused especially on the cast performances, and although some scenes were so terrifying but there was a reason behind that which was mainly to highlight how much this character was psychologically destroyed.

Evan Peters portrayed Dahmer with an astonishing performance, he kept the character on the same line across the 10 episodes, having a calm tone, and those calm reactions that are totally contradicting with what he is actually doing, in few scenes he lost his temper and when this happened he showed an extreme anger that is matching with the nature of this unstable character, like the scene with his grandma when she threw the mannequin that he had stolen from the store.

He has really awakened Jeffrey Lionel Dahmer and he completely understood the character and how gradually the character developed psychologically to be one of the most stranger cases of serial killers.

Richard Jinkens: Lionel Dahmer, he played the surprised father that refused the truth of his son with a great performance.

One of his master scenes was that one at the end when he admitted to his son that he blamed all who were surrounding him except himself and then he said ""Sorry that I was not the good father"" .. he felt each letter in this phrase and this scene especially summarized the impact of Jeff's father on him and on his case.

Penelope Ann Miller: Joyce Dahmer .. very good actress and although she has few scenes but her scenes were very significant, and you will stop as an audience in front of her performance in 4 special scenes: a scene when she shouted at her son telling him that he never wanted her when she was living the house, the scene in the court when she and Lionel accused each others of being the reason behind what happened to their son, and the scene when she was begging one of the grandmother for one of the victims to say something on behalf of Jeff in the court and the great scene when she tried to commit a suicide.

Neicy Nash: Glenda Cleveland .. this is an amazing actress, she played the scared neighbor that is monitoring all what's happening in her neighbor flat, I felt that she is really terrified especially when she was trying to inform the police with what happening .. one of her best scenes is that when Jeff asked her to eat the sandwich he offered to her and she refused and strongly asked him to get out of her house.

Micheal Learned : Catherine Dahmer (Jeff Grandmother) .. This is the only character that could change Jeff's life completely if he listened to her advices about going to the church or having a girlfriend .. she tried and tried and Micheal also played one of the great roles in this TV show.

Molly Ringwald: Shari Dahmer .. she is a very good actress and she was the kind person that supported Lionel in his crisis.

All the actors who played the victims' roles were great especially Rodney Burford who played Tony Hughes with a wonderful performance.

The scene between Jeff and the victims' family members in the court was amazing between those who were deeply sad and said

Although there were lots of movies produced previously about the story of Jeffrey Dahmer, however this tv show is the closest one to the truth ..

This show brought back some historical events I didn't remember clearly, such as the O. J. Simpson trial, the devastating earthquakes, the riots in L. A., and other significant but grim events that I won't delve into here. It was a powerful reminder of those turbulent times.

I was so engrossed that I binged the entire series in just two nights. The writers and directors did an exceptional job of keeping us on the edge of our seats, wondering what would happen next. Their storytelling was brilliantly executed, weaving suspense and drama seamlessly.

Initially, I didn't know much about the story, so I had no preconceived opinions. However, as the series progressed, I found myself forming strong opinions and by the end, my mind was made up. The narrative was so compelling that it drew me in completely.

648,648,8.0,10 October 2022,"STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * Awful

In 1991, in a run down apartment block in Milwaukee, police discovered the remains of several young men in the domicile of Jeffrey Dahmer (Evan Peters), leading to his arrest and subsequent trial. He'd been operating for years, luring primarily young, gay black men back to his home, before drugging them, sexually abusing them and murdering them, and in some cases even consuming their body parts. The apathy and incompetence of the police aided greatly in his ability to evade detection for so long, targeting young, marginalised men who were disregarded by the police and society in general, casting a wider eye over the culture of the time in general.

Netflix seems to churn out a 'true life crime' series on a whim every few months, focusing on real life interviews with some of the most sinister and calculating killers ever to have walked the earth, aiming to delve into their psyches and make sense of their minds. And so we have this well received ten part production, charting the life and crimes of Jeffrey Dhamer, truly a worthy contender in the 'most evil killer ever' stakes. Told in reverse from the moment of his capture and arrest, it depicts his childhood, as a quiet but withdrawn child living with his doting but quarrelling parents, being walked over at school, before an unstable and fractured early adult life, unable to commit to anything or stick at a job, before having to go back and live with his dad, stepmom and temperamental grandmother.

In the lead role, Peters is undeniably effective, portraying Dahmer with a cool, calm detachment and iciness that seems to be pretty much a mirror image of the real life monster. But, with that said, somehow it's Richard Jenkins's supporting role as his father that leaves the most searing impression, projecting an unnerving ordinariness as the dad forced to come to terms with the shattering truth about his son. While undoubtedly a man with flaws and his own personal problems, he's still fundamentally a typical, all American dad, driven to doubt his own sanity, going through the motions as events unfold. It's common to imagine monstrous serial killers being abused, neglected and all the usual stereotypes of their parents that have been fixed in our brain, but Jenkins impresses what is probably the reality very effectively.

On a wider scale, as if the crimes of Dahmer weren't horrific enough, the case exposed the wider attitude of the police and society in general towards black communities and homosexuals, paving the way for lessons to be learned and wider societal change. Overall, a well managed, eerie and uncomfortable piece, that never veers over the edge and glamorises the crimes of its subject in any way. ****","September 21, 2022 (United States)",star rating brilliant very good okay poor awful in in a run down apartment block in milwaukee police discovered the remains of several young men in the domicile of jeffrey dahmer evan peters leading to his arrest and subsequent trial hed been operating for years luring primarily young gay black men back to his home before drugging them sexually abusing them and murdering them and in some cases even consuming their body parts the apathy and incompetence of the police aided greatly in his ability to evade detection for so long targeting young marginalised men who were disregarded by the police and society in general casting a wider eye over the culture of the time in general netflix seems to churn out a true life crime series on a whim every few months focusing on real life interviews with some of the most sinister and calculating killers ever to have walked the earth aiming to delve into their psyches and make sense of their minds and so we have this well received ten part production charting the life and crimes of jeffrey dhamer truly a worthy contender in the most evil killer ever stakes told in reverse from the moment of his capture and arrest it depicts his childhood as a quiet but withdrawn child living with his doting but quarrelling parents being walked over at school before an unstable and fractured early adult life unable to commit to anything or stick at a job before having to go back and live with his dad stepmom and temperamental grandmother in the lead role peters is undeniably effective portraying dahmer with a cool calm detachment and iciness that seems to be pretty much a mirror image of the real life monster but with that said somehow its richard jenkinss supporting role as his father that leaves the most searing impression projecting an unnerving ordinariness as the dad forced to come to terms with the shattering truth about his son while undoubtedly a man with flaws and his own personal problems hes still fundamentally a typical all american dad driven to doubt his own sanity going through the motions as events unfold its common to imagine monstrous serial killers being abused neglected and all the usual stereotypes of their parents that have been fixed in our brain but jenkins impresses what is probably the reality very effectively on a wider scale as if the crimes of dahmer werent horrific enough the case exposed the wider attitude of the police and society in general towards black communities and homosexuals paving the way for lessons to be learned and wider societal change overall a well managed eerie and uncomfortable piece that never veers over the edge and glamorises the crimes of its subject in any way,POSITIVE
649,649,9.0,8 October 2022,"No pun intended - I mean there are serial killers where people go ""I would never have guessed it"", ""he was always so nice"" ... well you cannot really say that about Dahmer! There were so many warnings, there were so many close calls (literally and no pun intended), there were so many calls to stop him! This show will show most of them - and you will cringe when you think about how he got away with it so many times. And how nonchalant he is about all of it.

The show itself is all over the place - time wise that is. So you may have some issues following it. Or some may have that issue. If you let yourself into the mood, into the vibe, you'll get it and you'll love it. It is challenging, but so well structured that you won't mind. Also while we see the ""later"", it is then that we are told the past. Sometimes you get a cut from one scene to a totally different one - for shock value but also to keep your on your toes.

And while you may be asking yourself why some did not report his behavior ... you'll find out that they did ... but did not always find someone listening to them. I also watched the docu series that was also available to stream. While that was ok - this is more coherent, this seems more extensive, this seems to really get into the head of Dahmer.

Which may not be the best place to be. But it is what it is ... and the theme of loneliness ... well you can't deny them to say the least. It is anything but subtle ... Loneliness can kill a man (or more) - sorry for the pun.","September 21, 2022 (United States)",no pun intended i mean there are serial killers where people go i would never have guessed it he was always so nice well you cannot really say that about dahmer there were so many warnings there were so many close calls literally and no pun intended there were so many calls to stop him this show will show most of them and you will cringe when you think about how he got away with it so many times and how nonchalant he is about all of it the show itself is all over the place time wise that is so you may have some issues following it or some may have that issue if you let yourself into the mood into the vibe youll get it and youll love it it is challenging but so well structured that you wont mind also while we see the later it is then that we are told the past sometimes you get a cut from one scene to a totally different one for shock value but also to keep your on your toes and while you may be asking yourself why some did not report his behavior youll find out that they did but did not always find someone listening to them i also watched the docu series that was also available to stream while that was ok this is more coherent this seems more extensive this seems to really get into the head of dahmer which may not be the best place to be but it is what it is and the theme of loneliness well you cant deny them to say the least it is anything but subtle loneliness can kill a man or more sorry for the pun,POSITIVE

651,651,9.0,10 October 2022,"A sick and evil serial killer who done unspeakable things to his victims is shown on full display, sometimes sadistic, sometimes playing the victim, Jeffrey was if nothing else a highly captivating person in Dahmer. From the outset the first episode really draws you in to what Jeff's MO was. Meaning what his tactic was for capturing and killing his victims. They lay out the first episode very well and have most of the story on display setting a general timeline for what has happened over the years. The next few episodes are a bit more average, consisting of flashbacks to Jeff as kid growing up and how he worked his way to killing, it's told well and acted even better so it's more than enough to keep you watching closely. Towards the final few episodes I felt like I had already seen everything to piece together exactly what the outcome was so it seemed to drag slightly at the tail end. One downside is the story itself should clearly be centred around the serial killer and what he done to his victims, who were from a vast array of races and creeds but instead certain episodes take time to push certain stereotypes and agendas onto us. The police are always the bad guys, they always messed up. People of certain races are always innocent etc. This is especially prevalent in the Casandra episode where it spends more time focused on racial matters than actually getting on track with what the show is about. This leads to a misguided nature at points and sadly nowadays this underlying message inserted into writing has become common place in most forms of media. Overall the show has a decent enough storyline and is structured well to what happened that it remains a really good captivating watch.","September 21, 2022 (United States)",a sick and evil serial killer who done unspeakable things to his victims is shown on full display sometimes sadistic sometimes playing the victim jeffrey was if nothing else a highly captivating person in dahmer from the outset the first episode really draws you in to what jeffs mo was meaning what his tactic was for capturing and killing his victims they lay out the first episode very well and have most of the story on display setting a general timeline for what has happened over the years the next few episodes are a bit more average consisting of flashbacks to jeff as kid growing up and how he worked his way to killing its told well and acted even better so its more than enough to keep you watching closely towards the final few episodes i felt like i had already seen everything to piece together exactly what the outcome was so it seemed to drag slightly at the tail end one downside is the story itself should clearly be centred around the serial killer and what he done to his victims who were from a vast array of races and creeds but instead certain episodes take time to push certain stereotypes and agendas onto us the police are always the bad guys they always messed up people of certain races are always innocent etc this is especially prevalent in the casandra episode where it spends more time focused on racial matters than actually getting on track with what the show is about this leads to a misguided nature at points and sadly nowadays this underlying message inserted into writing has become common place in most forms of media overall the show has a decent enough storyline and is structured well to what happened that it remains a really good captivating watch,POSITIVE
652,652,2.0,9 October 2022,"Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story, starring Evan Peters, who is brilliant, is so good. I normally wouldn't watch such a gruesome movie if the production was mediocre. But this series is outstanding, The writing is perfect. The acting, editing, directing, casting-all of it gels perfectly together. I got deep into it within 2 minutes.

Evan Peters gave an incredibly inspired performance. You just never knew that underneath that calm, good looking face was an astonishingly sick monster. But you knew he was sick. He was the perfect actor to cast in this role. He didn't have to act like he was sick. It was so natural to him. It was as if he was Jeffrey Dahmer. I remember reading about him in the 90s when the story broke. I couldn't read the whole article, it was so disturbing.

Yes, the creators and writers, Ryan Murphy and Ian Brenner, plus a few other writers, even were able to show a sympathetic side to this killer. Don't know if this is part of the real Jeffrey Dahmer story or a figment of the writers' imagination. You can even understand why he did the things he did.

When I saw Richard Jenkins was in this movie, I knew it would be a good one. He knows how to pick good movies. He was great in his role as Jeffrey's father. So perfect as the hot and cold father.

You may think, as I did, that this movie is a single-minded sensational story about a serial killer. You certainly get that impression in the first few episodes. But it turned out to be not a simple story.

Monster lays out a much deeper, more complicated and wider landscape. The writers accomplished the Herculean task of artfully fleshing out a few of the victims' lives with their families. At first, I didn't know where the writers were going with these subplots. But then I realized the writers were showing that these victims were normal, nice people. They were loving sons and brothers, they had jobs, they were gay, they weren't criminals and they weren't drug addicts.

They were beguiled by Dahmer's sweet sexy face and demeanor. He sweetly and politely lured them into his apartment, gave them coffee or soda or beer and put inside a drug that rendered the man helpless. Why he drugged them comes out in a later episode. There's more to it than your first impression.

There are 2 elephants in the room in this series: racism and testosterone. The writers don't really play up these words but their behavior is clearly present. The Milwaukee, Wisconsin police department was not incompetent, as some reviews and people say. They were racist. Dahmer was a normal-looking white man and almost all his victims were black, brown or Asian. Plus they were all gay, which was taboo and untouchable in the 70s and 80s. If Dahmer were a black man and all his victims were white, you can be sure he would've been arrested far sooner. The Milwaukee police ignored, avoided and neglected any complaints that had to do with Dahmer.

All throughout this series, the writers explore the one question that is on everyone's mind, especially his father's. Why? Why did Dahmer capture, imprison, torture, kill and eat 17 human lives? What drove him to do this? The father wonders if he passed his DNA on to his son. He wonders if his son was affected by them dissecting roadkill together in their garage. The father wonders if the mother's neglect turned him into such a cruel person. They did not, however, explore the practical and scientific aspect. Testosterone is the male hormone that causes violence, aggression and domination. Dahmer was extremely violent, aggressive and had a driving need to dominate, which is why he drugged all his victims. His psychiatrist did not check his testosterone level to see if it was dangerously high. No one made the connection between Dahmer's behavior and his hormone levels.

Evan Peters Is up for a 2023 SAG award for his role. Richard Jenkins should be recognized for his excellent supporting role as the father, which only got better and richer as the series went on. If Hollywood had the stomach, a best picture nomination might be forthcoming.","September 21, 2022 (United States)",monster the jeffrey dahmer story starring evan peters who is brilliant is so good i normally wouldnt watch such a gruesome movie if the production was mediocre but this series is outstanding the writing is perfect the acting editing directing castingall of it gels perfectly together i got deep into it within minutes evan peters gave an incredibly inspired performance you just never knew that underneath that calm good looking face was an astonishingly sick monster but you knew he was sick he was the perfect actor to cast in this role he didnt have to act like he was sick it was so natural to him it was as if he was jeffrey dahmer i remember reading about him in the s when the story broke i couldnt read the whole article it was so disturbing yes the creators and writers ryan murphy and ian brenner plus a few other writers even were able to show a sympathetic side to this killer dont know if this is part of the real jeffrey dahmer story or a figment of the writers imagination you can even understand why he did the things he did when i saw richard jenkins was in this movie i knew it would be a good one he knows how to pick good movies he was great in his role as jeffreys father so perfect as the hot and cold father you may think as i did that this movie is a singleminded sensational story about a serial killer you certainly get that impression in the first few episodes but it turned out to be not a simple story monster lays out a much deeper more complicated and wider landscape the writers accomplished the herculean task of artfully fleshing out a few of the victims lives with their families at first i didnt know where the writers were going with these subplots but then i realized the writers were showing that these victims were normal nice people they were loving sons and brothers they had jobs they were gay they werent criminals and they werent drug addicts they were beguiled by dahmers sweet sexy face and demeanor he sweetly and politely lured them into his apartment gave them coffee or soda or beer and put inside a drug that rendered the man helpless why he drugged them comes out in a later episode theres more to it than your first impression there are elephants in the room in this series racism and testosterone the writers dont really play up these words but their behavior is clearly present the milwaukee wisconsin police department was not incompetent as some reviews and people say they were racist dahmer was a normallooking white man and almost all his victims were black brown or asian plus they were all gay which was taboo and untouchable in the s and s if dahmer were a black man and all his victims were white you can be sure he wouldve been arrested far sooner the milwaukee police ignored avoided and neglected any complaints that had to do with dahmer all throughout this series the writers explore the one question that is on everyones mind especially his fathers why why did dahmer capture imprison torture kill and eat human lives what drove him to do this the father wonders if he passed his dna on to his son he wonders if his son was affected by them dissecting roadkill together in their garage the father wonders if the mothers neglect turned him into such a cruel person they did not however explore the practical and scientific aspect testosterone is the male hormone that causes violence aggression and domination dahmer was extremely violent aggressive and had a driving need to dominate which is why he drugged all his victims his psychiatrist did not check his testosterone level to see if it was dangerously high no one made the connection between dahmers behavior and his hormone levels evan peters is up for a sag award for his role richard jenkins should be recognized for his excellent supporting role as the father which only got better and richer as the series went on if hollywood had the stomach a best picture nomination might be forthcoming,POSITIVE
653,653,10.0,1 October 2022,"I finished watching it and I gave myself the night to really think about what I would write in my review, and honestly, it's hard to review. It hits all the main story beats quite well and the acting and direction are really top knotch. However, there is quite a bit that is completely inaccurate, or never even happened in the first place. It practically lends a hand at making Dahmer a movie monster, instead of being a biopic about him, i.e. Glenda not even living in the same building or being the one who discovers the 14 year old boy on the street, the fact that his dad never participated in or drove around and helped him pick up roadkill to practice his disections and taxidermy, the fact that he had a pretty normal childhood when compared to a lot of other people, the way some of his victims were killed, etc. That, in my opinion, is extremely disrespectful to the true story and to the victim's families. Makes me feel like this is exploitation at its worst. On the other hand, everyone does a bang up job, except Peters. Who again I feel is playing himself, just with a different style. For me, it just wasn't the transformation that everyone is raving about. Not to say he doesn't do a good job, I like the guy and love him on AHS, but I just can't see him as a serious actor in anything else. The direction was perfect for the series, and the writing feels genuine and authentic, minus the embellishments. I just still can't get over how exploitative this all feels, and how the families of the victims must feel about their tragedy being put up as a horror series, let alone have to see and hear about it everywhere they look. Had they added more of the victims and cut out some of the murderous stuff, like show us what happened without showing us what happened type of stuff, and if they had cared to stick to the facts, I might have liked this a bit better. As it stands though, I think the series is unnecessary, crude, inaccurate and disrespectful, regardless of how well it was made. The fact that so many people are rating this so highly is beyond me. If this had been released 20 years ago, it wouldn't have seen the light of day. Not because of the content, but because people would've cared enough about the families and realized this was disrespectful material. 1 deeply disturbed individual out of 5.","September 21, 2022 (United States)",i finished watching it and i gave myself the night to really think about what i would write in my review and honestly its hard to review it hits all the main story beats quite well and the acting and direction are really top knotch however there is quite a bit that is completely inaccurate or never even happened in the first place it practically lends a hand at making dahmer a movie monster instead of being a biopic about him ie glenda not even living in the same building or being the one who discovers the year old boy on the street the fact that his dad never participated in or drove around and helped him pick up roadkill to practice his disections and taxidermy the fact that he had a pretty normal childhood when compared to a lot of other people the way some of his victims were killed etc that in my opinion is extremely disrespectful to the true story and to the victims families makes me feel like this is exploitation at its worst on the other hand everyone does a bang up job except peters who again i feel is playing himself just with a different style for me it just wasnt the transformation that everyone is raving about not to say he doesnt do a good job i like the guy and love him on ahs but i just cant see him as a serious actor in anything else the direction was perfect for the series and the writing feels genuine and authentic minus the embellishments i just still cant get over how exploitative this all feels and how the families of the victims must feel about their tragedy being put up as a horror series let alone have to see and hear about it everywhere they look had they added more of the victims and cut out some of the murderous stuff like show us what happened without showing us what happened type of stuff and if they had cared to stick to the facts i might have liked this a bit better as it stands though i think the series is unnecessary crude inaccurate and disrespectful regardless of how well it was made the fact that so many people are rating this so highly is beyond me if this had been released years ago it wouldnt have seen the light of day not because of the content but because people wouldve cared enough about the families and realized this was disrespectful material deeply disturbed individual out of,POSITIVE

655,655,8.0,22 September 2022,"I typically don't write reviews. But i have too say Evan Peters is JEFFREY DAHMER. Everything from his midwest accent, down too his mannerisms, he is a perfect fit for this role.

Now being a gay man myself and out too a very supportive family. I must say that their were SO MANY ""red flags"" where Jeff could have received the help he needed too ""come out"" and deal with his obsessions with the macabre. He was crying out for help and know one was listening. Let me be perfectly clear here. I DO NOT condone what he did on ANY LEVEL. As he definitely had deep psychological problems. But i do believe with a different upbringing and more ""understanding"" parents things may have gone differently for him.

The true moral of this story folks is too make sure your listening too your kids. And i mean TRULY listening when they come too you and want to talk. Jeff didn't have this and resorted too heavy drinking which only made his psychological problems even worse. If he were able too talk with a psychiatrist and be put on the proper medication. I think his sanity and soul could have been saved. Their is a part of me that feels very sorry for him that he didn't have access too this kind of help.

When you examine the first few episodes you see a father encouraging him in behavior that was ""abnormal"". Picking up roadkill and cutting it open only deepened his fascination with the macabre. And in turn worsened his psychological welfare. So in that regard YES i blame the father for getting him interested in such abnormal activities. He also couldn't handle the divorce and that is when he immediately needed counseling. Because he spiraled out of control from that point forward.

The bottom line here is people can be ""saved"" if they have the proper channels and outlets. Even if they are incapable of seeing themselves changing for the better. As an outsider one must still try and exhaust all efforts too save that individual from such psychological torment. Jeff had none of those outlets. And it's a shame that his life turned out the way it did. He certainly was born gay but i don't believe he would have done the monstrous things he did. If it wasn't influenced on him at such an early stage from his dad. So i hold him accountable for part of his issues.

659,659,2.0,13 October 2022,"Being a teenager from the Netherlands, I had never heard of Jeffrey Dahmer before, but still I decided to take a look. And let me say I was not expecting this...

It puts you right into all things disturbing right from the beginning. In my opinion the first episode was already the best one. And from that first episode I already felt like I knew what Jeffrey Dahmer was all about. Evan Peter's portrayal helped alot with that, he was absolutely fantastic in this. The way he looked, the way he talked... everything made him really unsetteling. Also pretty much all the other actors were amazing!

The way everything looked it felt like you were always there yourself. And the story was told brilliantly. They worked with a lot of timejumps, which was a really good choice.

It was shot to show it from the victims and families perspective. I think that was respectful but they could have gone further. I'm glad there was no actual gruesome scenes showing the kills. It made it much more tasteful.

Jeff is sweaty all the time as they all are. Haha everyone smokes and there is no air con.

What scares me the most was the overt racism. Made me feel pretty sick to think being white held that much power and it wasn't that long ago. Jeff was so creepy and detached.

Evan did a stunning job. Oh but the contacts he wears in the poster aren't real. Evan has brown eyes as did Jeff in the show or they looked it That was disappointing as I felt the pale eyes would have made him seem more predatory.

672,672,10.0,1 October 2022,"Finished watching ""Dahmer - Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story"". It is quite good watch. In a sense, that artistically it is good, like the somewhat sticky atmosphere, and minor details, that would normally be glossed over. There was 1 thing, that I did not like and 1 that I think could have been better.

During the 1st episodes, which were focusing on Dahmer himself, there were a lot of time jumps, which did not make much sense to do at all. I am not talking about some sort of flashbacks, but literal ""jumps"" in the middle of the episode. I would not mind them, if it was clear which of the scenes are ""the past"", but unless we were seeing Dahmer as a kid - it was quite difficult to distinguish. I believe this story would be much better as something more linear.

Which was proved right in the 2nd part of the series, which unfortunately had a different issue for me: it focused on people around Dahmer or his victims. Granted, those stories probably needed to be told, especially those after he was caught. But there were at least 2 episodes that were taking place during his killings, while in the main ""continuity"" of the series he was caught twice already: in the beginning of the series, and then in the middle of it, as we ""relived"" the event with some more details.

I guess, in a way, my 2nd complaint is very similar to the 1st one: those events should have happened in a linear fasion. Or, alternatively, as much shorter flashback during court hearings shown later in the series.

But otherwise, it's still quite a compelling story. There is no psychosis or any craziness here. Just monotonous and almost mindless cruelty.","September 21, 2022 (United States)",finished watching dahmer monster the jeffrey dahmer story it is quite good watch in a sense that artistically it is good like the somewhat sticky atmosphere and minor details that would normally be glossed over there was thing that i did not like and that i think could have been better during the st episodes which were focusing on dahmer himself there were a lot of time jumps which did not make much sense to do at all i am not talking about some sort of flashbacks but literal jumps in the middle of the episode i would not mind them if it was clear which of the scenes are the past but unless we were seeing dahmer as a kid it was quite difficult to distinguish i believe this story would be much better as something more linear which was proved right in the nd part of the series which unfortunately had a different issue for me it focused on people around dahmer or his victims granted those stories probably needed to be told especially those after he was caught but there were at least episodes that were taking place during his killings while in the main continuity of the series he was caught twice already in the beginning of the series and then in the middle of it as we relived the event with some more details i guess in a way my nd complaint is very similar to the st one those events should have happened in a linear fasion or alternatively as much shorter flashback during court hearings shown later in the series but otherwise its still quite a compelling story there is no psychosis or any craziness here just monotonous and almost mindless cruelty,POSITIVE

Things that he possibly couldn't know. It's all fiction and filler. Meanwhile you're taken away from what you came for, to learn about Dahmer the Serial Killer and his psyche. There is no real exploration in to that or the horror his victims endured. It's really just a fictional puff piece sprinkled with factual events. And Evan Peters was not the right actor for this. He's just too likeable. You may actually feel sympathy for Jeffrey Dahmer and at times see him as a victim himself.

678,678,9.0,30 September 2022,"The Jeffrey Dahmer Story is an amazingly done series that turns over every stone to help the viewer create their own theory on why Dahmer was the way he was as well as exposing the carelessness of some which certainly led to him continuing to do his awful deeds. We see Dahmer as a teenager already realizing that something is wrong with him and that he needs help. Because of his father's inability to see his cry for help, Dahmer is able to keep navigating his life and struggle due to alcoholism and begin to feed his bloodlust in secret.

The acting in this series is superb from Evan Peters, who portrays the character of Dahmer flawlessly and convincingly as well as Richard Jenkins portraying Lionel Dahmer. Jenkins is one of my favorite character actors and he really makes you empathize with Mr. Dahmer. Most impressive is Niecy Nash's portrayal of Glenda Cleveland. It's hard to believe that Nash went from a mediocre comedy like Reno 911! To this.

There is, of course much social propoganda some of which makes sense but I'm not sure all of it fits the accuracy of the events surrounding Dahmer's misdeeds. I don't buy that Dahmer preyed specifically on blacks. I think this was circumstantial based on the neighborhood he was in. The carelessness of police and possible neglect of black victims portrayed here serves well as a morality tale telling us that we can do better as a society.

682,682,9.0,25 September 2022,"I've seen a lot of people complain or comment on how difficult this series is to watch. But it's supposed to be. I've read a lot on Dahmer and his case and sometimes it's easy to forget that real people with hopes, dreams and day to day troubles died in horrific ways.

Sure there have been dramatisations of serial killers lives before but they typically focus wholeheartedly on their story, with little regard to those who lost their lives.

This show doesn't do this. Yes, there are segments that show insight into Dahmer and his childhood, but it detaches itself from being entirely from his perspective.

This show gives the young men who died a voice, it makes the audience see them as people. Something that is often missing from written accounts of Dahmer and his crimes.

Evan Peters has done a fantastic job, from the blank expressions and monotone voice to the way he moves and recounts Dahmers crimes in the interview scenes. The cast is incredible strong and all have done a wonderful job of portraying those who were impacted.

Lastly, the show largely stuck to what is commonly known about Dahmer and his life. There were moments that weren't fully accurate (the jogger as an example), but, as the real life version was horrendous enough, I'm glad that directors didn't feel the need to embellish things even further for the sake of viewers.

Watching the life of Lyle and Erick Menéndez and the fishy double-life that they needed to present to the society is totally psycho-stunning!

688,688,8.0,17 October 2022,"I couldn't get through the first 15 minutes of the first episode. The tone is completely off. They've written this show like a horror movie which is too good of a treatment for a villain like Jeffrey Dahmer. Jeffrey Dahmer doesn't deserve a TV show. His work doesn't deserve to be glamorized and showcased for a wide audience.

I think this would've been better as a documentary subject where we can give victims and families a voice rather than dramatizing them on screen and also where we could extract broader meaning to what his killings meant and what we cab learn.

I'm not trying to make a moral argument against true crime material. I've consumed as much as anyone, but certain subjects are only properly treated in a specific medium and I don't think TV miniseries is right for Dahmer.

I got heavily invested in Jeffrey Dahmer and fact checking quite a lot of what happened in the series to what happened irl. They really upped a lot of details around his childhood and his living conditions in the apartment for the series - which worked well for the story. These things made the series more interesting, as well as giving it a bigger impact on me. I am glad I fact-checked some stuff because the series really makes it impossible to believe, what was happening was doable for Jeffrey.

The series is obviously not for the faint of heart, but not too heavy on the gore - enough to know what was happening.

692,692,9.0,1 October 2024,"The story starts with two boys brutally murdering their parents without any context at all. Now, everyone is confused that why they did that, even their parents had no idea that this is going to happen.

The story became interesting after they surrendered themselves and the truth about their motivation to kill their parents because of the dark and gritty family secrets they have is unveiled.

I think actor Cooper Koch who played Erik in the show understood the assignment well alomg with the other people in cast. The show is raw, starts a discussion again, because you will be left with many questions once it ends.

The problem is that it is being said, that this adapatation is not true to the real story of the case and how the two brothers were demonized in the show is very wrong which overshadows all the torment they faced in their life.

Overall, the series is really beautifully done as expected by the creators of Dahmer, but then when you dig deep, more research work would have made the show a much better watch.

I've watched this all happen in REAL time, as I was in my 30's when it did.

NOTHING I ever read, no books, no newspaper accounts, or movies, EVER brought this real story to life like this one did!

And...I'll tell you why!

Evan Peters!

The more episodes I watched, the more I felt like Dahmer was portrayed by the most perfect person to do him!

I'm wondering...Evan is a wonderful actor. I haven't missed one episode of American Horror Story, and he's great in everything he's done on it.... BUT, does he feel anything about the fact...that he's the best portrayer of Dahmer ever?

There were times when I actually had to quit watching it, and come back days later to finally finish the series.

I don't remember doing that before, and I've watched everything in my 72 years.

The serie doesn't give victims any attention, they are use like any characters in any series or movies... I really feel it's a bad use of their names... an offence to their memory and the families.

The psychology of the ""Dahmer character"" seems far from reality... I feel like a lot of the script made him sound like someone/something he is not. Lot of what they portrayed as his childhood and all the family stuff along the show is far from reality... Again.

696,696,2.0,7 October 2022,"Very well played. Extremely disturbing. As most of the recent netlix crime stories should be condensed to fewer episodes. I wish Jeff had Dexter step father guidance, its not only the mental aspect of a serial killer, its the very poor parenting or guidance from early age that made this dark passengers resurface.

I am Absolutely NOT taking his side, but objectively speaking, He cried for help, he tried to express his loneliness, he knew there is something extremely wrong within himself, with his sick urges, but nobody listened. I won't fix it here, however, The fact that there are or were people mentally disturbed like Jeff among our society that have or cannot find their place to fit in is very disturbing and should not be overlooked. He was failed by his people who brought him up, and by society too and let for killing splurge.

I feel it must be extremely difficult for the victims relatives to relived this story all over again for sole purpose of public entertainment... it should at least have some impact on us, as society as whole to pay closer attention & listen to one another.

697,697,5.0,24 September 2024,"This isn't just another rehash of the same old story; it's a raw, detailed exploration that brings both the crimes and the systemic failures surrounding them into sharp focus. Monster is an unsettling yet captivating series that dives deep into the mind of one of America's most notorious serial killers, Jeffrey Dahmer.

Evan Peters absolutely nails the role of Dahmer. His portrayal is chilling, nuanced, and shockingly human in the most twisted way possible. You almost feel like you're there, witnessing each horrific moment unfold. The supporting cast, particularly Richard Jenkins as Dahmer's father, also delivers incredible performances that enhance the emotional weight of the series.

However, the series isn't perfect. The timeline jumps around, which can be a little hard to follow, and the pacing in some of the later episodes feels slower than necessary. Still, the overall impact is powerful and stays with you long after the credits roll.","September 21, 2022 (United States)",this isnt just another rehash of the same old story its a raw detailed exploration that brings both the crimes and the systemic failures surrounding them into sharp focus monster is an unsettling yet captivating series that dives deep into the mind of one of americas most notorious serial killers jeffrey dahmer evan peters absolutely nails the role of dahmer his portrayal is chilling nuanced and shockingly human in the most twisted way possible you almost feel like youre there witnessing each horrific moment unfold the supporting cast particularly richard jenkins as dahmers father also delivers incredible performances that enhance the emotional weight of the series however the series isnt perfect the timeline jumps around which can be a little hard to follow and the pacing in some of the later episodes feels slower than necessary still the overall impact is powerful and stays with you long after the credits roll,POSITIVE
698,698,3.0,7 October 2022,"I tried to avoid watching this Series knowing that it would be gruesome. I made sure that I was not hungry and only had a few chips and a coke. You see, I was a TV Broadcast Engineer for a well known national cable news station. I vividly remember this breaking news and how we reported on this from beginning to end.

While working in TV news I thought I had seen just about all the surprising stuff on serial killers. But, Jeffrey Dahmer really shocked the mess out of me! I would talk with anyone that would listen. My two sisters didn't want to hear about it and thought I was crazy for talking about it.

I had decided back then that this guy was pure evil. I didn't care what happened in his childhood that might have made him the monster he had become. Believe me, there is nothing that would cause this absolutely despicable behavior to come about. Can you imagine the innocent victims that fell prey to this predator??? It was unthinkable.

Jeffrey Dahmer was not insane. However, he was not a normal person. He was a psychopath. He was a predator. He was so good at what he did until he was able to get away with it for over a decade. Even he said he knew what he was doing. He did not want to plead insanity. In fact, he wanted to be executed for his crimes. But, Wisconsin did not have the death penalty.

Jeffrey Dahmer consciously lived in a predominately black neighborhood and killed, dismembered, and ate body parts of a lot of his victims. Also, 10 out of the 17 men he murdered were Black Americans. If Dahmer hadn't been caught, he would have continued to do what he did so well.

Dahmer lived in that community knowing that the police would not believe his black female neighbor living in the apartment next door. She and other black neighbors reported on this man repeatedly. Dahmer was so manipulative, cool, and calm that law enforcement believed him instead of his neighbors. He had the perfect cover for his crime and would stalk men that were mostly transient, gay, and non-white. He said that it was because they were the most attractive men in the gay clubs he frequented. But, do you really believe that? Well... I don't.

The series was great and these things actually happened. The actor resembles Jeffrey Dahmer and he had his mannerisms. When you really get down to it, criminals (serial killers) like Jeffrey Dahmer, want to be famous. They want to be noticed, to be known, to be talked about. They want to be a Serial Killer Legend. Dahmer really enjoyed all of this and when it was over and he was in prison he could sit back and enjoy the adulation from his fans from all over the world.

I'm glad Dahmer met his fate.

See the Series.

703,703,4.0,25 September 2022,"Another brilliant performance from Evan Peters, as well as Richard Jenkins. The series had a good pace, kept our interest through our binge nights--usually 2-3 episodes a night. Peters captures the mannerisms of Dahmer very well, from his almost-distant gaze, to his way of speaking. Jenkins did a superb job as a distraught father torn to pieces at the idea he may have made his son into the man that fascinated the nation with his disturbing crimes. Definitely one of the better iterations I have seen on Dahmer--solely due to Evan Peters' portayal.

The only negatives I would mention that actually annoyed me while I was watching were the fact that it jumped around so much, with the flash-backs and flash-fowards, it just became too confusing at times, especially when they started repeating scenes that we had seen earlier, just not in their entirety. It just became too muddy sometimes. The other negative is that they concentrated too much on his neighbor. Given the fact he lived next door to her gave her character relevance to the story, but it didn't warrant the amount of story and dialogue we had to endure. I found myself asking the question, why is any of this important to the main story? And the answer was, and is, that it's not. The series, although very well done, and obviously we'll acted, could have been shortened by a full episode by eliminating the need to flesh out her story. It wasn't necessary. She wasn't a victim, she just lived next door. And the fact that she always brought Dahmer up to co-workers, when one of them mentions how Gacy was the worst-of-the-worst, and she says her neighbor was and asks her if she ever smelled a dead body. It was just stupid writing and didn't need to be in there, all it did was fill up time and take focus off of Dahmer and the families of the victims.

Overall, the main actors did a superb job and the series was very well made. I already knew the Dahmer story, as I do most of the other famous serial killers, but it was nice to see the minor details that aren't always made known in other sources, and this series did a good job fleshing those out.

However, I my opinion, repeatedly telling the side of the victim and their families takes away from the fact that Jeffery Dahmer was a demonic person. The victim storyline, while extremely accurate, gave the writers to attempt to show Dahmer as a sympathetic individual...which he was not.

The framing of who the real 'monsters' are is inconsistent to the point where I can't determine what Ryan Murphy wanted to accomplish with it. Did he want the viewers to side with the brothers or the parents? Did he want them to side with anyone?

In one episode Erik and Lyle are presented to be sympathetic to the viewer, like the scene with Lyle and Jose at the cemetery, with Jose shouting at Lyle for his suspension from Princeton, stating he is unworthy of being buried among other successful figures, and cruelly comparing his 'disobedience' to their dog. Yet in another episode we're shown Jose's perspective, in which Lyle's academic misconduct is what thwarted his latest attempt at 'mending' the family. As if that justifies his behaviour.

The last episode is the worst, however. The viewers are positioned to feel sad when Erik and Lyle receive their life sentences, get sent to separate prisons, and their vans part ways. But then there's a cut back to a conversation on the fishing trip, where they evilly conspire to murder their naive parents.

737,737,5.0,22 September 2022,"Realizing this is called Jeffrey Dahmer: Monster, Evan Peters, who is producer Ryan Murphy's own personal go-to pawn, ala Malcolm McDowell from Clockwork Orange, seems to be literally playing a monster, and a brain-dead zombie at that...

To think all those gay men were picked up on, and allowed themselves to be taken to the apartment of, a guy who could hardly function, could hardly even walk down the street without seeming like he's about to burst... A guy so monotone, robotic and sleazy anyone with a brain would run the opposite direction...

That's how Peters decided to play an actual non-fiction person, who was, indeed, a human monster, but the monster comes from what he did when he got what he wanted and was able to DO what he wanted...

But the problem here is there's no character-arc for Dahmner... He starts out a droning freak and winds up the same way... As for his accent, it seems unnatural and put-on... performed...

Meanwhile the pace doesn't flow; it's a real slog to get through.... There are so many interesting aspects of Dahmer's life to be studied, to experience, and yet the entire thing feels like it's deliberately slow-motion-arthouse-weird for the sake of style instead of substance...

Through school, through the army, through gay bar hookups, through everything in Dahmer's entire life including interrogation, he's a one-dimensional cardboard-cutout of how a novice acting student would IMAGINE a crazy person to be...

And many good reviews are noting how off-putting and creepy this is, but... if everything's off-putting, what's there to compare it with? In fact, most of the other characters, from his victims to bosses to the police and especially Richard Jenkins as his dad, are equally as stone-faced and drowsy...

Rather reluctantly at first; the subject matter is not exactly ""nice"" viewing. If it were going to be a bloodbath, it would have been a no-go.

But it is instead a dark, brooding psychological study. Well scripted, directed, and acted; it is a superior crime drama, all told.

Evan Peters in the title role is crazy good. He completely captures the strangeness and unease of Dahmer.

However. Peters is not believable in looks as someone who had the power to lure men to his place. His face is hard and rather homely. You see in the early 80s mug shots the real Dahmer who had borderline blond porn-star looks, a kind of facial prettiness that could plausibly be a ""bait"" snare.

752,752,5.0,16 October 2022,"This is not the sort of series I generally give a 5. Normally, this would be a 6 or a 7. The cinematography is competent, sometimes good. The production and art design is generally pretty good. The writing is more than adequate, it satisfies and more. The performances are probably the best part, they're actually very compelling; in fact, my curiosity tp see Evan Peters in this role is the only reason I gave Dahmer a shot. But, I digress: shows with above average quality normally get an above average rating from me, except in cases where the show had a damaging effect on the world (for example, the South Park episode that accidentally created gingerism), or which deal with sensitive subject matter insensitively and without a necessary level of tact.

Dahmer uses the story of Jeffrey Dahmer for a sensational story with a famous serial killer name brand for extra viewership, but the show never deals with or addresses the effects it might have on the living victims and family of the man himself. I didn't realize this when I started the show, and didn't think too research until halfway through, that Jeffrey Dahmer's parents may still be alive. His father is. I don't know about you, but having seen the series and it's portrayal of Lionel Dahmer, I don't like that one bit. The series never talked to the victims' relatives, either. That's my main issue, but it's a big one. I don't think that you could, in good conscience, make a biopic about a serial killer without talking to the people who live with that trauma every day. It's disrespectful.

As well, I think that the changes made to the true story were often morally questionable, such as the depiction of Steven Hicks' murder, which was made significantly less egregious and unjustifiable than the true story. It's not like they made it seem reasonable; but certainly less deranged and much more understandable given the context. I think that the gruesome and horrifying details this show occasionally decides to dance around would make an equally compelling story that the semi truth they choose to tell, and therefore I cannot see any good reason behind it. Even more egregious is the fictional depiction of Jeffrey Dahmer and Tony Hughes as having a reltionship, when in fact Tony was killed just like all the others: the night they met Jeffrey. I found this fabricated friendship between the two to be grossly inappropriate and wholly unnecessary. They could have invented a fake person, instead of distorting the image and life of a real human victim.

760,760,5.0,2 October 2022,"Just because Dahmer was gay does not mean that his story needed a major Ryan Murphy treatment. This retelling of the life of the infamous gay white serial killer through the white lens of Dahmer and Murphy was repugnant in its grotesque insensitivity to the victims of colour, their families, and the gay men of colour who to this day remain vulnerable members of the white-dominated gay community.

Casting Dahmer so centrally in this bloated 10-episode biopic is a reminder of how disposable and unimportant his mostly ethnic victims were. Why did he not target more gay white men? Ostensibly because they were not as marginalised as his non-white victims were. Gay people of colour remain cheap commodities for gay white men who could not hack it with their own kind. When gay white men like Murphy produce and endorse shows like these, they only increase the sexual dominance and capital of gay white men.

762,762,1.0,19 September 2024,"In Murphy fashion, he definitely takes obscure actors and gives them the opportunity to show their greatness. Excellent acting by the two leads but the material is boring and drawn out. Season 2 seems more like it's being used as a case for a lesser sentence of manslaughter rather than murder. I dare say a cry to get the Menendez out of jail. I have no doubt these guys had a very difficult upbringing, but unfortunately, it's nothing that many other children before and after them have experienced. How many of those children killed their parents with 16 shots from shotguns?

There are some interesting side stories but not enough to keep me from fast forwarding many scenes. So, for me, this season is just ok. But in Murphy's defense, this season should not be compared to season one. The Menendez brothers are sociopaths who decided they wanted freedom from their parents and live the high life with their money.

Taken in as a full 10 hours this became, for me, less than just about Jeffrey & more of an epic composition of stories of different people all of whom became caught up in the ensuing cat-5 this story would become.

768,768,3.0,29 September 2022,"There are several cinematic/tv accounts of Dahmer's life and all are dogged by the 'director down the rabbit hole' syndrome this story seems to bring.

Though they have moments of clarity generally they then plod mechanically through the telling of a now well known story lacking fresh insight or perspective and already subject to wide exposure via documentary, books and news accounts.

There is this repeat failure to get inside the head of Dahmer. Confrontation with such a formidable obsticle causes alot of narrative shuffling and substituting which in the end fails the work as a whole with defeat often acknowldged via a cap donning to a percieved exceptionalism directors in the end attribute to Dahmer himself.

Dahmer Monster - initially tries to avoid this scenario but almost immediatly shows the tell tale signs of having completely failed in much the same way as previous works have.

The compulsion to tell Dahmer's story still exists because his story has still not been fully understood nor fully layed bare. It's this inticement which will ensure he remains subject matter for future story telling.

So how should a director tackle what still needs to be told in this story ? There are a couple of key methodologies required.

First, do not make up parts of the story which simply did not happen. Dahmer Monster does this endlessely and it's the reason the director/s have blocked their own way into Dahmer's mind creating for the most part a voyeuristic meditiation on the impenitrable. The Dahmer story is like theatrcial classics in this respect. When doing plays like Shakespeare or any number of operas you never cut or alter the story. You bring to the story new information and resonance and you find ways to weave it in so as to amplify what is already there. Dahmer Monster strays so far from this rule it's no wonder it's being percieved as exploitative.

Dahmer's story has many key sensationalist, indeed infamous moments which successive directors are both initially drawn to and then repelled by as increasingly entangled in this dychotomy, they end up creating pieces which are more about the neccessity of a visual moral ettiquette rather than Dahmer the subject. This is again detectable in Dahmer Monster.

It needs to be noted that Dahmer himself invented and directed his own narrative and emphasis of detail when he fully confessed his crimes. Dahmer's control of his exceptionalism as sensational curio remains dominant in tellings of his story to date. The benefit of the doubt remains entirely in tact. The surviving police, detectives, journalists and authors are relient on the same because their reputations and life's work is invested so absolutly in it.

But look more closely at the repeat absences, gaps, jumps, and skips which occur in the repeat telling of Dahmer's story and you begin to see what Dahmer chose not to promote in his own myth making.

There lies a chain of unexamined key events and it is these which will finally enable entry into Dahmer's mind. Listed below are some of those details which if re-arranged so as to consitute the main part of his early story at least, tell a different story, of slow, natural, agonising, morose, mundane, ugly , calculating corruption and failure which speaks far less of exceptionalism and more of similarity to others like him.

1. An established acute alcoholism, dependant on spirits like vodka by the age of 14 maintained by chronic bouts drinking secretly both in and out of school remains highly anomalous and entirely unexplored as the sensational visual drama it actually is.

2. The comorbidity of deviant masturbation coupled with an increasingly evident indication of being highly skilled in the killing of animals where both are associated with his hyper private world of animal disection. The latter is a classic symptom of pre homicidality and links hime to the assured confidence by which he assumes the postition of assailant to a local jogger. All together these suggest the ferment of a homicidal, necrophile mindset fulled by alcohol misuse and even intoxification by chemicals used to preserve animal parts to the extent that murder and disection were very much part of the sexually contempleative minde set at the point of his first murder. I.e. Dahmer didn't stumble a nieve innocent into murder, he slowely developed and nurtured a precocious necrophile intent from his early teens and therefore cunning and calculation formed much of his creating situations in which harm or murder might occur. This is really important to establish because it alters his own versions of future murders to come all of which he sees himself simply as a passive anassuming protagonist subject to impulses he remains unaware of.

3. There are repeats of gaps Dahmer himself set in his own story. The gaps of no mention of his relationship to sexual exhibitionism / flashing, a chronic activity for which he was prosecuted once but which he engaged with on numerous occassions, particually when stationed in the army in Germany. Dahmer Monster clumbsily attempts to 'interpret' this as a recall of his first victim Wicks. But actually it's much more likley that Dahmer's exhibitionism is constituted of a kind of display of exceptionalism and sense of being other worldly and able to access rules outside the norm. In short he's sticking 2 fingers at the world whilst at the same time presenting himself as a product of their society. There's alot to be teased out here and it's telling Dahmer makes no mention of it as part of his conffession.

4. New information arrives all the time as time passes. Today we know he sexually raped and abused his room mates in Germany over a period of time whilst consuming huge quantities of alcohol and engaging in sexual exhibitionism in the local town, partoicually towards mothers and children. We know one night he inexplicably returned to a party with blood spots after storming off in a rage. We also know that his discharge was in many respects a cover up. All of this is repeatedly absent from Dahmers myth. Why ? Because it again presents Dahmer as a methodical abuser, seeking pleasure in any kind of subversive abuse he was able to access.

5. We also now know after the shame of being discharged from the army he delayed return home to his father and Wick's body, by spending time in Miami living with an english girl he led into a discussion about marrying. She was to join him once he returned home. But he omits any detail about Miami what so ever. So there's alot to consider about what he's really up to and going through while he's in some sense hiding in the light of this woman's innocents of his true nature.

6. Crucially a key symbols is repeatedly misunderstood. The existance of Wick's stashed whole skeletal remains at his father's home during the entire time in the army and Miami. Wick's body was decapitated as part of an essentially immeidiate and precoious need to deviginise his necrophile sensabilites. After his near capture, the body has to have been presereved for a deeper reason. It's preservation has to have acted as both a deterrant and mutually a draw. The body drew him back because it punctuates the narrative of homicidal Dahmer. It haunts his time in the army and Miami. It dominates his persona when he returns home to his father, completely incapable of making personal choices to an exagerated degree. The final destrcution of Wick's bones is an important moment because it simultaneously marks a desire to erase his deeds whilst also expressing yet more of the creative potential for absolute power inherent in the experience of necrophillia.

What we have here are neccessary re-examinations of parts already presented. Sadly Dahmer: Monster fails to bring the focus and integrity required to animate these calcualtingly ommited parts. It's noted that all this has occured by the time Dahmer is only 21 years old. He hasn't even began his killing career.

When it comes to his preented 2nd killing, in Dahmer's version the precise moment his serial killing career begins, at the Ambassador hotel the excepted narrative has to change. Dahmer presents as a highly proficient serial drug rapist who without knowing it 'accidentally' beat Tuomi to death. However if you alter the historical narrative by filling in gaps, Dahmer is transformed into a repeat perfecting and rehursing homicidal necrophile who has to some degree planned for the moment of murder. From that point on Dahmer's precocious proffessionalism is maintained as a central aspect of his decent into lustful oblivion. But the mess of rising frenzy isn't reflective of that fallacy. The penultimate frenzy arisies from the conflict which arises in the face of an absolute degree of satation of desire not in a dissacoated amateur and unaware mindset.

It's this absolute control of the accepted narrative Dahmer still has over the way he is presented as a protagonist in his own story which needs to be challenged and which remains frustratingly intact given the arrival of Dahmer Monster. Somebody must bring him down. The exceptionalism here lies not in Dahmer but in Society's capacity to examine an emerging, common understanding of taboo desires as they exist across those who have them.","September 21, 2022

I was glued to this series the first few episodes but the tone and pace changes about halfway through and my interest level dropped. The jumping from scene to scene started making it hard to keep my attention. What really made me lose interest is when it the story line went woke.

778,778,1.0,26 September 2022,"This show was way too drawn out. Did we really need 10 almost 1 hour long episodes? This series should have been trimmed to a maximum of six episodes. I am noticing this trend with these true-life crime dramas to extended them well beyond what the story structure can support (Under the Banner of Heaven, The Staircase to name some recent few) which results in the series plodding along with a lot of dead time instead of being a tight, brisk and thrilling watch.

While I enjoyed it, I thought Evan Peters performance of Dahmer was very one note and a bit of a disappointment to be honest. For me Richard Jenkins as Lionel Dahmer quietly steals the show. Niecy Nash also gives an honest and enjoyable performance as Glenda Cleaveland, Dahmer's next door neighbor who had to put up with all the smells and noises coming from his apartment and who on many an occasion called the police because of the terrifying sounds she heard coming out of the grating that connected her apartment and his, but was simply ignored by the local police.

I will say Episode 6 was a punch to the gut though as they focus on one one of his victims, Tony Hughs, which was just heart-rending to watch. I found myself wanting to shout out at the screen to warn poor Tony once his path crossed with Dahmer's and so desperately wished for him to be one of those victims that managed to escape with their lives intact, but this was not to be the case.

One of the biggest sins this show commits (and one I am sure could have been alleviated with less episodes) is that it's boring and I am a true-life crime enthusiast. When you have your viewers falling asleep throughout the show (and during the day too since it was a daytime watch) about one of the most notorious and gruesome serial killers to have ever existed, then that tells you something is definitely wrong with the pacing of your show, as is evident here.

On a side bar note : - Why these people even went into a house/flat that smelled of rotting flesh is beyond me. Our bodies are hard-wired to be repulsed by that smell. Even if the bloke wasn't a serial killer, my hygiene buttons would have been pushed to their limits.

779,779,5.0,24 September 2022,"So far I've seen four episodes, overall I think it's too slow. There's already been so many works done on the Dahmer story. Capping this at four one-hour long episodes could have been accomplished.

The series is full of peaks and valleys, mostly the latter. I can't say it's a binge worthy series- usually I'm not eager to flip to the next episode right away (like I was with Netflix's ""You"" or Apple TV's ""Severance""). I think the camera work is astonishing and Evan Peters and Richard Jenkins do a good portrayal of Jeff and Lionel Dahmer respectively. It's definitely a grotesque and unpleasant series to watch, but it's tolerable in terms of Netflix content. I particularly like the scenes of Jeff speaking with the cops (while Jeff is pulled over and when they visit his apartment) and psychologist. This all helps us enter the deranged character's psyche.

The fervent interest in Dahmer's mental state, fetishes, and killings makes sense, but the creators are putting in too many extraneous details. We don't really need to see the Dahmer's before Jeff was born, Joyce Dahmer's work life or addiction, or Jeff's extended interactions with a mannequin or his erotic magazines. Those are just a few examples, but the constant oscillation of the time period can also get confusing. This simply wasn't streamlined and it's hard to tell what the focus is.

So I can recommend giving it a chance just for the shock factor.

Sure, it was well acted and they set it well in that time period, but... No.

The time jump all over the place just irritated me. I never like when shows do that. It makes it difficult to keep track of where you're supposed to be.

And probably the thing that took me out of it the most, was the families and the neighbours. This just highlighted it was a TV show and not a documentary.

792,792,2.0,11 October 2022,"The main problem with this series is that it stretches some very thin material to an almost unbearably slow run time. As so often with TV series, it's 90% filler, and the narrative thrust gets lost.

This would have worked much better as a movie.

Much of the scenes are unnecessary or drawn out in a way that could be shortened otherwise.

Sounds of Dahmer doing his horror stuff run over a black screen at one point. This could have been more efficiently handled by doing an L cut and having them run over scenes of seeming normality. Or scenes of his neighbor. There's a story to tell here about police incompetence and Dahmer using his homosexuality as a shield to prevent people from snooping around, or reinforce their stereotype of gay people being weird enough to not investigate the smell and disappearing people. The entire case is a textbook example of police incompetence.

The narrative structure is further damaged by the time jumps, which are completely unnecessary in a documentary style series. Tarantino can get away with nonlinear story telling. This material here cannot.

Aside from the runtime and narrative focus, the series' biggest detriment is its raison d'etre. Why was this made? Did we really need another series after several movies and series that exploits this tragedy for cheap thrills? Worst of all is the pretense of trying to ""give a face to the victims."" Yeah right. That's why the series is titled ""Dahmer"". It's exploitation of a tragedy, pure and simple.

Now granted, this can still be entertaining or interesting if done right. And a lot of it is interesting. Aside from the curious aspects of the actual case, the acting here is brilliant by everyone involved, especially the lead. He absolutely nails his portrayal of Dahmer with all the small vulnerabilities and the cunning and depravity.

If you have nothing better to do and are interested in the case, it's certainly worth watching for the acting alone.

If you're looking for horror thrills, you'll be disappointed, since most of the violence isn't shown.

If you enjoy faster paced storytelling or expect new information, you will be sorely disappointed. Maybe as with many series there will be a 2 hour fanedit version eventually that can fix the pacing issues. But even so.. you're not missing out on anything of substance by skipping this.

820,820,3.0,28 September 2022,"While this mini-series is well produced and directed it doesn't quite hit the mark. A big part of it is Evan Peters portrayal. I really like him as a actor but he has too much humanity to play this role. The real Jeffrey Dahmer is vacant and robotic. He has no humanity, at all.

Richard Jenkins does his usual great job as a father who tries to reach and save his son. He is a semi-tragic character as he makes wrong decisions time after time in his efforts. It forces you to think any effort to reach Dahmer was probably doomed from the start.

There's no procedural drama here but the series makes it clear why that is. Many times Dahmer should've been caught but the police views on gays and minorities meant the cases weren't taken seriously.

The sixth episode is the hardest to watch but it also is the one that most clearly shows the impact of Dahmer's horrible crimes on the families. It also drives home that these people weren't just 'victims'. They were real human beings with hopes and dreams.

A series on Dahmer was always bound to have problems, so, for the most part this production is pretty strong. It's not an easy watch but is probably a must for true crime fans.

The recounting of how the boys were molested by their father is endless, with one episode focused solely on that. That episode I ended up skipping- it comprised of one over the shoulder shot focusing on Erik who was once again telling how his father molested him. That's it.

825,825,4.0,25 September 2022,"First, the acting, direction and script seemed sound. The problem is, Dahmer is pathetic in a way that makes for a boring story. I am a sucker for downer movies, and this is not out of revulsion for Dahmer, but this was a waste of time and resources. I don't think it's possible to make a good story about him unless you completely fictionalized his life story. One redeeming lesson: don't encourage your kids to play with road kill.

All in all, it would be a good thing if there were no longer a demand for serial killer miniseries, particularly where the effort is to try to stay close to real life events. By comparison, Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer was a good movie because it took a pretty bleak storyline from a true story and worked with a serious, thoughtful script.

As for the series, it did not do justice to the actual emotions that went with such a horrible crime spree. At the end it tried to glorify Dahmer as a changed man just because he accepted religion.

833,833,7.22,20 January 2023,"This is basically a big cash grab freak show with the real events either drastically tainted and twisted, or not on screen at all.

The most egregious of these falsehoods is Niecy Nash playing Glenda Cleveland (now deceased over a decade) standing in for Pamela Bass, Dahmer's real next-door neighbor, who actually got along *well* with Dahmer. Cleveland did try to save a real victim of Dahmer's but in reality, occupied less than a footnote in the true story. This is all very well-known and has been elucidated in at least 4 other movies, almost all of which are better than this crappy Ryan Murphy dupli-series.

Not all of it is abysmal. Richard Jenkins has Lionel Dahmer down to his facial tics and speech rhythms, and the other bigger name actors provide similarly strong support.

But how could any of them --- especially Niecy Nash! --- go along with this rancid fictionalization? There are a few odd events that make it in here due to the long long running time but very few are completely accurate.

Without more than a shred of truth, this becomes just a long morose Lifetime trash fire.

If you're really interested in the horror show of Dahmer, watch ""The Jeffrey Dahmer Files"" --- an experimental documentary with the REAL neighbor, Pamela Bass. Or Jeremy Renner's early portrayal in the indie movie Dahmer (before he became famous). Both knock the crap out of this pablum.

And Evan Peters really just sleepwalks through the title role here, providing no real insights. I think Netflix was terrified to portray Dahmer as anything but one-dimensional, so here we get Peters doing Martin Starr's Bill Haverchuck from Freaks and Geeks for ten episodes straight.

Sure creepy, scary etc. But this will just leave a bad taste in your mouth and nothing much else to be honest. I wanted to watch his next kill, what it will be, his development but he was just an alcoholic homo mess that was doing weird stuff... Waste of time unless you enjoy studying such crap.

There are much better things to watch like real interviews with serial killers (Kuklinski) where you can see them and their real-life reactions or the lack of them/etc. This... just a cheap show that thrives on creepy stuff/kills and nothing else really...

845,845,7.22,13 October 2024,"The Menendez Brothers is probably the worst series I've ever seen. An insult to the medium of ""television"" shows. At least the Dahmer series was somewhat interesting in its horrificness (if that's a word), and explored something of the human condition.

This series was boring, uninspired and could have been dealt with in two 45 minute episodes.

Like the Dahmer series, I would ask, who the heck was this even made for? Its a sad state of affairs that Netflix thinks this is good content. They think they can string together a couple of good scenes and somehow use child abuse to humanise cold blooded murderers. Minus 10 out of ten stars.

It was uninspired money grabbing trash. If you haven't seen it, don't waste your time.

I would rather watch an actual murder than watch that series again.

And the actors go on tour after the series talking about how the murderers are such good people and try so hard in prison and do such good things, after shooting their mum and dad many times with shotguns in the face and body and mutilating them. Oh, but they read poetry in prison and are completing university degrees. Such good upstanding young men.

They are just dumb, run-of-the-mill psychopaths who got caught. There is no redeeming quality in either of these men, and the fact that they still try to claim innocense is testament to that. At least Dahmer fessed up to it all. These men are scum and should rot in hell.
