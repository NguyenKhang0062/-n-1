0,1.0,27 November 2011,"Do not look at this through the prism of ""Foreign Films"". You'd be wasting your time and miss something far too important.

Hollywood does scale like nobody else, leaving the competition gasping in its wake. France does intimacy, and brutality. Nothing is sacred. And rather than try to revive the New Wave or emulate Hollywood like most widely seen French films of late, ""Intouchables"" harnesses its core strengths - ease with intimacy, willingness to ridicule anything and brutal honesty - and delivers one of the funniest, most honest and touching films I have ever seen.

Sy is a failed robber, going through the motions and playing the stereotypical jobless émigré. Cluzet is a romantic and melancholy mind trapped in a useless body. The circumstances that bring them together are too funny to spoil here, but meet they do, and an awkward relationship quickly blossoms as they bring out the best in each other.

The film's simplicity is delightfully misleading: the script is a masterpiece of comedy writing, and however good the rest of the cast is, the central duo is magical. Sy's comic timing will have you in stitches, but it is his honesty and vulnerability that make you fall in love with the character. Cluzet isn't your typical sad-sack, instead, much of the finest pleasures in the film consist in watching him use his keen mind to mess with the world around him (a subplot about an abstract painting really takes the biscuit, you'll know it when you see it).

This is one of the most unique, beautiful and honest friendships ever committed to film. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry... a delightful celebration of everything in life that makes it worthwhile.","November 2, 2011 (France)"
1,1.0,10 January 2012,"I am now trying to find words to describe this movie for an hour. I couldn't.

You've seen it, or you haven't. It's monumental and outrageously good.

The cast is brilliant. The jokes lovely. The story and the idea behind the movie is beautiful. Especially when you've worked/lived with handicapped people. The music is such a perfect choice, it is unbelievable.

I hope this movie makes a plenty of people think about how good their life is and how bad it could have been.

Bottom line: Oscar-worthy. Period.","November 2, 2011 (France)"
2,1.0,17 January 2012,"In less than two months, ""Untouchable"" became the second most successful French film by number of spectators, such an event by itself that people went then to see it, not because they thought it was good but to see what was so good in it: that's the virtual circle of success.

My biggest disappointment in 2011 was with ""The Tree of Life"", a movie I sincerely wanted to love but couldn't, and I left the theater before it ended with a bitter taste of frustration. Proportionally, my greatest positive surprise came with ""Untouchable"" because it was the opposite expectation: I was sure I would dislike it, figuring the movie manipulated viewers through the overused device of the improbable friendship. Why such preconceived negativity? Well, when a young black guy from French suburbs, darkly depicted in Mathieu Kassovitz 'Hate' and infamous for its occasional riots, befriends a rich quadriplegic, I immediately think of 'good feelings', 'mainstream populism'  unaware that I apply to myself a cynical judgment that can undermine my very way to enjoy not just this film, but any film. After all, why getting ready for hatred when it's so relieving to give the benefit of the doubt and get ready for appreciation? Especially since more than 15 millions of French people, from different ages and backgrounds liked it.

So, I saw it  and loved it.

The story of ""Untouchable"" is the kind of unintentional masterpiece that only movies can provide every once in a while, it has no other pretension than to depict a magnificent and inspiring friendship story starting as a simple job. A young man with a Senegalese background, Omar Sy as Driss, only needs a signature to prove that he attended an interview for a live-in carer job. For some strange reason, Paul, the rich man, played by a wonderful François Cluzet, gives him the job, with a one-month trial period. The reason of this choice is smoothly handled by the script: the film starts with all the job applicants, every one of them unnaturally posing and getting mixed in prepared answers. Then, Driss casually enters, without waiting for his turn or knocking on the door, he's got enough problems to deal with, unemployment, an experience in jail, being a pariah for society, and undesirable even in his own family, especially her adoptive aunt. Driss' attitude pleases Paul, because after his paragliding accident, he can't feel his body from neck to toes, and needs caring almost 24 hours per days and 7 days per week, so he really doesn't have time for bullshit either.

And this is a remarkable aspect in the script written by the two directors Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakache: it doesn't waste time cementing the friendship, the two leads rapidly get fond of each other, a feeling illustrated in the poster with both posing with natural smiles. The film shows Omar's struggle to learn how 'needy' Paul is, which provides some priceless comedic moments, but ""Untouchable"" goes immediately to the core, an eye-opening message about the life endured by a handicapped person, making all the wealth in the world pointless and the richness of heart and mind, priceless. Through Driss and Paul's interaction, the film explores the real needs of people in life, respect and understanding, acceptance and love. Maybe if it was handled by other directors, it would have been predictable but in ""Untouchable"", the complicity between the two heroes feels absolutely real. There's one scene when Driss shave the bushy beard of Paul, well, I won't spoil it for you, but the part was a clever mix of realism and comedy because anyone would have done what Driss did at one moment, and that's the secret of the film: it feels real.

Some movies can work with a good story but they need good performances, in ""Untouchable"", it's almost impossible to determine who carried the film, both Cluzet and Sy were great. And I don't get the complaints: why they didn't respect the original story where the carer was an Arab, or how they 'sugarcoated' the handicap? I even heard that in America, they were accusing the film of racism because Driss was portrayed as a sort of (I quote) 'helper monkey'? Seriously, this is getting old The way handicap is approached never flirts with an exaggerated pathos, nor the opposite, which is the most intelligent achievement. There's a sort of heart's intelligence in the way Omar teases Cluzet with his own handicap, and the film provides the extraordinary message that pleasure and thrills have unlimited media, whether they come from pot, an ear-massage or even paragliding.

Many of Paul's friends criticizes the presence of Driss in Paul's life, but Paul doesn't care: Omar is a man full of life, big, tall and strong, and when he uses violence to teach a man the respect of a parking sign, Paul admits this is the right method. Both are in the same wavelength. I wondered if the title ""Untouchable"" referred to the lowest caste in India, echoing the two men's conditions, both outcasts physically and socially, but I guess, their relationship evolves into a friendship precisely because they're both strong-minded, and together, they become even stronger, until getting untouchables ... in the noblest meaning of the word.

There are real people in ""Untouchable"", nothing works as plot devices even if some situations are so cinematically appealing: Omar inviting everybody to dance during Paul's birthday, his learning of the aristocratic world, the art of abstract painting, and the way he breaks the conventions with an unconventional charisma reaches a level of energetic comedy that reminds of the greatest days of Eddie Murphy, with Cluzet as a perfect straight-man not deprived from a sense of humor. ""Untouchable"" is simply an inspiring story of friendship with whatever defines this beautiful virtue.

And yes, it's one of the best French films ever, and certainly one of the best of 2011.","November 2, 2011 (France)"
3,9.0,14 November 2011,"Being french and a film maker myself, I have high standards for ratings, and this one definitely deserves in 10/10. I've not seen a film showing our world with such humour in a long time. The jokes are absurd and possibly, with a touch of British humour to them. The directing is beautiful, the acting is incredible, the shots are somehow truthful, if I can say that about a shot. It may be Omar Sy's first time in a leading role, for a major production, but he really delivered, and not just in the funny parts, the delivery of emotions was just spotless. Francois Cluzet was also just as brilliant, as he usually is. I will be recommending this film to everyone, and seriously hoping it will be released in the UK soon enough for me to see it again! Only negative aspect... the Americans are thinking of doing a remake... why do they always have to? I mean would you reconsider remaking the ""Joconde"" or the Sixtine Chapel to American standards? Film is an art like any other, it travels the world as it is... no need for remakes...","November 2, 2011 (France)"
4,1.0,28 December 2011,"It has been 9 weeks now since Intoucblaes has come to the movie theaters. I did not give it much thought at first, but the universal acclaim I have heard convinced me to go see it. I don't over-stating the universality of the acclaim, people of various races, classes, colors & countries told me it was a must see. I had no expectations, and I was floored.

Intouchables, directed by Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakache, starring Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy is possibly the best French movie of the year. This is not because of a lack of worthy contenders, but truly because Intouchables is that profound. It touches on themes of presumptions, social class difference, health, and as naïve as it may sound, the universality of humanity.

The story is not as important as is the relationship that is displayed between the two protagonists. Philippe (played by Cluzet) a rich aristocrat that loves adrenaline rushes finds himself a paraplegic after a paragliding incident. Driss (played by Sy) is, in appearance a typical hoodlum from the ghetto. The two are brought together and wonders happen.

The audience then sees how the men affect one another as they engage in a truly honest relationship. Driss is charismatic, lighthearted and funny, helping make Philippe's life enjoyable again. In the process the traditionally cold French aristocracy around Philippe warms up and lightens. He is like a hot knife through cold butter.

Again, it is not so much the story that is important as is the social commentary. The commentary is not judgmental and is very subtle, revealed only in the contrasts the director chose in the story and its contexts. His method reminded me of a sort of Zen approach to comedy. One example you can catch from the trailer alone is the contrast between the able bodied black Driss and t the crippled white man, etc.

The audience is also given wonderful sights of Paris and France as we go through the Pyrenees, Cabourg and the various streets of Paris.

On paper the review does not make the movie justice. It is hilarious in a way that is true, honest and by which anyone can relate to. Most importantly it is revealing and comforting in its reminder of the essential in life : love. It's approach is simple, pure and honest and that makes it worthy of the title of ""best movie of the year"".

I cannot say more; the film must be experienced. My friends tried, they failed, so I trusted them and I saw it. It floored me. Go and be floored.

PS - I heard American studios have purchased the rights for the film. They will need a brilliant director, screenwriters and perfect actors to make the original justice in the way ""The Departed"" did for ""Infernal Affairs"".","November 2, 2011 (France)"
5,1.0,20 November 2011,"Well, I've just got out of the theater and i must say that all the reviews are right. this is an amazing film! The actors are simply the best, Omar is not only a great comic but also a great actor.

The filming has a certain touch that brings to mind ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" in the way the director was able to capture not only the suffering of Phillip but also the joy.

Not wanting to spoil the film for others, i highly recommend seeing this in the theaters and with a loved one.

It is also a good film for teenagers as it holds a few wonderful life lessons.

6,9.0,7 January 2012,"Just seen last night, amazing movie, great performances from actors, particularly from Omar, and Cluzet is great as usual. Photography of images are great, supported by good choice of locations supporting actors are all good and natural so doing a great job to give a great solid base to the story. RIch of emotions on a simple story where ordinary people become extraordinary. Good representation of social differences in France without being too heavy on it. Simple, beautiful, efficient, like a good French cuisine, making a great dish full of tastes magically mixed :) Most to be watched and even more emotional when you know its based on true story !","November 2, 2011 (France)"
7,1.0,25 November 2011,"This movie surprised us. We checked on IMDb and saw 8/10 for a french movie, without hesitation we went to the movie theatre to watch the movie.

The subject is hard but the movie is really funny. In a few seconds you are fully projected within the film from the beginning to the end. There is no special effet but the actors are playing very well and the movie is based on a real story.

If you are skeptical for French movie don't be for this one ... it is a must see movie.

8,8.0,11 December 2011,"It's not because I'm French that I appreciated this movie which I've seen twice. Too give the really infamous appreciation of the reader from Toronto to the French public, qualifying us of a segregationist country is difficult to gulp especially coming from north America which has not a very glorious past on the matter even in recent years. Perhaps the commentator should see the movie ""The help"" to refresh his memory... But what I'd like to say here apart of praising the fabulous interpretation of both leading actors is to remind that this is a true story, it did not come out from the directors and scriptwriter heads.

Philippe Pozzo Di Borgo born in 51, got a dramatic para-glider accident in the French Alps in 1993 being totally deprived of movements from the base of his neck to the tip of his feet. 3 Years later his wife died and he was helped out of his depression by Abdel Sellou his life-aid assistant. He published his terrible story in 2001 under the title ""the second breath"" (in French ""Le second soufflé""). The directors have had the compliments of Di Borgo for the way they adapted his story. If in any way this was biased he would never had accepted the film to be left in that state. The Di Borgo family is a very old and wealthy family whose origins goes far back in the history of France, and their residence in Paris is considered to be one the jewels of the capital at the same level as The Hotel de Sully in Paris. What is shown in the film is exactly what happens everywhere in the world as far as handicapped are concerned: tendency to overwhelm them with pity which is more diminishing them as if their fate is not enough for them to swallow every minute or second each day. The way the racial problem is viewed is properly demonstrated. The police behaves in different ways depending of the color of your skin or your country's origin and sorry to say North America is a very good example of this so perhaps is not a proper judge on this matter.The authors had the courage to state this straightforwardly. The film shows on the contrary how a man with a very limited education at the beginning, a former convict, is capable progressively to change his views, and find in himself at the same time the good Samaritan aspects and help with humor and punch, his handicapped boss to find a new belief in his shattered life at 42! At the same time the boss demonstrates an open-mindedness which was not obvious to get not only because of his handicap but because of his origins and his wealth at first. Let's not illusion ourselves on the matter, everywhere in the world few wealthy people would accept to have as an aid an ex convict whichever color his skin should be! It's a fantastic lesson of tolerance, and friendship. For just those reason this movie would deserve an Oscar or Golden Globe awards.

09/07/2013 : I've just seen that under ""Crazy credits"" is mentioned that 5% of the revenues of the film will go to an institutions caring for disabled persons. I just don't see what's crazy about that! I find this kind of remark particularly shocking and insulting both for the producers and the actors especially in this case where the story told is a true one.I suggest the administrator to delete that remark or change its qualification.","November 2, 2011 (France)"
9,7.0,19 October 2011,"I have seen this movie tonight at a preview session as the official french national release is set on 2011, November 2nd. Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakashe, accompanied by the lead actor Omar Sy were meeting the audience and cheerfully answering questions.

The movie is very well written. Although opening on a flash-forward, it is fairly classic comedy about the meeting of two opposite people who were very unlikely to meet. The first one is a paraplegic white middle aged very rich and lonely man, the other one is a young black, poor, unemployed, coming from poor suburbs and a very large family.

What makes the quality of the film, beside the humour present in every scene in which Omar Sy appears (actually most of the film), is the emotion you can feel, through increasingly attaching characters.

The story is based upon a true story, and real characters.

If you want to watch and enjoyable comedy, with very touching moments, this is a must go.

16,9.0,27 March 2012,"Intouchables is a true story of Philippe ,a rich aristocrat who is paralyzed from neck down and Driss ,an unemployed man coming from a poverty stricken family..

Francois & Omar as the lead cast give a superb performance .. The charismatic Omar (Driss) is just amazing..His very presence on screen is powerful as he juggles between rib-tickling comedy and some serious drama...Francois (Philippe) is on par with Omar...He gives a very controlled performance and is able to hold strong against Omar's contrasting character.Considering,Francois had to act as a quadriplegic, he has done an amazing job..His expressions itself substitute any needs of dialogues.. The bond the two develop is pure gem.

Story is smooth and never drags..It could have been an intense drama movie,but the directors usage of comedy made it stand out from other similar stories..Direction is sharp & the movie doesn't rely on any over the top scenes..

The music is beautifully blended into the movie and it enhances the effectiveness of many scenes...

The Intouchables can be described by one word..Beautiful...The movie is a must watch for all..

17,7.0,10 January 2013,"In Paris, the aristocratic and intellectual Philippe (François Cluzet) is a quadriplegic millionaire that is interviewing candidates for the position of his caretaker with his red-haired secretary Magalie (Audrey Fleurot). Out of the blue, the rude African Driss (Omar Sy) cuts the line of candidates and brings a document from the Social Security and asks to Phillipe to sign it to prove that he is seeking a job position to receive his unemployment insurance.

Philippe challenges Driss and offers a period of adaptation of one week to him to gain experience helping him. Then Driss would decide whether he would like to stay with him or not. Driss accepts the bet and moves to the mansion, changing the boring life of Phillipe and his employees. ""Intouchables"" is a beautiful and uplifting story of friendship based on a true story. My daughter had watched this movie a couple of months ago when she was traveling on vacation and recommended it a lot to me and yesterday I saw it on DVD.

The screenplay is excellent and the directors and writers Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano have a magnificent work. This theme in the hands of a weak director could transform the uplifting story into a corny or melodramatic movie. But they succeeded making a funny and touching comedy.

The cast is also fantastic, and the chemistry between François Cluzet and Omar Sy is amazing. Anne Le Ny is also wonderful and Audrey Fleurot is a very beautiful woman and excellent actress in her ambiguous role luring Driss. In the end, I went to bed late but feeling good. My vote is nine.

And as the title say, after this film I really have to consider to reduce my ratings for several films, because it seems a bit unfair to put them on the same level as this film, although I don't have anything to criticize on them at all. All the persons in the film are very authentic played. And both main characters surprised me with a brilliant performance. I would say, that both actors are really what they are playing in the film. If I would see François Cluzet in the street, I would be surprised not seeing him in a wheelchair. The emotions shown in the last sequence of the film are so brilliant.","November 2, 2011 (France)"
19,6.0,17 January 2013,"'THE INTOUCHABLES': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)

A French comedy-drama film that has become the third biggest foreign film and biggest foreign language film of all time. It's also received rave reviews and a great deal of award recognition, but no 2012 Academy Award nomination (due to the fact that the foreign language division was afraid it would win). The film is beloved the world over but perhaps just a little over-hyped. It's a good movie but it is clichéd and somewhat simple and unoriginal. It's been criticized for being another tale that revolves around rich white people being enlightened and finding happiness through poor black people. It does seem like the type of movie Eddie Murphy might have starred in in the 80s, perhaps with Dustin Hoffman (because the lead white actor in the film bares a striking resemblance to Dustin Hoffman).

The film stars Francois Cluzet as an aristocrat, named Philippe, who was paralyzed in a paragliding accident. He's somewhat depressed and has lost most communication with his adopted daughter Elisa (Alba Gaia Kraghede Bellugi). He also has phantom pains which keep him up at night and still mourns the death of his wife greatly, who died before they could have any kids of their own. He maintains romantic relationships with women only through written letters and fears actually meeting or speaking with them. One day he's looking for a new caretaker and a man named Driss (Omar Sy) enters his home just looking for a signature so he can continue to collect welfare checks. Driss lives with his large family in a small flat in a Parisian suburb. So when Philippe actually does offer him a job as well as a room in his mansion, that has it's own large bathtub in it, it's quite a culture shock for him. Of course Philippe is inspired by Driss and both men's lives are forever changed.

The film was written and directed by Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano. It is nicely directed and looks beautiful. It also has a nice combination of both comedy and drama and both elements are done well. It's just that the film isn't that funny or that emotionally moving. The performances are fine, it has some good laughs and it's a good well intentioned story but it's nothing we haven't seen before and far from anything spectacular. It's enormous success does puzzle me a little but I'd much rather see a movie like this do really well than something like 'TWILIGHT'. So it's definitely a decent crowd-pleasing film, just not a great one.

20,2.0,18 March 2012,"It's quite rare to find and have the pleasure to enjoy a genuine movie, blending comedy and drama with such naturalness: that's why ""Intouchables"" is undoubtedly a rare authentic picture and the fact that the story is inspired by a true one helped make the movie more involving. Funny and touching at the same time, the picture evolves with simplicity but strong pathos, with the merit of avoiding every pathetic or melodramatic attitude: there's brutal honesty in representing the real condition of Philippe, as well as Driss's initial uncompassionate attitude. There are touching moments, there are true amusing moments, both accompanied by a forceful soundtrack. Acting proves brilliant, to say the least, and the pairing between Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy sparkles and captures the viewer's attention. I was swept away by Dryss's genuine smile as well as by Philippe's melancholic eyes, and the moments when they are together filled me with an authentic feeling-good sentiment.

21,9.0,4 November 2018,"I feel like I need to say something. Not only is this in the IMDb top 250, its very close to the top, sitting at #38. This means its higher than Das Boot, The Shining, The Pianist, and more than 80% of the other incredible films on this list. I don't think every movie in the top 250 is a masterpiece, but most of the ones I've seen attain a certain level of quality that sets them apart from your ""average"" movie. I rented this movie hoping it would at least be good, but I didn't even get that.

There's not much to say other than every aspect was competently done but nothing exceptional (that goes for the story, performances, production value, and direction). My only real complaint would be that our two leads are a bit one dimensional. Why are rich people always stereotyped as loving classical music and listening to nothing else? Driss is a bit too erratic and clueless to be believable, but that's just me.

Clearly I'm missing something because everyone seems to love this movie. If you want to check it out, I won't stop you.

Touches that include quite a lot of non-PC behavior (be alert and do not watch, if you are sensible to that sort of thing).

It is a french comedy with heart. And it was a sleeper hit in Germany. Word of mouth made this a big success.

24,1.0,2 May 2012,"This movie does not really need another review, but after seeing what Daily Beast's (Marlow Stern) and Variety's (Jay Weissberg) critics have written about it, I feel that one thing needs a serious clarification. It is somewhat disturbing and, at the same time, really telling a lot about USA's culture that American reviewers see this movie as ""race-relations"" feature.

I've read all of the 38 reviews written here on IMDb until now and I would suggest to both Stern and Weissberg to do the same. Maybe they could learn something. Most of the reviews here were written by non-Americans and, tellingly, most of them do not even mention race or race relations or anything similar. To me that shows how deep anything to do with a difference in color of skin has been intertwined with USA culture when even in this film - where nobody from, let's say the rest of the world, does not see any racism or anything similar - the only thing USA critics do see is the difference in color of skin. Sad, very sad.

I'm, therefore, afraid that, if it shares Stern's and Weissberg's opinions, most of the USA audience will not see the real beauty of this film and will, probably also under the influence of critics' reviews, see the movie as a race-relations feature when that's the only thing it's not.

And what it is? It is (I can't believe I'm gonna write this) a carefree comedy about a quadriplegic and his personal aide. The movie does not at any moment come even close to apathy or pathetics which is a success on its own. The movie also has just about the perfect amount of black humor and political incorrectness and does not cross those borders at any time. I think this is the only movie about a disabled human where, after seeing it, you will go out of the theater laughing. And I can't remember any movie which approaches such a difficult theme with such ease.

Additionaly, the soundtrack - both Einaudi's score as well as selected tracks - is fantastic.

A lot has been written here about cast and I would just like to add that along masterful performances of both Sy and Cluzet, the rest of the actors are equally great, especially Anne Le Ny and Audrey Flerot.","November 2, 2011 (France)"
25,1.0,24 July 2012,"My my where do I begin.

To start with I did not want the movie to end at all. Its becoming more and more rare for movies as this one to come by. This movie completes the circle, as far as movie going experience goes. The movie has left me with a sort of warm feeling in my heart that cannot be said in words alone. There is something about the way French movies are made, when they get it right they are simply par excellence. Hollywood kisses concrete.

Anyway, I feel most of us humans are quadriplegic though not physically but emotionally in someway or other. But what one may agree is that when you cry you cry alone, but when you laugh the whole world laughs with you.

If just by the word ""quadriplegic"" you are expecting it to be a dark, heart shattering, emotionally overloaded movie then I would passionately defend against such a prejudiced opinion. One is not the physical form alone. One can have a beautiful body but a black heart and vice-verse.

A very well written, full bodied script and an exceptionally well directed movie. Characters cannot become more real than this on the silver screen. Omar Sy in my opinion has done a very good job. He lived his character and not played it. To contrast him we have François Cluzet who kept the sparks flying. Omar Sy's comments on Bach, Vivaldi etc classics had me in splits. And also do not miss out on the singing Human tree, the very mentioning of which is having me in splits.

This movies is so simple, humane, deep. It's about what should happen more often, great friendship between two so different persons who are able to go beyond prejudices and stereotypes. It's not a sad movie at all, like it could sound to some people, and it's absolutely not racist like I have read somewhere else in the comments. I suggest to all people to go and watch this, you will go out of the cinema with something great you have learned and seen.

28,9.0,17 March 2013,"According to IMDb, ""The Intouchables"" set all sorts of box office records--the second most successful French film in history in France as well as the number one film for 2012 in Germany. So, because of this very impressive pedigree I was perhaps expecting a little more. Now this is NOT to say it's a bad film--it's wonderful. It just didn't seem quite THAT wonderful. But it IS well worth seeing.

As for the plot, this movie is a true-life account of a quadriplegic man (François Cluzet) in search of a new aide. However, all the folks who apply for the job seem the same--boring and sterile. On an odd lark, he chooses an unqualified man who doesn't seem interested in the job at all (Omar Sy). And, oddly, they form a friendship that seems to reinforce the old adage that opposites attract.

While the plot is amazingly thin and seems to be missing chunks of the story, the film is masterful in several ways. The acting (particularly by Sy) is just terrific. But even more terrific is the artistry of the film itself. It takes a somewhat ordinary story and injects it with class--including some wonderful cinematography and one of the nicest soundtracks I have ever heard. It is a lovely film.","November 2, 2011 (France)"
29,6.0,20 July 2012,"This is the story of friendship between a quadriplegic (Phillipe) and his black attendant (Driss). At the surface one has the impression that the film will be a tearjerker with oodles of sentimental scenes coming one after another. Being from India and having witnessed such films of dying person or disability which are meant to titillate the sentiment of the weak to my mind I perceived one that of a contrived, loud, excessively melodramatic ""Gujarish"" which was also about a quadriplegic person. But as I started watching it how I wished to see such a film being made in India. The movie is a lesson to live life with full vigour amidst adversities. The film starts with two persons in car with one in the wheel driving it crazily through the busy roads of France when they are stopped by the police. Driss challenges Philippe that the policemen wouldn't arrest him but on the contrary would escort them. Thus they put a bet of 200Euros.Driss faked a drama about how he was taking quadriplegic Philippe to hospital for emergency and thus he had no option but to opt for rash driving. They succeeded in creating guilt amongst the policemen thus assuring them to escort Phillipe's car. As they start the car again there is an immediate smile in my face that this will be film full of life. From there the movie goes back to where the hiring process is on for a caretaker. Driss, an outlaw leaving in the black community of suburbs took the job. Unlike the other caretakers Philippe become connected to Driss easily because of the Driss's lack of sympathy towards him. In fact the film works at this level which makes us feel that people with certain problem needs affection rather than sympathy. Driss is an outlaw, rude and brutally honest and somehow there seem to be a connection with Phillipe who is a rich loner losing his lower half to an accident. The zeal for life is still there but the support is missing. From having food to shower to everything he needs someone else's ""hands"" not out of sympathy but out of compassion and he found it in Driss. Driss on the other hand learns the art of living from Phil's quadriplegic existence. He learns to respect life, family and more than that Himself. He gains confidence in life and tries to induce that to Phillipe by trying to re-marry him to his lady love. The climax is one of the best I have seen in recent times. It is honest, sweet, touching yet there is no forced melodrama. The simplicity brings down tears of happiness as we learn the real characters that inspired the reel version are living a happy contended life overcoming their individual short comings at physical as well as psychological level. There have been several films on friendship between a black and white but there is nothing contrived in the plot. Director duo Olivier Nakache & Eric Toledano's intention is as pure as the friendship portrayed.Their success lies in their usage of subtle humour to tell this touching story.The wide angle of camera reflects a contentment which the protagonist is having with his surroundings. The gradual bonding has been kept subtle with small sequences like Driss taking Phillipe to open air around 3am and then offering cigarette. These are the small things which help in taking the bigger step. The usage of light has been apt as the shade gradually shifts towards brighter shade. Dorian's editing gels with the character transformations. The long cuts in the initial reels changed to short cuts reflecting the happiness and youthful exuberance within. Ludovico's soft background score suits the mood of the film. The occasional use of orchestra uplifts the mood after prolonged calmness which fits Phillipe's characterization. François Cluzet and Omar Sy as Phillipe and Driss respectively are flawless. Veteran actor Cluzet fits in perfectly as Phillipe and brings out the hopelessness yet the desire to live with perfect conviction. The clumsiness of a quadriplegic comes from his mannerism. And then there is the young talent Sy whose comic timings are more than perfect. His range of expression helps in showing the change in the curve of his character as he softens down on his basic mannerisms. His initial mockery to the aristocratic existence, to his understanding of their behaviour and thus a change in his own expressions are put across with perfection. ""Intouchables"" celebrates life and the reason it works is one can identify with the basic emotion. Someway we all are saddled in our existence fighting all odds and struggling to overcome adversities of life. This film brings in hope; it throws light to the darkness in our existence. It teaches us to love through tales of true friendship, a virtue that is losing its value in this materialistic existence. It tells us to believe in our strength and never lose hope which we tend to even in minor setbacks. Without trying to sympathise on bygones the film subtly teaches to look forward and use every precious moment of our life to be happy. The movie is a must watch for everyone who can breathe.

P.S : This year a great tragedy happened in my life for which I was mentally down. But this movie really helped me to have faith in life and all to a certain extend. I really want to thanks the director duo for making this film","November 2, 2011 (France)"
30,4.0,29 April 2013,"The actors give good performances here but the script, and the movie, ultimately is ridden with clichés and not terribly sympathetic. Anyone paralyzed in this manner deserves sympathy, but if you have a vast fortune, an army of caretakers, and every imaginable comfort and resource you may need less sympathy than some others. Why did the filmmakers transform a North African (Muslim?) caretaker into a Senegalese? Why is this black African's conformity to every cliché -- pot-smoking, violent, rap music, he even dances well -- supposed to be refreshing, either to Philippe or the viewer? So much was simply artificial -- dressing Philippe like a doll, playing with his beard and hair, the caricature of the other applicants, the behavior of the adopted daughter -- or further clichés -- e.g. the police. Mildly amusing at times, way too long, just watchable.","November 2, 2011 (France)"
31,1.0,31 May 2012,"This movie so easily could had become a forced and melodramatic one but luckily it's one that got made with lots of tact and skill, making this one fine drama, with a comical touch to it as well.

Guess that I really like contrasts in movies. The two main characters are complete opposites of each other, in about every way imaginable. Driss is poor, Philippe is rich. Driss is vibrant, Philippe is a quadriplegic. Driss is black, Philippe is white, etcetera. They are a complete mismatch on paper but yet they become best friends, which forms the central point of this movie and works out so well because it gets made believable.

They don't just become good friends, they also learn from each other and I believe that they also become better persons because of that. This is were the movie its warmth and soul comes from, in my opinion.

It doesn't ever dwell on it that Philippe is bound to a wheelchair and can only move his head, or that Driss is poor and also has a poor relationship with this family. If anything, this movie is a celebration of life, rather than than a movie that will bring you down. The effect of these sort of movies often is that it actually strengthens its drama because you feel far more involved with it, also since the movie doesn't shoves its drama down your throat constantly.

There are some small side-plots in the movie but the good news about them is that they don't distract from the main theme and storyline of the movie and the movie never puts its emphasis too much on any of the side-plots or its secondary characters. It keeps a great and effective focus on its main subject, throughout pretty much the entire film.

It's a great movie, in every way. It has a good look to it, that isn't cheap or rushed. It's a respectful and professionally made movie, which all paid off for it.

Also the acting is just great. Everybody seems perfectly cast in their roles and know how to handle their characters and manage to fit within the style and tone of the overall movie. Of course François Cluzet and Omar Sy carry most of the movie and they did a more than great job with this.

It's just a movie I can't say anything bad or negative about. It's well made and effective, which makes this one of the better genre movies out there!

32,1.0,30 December 2014,"A French-language based on a true story drama, The Intouchables is ... touching ... but not as good as it likes to think it is. In the mind of its creators it seems to be a comic drama of immense human significance; in reality it is powerful and affecting and funny at different times. It's also clichéd, patronising and predictable.

It's the story of a rich, privileged quadriplegic man who needs to hire a new carer. He picks a young man with no qualifications and no experience from the Paris housing projects. What follows is a predictable but still effective clash of cultures and expectations, with mutual learning taking place on both sides of the divide. The films seems at pains to not offend with its sensitive subject matter, the overall effect seeming to be at times patronising to the poor and the disabled alike. All poor people like hip-hop, it seems; all the rich, classical music. The quadriplegic man struggles to feel, you see. Yes, really. All a bit trite at times.

At others is affecting though. It chimed with me at points; it encourages an engaging, counter- cultural lack of safety and wisdom the better to actually build meaningful lives and relationships, to break artificial barriers and self-limitations. It's encourages a kind of holy recklessness on its viewers, that you suspect will get lost amidst the worthiness for many. If only the film itself had shown a little more danger and a little less safety, we could have had something more special and less crowd-pleasing.","November 2, 2011 (France)"
33,1.0,29 September 2012,"Its a harmless clichéd ridden comedy. Its identical to Hollywood films in pacing, plot and structure. Its well executed and may be entertaining for someone who doesn't have a sophisticated taste for movies.

The fact that one of the main characters is quadriplegic doesn't affect the basic plot by any measurable degree. Its a traditional story of a rich guy meets a poor guy and the two become friends. The rich guy likes classical music, the poor guy likes pop music. The rich guy likes art, the poor guy, prostitutes. Etc The cliché goes on and on. Only someone who has watched few movies will be impressed by this story: its extremely conventional.

The jokes can be funny sometimes. Specially the ones where the characters exploit the fact that he is quadriplegic. Since one cannot find these jokes in other comedies. But overall the film is okay, but not good and is not worthy of being viewed in a theater.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

However, to see him perform at this level and with such ease simply amazed me. The relationship & chemistry created between the two characters in the film would make you believe that Omar & François Cluzet were best friends in real life.

François Cluzet is also excellent in this film. To a certain extent, his performance reminds me a bit of Dustin Hoffman's in Rain Man. This role shows how versatile he is as an actor. The last film I saw him in was ""Ne Le Dis à Personne"" (Tell No One) and his role in that is, literally, the complete opposite, yet he pulls off both wonderfully.

**** (out of 4)

Terrific comedy-drama from France about Philippe (Francois Cluzet), a rich man who was left paralyzed from the neck down after an accident and Driss (Omar Sy), a man from the ghetto who hasn't had much going on in his life until he gets the job of taking care of the handicapped man. THE INTOUCHABLES has been breaking box office records around the world but I decided to stay away from it because of some rather lukewarm reviews. I'm certainly glad the trailer kept telling me to go see it because no matter what the critics say, this here is a complete winner and it's easy to see why so many people have fallen in love with it. I'm really not sure why so many critics have bashed it for being a ""crowd winner"" or ""too happy"" because neither makes much sense. I thought the film was quite remarkable because the pre-credit sequence is just so touching and funny that you can't help but fall in love with these two characters and the journey of their friendship that follows was incredibly touching and best of all is that it felt real. A lot of credit has to go to the two leads who deliver remarkable performances and I'd be willing to bet that you're not going to see better from anyone the rest of the year. If so, more credit to whoever is better. Cluzet and Sy are simply so terrific in their roles that you really do feel as if you're watching real people with real issues. The way to two play off one another is so remarkable to watch that once you've seen it I don't see how you could forget them. Directors Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano do a remarkable job balancing the comedy with the drama and in the end they really create such a special atmosphere that it's impossible not to get caught up with it. THE INTOUCHABLES is without question one of the best films of the year and hopefully the strong word of mouth from around the world will get more people to check it out.","November 2, 2011 (France)"
41,1.0,7 May 2018,"Ofcourse the entire premise of The Intouchables is a bit of a cliché these days with the strong black man helping the weak white man, yet it is not a film of irrelevant political propaganda and steers clears of this subject quite well.

The better parts of the film is primarily that it has some great shots, an incredible piece of piano notes music by Ludovico Einaudi & some great acting by especially Francois Cluzet ( Phillipe ) as the invalid aristocrat. Unfortunately however, the bonding of the two cultures of the main characters make little sense. Driss ( Omar Sy ) does not seem like a particularly nice guy and even his family isn't all too keen on him for reasons that he has caused on his own. Somehow for reasons unknown this eventually changes causing Driss to seemingly even care and freak out about things in Philippe's life that seem to be a bit out of character for him. Yet even though their relationship seems far fetched, it does still have a certain charm to it which makes it convincing enough as a piece of entertainment.

The acting is mostly good, especially by Francois as stated before, who does a great job of facial acting too. Omar Sy is a bit inconsistent as Driss due to some weird outbursts & a couple of cringy scenes ( the dancing or the consistent flirting with the secretary becomes quite a cringe to watch ) featuring him which kind of makes me think he is the French Chris Tucker. The film isn't as emotionally powerful as it would like to be. The music by Ludovico Einaudi is a splendid emotional piece, so that is not the problem. The problem seems the movie feels a bit too much like a 'feelgood' movie due to the buddy relationship that the mixes between emotion and light hearted feelgood scenes are hard to make. However, a couple of scenes especially near the end do manage to succeed in this aspect, helped by Einaudi's score and some excellent facial acting by Francois Cluzet.

The movie is mostly quite grey and not very pretty, and a lot of shots follow Driss closely from over the shoulder resulting in quite an ugly bouncing camera kind of shots. However, there are a couple of shots where the cinematography really shines. Most of these shots come from the position of the camera behind the two men, with Driss left and Phillipe right, which is a pose used many times during the film. Especially the one right before the parachuting scene is a beautiful one, yet this is followed with quite a weird shot in the parachuting scene itself from some kind of onboard camera like it is a documentary, which is unfortunate since there truly are many great shots in the film, but also a lot of uglier ones.

It is a film with some great acting and some lesser acting, some great emotional scenes and some cringy scenes, and some beautiful shots and some ugly ones. While overcoming its cliché concept of a story on a splendid manner, it is not quite as great as it wanted to be.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

44,1.0,19 April 2016,"One of the most wonderful things about the art of filmmaking is that it is incredibly good at getting an emotional response from the people that consume it. Now that was a really pretentious way of saying that films are great because they can make use feel happy, sad, scared, etc. I know for me personally that a lot of my favorite films are the ones that are able to make me cry. And I think that we can all agree that it is truly a wonderful thing when a film is made with such devotion and passion that it is able to make its audience shed tears over fictional characters and events.

Unfortunately filmmakers know that audiences love when a film makes them cry, and some filmmakers will try and take advantage of that fact. They will make films that are filled with overdone clichés and over dramatized acting/dialogue in hopes of making the audience cry, because if you can get someone to cry at your film it's very unlikely that they will forget it, and they will probably like it. This is exactly the sort of film the Intouchables is, a cheap, insincere, artificial cluster of scenes that will do whatever is necessary to make the audience get emotional. These cheap films that target and exploit sensitive topics just so they can receive acclaim and attention, are in my opinion some of the worst films out there. They represent all of the worst aspects in filmmaking, and deserve to be called out for what they are, and they are detestable piles of complete s***.

I'm entering my third paragraph and I haven't even mentioned the acting, plot, cinematography or really any of the actual specifics of the film yet, and that's because regardless of whether you've seen it or not you can already predict everything that happens in the entire film. The plot is so structured and formulaic that it feels like it was copied and pasted from a text-book. The cinematography is at best dull, and at other times so bad I actually can not believe it was in a film with a 9.5 million euro budget. (which comes out to roughly 10.8 million dollars.) All of the actors give exactly what you'd expect from a movie like The Intouchables, and honestly I can't even remember a thing about any of there performances. Which is a compliment for a movie like The Intouchables.

The Intouchables received mixed reviews from critics, and was nominated for best foreign language films by the Golden Globes. Even though critics were split on the films quality, general audiences loved it. At the time of writing this review it is the 38th highest rated movie on IMDb, coming ahead of films like Apocalypse Now, 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Seventh Seal, Ikiru, Vertigo, and even Citizen Kane. And I won't lie this upsets me, at least more than it should. The idea of a film as terrible as The Intouchables coming ahead films like the ones previously mentioned, (not to mention the dozens of other better ones in the top 250, and hundreds out of it.) just really destroys my faith in the film industry. I can not recommend that anyone watch this film ever. But even though I've been basically calling this film an indefensible offense on cinema. There are things out there that are much worse than it, so I won't give it the lowest rating possible.

46,1.0,5 June 2012,"¨Sometimes you have to reach into someone else's world to find out what's missing in your own.¨ Intouchables is a remarkable ¨feel good¨ French film mostly about friendship, but there is a little bit of drama and a love story included as well. This film with relatively unknown directors and actors has managed to make some big noise in Europe, and especially in France where it has become the second highest grossing French film of all time. The key to the success of Intouchables relies on the great chemistry and performances from Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy. They are just absolutely great in this film and their friendship felt authentic and real. The movie mixes the drama with the comedy really well and it works better than most films have in the past when combining two different and sometimes opposite characters together. Sy and Cluzet play totally different characters who come from very different backgrounds, and although we've seen this play out in hundreds of films in the past it works really well here thanks to their terrific performance and a great script from the directors Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano. Cluzet has a sort of a Dustin Huffman vibe and he says so much with his expressions without having to say anything at times, while Sy plays a more outgoing character who isn't afraid to speak his mind. This odd pairing reminded me a lot of another film which I really loved, Goodbye Solo which follows a similar premise at times. Intouchables is a feel good movie, but it transcends the term at times and becomes much more. An absolute must see, especially if you've ever had to work or live with a handicapped person.

Philippe (Francois Cluzet) is a very rich quadriplegic who lives in his mansion with several servants and his teenage daughter. He is hiring a live-in carer once again (since most only last a couple of days with him). Driss (Omar Sy) happens to be applying for the job, but actually just wants to get rejected so he can live on welfare without having to work. He's been in prison for the last 6 months and away from home, but Philippe decides to actually hire Driss for the job considering he is someone different who doesn't look at him with empathy and actually treats him like a normal person. Driss and Philippe come from very different backgrounds, but they seem to complement each other very well. Philippe is a millionaire who's interested in art and classical music; while Driss comes from a poor African background, who's interested in pop culture mostly and in bands such as Earth, Wind, and Fire. Driss is really outgoing and becomes really close friends with Philippe. Together they share various stories about their past and end up helping each other solving some present conflicts. There are some other secondary characters whose names I don't even remember because they are not very important to the story, but mostly revolving around other house servants.

Intouchables is actually loosely based on a true story involving a quadriplegic and his Arab carer who ends up befriending him. The directors actually came across a documentary about these two men and decided to film a movie about it. One of the greatest things about the film beside the inspiring story was the casting. Omar Sy and Francois Cluzet were really the perfect match and they had me laughing real hard at times and at the border of tears during others. It is truly an emotional and powerful film, a story that will stick with you long after the film ends, and by the time the credits role you will have a smile on your face. It is a feel good movie, but never feels cursi or anything like that. I was really surprised with Omar Sy and hope he gets many more roles. This is really a great French film, very different from Le Prophet but just as good. I had a really good time watching this movie and recommend it to everyone.

I don't know if this film has been dubbed in English, it will certainly lose some of it charisma. If you understand french, then get it in the original voice.

Give it a try, you won't be disappointed. It is a beautiful movie.","November 2, 2011 (France)"
50,1.0,4 September 2012,"Without giving away too much, this was simply one of the best movies I have seen in a very, very long time! It has humor, life lessons, friendship, love, etc. There are so many emotions, but mainly laughter and humor that really touches you. The acting is superb and all people of all ages, genders, backgrounds can really enjoy this movie. You would be foolish not to see this film.

I have read that they want to remake this movie in America, however, I don't see why they should do such a thing. It is perfect exactly the way it is. Nothing about the movie needs to be changed one bit. Absolutely Oscar-worthy - saddens me that it was made in 2011 and this is the first I had heard of it. It leaves you with a warm, fuzzy feeling inside.

52,1.0,27 April 2019,"Western filmmakers tend to make stories where someone poor who has zest for life meets someone really rich, but tired of life and turns their life around. In such movies, one often sees the impact that the poor person has on rich person's life, but seldom do the filmmakers try to tell the story from the poor person's point of view. The focus is the rich man and his boring life and how it can be turned around by a poor person who sees it in a different light. Towards the end of the movie, the poor person gets little or nothing out of the exchange, but the rich guy walks away with deep insights and a newfound will to live. It's really unfair how such films portray poor people (recurring trope of them being awestruck by bathrooms) and paint them as incapable of doing anything unless aided by the money from the rich person. I think that's because the target audience is rich people who will pay to watch a movie which gives them some hope.","November 2, 2011 (France)"
53,1.0,12 August 2012,"This french film starts with a Dustin Hoffman look-alike actor being driven by a black driver (Omar Sy) who is fond of Earth, Wind and Fire music and has a swagger made popular by many a black Hollywood actors including Eddie Murphy. In the typical Hollywood fashion he comes from the wrong side of tracks (think of Murphy in Trading Places), but ends up living in a Paris mansion (again echoes of Trading Places) taking care of a quadriplegic (François Cluzet). Somehow he learns to take care of his patient and in fact becomes quite an accomplished male nurse. The transition is mildly amusing, and won't bother you if you checked your skepticism at the door before entering the movie theater. If you have any doubts about whether or not this film is in the genre called Hollywood fantasy, you have to see what our tough man with heart of gold does next. He decides to teach his boss how to be a good father and ultimately becomes cupid for his boss. The film plays on the obvious disparities between expectations and attitudes of the privileged and under classes in ways that are funny. If you wish to enjoy this film, please keep your expectations low and ignore the obvious visual and other tricks. One of the early scenes shows a row of shoes and socks of the candidates waiting to be interviewed for the nurse's job. As the camera pans, all candidates are wearing shiny shoes with clean socks, but one pair stand out for being dirty and incongruous. Of course, they belong to Omar Sy's character and he gets the job at this super-rich household. How fuuunny!! I predict that in two to three years there will be a Hollywood clone of this film with Dustin Hoffman and Chris Rock playing the main characters.

And it's totally rare for me to have the lucky chance finding a foreign movie that doesn't need to tell its masterpiece beauty. First of all, all the time I was watching the movie I thought I was staring at Dustin Hoffman playing well a disabled nobleman being taken care of by a straight-thinking commoner. I know the overreacted dire issues this movie is being pestered, but I don't really care what other people say how the movie should have been. It's an obvious sign already that this movie topped 111 (and may still elevate) in IMDb top 250 movies that a lot of sensible reviewers appreciated its simplicity. The reason indeed probably why the crew casted a black man instead of Arabian to portray the character because maybe simply Omar Sy just had the skill to fit in to the character's delicate vessel. Why so locked with the racism issue? Other may had been suggestive but it's not an extreme case to horribly condemn the movie of its simple choice. I just don't understand people who can't keep their bloody mind open. Well either way the movie had its story straightforwardly rendered and its worth approving rather than condemning. I even laughed so hard when Driss (Omar) just naturally cackled all over the man dressed like a tree singing at the top of his voice, man that was really a humorous punch. The drama Well done.

Ten stars would be more than it deserved.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

60,9.0,4 December 2013,"I'm not sure how I came to be watching this film; I had heard of it some time ago and added it to the queue without knowing too much about it other than it was successful in its home market. Supposedly based on a true story, the plot sees a rich quadriplegic employ a rather colorful young man to be his new live-in caretaker. We open the film with a flash-forward but quickly go back to the start of the relationship and quickly are let in on the ground floor regarding how this film will be. Basically Philippe is uptight and locked within himself mentally almost as much as physically, while Driss is carefree and very different from those in Philippe's world. Will the odd-couple become friends and perhaps benefit one another's lives somehow? Well, only time (and the genre) will tell.

Of course this is pretty much what happens but you know this from the odd-couple comedy/drama feel that it has from the getgo and it is fairly shameless about doing it. There isn't really a depth to the film but rather a superficial but entertaining pace and plot. It feels cynical for the most part but yet somehow it works if you can get through some cringe-inducing ""heart-warming"" moments. A big part of it working is plain and simply the two actors in the lead roles. Neither gives a brilliant performance individually but together they have real chemistry and their banter and shared moments do have a certain genuine and intimate feel that is all down to the delivery. By themselves Cluzet is solid and Sy clowns it up for all he is worth, but yet both are quite charming and likable all the way to the end.

Ultimately it is fairly shameless crowd-pleasing fare which airbrushes life into a series of fun set-pieces. It really never touches a real nerve but it is still enjoyable thanks to the warm tone and strong chemistry between the two leads.","November 2, 2011 (France)"
61,9.0,7 November 2022,"I have a feeling that I'm writing another short review here, but we shall see.

The Intouchables is a French comedy/drama film, based on a true story. The movie follows the relationship between Driss, a young man with unstable life and low economic status, and Philippe, a rich disabled man who's sick of getting looks of pity. As time goes on we see how their bond tightens, and how they manage to help each other grow and evolve.

I'll say this: the film is super straight-forward, accessible and simple. The pacing is quite fast and solid. The soundtrack is fun, the cinematography is actually better than I expected, beautiful shots here and there. Some of the jokes fall flat, but some made me laugh out loud. I had a decent amount of emotional investment in the characters, though nothing truly moving. Just enough to keep me interested, to get me to care.

Yeah, I enjoyed the movie quite a bit, but it's genuinely so...I don't know, basic? That I don't have much to say here. Nothing in this film is truly special, the way I see it at least, but The Intouchables still has solid amounts of charm and memorable moments. Just enough to make it a good movie, actually. It's not an extremely rewatchable film, but it was definitely a fun, good watching experience overall, with a couple of heartwarming scenes. I'm feeling a 7.0/10 on this one.","November 2, 2011 (France)"
62,1.0,6 September 2022,"Still struggling to understand why this masterpiece didn't receive a single Oscar nomination, not even for best foreign film. And Omar Sy should have been nominated for best male actor as he practically stole every scene he was involved in. It felt natural, as if there were no acting involved. If it was made today it would sweep the ceremony, no question. At times it made me laugh uncontrollably, and the humor comes naturally rather than through telling jokes as with most comedies. Although this is not strickly a comedy, it falls more under comedy/drama. It tends to get serious at times. The fact that this is based on a true story makes it even more incredible.

This is an absolute ""Must see!"". If you haven't already, do it now!

Shame at my prior laziness for avoiding any non-English speaking films and excitement for the wealth of films I am about to discover. There is a film world outside of the UK and USA. Anyway I haven't much to say about the film, you'll get a good incite into it by watching the trailer. From the subject matter I assumed at some point during the film I would need tissues to dry my tears which would have made reading subtitles difficult but thankfully I didn't. At times its sad but is also uplifting throughout. Its just a lovely film and may throw caution to the wind by watching it again without the subtitles!","November 2, 2011 (France)"
66,6.0,10 October 2012,"It was very exciting to hear that 'Untouchable' would finally be shown in the UK after appearing in so many other countries first. Having read plenty of hype about this film I was preparing myself to be disappointed but, luckily, the film felt engaging from the very beginning and went on to be a wonderfully touching and funny experience. There is also a fair amount of excitement and romance thrown in for good measure!

Despite appearances, Untouchable is not really about race, disability or class; it's about friendship. The two main characters both feel disconnected from society for various reasons, yet the connection between these two outsiders is so genuine and believable that you are drawn into their relationship. In fact, the performances from Omar Sy and François Cluzet are simply incredible. The massive amount of meaning conveyed in the slightest look between them is acting at its very best. On many occasions, you find yourself laughing with them and the fact that one is a rich white guy in a wheelchair and the other is a poor black guy fresh out of prison ceases to be an issue.

One of the most interesting themes for me was the effect that Driss's lack of pity had on Philippe. I understand that the film has been applauded by many disabled groups and I can see why. Pity is a very selfish and unpleasant emotion and I can imagine that the effect of such pity would be quite destructive on a person in Philippe's situation. Driss simply reacts to him in natural and honest way, which is extremely refreshing to see and a lesson for all those who would look down on anybody with pity.

The film is not without flaws however. It is a little 'lightweight' in places and there are a few clichés here and there (even though the film manages to avoid most of the more obvious stereotyping). The subtitles are also not brilliant in places and some of the meaning is slightly lost on occasion, but I guess that happens all the time. Overall, I would have said that this was a lovely 8/10 'feelgood movie' but the superb quality of acting easily bumps it up to a 9. Unmissable.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

Watch it if you're bored with your life, if you think there's no point or no hope. Watch it if you've stopped enjoying simple things. The plot is simply thrilling, the acting as well,with a large amount of extremely good humour plus a great deal of equally amazing music.

I rated it a ten and keep in mind that it didn't catch my eyes nor ears in the beginning. However, the overall feeling I'm having after having watched this rather lengthy masterpiece; is a calm and thoughtfulness that I haven't felt since I watched the almost six hour long Italian film, La meglio gioventù.

One would think that the main two characters, Philippe and Driss, had been living together for 20 years before the recording of this movie. The chemistry between the two of them is something extraordinary. Something intouchable.

Together, they complement each other in a way that is unusual in today's films. Driss, who embodies a ""'pragmatic'"" African french youth with lots of temperament and a great deal of emotional luggage. Philippe, being in the state that he is, can't use his body language the way that Driss can. He has to rely on his facial expressions. Something he is mastering very well.

I didn't want the film to end. I wanted it to continue as a TV series, one can come home to and watch after a stressful day at work.

I don't want to say anything more about this lovely 112 minute long touching movie without spoiling the experience for the ones that still haven't seen it.

The story as in the real life story has been portrayed, in my opinion, brilliantly. Of course we can expect a lot of things to have been added to the entertaining production, but nevertheless a lot morally correct life lessons are included as well. This movie makes you search for humanity within yourself as it illustrates how a guy from the low, social classes in Paris can be a true friend and ally of this rich, handicapped person. Subsequently, the writers and producers have creatively played with this and have 'covered' the seriousness of the movie to seconds while the major events have been coated in a fun and inspiring way.

To start off, i'm not from the United States, I'm from Spain. There have been good TV shows and music coming out of spain for years, but films is the one thing we cannot do, due to all films having to be comedies which a part of them are not understandable by international (specially American) audiences due to the politics and very vast culturl differences.

You may think that had nothing to do with the critique, but it does more than you think. Just like Spain, France does have a very different culture, being even one of the European countries with most differences to the United States. Most of the critic reviews i've read about this film state things that are true in the states when talking about social class levels, but when it comes to France, it is completley different.

This films is very captivating, and incredibly emotional, one of the best foreign fils I've seen in years, comparable to 2019's Parasite (not as good), and 2018's Roma. Also something that may bias me, it that i have seen this movie religiously, and knowing a basic french understanding helps.

82,1.0,6 October 2012,"The fantastic, life-affirming comedy Untouchable, from Writer/ Directors Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano, is a breath of fresh air that surpasses the hype.

From the opening roar of a Maserati pursued by police along the Parisian périphérique, Untouchable captivates. At the wheel Driss, (Omar Sy) a young, Senegalese street hustler, bets his passenger, Philippe (François Cluzet) a middle-aged, bourgeois Parisian, he can escape. Cornered but not defeated, Driss ups the ante to secure a police escort. With Phillippe aping a potentially fatal fit, Driss races to A&E with Earth, Wind and Fire blaring above the attendant sirens.

Flash back to Driss, fresh from a prison stretch, unwelcome at his Mother's overcrowded flat on the sprawling Berlioz housing slum. Living on benefits conditional on attending interviews, Driss applies to care for Philippe, a rich quadriplegic confined to his first arrondissement mansion. Devoid of pity or reverence for Philippe's rarefied world, Driss's open about his motivation optimistically coming on to Magalie (Audrey Fleurot), Philippe's assistant. Although totally unsuitable, Philippe withholds his signature to satisfy the benefit agency. Forced to return, Driss around his expansive quarters and homeless, Driss reluctantly accepts a trial recoiling at the indignities expected of him. Despite initial tantrums and ineptitude, Driss develops an unlikely relationship with Philippe that transforms the entire household.

Untouchable, contrary to the tragic set up, is one of the funniest comedies of the year. Creative collaborators Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano have produced a string of popular and critical successes since 1995. They took France by storm when Untouchable, based on a true story, was originally released in November 2011. The films worldwide release has broken box office records for a French language film, racked up awards, contending for an Oscar and already scheduled to be remade in English by The Weinstein Company; it will need a brave director to try and live up to the original.

Untouchable's casting is superb. Cluzet plays Philippe, a former adrenalin junkie born to entitlement but paralysed in a paragliding accident and mourning his wife. His performance, with the physical limits of Philippe's condition, is an expressive master class, his comic timing perfect. Sy, who emerged from the working-class suburbs of Paris himself, is authentic and effortlessly charismatic as Driss, the aimless, street smart, opportunist whose overwhelming vitality is infectious.

Their cultural clashes drive the comedy. Philippe fills his life with intellectual stimulation; poetry, art, opera and classical music repressing the physical pleasures he can no longer feel. Directionless and irresponsible, Driss grasps all life has to offer living in the moment and, forgetting or dismissing his employer's disability. For Philippe Berlioz is the great French composer of the 19th Century; to Driss Berlioz is his family's housing project. While Philippe has poetic epistolic relationships, Driss collects hooker's flyers and constantly propositions Magalie. For his birthday Philippe's extended family gather for a dour classical concert but Driss gets them all grooving to Boogie Wonderland.

It's an education for both. The odd couple overcome the barriers of class and race, sharing honesty, humour and contempt for bourgeois pretension. Through Driss' ignorance and innocence, cajoling and challenge, Philippe's rediscovers the pleasures and possibility of life while Driss matures, developing empathy and a knowledge of classical cultural denied his social class.

Untouchable avoids sentimentality touching on the deeper issues of social class and discrimination poignantly reminding the viewer to live life to the fullest and embrace our common humanity.","November 2, 2011 (France)"
83,9.0,2 April 2012,"When I first saw ""Intouchables"", it hadn't become the French box office hit it is now, in fact I hadn't heard of it or watched a trailer before seeing the film. Members of my family who were there with me were absolutely enchanted when we got out, but I merely shrugged.

I remember thinking, early on in the film: ""It seems they sort of know what they're doing"", what with the very expressive visual choices in terms of setting and photography. But as the movie went on, all traces of artistic flair were lost for good.

The characters are flat and are only here so that the audience can have a good laugh and be forced to accept the old fallacy that a movie with disabled people can only be good. Then again, I found myself smiling at various points of the movie, but I only think it is sad that the movie abandons its interesting story and social context: by the end, it does not consist of much more than a long thread of random jokes. Francois Cluzet is too distancing in the role of a jaded paraplegic, but Omar Sy makes the most of his (very) limited part. It is only through this character that the film manages to take a stand against prejudices without feeling divorced from reality or from the cinematic necessities of storytelling and character development.

Let's sum things up this way: the movie had a great beginning in which it properly introduced the world of the story, Omar Sy's performance is really engaging, and yes, the film is VERY entertaining and beautiful, but it is not realistic enough nor ready to put its many jokes in context.","November 2, 2011 (France)"
84,1.0,4 January 2022,"""The Intouchables"" took a tried and true formula, tweaked it a bit, and made a sensational movie. The idea of ""The Odd Couple"" has been around for ages. We see it most in buddy cop movies, but it also rears its head in other genres. I, for one, have gotten tired of the idea of polar opposites becoming friends. It's not that I don't appreciate or like the idea, it's just that it has been done so often. The very thought of having to watch two people get to know each other and appreciate their differences makes me roll my eyes. ""The Intouchables"" takes the idea, guts it, and gives us a gem.

Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy star as Philippe and Driss. Philippe is a wealthy, paralyzed, white Frenchman who is in need of a caretaker. Driss is a poor, somewhat hood, African Frenchman who is just looking for a job. Driss has no passion for healthcare nor is he at all sensitive towards Philippe's condition, he just wants a paycheck. What you don't expect is that Philippe admires this about Driss. Philippe doesn't want a caretaker who feels pity for him, he wants one that treats him like any other able-bodied human being. And I think that's where the movie distinguished itself. Instead of us suffering through a contentious relationship that slowly transformed into something special, they were practically friends from the start, even if they didn't recognize it. Philippe wanted Driss as a caretaker and Driss wasn't going to pass up a good paying job.

Their relationship grows over time from one of employer and employee to friendship. It's a funny movie that seems to hit all the right buttons.

Prior to viewing, I was minimally interested in the plot, a little doubtful, and kinda iffy about having to read subtitles. But now I'm so happy I saw this. Just listening to the beautiful piano pieces at the beginning and end of this film fill me with emotion that isn't sad nor happy, just one that gives me that feeling of a long quiet night on the road, silently enjoying the company of a great friend. This film doesn't have huge questions to ponder, and it doesn't have melodramatic characters and subplots, at least not too obviously.

92,1.0,18 April 2021,"This is a film that works very well at the core. It's true that many scenes were crass and felt played up for mass-market appeal. I can see why some film critics gave it a lower rating. That, however, seems to me to be missing the forest for the trees.

The acting is superb from both Sy and Cluzet. They deliver force, touch and humour, and have strong chemistry. Although they act out stereotypes frequently, they never become the stereotypes. I think this handling is the correct way both to acknowledge and overcome stereotyping, which is something that is all around us and cannot simply be wished away, but must be overcome through force of character. The leading duo (and for that matter the supporting characters) are both believable and likeable.

Intouchables is full of light-hearted humour and adventure. Aside from keeping up the flow and entertainment level, there's also a strong life message within. Life is something to be lived, not passively observed. Themes of curiosity, self-awareness, courage and responsibility come across strongly. In this sense, the film is more than just a buddy drama about a quadriplegic and street guy. If these guys can expand their horizons, find joy and adventure, laugh a little at themselves, and take charge of their life and families, then surely we all can.

Finally, there are strong metaphorical elements in the storyline. Old aristocratic France is stuck, and relies on immigrant France to keep it moving (literally), and perhaps to bring some life and liveliness too. The two don't often come into such intimate contact, or invade each other's space. But if they did? Lots to think about.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

94,9.0,13 February 2018,"The masterpiece of directors Olivier Nakache & Éric Toledano. A story of a ghetto black man (Omar Sy), who ends up getting a job as the life-in caregiver for a wealthy quadriplegic aristocrat (François Cluzet). And what do you know, the black man ends up teaching the aristocrat some fantastic new things about life. Think Driving Miss Daisy in modern day Paris.

This film feels and looks nice. The cinematography, all the technical aspects really, look, sound and feel great. It's definitely a professionally made film. I also have to praise the performance of the two main leads. Cluzet's character is a very reserved, very stoic gentleman, which means that he doesn't have quite as much room to really let loose acting-wise, but even still he gives a praiseworthy performance. But it's Sy who's the star of the movie, with his boundless energy, his ever-ending optimism and his streetwise manners that give none and expect none.

All that being said, the story is clichéd. Based on a true story, sure, but the fact still remains that daytime TV is filled with films just like this one. This is no doubt better directed, better filmed and better acted than any of those fluff films, but you still end up feeling like you're being pandered towards.

Still, it just might be that I'm biased towards these kinds of stories. It is a well-crafted film, after all. If the premise interests you, by all means, give it a watch.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

The protagonist is wheelchair bound, a quadriplegic or worse, as a result of a hang-gliding accident, which might have been predicted because he risked gliding in bad weather. His wife is almost certainly dead of an unnamed illness (I did not quite understand that part) but that is doubly calamitous since she was the most wonderful woman ever to have lived. He has a spoiled adopted teenage daughter who is involved in a bad relationship. As we meet him he is interviewing for a caretaker/companion and the successful candidate is a Senegalese man who has jumped the line in order get his unemployment form signed so he can leave. The star tells him to return the next morning to get the signed form back, so he leaves, stealing a Faberge egg on the way out. Surprise, surprise when he comes back the next day he has gotten the job. The perks include room and board at a Paris home that Jackie O would have been quite comfortable in.

Also, the real life Philippe died last year in 2023 Jun. Abdel (Driss in the film) is currently alive and is 53 year old.

In a nutshell, a very rich man gets paralyzed from the neck down and needs to hire a caretaker. He chooses Abdel because he doesn't give him special treatment and is more of a friend to him than a caretaker. Over the course of the film they become friends.

102,1.0,29 May 2022,"Olivier Nakache and Éric Toledano, the duo who wrote and directed ""Intouchables"", made a clever creative decision by setting the movie's goals up right away in the first scene through a break of expectation. The viewer is initially induced to assume that the pair of main characters - Driss (Omar Sy) and Philippe (François Cluzet) - is dealing with some kind of emergency, but the soundtrack, actors' facial expressions and the general tone of the scene suddenly change when it is revealed that the characters were faking the ""emergency"" and merely having fun. This is deeply related to what the film is about: The lighthearted, comic and happy moments of a friendship tale. Even though ""Intouchables"" doesn't completely ignore melancholy, suffering and tension, it doesn't give excessive attention to them like most films about people with disabilities do.

Additionally, the fact that the movie is full of hilarious scenes makes it a fairly good option for those viewers who merely want to watch something for fun. There are even some moments which mix sadness and comedy up, in order to not make the story feel utterly depressing at any point. Besides that, the plot also deals with some serious social criticism regarding privilegies and socioeconomic inequality (a factor which is creatively enforced by the colours and scenarios).

Ironically, the film's main negative aspect is also related to oppresion and minorities. Driss makes a few mean jokes about overweight people and other groups throughout the movie and frequently takes some annoyingly sexist attitudes towards a female side character. However, although such unnecessary moments might make the viewer mildly uncomfortable, they don't even remotely ruin the full experience. Also, Sy's character doesn't become detestable, given the fact that he is presented with a lot of likeable and relatable personality traits.

In conclusion, except for a mildly offensive line here and there, ""Intouchables"" is a great movie with a phenomenal and diverse soundtrack, sympathetic characters, splendid performances, and a creative use of colours and scenarios, so it certainly deserves to be watched.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

104,7.0,3 April 2016,"Let me start off by mentioning what I liked about this movie. The casting was great, and both Omar Sy and Francois Cluzet did outstanding jobs, and the relationship between them seems natural. It was also a very funny movie- though watching with subtitles, i couldn't help but fall for Dris's charm and laugh out loud. Unfortunately, the above-mentioned just isn't enough to qualify this movie for being considered great.

I expected a sensitive, understated French film- what i witnessed was nothing but a feel-good Hollywood movie with little to no substance. Where was the point of conflict? Philip and Dris's relationship, which was- I believe- the point of the movie, suffered no breaking points, no hardship. There were a few points of conflict in Dris's life, which never really resolved themselves.

In addition, the frequent use of jump cuts and short takes, while useful for comedic effect, blocked this movie from being anything but a group of amusing anecdotes about the relationship between invalid and reluctant caretaker and finally between two friends. There was very little substantial storyline, replaced by various amusing scenes.

I mentioned before that this was a feel-good Hollywood movie, and that in my opinion is the worst part. The film was full of unrealistic scenarios and characters, a sort of la la land where very little struggle is revealed to us.

Look, I did enjoy Intouchables. But I don't think it deserves to be in the IMDb top 100, and I believe it was a wasted opportunity.","November 2, 2011 (France)"
105,1.0,5 November 2015,"I don't doubt the reasons that people have given for liking very much/loving this film to the point where it became one of France's biggest hits in years and then, not surprising in the least, became a Weinstein Company release in the USA. The Intouchables is the epitome of a ""feel-good"" buddy movie, the kind of movie starring a big black dude that you can show your 90 year old grandmother and she'll take a liking to it as well (unless they have an aversion to, say, pot or Faberge eggs). It's the case of a movie with the kindest, inherently liberal message there is: a man from the projects lucks into a job (via Earth, Wind & Fire and Kool and the Gang as his 'references' at a brief interview), and it's taking care of a very rich man who is a quadriplegic. Over the course of this story they'll grow and become best friends and while the rich white guy can learn to relax a little more, smoke some weed (no, really) and listen to that Kool & the Gang, the dude from the projects gets some Vivaldi, makes an abstract painting that sells for 11 grand, and goes paragliding.

Other stuff happens as well, but suffice it to say there's no surprises in this movie. That may not be an issue for most out there. For me, as the movie went along, it was just a little too... safe. That may be a word that doesn't really give much critical credence to what's here, and to be fair the actors really help to ground it in a number of scenes. Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy keep things at a good, even keel as far as making the material work for their equal levels of charm and (sometimes) dismay. Sy especially shows that he can take what could have been a super-typical ""magical negro"" stereotype and not let us forget he's from a slightly less educated background (and a little rougher - see his comments about the rich man's adopted daughter when she mouths off). So on the acting front it's perfectly fine and in the first half I was interested in where this would be going.

When I say 'safe' I mean to say that nothing really dramatic is left out there for any of the characters. Any possible conflicts get swept up and resolved even before the third act begins (it almost seem,s like Driss gets some time off working just so he can resolve his small conflicts, or those with his sorta-brother, and then come back). Even with the overriding emotional beat of Philippe's correspondent-love-interest, I never felt any sense that these people would not be together by the end; there's one little bump in this road, maybe two, though it's only with the sense that 'hey, I'm quadriplegic, can't let her see that'. I get that it's something to make us feel for him, that he needs to overcome his fears. But I think a big part of it is an overall 'light' touch; yes, Driss may have a criminal background, and yes he has a big family to support in the projects (not that we see much of them, which seems like an odd choice that they just accept this), and sure Philippe has seemingly all the money in the world (where does he get it from, who knows, rich family, they never say).

So in other words, there are stakes here, but given that this man can't walk or move, or that Driss has an upward climb in life, it all comes back to just... silly jokes in a lot of scenes, playful flirting between Driss and a woman in the main house not having it, life lessons learned in montage. It's a movie that has a heart in a good place, I can't question that, and being that it's based on a true story (and boy does the ending remind you!) it's hard to say this wasn't credible in the sense of it coming from real life in a certain way. It may be a certain feeling like it's running through things I could see in a lessor TV movie, the beats of conflicts that one might see on a sitcom even (again the teenage girl plot, where she never feels like a character, just a thing that gets used from time to time to move little events forward). Even the moment where the third act gets into gear, a little conflict as Driss has to go away to fix some things and they call it quits, it's just... OK.

If you love this movie, I'm happy for you. For me, it just didn't win me over completely - not so much manipulation or pulling at the heartstrings (though it tries at times), just an overall feeling like it's missing some things that could make it FEEL more important, more substantive.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

The characters are truly stereotypes. On top of it all, I don't particularly like either characters. Philippe is uptight but his paralysis really restrict his acting. Driss is Arrogant Without Reason. Add a stereotypical large immigrant family, and you've got the standard street hustler.

When Driss draws a painting, everybody is surprised. Why? I didn't know black people can't draw. Are the French really that racist and ignorant? The actual man this character is based on is a Muslim. That would have been a fascinating in-depth character rather than this simplistic caricature. There was one possible great moment. Driss stole a Fabergé egg from Philippe.

It's a story about a white man and a black man. The white man is rich and paralyzed from the neck down; the black man is an ex-con from the projects. The former needs a caretaker; the latter needs someone to turn his job application down, so he'll be eligible for unemployment benefits. They meet. They clash. And, against all odds, they become friends.

That's the plot of The Intouchables (based on a true story), and that storyline has prompted many American critics to label the film ""racist."" Maybe it's coming from a misunderstanding of some journalists, or from a cultural difference between USA and France, but race is absolutely not the subject.

Indeed, the French title Intouchables which translates literally as untouchable, refers to the 5th Indian caste, these people ostracized by society, as the two characters. Philippe is rich but quadriplegic from a paragliding accident. Opposite, Driss is full of life, but he is poor and comes from the suburbs. His disability is purely social. Using humor to explore the sensitive topics of class inequality, and quality of life for handicapped individuals is a tall order for filmmakers of any country. However, directors Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano accomplished all of this.

An irreverent, uplifting comedy about friendship, trust and human possibility, The Intouchables depicts an unlikely camaraderie rooted in honesty and humor between two individuals who, on the surface, would seem to have nothing in common. A great film!","November 2, 2011 (France)"

Its formula is simple: the juxtaposition of two people from two radically different backgrounds who, with time, become the best of friends. And oddly enough, there isn't the initial suspicion or antagonism; they hit it off right away. But the relationship grows and deepens until they become inseparable.

The real strength of the film lies in the characters and the men who play them. One is a sophisticated, literate, older white man who is paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair; the other a young, lanky, street-savvy black man with naught but the clothes on his back. They have such charisma, such chemistry, it is a tour de force from beginning to end. Particularly the younger man, whose infectious smile and boisterous humour keeps the mood light even in the darker moments.

It's set in France, and you do have to endure subtitles (which are not well done; occasionally the punch line of a joke comes up too soon), but it's well worth it nonetheless.

There are few characters, and the main focus are on two men, who very obviously come from two different life's and struggles, but develops a friendship I have never seen anything like on a movie screen. I almost have trouble describing what this beautiful story does to you. You feel like you wanna run down to the streets and hug a stranger and let them know that whatever they are facing in life that it's gonna be okey.

The reason i LOVE this movie is because of the story and the people portraying the main characters. They have really done an excellent job both on the cast and the script.

It is a very recent film filmed in Paris and i find this film suits any watcher for the reason that it contains both high-up, posh lifestyles compared to ""chavs"" smoking and speeding Maserati's. The Humour is captured best in the original version as i would imagine a few humorous jokes may not work in translated English. I Loved it.","November 2, 2011 (France)"
130,1.0,4 April 2013,"Prepare yourselves for one of the most touching relationships ever brought to screen! Forget Fred and Ginger, forget Humphrey and Ingrid, because now it's all about Phillipe and Driss. Most French films I watch are nasty (but brilliant) shockers like Inside and Martyrs. Of course I've seen the odd gentler one like, I've Loved You So Long but even that's depressing. The funniest French films I've seen are Jean-Pierre Jeunet's, Amelie and Micmacs, but Untouchable just about betters both of them. It's not just one of the most funny and touching French films I've seen, but just films in general. Only a seriously bitter and cynical person could hate Untouchable.

The film opens with wit and energy as we see Phillipe and Driss trying to out-run and out-smart the police for speeding. It's a funny and clever sequence and just a taste for the even more amusing shenanigans to follow. But of course we can't just jump into the middle of the film! We need what Midge calls, ""a flash-back"" so we can see how they got there. What Untouchable does so well is build up its characters so we can care about them. Driss comes from a working-class background, living in a tiny and over-crowded flat. He's also a thief and his Mum has kicked him out, and although Driss is a thief we can still care about him, especially as the film goes on and we see just how funny he is.

Phillipe is the opposite. He's a hugely rich invalid with silly money to spend on paintings that look like ""a nosebleed"" as Driss puts it. But like magnets opposites attract. Driss is obviously attracted to his lavish quarters, already bigger than the whole flat he used to live in! The film takes time building up their relationships, as we see them bond through some very funny and touching moments. The directors make the audience feel as though we're bonding with them, so in a sense it's a three-way relationship and becomes all the more personal. Untouchable is also a comedy, there are some hilarious moments which I won't spoil, but it had me and the audience laughing pretty much all the way through.

The directing is really well done, and I also really liked the music which made some touching scenes even more touching! It's no wonder that Untouchable was a huge hit in France, because it's such a light-hearted and entertaining film, yet is also quite memorable too, thanks to the wonderful performances, witty screenplay and classy directing. Untouchable is a sort of rom-com but Jennifer Anniston is no where in sight! It's one of those 'buddy movies' which shows a touching kind of platonic love similar to that of Rain Man. It's a relationship we can all relate to and care about the couple involved.

Untouchable is a French classic and one I hope to watching in years to come. I defy anyone to watch and not to become involved in Phillipe and Driss' wonderful relationship. An endlessly funny and moving film which those with a sense of humour can enjoy. It's a wonderful feel-good film!","November 2, 2011 (France)"
131,1.0,12 December 2012,"Wow. That's all I can say about this movie. The fact that it's based on a true story is all the more amazing, and I immediately looked up the people the movie was based on as soon as it ended.

Once in a while, a movie comes along that elicits emotions from deep within the heart. You don't know how it's going to end and you are smiling when the movie is over, wishing there was more. I usually don't laugh out loud while watching a movie but found myself doing so because even the jokes in this movie were so genuinely funny without being crass.

Both the lead actors did a wonderful job. The chemistry between them can be felt and you really feel as if you are watching the story unfold in front of you and not on the screen. All the characters were well developed in their own roles and there were no loose ends (something most movies neglect to tie up).

Watch this movie. You will surely recommend it to others as I am doing right now.","November 2, 2011 (France)"
132,1.0,20 September 2012,"Intouchables / Untouchable **** 10 September 2012 I hate having to start like this but, based on the discontented grunts from the morons who walked out in the first minute, I regret I must begin with: Intouchables is a French film. Which means it's in FRENCH. Which means there are subtitles!!! Arrrggghhh.

For the readers who actually have a brain, Intouchables (Untouchable for those who can't work it out) will almost certainly end the year as one of the most tender, beautiful films of 2012. Yes, it was released in France last year but this is no place for such pedantry.

Intouchables is the true story of Phillipe (François Cluzet), a wealthy, aristocratic quadriplegic and his relationship with his caretaker-cum-care assistant, the reluctant, defiant Driss (Omar Sy). When Driss turns up for an interview at Phillipe's home it is with the sole intention of failing in order to qualify for unemployment benefit. Phillipe, however, sees in him a man who will challenge and inspire him and, much to the annoyance of Magalie (Spiral's Audrey Fleurot), hires him on the spot.

And so begins a clash of culture, class and conduct from which both parties will surely emerge richer, softer and sharper.

There are no surprises in the broad story; if a true-life tale is worthy of the big screen treatment, there's a very good chance it sticks to the formula, although don't dismiss Intouchables as merely formulaic. The surprise here is how effortlessly engaging, inspiring and downright funny it is. No, it isn't specifically a comedy but I laughed out loud more often and with less control than I have in any films billed as such this year so far.

There's no great villain, no huge love story, no major tragedy, just a simple story of friendship where two men, though apparently diametrically opposed in every aspect, are absolutely meant to share their lives and have more in common and so much more to give each other then either could have considered.

Cluzet, in a welcome return to British screens after last year's superb Little White Lies, is huggably dour as Phillipe with an outer crust and a rod up his backside that are begging to be shattered. Sy meanwhile, in his most prominent film for English-speaking audiences (other than a supporting turn in Micmacs), storms into frame with a demeanour that would make most of us back away and cover our throats. But though we get the measure of both men fairly quickly and there are no road-to-Damascus conversions, each of them evolves and when the inevitable tug at the heartstrings arrives, it brings a hollowness that you'll hope desperately can be filled. Soon.

I really want to award Intouchables another couple of stars but it misses out on perfection for being too swift and not allowing itself the time to unveil the arcs of a couple of supporting characters that could have added greater depth to the film. Although we meet members of Diss' family at various points, there is another plot line with them that is never fully explored and there is more that occurs in Phillipe's household than we are allowed to fully enjoy.

But these are minor quibbles. See it. See it before it disappears from your local screen. See it if The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel left you hankering after India, see it if The Chorus made your heart skip, see it if Oh, just go and see it. It's beautiful, warm and very, very funny.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

134,6.0,8 January 2013,"A rich aristocratic Frenchman Philippe played by Francois Clouzet, who is quadriplegic is perpetually looking for a caregiver.He is a tough cookie and taking care of his fragile health and erratic temperament mean that most don't last more than a week.We see interviews happening.There is a train of inept candidates even we know won't last long.They already see Philippe as a dead man. In the middle of all this, in walks a giant of a black man.He is well built and full of raw energy.He does not want the job, just a signature attesting that he tried to find a job so he can qualify for social security.He is out on parole, a stock character from the Paris housing projects, the grim underbelly of which has been superbly documented in La Haine.

We know immediately he will be hired.Its an immutable law of films, even if the posters and trailer have not given it away already.What follows are a set of adventures the two embark upon turning conventional wisdom on its head. Driss played by the gregarious Omar Sy, has immense physical energy and a love of life that is infectious, he has a mind of his own and is not cowed by the splendor of the mansion in which he finds himself in.Of course he tests the springiness of the mattress and practices his bathroom singing in a luxurious gold rimmed bathtub but those are not too important for him. Philippe indulges him, despite the protests of his friends, he trusts his instincts, probably his last act of rebellion against life which has suddenly been so unfair. The two are polar opposites but begin to share a bond.Phillip likes the fact that Driss does not treat him like a vegetable but a real human being even to the extent of making fun of his disability.

If all this sounds like a series of clichés from many other films you are right.But then, cinema thrives on telling the same story again and again because our lives too follow predictable patterns, no matter how hard we try to assert our individuality.What ultimately matters is whether cinema is able to sweep us away in its arc and its joy of telling that story and makes us forget our own dull life. This is what this film does, takes an old premise and infuses raw energy in the narrative.Sy dominates the screen like a giant, his love of life and his refusal to become a part of the vicious cycle of the Parisian immigrant suburban housing estates which are a sad model of exclusion and ghettoisation, sets him apart.

Driss shows Philippe a good time.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

Oh my God, I'm weeping right now, while I write these lines... NOT! This film is pathetic and the only way to explain the high ratings and its success is through the fact that most people are easily touched by stories that are sentimental and about friendship and moral values. Similar to why Paulo Coelho's books are bestsellers, for example.

To compare: Little Britain's Lou and Andy are funny exactly because they are not trying to teach you a moral lesson or show you how important it is to have a friend or help someone.

Simple story. Cliché. Sentimental. Boring.","November 2, 2011 (France)"
138,1.0,31 July 2012,"Now here is a film that perfect defines the word ""wholesomeness."" The Intouchables is a moving parable about a wise but poor black man who becomes the caregiver and mentor for a wealthy tetraplegic in a series of unlikely but not unbelievable events in modern-day France. The film begins by showing the man's assistant, interviewing candidates for the job of being the man's hands and legs, but as the man sits close behind her, he becomes increasingly unsatisfied with the candidates due to their lack of motivation or their mundane nature.

The man, named Philippe, played by François Cluzet, is brought to a smile when he is acquainted with Driss (Omar Sy), a man who has been through relentless struggles with money and social-status, but still manages to push through it with a smile. Driss is only looking for a signature on his unemployment checks so he can continue receiving welfare benefits and has absolutely no ambition to get this job.

The next day, he is called up to begin the trial period as the role of Philippe's caretaker, and while Driss is clearly unqualified for a job of this nature, Philippe casually accepts him because he finds the man to be charming and good-natured. While both men come from the Parisian-area, Philippe lives in a heavenly mansion, while Driss inhabits the lowest end of the slums. Despite this setback, the men have an incredibly easy-going friendship, with deep, touching talks of inspiration and motivation throughout the picture. Subplots involve Driss demanding that Philippe maintain better control of his only daughter, Elisa, and trying to get the man back on his dating game with a digital lover.

I'm aware the story sounds like cliché-after-cliché, but the film perfectly abides by my law of films with a seemingly cliché premise. The Intouchables knows its story functions with moments of incredulity and utter sappiness, but it doesn't try to overcompensate and milk those moments for more than they're worth. It also does more than give us contrivance, but inflates its moments of sentiment with wit, charm, attitude, style, and poignancy, making this for a very emotional experience on every level. Sometimes, we are greeted with a film we know is relatively simple, cliché, and unassuming, yet we are mesmerized unconditionally up until the final frame.

The film became a colossal hit in France, selling over nineteen million tickets and is currently the second highest grossing film of all time, in France. Due to its very minimal promotion in the US, I could see some people going into this film expecting a somber, relatively monotone film depicting the life of a tetraplegic tragically and with a numbing aftertaste. The Intouchables has a talent much like the Alexander Payne film, The Descendants, which is depicting a relaxing environment, which includes making a character out of the setting, handling tragedy with a sustainable amount of poignancy, and providing touches of extremely funny comedy throughout its entire runtime.

As of now, French cinema is one of the strongest cinemas in the world, as it has been for decades now. Rather than try to recreate the New Wave it experienced many years ago, try out a gimmicky, self-indulgent style, or even worse, replicate Hollywood formulas, it is at a stage now where it can take even the most basic storyline and rework it into a magnificent portrayal with humanity and lavishness subtly and majestically. The Intouchables is a beauty that will definitely be taken for granted.

139,1.0,31 March 2012,"In these days, in my country, the movie Intouchables is ranked very high in box office. Usually French films are not that popular or familiar in this country's movie industry. Therefore it is quite surprising to see that people are very eager to see Intouchables, a film from France. At first, it was not famous to people at all because promotions were not big for the movie. However, as time goes by, Intouchables is getting bigger and bigger. Almost every person who watched the movie tells to friends or writes review on the internet that Untouchables is a amazing film. And I think that is a real and successful marketing.

I would have thought that people who spend their working lives watching one violent film after the other punctuated by mindless horror, teenage pap and worse would find a film like Untouchable a pleasant antidote but that doesn't seem to be the case and the fact that it's all true - we learn in end captions that both men remain close - appears irrelevant. So much for hacks; the International public have already embraced it and it's more than likely the UK will follow. For many non-French audiences Francois Cluzet appeared on their radar first only six or seven years ago when Tell No One was an International hit. Jazz buffs had registered him as far back as 1986 when he co-starred with Dexter Gordon in 'Round Midnight' (coincidentally another 'true' story based on an unlikely friendship between American Jazz pianist Bud Powell and a young French fan). I personally have yet to see him give even a mediocre performance let alone a bad one; as for Omar Sy this is the first time I've heard his name. There are, of course, precedents for unlikely male bondings in fact Francis Weber, the French writer-director, specialized in the genre in such titles as Le Chevre, Les Compreres, Tais-Toi etc, Daniel Auteuil has also joined in at least twice (Mon meilleur ami, Apres Vous) and so on but despite it being well-worn Untouchables applies a new lick of paint to the genre and delivers a feel good title to remember.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

Beyond the obvious plot, I see the movie as a look at France's - and much of Europe's - growing diversity. Even if a person in France or Germany doesn't like immigrants, he's still bound to have exposure to them (much like how racist southerners in the US are going to have exposure to blacks whether they want it or not). Of course, most important is the different backgrounds that the men have: Philippe is a modern aristocrat, while Driss is from the ghetto. Both have something to teach each other.

The film has the tragic note but also it shows we should use every moment of our life. The fact that the film was based on real persons and events makes it even more special. I would recommend it for every audience : each person can learn from the film.

155,1.0,23 August 2023,"""Invisible boundaries between wealth and poverty, ability and disability, hope and despair are beautifully challenged in the 2011 French film, ""Intouchables."" Directed by Olivier Nakache and Éric Toledano, the movie stands as a testament to the power of human connection, transcending the confines of societal constructs.

The movie is a poignant narrative based on a true story that follows the life of Philippe, a wealthy quadriplegic, and Driss, a young man from the projects. At the crossroads of desperation and need, their paths intertwine in the most unexpected manner, proving that first impressions often mislead.

One of the standout elements of ""Intouchables"" is the electric chemistry between François Cluzet (Philippe) and Omar Sy (Driss). Sy, in particular, lights up the screen with his charm, wit, and raw energy, making it easy for viewers to understand how he breathed life back into Philippe's somber existence. Their dynamic remains refreshingly genuine and endearing, driving the narrative forward and capturing the essence of an unexpected friendship.

The film masterfully balances humor with depth. The comedic moments are not forced but stem from the organic interplay between the characters, making the audience laugh one moment and then ponder deep-seated societal issues the next. Its impeccable score, featuring classics like Ludovico Einaudi's ""Una Mattina,"" further adds depth, weaving a sonic tapestry that elevates the storyline.

However, no movie is without its critiques. Some might argue that certain aspects of the film simplify complex societal issues, and it occasionally treads the line between genuine representation and the risk of perpetuating stereotypes. Nonetheless, its overall message of friendship, understanding, and redemption shines through, making it worthy of its acclaim.

In conclusion, ""Intouchables"" is a must-watch, not merely as a feel-good movie but as a reflection on the depth and breadth of human connection. It demonstrates how two vastly different worlds can come together, find common ground, and teach us that sometimes the most unlikely relationships can be the most impactful.

156,6.0,9 June 2019,"I was surprised by Untouchable. I did not think that a French film about a wealthy quadriplegic and his black working class carer would be a comedy. Instead I thought the film would be bogged down with race, cultural and class issues.

Francois Cluzet who looks a lot like former F1 world champion Nigel Mansell plays Phillipe. A wealthy widowed aristocrat living in a fabulous Parisian mansion paralyzed from the neck down in a paragliding accident. He needs round the clock care and none of them last long.

Philippe meets Driss (Omar Sy) who is of Senegalese origin. He only attends the job interview to get a signature so he can get his unemployment benefits. Despite being a small time criminal, Philippe likes his irreverence and verve and employs him.

Driss is physically strong but he also brings Philippe to life as he drives him around in one of Philippe's fast cars rather than his adapted disabled friendly van. Driss's lack of stuffiness is exactly what Philippe needed.

Untouchable is a feel good buddy comedy of two men from different tracks of life who bond. It is really a simple story based on true facts, although the real life carer was a French Arab. It is an engaging enough film despite its stereotypes. There is a scene where Driss steals a Faberge egg that was given to Phillipe by his late wife.

161,1.0,4 June 2012,"Greetings again from the darkness. Sometimes acting elevates material to a level far beyond what a film might have otherwise deserved. Such is the case with this based-on-a-true-story effort from co-writers and co-directors Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano. Despite the elements of truth, the core material here is a sentimental tale that we have seen before. Francois Cluzet (Tell No One) as Philippe and Omar Sy as Driss turn it into an extremely entertaining story with characters we quickly connect with.

Philippe is a wealthy quadriplegic widower who is interviewing candidates for a caregiver. Driss is a recently released from jail street hustler who is just trying to qualify for state benefits by going on the required interviews. Philippe is struck by Driss' direct approach and energy level, and chooses Driss over the room full of more qualified types.

The rest of the movie is really a buddy flick where the polar opposites bring much to the other. Philippe slyly gets Driss to use his sharp mind a bit more effectively, and Driss taps into Philippe's hidden lust for life. Though the supporting cast is fine, the film's best scenes are those featuring Philippe and Driss.

This is a film from France and much as been made of the filmmakers' decision to change the caregiver from the real life Arab to a more cinema-friendly Black man. The Earth, Wind & Fire dance may be a bit too much, but I choose to believe the casting of Omar Sy was the deciding factor, not his race. He lights up the screen and draws us right into his world and his choices - some of which are better than others.

The film shares much with The Sea Inside, Scent of a Woman, and The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, but this one has much more humor and bonding than any of those. It doesn't shy away from the melodramatic moments and isn't above trying to generate tears in viewers.

As for The Intouchables, I really liked the film and found it entertaining and thoughtful at the same time .The chemistry between the two leads is wonderful. Not quite as insufferably retro as it sounds, the formulaic film gets a boost from the endearing performances of its leads — particularly Sy, whose ex-con-turned-servant instructs his cultured boss on the pleasures of '70s soul classics and pot-smoking before cleaning up nicely. The racial politics remain as sketchy as the sitcom-style jokes, and Harvey Weinstein smells a hit, having bought both the movie and, alas, the rights to remake.","November 2, 2011 (France)"
163,9.0,23 December 2012,"Just as how Jack Neo's Ah Boys to Men Part 1 finally took over the box office crown held by Money No Enough more than a decade ago, so did Intouchables take over the French box office equivalent from the quirky comedy Amelie, which was the champ over about the last decade. As the French entry for the Oscar's Best Foreign Film picture next year, I was glad I held out against watching this while on a flight, patiently waiting for it to make its big screen bow here, which it finally did outside of the 2nd Rendezvous of French Cinema earlier this month.

There were many moments that made it so easy for me to identify with the movie, especially coming from caregiving, which is never an easy thing to do. Those who have never done it, I'm talking about full time, real time, on the job alertness, and doing everything you can to make things comfortable for the other party. There's no Off button you can use, and anyone in this for full time employment, gets my utmost respect. And watching how the characters here go about their routine, bring back memories that are forever dear to me, and needless to say, these routines and close contact interaction, bring about a new level in relationships.

Lifting someone up from bed in back-breaking fashion, it brings new meaning to ""He ain't Heavy, He's my Father"". Tucking someone into bed. Did that too. The gloves for the toilet visit, nothing new, gross that it may be at first. Wheeling someone out to soak in sights and sounds outside of one's home, well, it may be the most inconvenient, but seeing someone's face light up for the rare trip out, is priceless. And these life-affirming, relationship building events may seem to stem from mundane tasks, and tasks we take for granted, such as bathing or just sheer presence to interact without distraction, but to the physically infirm, it means the world.

And this is what The Intouchables is about, the story of two men thrown together by fate in what would be an employer-employee relationship that develops into firm friendship, a bromance even if you'd like. Inspired by a true story, Francois Cluzet plays the rich aristocrat Philippe, who is quadriplegic from the neck down from a paragliding accident, and has to rely on an army of helpers and assistances to get through every day. But his primary caregiver never lasts more than a week, given his rather stiff (pardon the pun) ways, until Driss (Omar Sy), a young man with not the most polished resume - he responded to the ad just to chalk up mileage to get welfare - gets hired despite verbally crossing swords during the interview, and soon, a bet turns into what's life-changing for them both, bringing out the best in each other.

You can half expect writer-directors Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano's story to contain the usual clash of cultures and background, with one refined in the arts and the other being quite the rough and gruff, obviously no time to enjoy the finer things in life when one has to worry about bringing home the bacon for an extended family, with trouble brewing when members trying to stay in line with the law. But their story is tinged with so much sensitivity and truth, that it's hard to quibble with the loads of humanity on display, going by the adage that one shouldn't judge a book by its cover, or by one's background or resume. One may be rich, but getting someone else to wait on you, even if providing him or her with a comfortable life, is a different ballgame altogether, especially when one is not kin or kith.

But throughout the story, one cannot deny that life can still go on quite comfortably in a material way, with wealth on display, and if there's a minor grouse about this, is how old money gets flaunted around, with Meseratis and private jets being part of the arsenal to enjoy life. Then again, this is part of the true tale, so it's not debatable. Not forgetting the extended ensemble cast of assistants in the form of Yvonne (Anne Le Ny) and Magalie (Audrey Fleurot) amongst others who pepper the scenery, the former serving to fill in the blanks for Driss as he tries to gather background, while the latter coming in as an object for Driss' romance, with a little surprise up in store.

There's no qualms The Intouchables is a delight to sit through, being a story of hope and friendship. And in some ways, even for the most able amongst us, this is a tale that reminds us of the importance of humour, which is medicine enough to get us through some of the toughest situations we'll encounter from time to time. Both Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy put in amazing performances, and their delivery of their characters, screen charisma and banter, are more than reasons enough to catch this. A definite recommendation!","November 2, 2011 (France)"

The characters are exceptional, especially in their social contrast--but when the inevitable social comparisons are made, they are either handled with genuine surprize, or else expertly buffooned. Some of the obvious exchanges are handled so well, and so unexpectedly that there are guffaws from the audience. The story is wonderfully touching, without any syrup. That it is a true story makes it even more surprizing and appealing. I don't know which other contemporary movie I would rate a perfect 10. Well done.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

I will say I was little skeptic at the beginning because I usually watch American/English movies mostly and I usually don't like non-English movies, I found them almost every time boring and I lose interest very soon, but this one kept me watching without a brake. Its just a WONDERFUL story about friendship and courage of two men that came from totally different backgrounds, but they fit together in this movie PERFECTLY. I gotta say Omar Sy performance was Oscar worthy, he was just great, he made me laugh through the whole movie and he was incredible, and François Cluzet, what can I say about him, he was just great, playing such hard role, I think no one would have done better job then him. Two of them together carried the whole movie and made it PERFECT. The story was based on true events and I believe that fact made the movie even better because it has one thing that most other movies don't have and that is REALITY.

168,1.0,20 October 2014,"The concept of popular cinema has undergone considerable change in France. In the past, it was a device used by film journalists to define films made by directors namely Gérard Oury, Georges Lautner, Claude Zidi etc. In recent times, one sees a new breed of directors especially Dany Boon, Michel Munz, Thomas Gilou etc whose films have had tremendous commercial success. The team of Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakache is a new entrant to this group. Their film ""The Intouchables"" can be classified as a 'feel good' film with elements of 'popular cinema'. It sacrifices its elements of realism to portray an imperfect world of ""the haves"" and the ""haves not"" through the depiction of how black people are somewhat forced to live in suburbs whereas their friends live in expensive areas of Paris. As a character study of people from different areas, it shows why only a handful of black people are able to mingle with white people.

I felt after watching this movie one of those life affirming moments - a clear summer sky where the clouds are full, loaded with health and the warm light that seems to last forever showing off the land about you typical of summer evenings.

This 'glow' is because the principal casts are excellent. I cannot direct a negative to any of the casts, pinpoint a scene where the acting was forced or lacking in motivation. Omar Sy is infectious as a performer. He struts. He dominates with his energy. Whoever cast him deserves praise, as he is the right balance between cock sure attitude and understanding. Francois Cluzet pedigree dates back decades, and his assured but restrained performance is the right level of rebound compared to Sy's exuberance. Trust in a maestro to deliver a seasoned performance. It would be easy - and a major oversight - to read the synopsis about the movie and believe the subject matter depressing. Funny, moving, idiosyncratic, unexpected, real, intimate, soul praisingly positive, and many other adjectives could be used to describe this excellent film.

I stumbled upon this movie knowing little of its release or background, and its a gem of a film. One of them films you watch and yell, 'yesssss to life'.

It might help to think of ""The Intouchables"" as a French spin off of ""Driving Miss Daisy,"" retitled ""Pushing Monsieur Philippe."" A stuffy rich employer finds his life enriched by a wise black man from the Paris ghettos and takes lessons in funky music and the joys of marijuana. This is a story that has been told time and again in the movies, and sometimes the performances overcome the condescension of the formula.

The film was an enormous box-office hit in France, and indeed, it is easy to enjoy. Philippe (Francois Cluzet) is a millionaire who was paralyzed from the neck down in a para-gliding accident. Driss (Omar Sy) is a man out on parole for robbery, who applies for the job of Philippe's caregiver only so he can be rejected and get a signature on his application for unemployment benefits. As Philippe interviews one boring job applicant after another, we begin to understand that he needs not only physical help but someone to cheer him up. Driss' cheeky irreverence is refreshing, and Philippe astonishes him and his own household staff by offering him the job.

The movie tells the story of a growing relationship between these two likable men, based on Driss' confidence that Philippe will improve if he escapes his stuck-up lifestyle and samples the greater freedoms of an immigrant from Africa. There may be a certain truth in this, but the education of Philippe proceeds in a series of essentially insulting clichés. Driss, you see, has rhythm and soul, and if only Philippe can absorb some of that, he'll be a happier man. He'll still be a French millionaire surrounded by a protective staff, he'll still be paralyzed, but he'll be happier. How many times have we seen the scene where an uptight square inhales pot for the first time and a smile slowly spreads across his face? ""The Intouchables"" has an element of truth that it never quite recognizes. The role of a good caregiver is hardly limited to lifting, bathing, grooming, dressing, pushing and supplying medicines. The patient is faced with a reality he finds it difficult to accept: he has been deprived of all he once took for granted, such as the simple ability to walk across a room. A caregiver can't provide that, but he can provide something more valuable, companionship. Philippe's wife is dead, his teenage daughter is a snotty brat, and his staff is preoccupied by their salaries and status. Driss comes from a different world.

The success of the film, despite its problems, grows directly from its casting. Francois Cluzet, who acts only with his face and voice, communicates great feeling. Omar Sy is enormously friendly and upbeat. He reminded me of the African immigrant played by Souleymane Sy Savane in Ramin Bahrani's ""Goodbye Solo"" — a film that avoided the traps that ""The Intouchables"" falls into.

The appeal of a film like this, and it is perfectly legitimate, is that when we begin to feel affection for the characters, what makes them happy make us happy. Caught up in the flow of events, we allow many assumptions to pass unchallenged. The writer-directors, Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano, are cheerfully willing to go for broad gags, and their style is ingratiating. But at the end, by looking through the foreground details, what we're being given is a simplistic reduction of racial stereotypes.

That was also true of ""Driving Miss Daisy,"" but it was a period picture set in the South in the late 1940s, with older characters who had been shaped by their times. There was a plausibility there. ""The Intouchables"" is more of a soothing fantasy.

One the plus side, the movie is funny and sensitive at the same time. In this role Omar keeps his trademark hilarious attitude. He gets the job to work for Philippe, played by 'Francois Cluzet'.

Philippe loves Cedric's behaviour and attitude (Omar Sy) because he treats him like a normal person without mercy or sympathetic. In this movie you will discover a story of love and close friendship.

Moreover, this movie is taken from a true story which make the plot even more real and attractive.

183,1.0,13 July 2012,"Okay, so my first concern why I didn't want to watch The Intouchables was the story itself. Like it was scavenged from a Hollywood studio's thrash can: ""A disgustingly rich quadriplegic guy hires a down-on-his- luck young man from the projects to be his personal aid. The cool dude shows the stuck up old man how to have fun and in return the rich guy teaches him about arts, manners and whatnot. Initially they have a few quarrels that mostly derives from the social, racial and age difference (and that the man is actually paralyzed from the neck down) but in the end they grow close and live happily ever after."" That really sounds like something Hollywood might cook up. Like Scent of a Woman or Flawless.

But here's the catch: This movie is based on true events. Not in the sense as Titanic for example, where the only historically accurate fact was that ""the ship sunk"". It really how it happened in real life as depicted in this movie. Philippe Pozzo Di Borgo (the real life billionaire who this movie is about) personally oversaw the making of this movie to make sure it depicted the story of him and Abdel Sellou (his aid) as realistically as possible. Sure, they took a little artistic license here and there, but it's mostly accurate.

The thing about cripples and terminally ill patients is that most people don't know how to handle them. Dr. House said it best in the series, that once people know you have cancer, from then on everything will be about cancer. People will feel obligated to feel sorry for you 24/7. They will be overly attentive, overly helpful to the point of annoying and will be really careful about how they talk to you. They will never ever just be themselves around you. Even if you've accepted your condition a long time ago, and sometimes you just wanna forget your debilitating disease, you'll be reminded every single time by these people who cannot NOT see the cripple or the person with the death sentence when they look at you.

What this movie offers is a unique insight into a relationship that defies this. Driss is brash, brazen and completely disregards the notion of feeling sorry for Phillip. He acknowledges the fact that he is a quadriplegic, and he slowly learns to take care of him, but he seemingly refuses to be the gloomy oh-I'm-so-sorry kind of hypocrite society wants him to be. Instead, he makes fun of Phillip's condition on many occasions making even Phillip himself laugh. He introduces a fresh and invigorating energy into Phillip's life, which makes him see the world in a new light. Instead of wallowing in the sad and painful past, he starts to look to the future, take chances and make the best of what he can of what he still has.

It was written and directed by Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano (Samba, Those Happy Days, Tellement proches).

This film is about a quadriplegic millionaire named Philippe (François Cluzet) who hires a lower-class man from the projects called Driss(Omar Sy). With help from Driss, Philippe finds humour in his situation and Driss reminds him how to appreciate life again through setting him up on dates, listening to funk music and even giving him a joint.

This film is propelled by the performances by François Cluzet and Omar Sy. François gives his performance purely through dialogue and facial movements. Surprisingly he gives a great performance filled with emotion and humour. Omar Sy plays an incredibly likable character who can really make you laugh at points and at others make you feel very compassionate about his issues. Whenever the two are on screen together it is gold. I would compare their chemistry to those of buddy cop movies although this relationship is a lot deeper.

Another aspect of this film that I admired was the dialogue. Since there is no real plot other than the story of two men, the film is carried by a lot of good dialogue. For example, when the two are looking at a piece of art, Philippe asks Driss why he thinks people are interested in art, Driss replies with because it's a business when Philippe tells him it's because it's the only thing one leaves behind.

This film is basically the French version of Driving Miss Daisy, that is not to say this film is bad. This film's strongest points are writing and acting, but after that it's pretty thin. Directing or cinematography isn't anything special and the piano soundtrack sounds like something that would be added to an amateur short film.

192,8.0,15 June 2012,"Intouchables is probably one of the best French movies of the last few decades. It's not hard to see why it raised such a tremendous furor in Europe, and now it's creating an even bigger fan base for itself in the United States. It's so utterly pleasurable and heart-warming. Don't look at it as a foreign feature, though, or you will miss ale the excitement. It's a movie simply made for the viewers to love and remember. Films like this one don't come out too often these days, so just sit back and enjoy it while it's still out on the big screen.

Intouchables presents a truly touching story about an unlikely friendship between an older, extremely rich, but severely paralyzed white man and a black man, who just got out of prison. Philippe is in need of a caretaker and as soon as Omar steps into his house he realizes that he might be the right person for this specific role. The plot doesn't concentrate too much on the way that those two guys connect over time, but quickly shows how they got so fond of each other. It was as if they were meant to work together and, in the process, become 'intouchable', in a very profound meaning of the word, and inseparable by any outer force. It's fantastic to see how people from completely different backgrounds are able to form such a strong bond and spend so many wonderful days and nights together. Even though at first it might seem that Omar may be overly vulgar, disrespectful, ignorant, and simply inadequate for this hard job, Philippe is still eager to give him a chance. What's more, many of Philippe closest friends don't approve of his new companion, but that doesn't discourage him.

It is simply remarkable, how Omar is able to bring warmth, enthusiasm, and so much fun into Philippe's life. They actually operate on the same wavelength, as it might seem, sharing the same views and opinions on various topics. Through Omar Philippe understands that sometimes all it takes to achieve pure happiness is to let go and do what one feels like doing, as if nothing really mattered, even if you are attached to a wheelchair.

And with that moving tale the movie creates a very powerful message, showing that all the wealth and money isn't capable of making a man truly happy, when he doesn't have someone to share it with. It's the richness in heart and mind that really matters, not the abilities of a body blessed with fortune and power.

Through his brilliant, funny, and very real performance, Omar Sy will probably give his career a fantastic jump start. He is able to show the transition that his character goes through, from a cold man living on the streets, to a deeply compassionate and art-loving protector, in the most convincing manner.

The amount of clever, laughable, and sometimes insulting (but timed very adequately) jokes is simply overwhelming. Also, notice the amazing mix of classic music and 60's soul and the way it enhances the visualization of this very peculiar friendship between the characters.

I don't think that if someone would've come to me with a script and said: 'Listen, I got a story about a young black guy who makes fun of a handicapped man and gives him weed to smoke just to make him feel more relaxed' I would've bought it.

It's a simple exaggeration, but through that straight statement I want to show that the movie has yet so much more to offer, making the marvelous Intouchables a true stand-out movie of the last few years. Highly recommended.","November 2, 2011 (France)"
193,9.0,7 March 2013,"Films such as THE INTOUCHABLES come around far too seldom and when they do the public should somehow be advised that here is a cup of magic that could alter the manner in which we relate to each other and to the world tainted by schisms of societal errors. Written and directed by Olivier Nakache and Éric Toledano the film was inspired by the true story of Philippe Pozzo di Borgo and his caregiver Abdel Sellou, discovered by the directors in 'A la vie, à la mort', a documentary film. Of note, the book version of the film's story was written and released after the film enjoyed great success. Written by Abdel Sellou the book 'You Saved My Life' tells the extraordinary true story of the charming Algerian con-man' friendship with a disabled French aristocrat. Sellou's book shows the real man behind Sellou/Driss's smiling face. The book takes us from his childhood spent stealing candy from the local grocery store, to his career as a pickpocket and scam artist, to his unexpected employment as a companion for a quadriplegic. Sellou has never before divulged the details of his past. In many interviews and documentaries, he has evaded or shrugged off the question of his childhood and his stay in prison, until now. He tells his story with a stunning amount of talent, with humor, style, and--though he denies that he has any--humility. Abdel Sellou now lives in Algeria with his wife and three children, where he runs a chicken farm. He remains close to Philippe Pozzo di Borgo, who lives in Morocco with his second wife and two children.

The cinematic version of this relationship is an irreverent, uplifting comedy about friendship, trust and human possibility. After he becomes a quadriplegic from a paragliding accident the aristocratic intellectual Parisian millionaire Philippe (François Cluzet) is interviewing candidates for the position of his caretaker with his secretary Magalie (Audrey Fleurot). Out of the blue, the rude ex-con African Driss (Omar Sy) cuts the line of candidates and brings a document from the Social Security and asks to Philippe to sign it to prove that he is seeking a job position to receive his unemployment insurance. Philippe, impressed that Driss is the only candidate who does not look at him with pity, challenges Driss and offers a period of adaptation of one week to him to gain experience helping him. Then Driss would decide whether he would like to stay with him or not. Driss accepts the bet and moves to the mansion, changing the boring life of Philippe and his employees, especially under the watchful and compassionate eye of the head of the house staff Yvonne (Anne Le Ny). As Driss reluctantly learns to move, feed, and clean Philippe, the two men discover a blunt but vital humor that not only bridges the cultural and class divide between them, but gives Philippe a renewed joy in life - and a chance to turn his passionate epistolary relationship with one Eleanore whom he has never seen into a chance at a second go at life.

The only aspect of this film that is somewhat distracting is that the film opens with a car adventure involving both Philippe and Dris which is terrific film making and very funny but does make the film's beginning (after the credits) seem less surprising. A very minor point, especially when the film ends with the same activity but this time drives it to an incredibly touching completion. Highly recommended on every level: both François Cluzet and Omar Sy are brilliant!

194,7.0,24 July 2013,"Their is a reason why this movie is rated higher than Lawrence of Arabia or 2001, just for the same reason the Shawshank Redemption is rated higher than Citizen Kane and the godfather. Because this is a movie about hope, love, patience....and all the characteristics we all hope we have. And what's wrong with that???

The movie is about two people who can not be any more different. One has his health, he is tall, strong and playful but no money and education what so ever. The other has all the money in the world but everything below his neck is paralyzed, he is reserved in manner. After they meet they quickly connect. It is as if they both find, in each other, the things they have been craving for a long time.

The movie was a hit with audiences when it came out but it is not that popular with critics because according to them it is too stereotypical. Well i don't agree with that one bit. I thought the movie handles all the moral issues very correctly. I was also sad to learn that this movie wasn't even nominated for a best foreign language film award, it is such a shame. Anyways, if you haven't seen this movie please do, because it is one of those movies that make you feel good from the very inside.

As for the technical stuff, i thought everything was spot on. the movie is put together in a way that makes you wonder if their even is anyone behind the camera which is a good thing because it shows how the actors are so natural in their rolls.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

199,1.0,27 May 2013,"Amusing heartwarming drama about a quadriplegic millionaire who looks for a carer, but all the ""professional"" applicants are condescending, unfeeling and all about their paper qualifications and academic knowledge reducing Philippe (Francois Cluzet) to an object. Driss (Omar Sy) is at the interview just to get Benefits but his irreverence and dismissive laissez faire attitude actually meant that he treated Philippe like a person. A heartwarming relationship grows with it's ups and downs, bringing in more about each of their pasts and hopes for the future.

The film is simply filmed, with a witty and gripping script (subtitled into English), which isn't lost in translation. The actors Cluzet and Sy were brilliant in their respective roles with Cluzet brilliantly portraying quadriplegic, only able to move his head and face, but his acting is a commitment to trust in that he has to remain still and inflexible. Sy was exuberant, fun and wild but also showing sensitivity and well-portrayed comic-stupidity. There's music, art and dancing, love and sexuality, fast cars, adrenalin sports, laughs a-plenty but also desperation, struggle and prejudice.

It's well acted but whilst the plot is based on a true story, and has something for everyone in true 'underdog makes good' or 'Rainman-esque' style, the screenplay is lacking something. I'm not sure what it is, I think perhaps it's that there are holes in the characters, and in the plot and you are left with questions; you feel it's going to go a certain way... I expected more with Philippe's daughter 'Uncle Buck' style but liked how Driss lightened the mood of the house and brought joy and friendship to the story but ultimately there was something unfulfilled with his character, there wasn't enough depth and finish. I felt that use of Driss played to stereotypes, especially finding out that the original carer wasn't from Senegal but North Africa/Morocco and I wonder whether the story was exaggerated for the screenplay.

I liked this film a lot, highly watchable and enjoyable and a very good cinematic experience. I can see why this was lauded but it's not particularly original and did play to stereotypes and didn't feel exactly finished. I was glad I saw it though, and it is apparently France's second most successful film after Welcome to the Sticks. A wonderful soundtrack, the Chamber Orchestra scene was great.","November 2, 2011 (France)"
200,1.0,4 October 2012,"After missing last year's 'The Help' on principle (the principle being: black people have moved on; why can't Hollywood?), I couldn't help but approach 'Untouchable' with similar trepidation. My preconception was a misconception: It is one of the best films I've seen all year, and is by far the best foreign one. It's about platonic love between polar opposites. It's about hope and happiness.

Set in Paris, Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano's heart-warming film stars François Cluzet (a dead ringer for Dustin Hoffman) as Philippe, a wealthy quadriplegic widower and Omar Sy as Driss, a brutish ex-offender from a Parisian project.

Looking for someone who will not pity him, Philippe hires Driss as his carer. Driss almost leaves until he sees his lavish quarters – and Magalie, Philippe's sexy auburn-haired secretary, who Driss makes it his mission to bed. Driss does pity Philippe, but never makes the mistake of showing it. Instead, the two make jokes at each other's expense and a bond very quickly (and believably) develops. They introduce each other to their worlds. One is replete with operas, art and literature; the other with girls, spliffs and street knowledge. By the end of the film they are inseparable.

This could easily have been a tale of race, like 'The Help' was, but that is inconsequential in this film. It is purely coincidental that Philippe is white and Driss is black. When Philippe's personnel look disapprovingly at Driss, they do so because of his rough manner, not his colour. One of the film's strengths is that it doesn't mention this detail, which is after all as irrelevant as it being set in France. One thing that ought to be mentioned is that Omar Sy is not just the help in this film; he's the star, commanding the screen with confidence, charm and credibility.

What cautions me from classing this as a perfect film is the few but prominent clichés. Philippe has a daughter who's so much the stereotypical spoiled little girl, and Driss's own family hates him. Also, the setups are overly familiar. Driss scoffs at Philippe's love for classical music and abstract art, but then learns to love Vivaldi and Bach, and then, astonishingly, creates a painting of his own which sells for 11,000 euros! This film is based on real people (Philippe Pozzo di Borgo and his carer Abdel Sellou), so these things may be accurate, but this isn't a documentary of their actual lives.

However, I can easily forgive these clichés because they are outnumbered by the many wonderful laugh-out-loud moments. Returning from a hiatus, Driss insists on shaving an unkempt Philippe. He snips away leaving Philippe looking more absurd upon each stroke, leaving him with a hitlerian moustache!

Already 'Untouchable' has achieved a phenomenal level of success. It is making and breaking records across the globe, and is beating such films as 'The Artist' to awards. It has rightly been entered as France's entry for next year's Oscars. It is sure to win.

207,1.0,24 November 2012,"Feel-good French film The Intouchables tells the true story of the burgeoning friendship between an old, aristocratic invalid and his young, impoverished caretaker. Sounds pretty lame, doesn't it? It sounds like the kind of film that, at some point, seems destined to travel down one of two paths, descending either into a lecture on the class differences between certain socioeconomic groups or a comparison between the relative hardships of near-poverty and living with a severe disability.

And therein lies the excellence of this film. Not only does it avoid both topics and, in so doing, keeps itself from becoming overly melodramatic, but it actually subverts audience expectations by persistently looking, as those Monty Python boys suggested, on the bright side of life. A big part of the film's charm is the effortless interplay between Omar Sy (caretaker Driss) and Francois Cluzet (Philippe), who clearly have a lot of fun with their roles while concurrently displaying total immersion in their characters.

If managed poorly by directors Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano, Driss's avalanche of one-liners and practical jokes at the expense of his handicapped friend could've come off as misplaced and in poor taste. However, the acting pair's wit and comic timing turns virtually all hit-or-miss jokes into gold and contributes greatly to making The Intouchables...well...just plain funny.

In the same way that 'fun for the whole family' has comes to be interpreted as 'a living hell for anyone over six' by contemporary viewers, the classification of a 'dramedy' has come to imply a meagre handful of humour, quickly pushed aside to make room for a sob story. The Intouchables gets the formula right, injecting varied forms of comedy in between a genuine, emotionally investing subplot involving the lovelorn Philippe's pen pal Eleonore (Dorothee Briere). A toe-tapping soundtrack brimming with disco classics serves as the icing on the cake for this potentially Oscar-winning delight.

It is a really charming film, but charm doesn't make a film. It's one of those films built on unconventional friendship and culture clash (also a true story and people it's based on appear in the end credits, similar to 127 Hours), but the difference is that the quadriplegic, Philippe, and the caretaker, Driss, have minimal conflict and bond right away as soon as they adjust to each other. Rather than disapprove or be irritated by Driss interfering or being a nuisance during things Philippe likes, he immediately finds it amusing and refreshing. It's nice to see, but it hinders growth of character, which instead they reach effortlessly by sharing the experience of music, hookers, drugs and paragliding. It is quite entertaining and sometimes moving, but there's not really a story or strong narrative here besides two people improving each others lives through a few light situations.

Unfortunately the film doesn't have a particular style or it tries things which feel jarring - such as the montage split screen music video style opening credits after a very strong thriller theme. The cinematography is nothing special and the editing is quite distracting with some scenes with time jump cuts that really didn't do it for me. It does focus on its strongest aspects which are the eccentric and charismatic performances, writing and soundtrack (a mix of R'n'B and classical to fit the characters). All the situations are things we've seen before and it's never dealt in a way we haven't seen before (such as Philippe having a long distance lover that Driss pushes him towards), it is the chemistry of the central friendship that makes the film. It is very pleasant. But those pleasant ideas only work for the 2nd act, after an awkward 1st and 3rd that doesn't really satisfy or close itself. It trades potential for genuine conflict or dilemma for directionless despair due to crisis of confidence and ultimately renders the film not making much of an impression. Granted, as a buddy film, it's pretty damn good and it certainly has its strong feel-good moments.

221,1.0,11 August 2012,"A French movie with English subtitles enters the finicky American movie market with two strikes against it.

It's French -- strike one.

It has subtitles -- strike two.

Which is a crying shame, because one of the year's most enjoyable and uplifting films has pretty much come and vanished from theaters, unable to garner much attention during another summer filled with mindless action adventure ""thrillers"" and sleep-inducing ""comedies."" The Intouchables is a marvelous film. Carried by two outstanding lead performances by Francois Cluzet (who bears an uncanny resemblance to Dustin Hoffman) and Omar Cy (who deserves an Oscar nomination for a movie-stealing performance), this film has wit, candor, humor, sadness, and ultimately great inspiration. The film's credibility is boosted by it being based on a true story.

Cluzet plays a quadriplegic, which means he is confined to a wheelchair unable to feel any sensation below his neck. If there's any upside, it's that he's also very wealthy, giving him considerable options that would not otherwise be available to a person of lesser means.

Cluzet is utterly bored with his life, not the least of which has anything to do with his physical impairment. One senses that even if he were not parked in a wheelchair, he would still need something more. A great deal more, in fact. What Cluzet needs is stimulation, excitement, and most of all – someone he can call a friend.

He finds all of this in the unlikeliest of places.

Omar Cy plays the part of unemployed street thug to absolute perfection. He's a Senegalese immigrant languishing in the slums of Paris burdened with typical urban family difficulties -- poverty, drug abuse, lack of hope and opportunity. One can imagine that there are many Omar Cy's living as second-class citizens throughout the modern world. In fact, the city here may be Paris. But it could just as easily be Sao Paulo or Chicago. He meets Cluzet in what can only be described as an unexpected encounter, and the two men begin to engage in an uneasy, but captivating friendship.

Everyone can see what's coming next. And that's perfectly okay. Initially indifferent to Cluzet's condition, Cy will ultimately come to care deeply for the man who is not just an employer, but a pathway out of pointlessness. The man in the chair becomes a muse and means of escape, an emotional and spiritual home for a foreigner who instantly resumes the role of ""immigrant"" once he steps back beyond the threshold of Cluzet's luxurious apartment and back onto the streets of Paris.

The two men desperately need each other, in completely different ways. Eventually, they engage on a bucket list of activities, bonding in the process, allowing the rest of us to go along for the ride. And what a joyous ride it is.

Critics have correctly pointed out this film gives a somewhat sanitized depiction of what being without the use of one's arms and legs must be like. While most of the film focuses on the role of caregiver, we are constantly reminded (or perhaps, I simply could not get it out of my mind) that not every quadriplegic receives such meticulous physical care nor emotional support. It helps to have money, no matter who you are.

But I was willing to overlook this and enjoy a film full of energy, comedy, and ultimately of happiness.

Admittedly, the conclusion of the film seems all too neat and tidy. But again, I am going to give the filmmakers a pass here for reasons you may understand only if you see the film, which enables audiences to come and appreciate how important people are to other people. After all, we are allowed to enjoy an uplifting film every once in a while. Never mind that it's all somewhat contrived.

One of my barometers in judging a film comes with a fundamental question. Namely, do I think about the film the next day, and perhaps the next.

I did. I must admit I was moved emotionally by this film. So was everyone else in the audience, from the reactions I saw. I laughed. I teared up. And, I rejoiced in the end.

Call me naive, but I wish all life ended just like it does in the movies. I know -- it doesn't.

Over a period of time , a rich white mid-age, filthy rich quadriplegic and an unemployed,poor,care-free black guy become good friend and earn mutual respect for each other. As the story progress, we see how two different people from different background becomes close friends and develops a strong bond.

Directed by duo Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano, The Intouchables, based on true story, is a classic comedy blended with high- octane drama and brave performances. The introductory scene is itself is so impressive that you get engrossed in the film right from the beginning. Hats off to the director to develop the each character effectively which blemishes with film scenario. The script is so tight that you would not feel bore for even a single second in the film. Couple of scenes are hilarious in the movie. The scene where Driss dances to his own tune on Philippe birthday party , the scene where Driss warns Bastein to stay away from Philippe's daughter are just like icing on the cake. Even the emotional scenes have shot so well coupled with beautiful background score. Coming to the performances , I was totally floored by Omar Sy's gallant performance. He makes the film alive the moment he steps in the scene. His care-free , straight from the heart , funny-loving character will stay with you even after leaving the theater for sometime. François Cluzet puts in powerhouse performance as Philippe. It takes guts to sit on chair through the entire film and still act well with just the expressions. Brilliant !!!

I kept on hearing about this film for long time and am glad I took the decision to watch the film. There are so many reasons to watch this film - Nice Storyline , strong direction , fantastic performances and above all superb background score that gels with mood of the film !!! Highly recommended : 4/5","November 2, 2011 (France)"

228,1.0,9 February 2013,"So many movies and TV programmes involving disabled characters are saccharine and patronising in an effort to inspire or hammer home a message of triumph over adversity. Not so the Intouchables. This movie finally gives an honest portrait of disabled man, at once gruesome and humbling, while keeping the focus firmly on his relationship with his carer instead of dwelling on his disability. Indeed this is a story as much about overcoming class divide as it is about overcoming physical disability.

Down and out Driss, part of Paris's disenfranchised and unemployed black youth, applies for a position as millionaire quadriplegic Phillipe's carer in order to get a signature for his jobseeker's benefit. Phillipe, appreciating the young man's honesty and frank attitude towards his condition, hires Driss and simultaneously resolves the Driss's poverty and his own boredom.

The genius of this film, in spite of its dark subject matter and themes of disability, class and race, is that it is genuinely hilarious. Omar Sy as the no holds barred Driss oozes cool and yet is heartbreakingly affectionate towards Francois Cluzet's Phillipe.

From the premise up we get treated to a repetition of the same joke with the paraplegic at the center. I can't remember the last time I saw such an array of unfunny clichés posing as a film. Omar Sy does well as the French version of Will Smith and other actors perform on par. The film's impact just relies too much on the obvious humor excavated from situations involving a man who due to an accident can only move his head.

The Intouchables is incredible from the first minutes up until the closing scenes. It displays the aspects of drama by showing a connection between the two worlds that the main characters live in and when the two worlds merge together, the story manages to keep you smiling throughout the duration of the film. The beauty of the film is that it does not force the jokes and humor, the moments kind of happen on their on thanks to the brilliant play of the main characters who have good chemistry.

Last but not least, when I rate movies I tend to give 9/10 and usually that last 10th star depends on the music and job that the composers have done. In The Inouchables music fits perfectly into the settings and the emotions... 10 out of 10","November 2, 2011 (France)"

In spite of several teases and jokes related to disability, they are included in a logical and realistic way into Driss 's character (splendidly played by Omar Sy). No wonder that the film has received so much warm welcome and has become one of the biggest French successes all over the world. Opposites, even antipodes have several things in common, but there are a few occasions triggering the events to understand them.

The film could be recommended even to those who have disabled persons closely around. Perhaps it is then possible to find new angles to deal with them and bring more joy and variety into their lives.

And last but not least: I hope no Hollywood remake is made, although Eddie Murphy and Dustin Hoffman (just my guess due to their looks and similarity) could be tempted to go for it...","November 2, 2011 (France)"

A simple story about a poor black guy taking care of old paralyze man. It's simple, sweet and at moments very, very funny. The actor who plays Driss makes excellent job by portraying character as street-wise and amusing. It's just a short of person who you would want to hang-out with from the very first second.

Some of my favorite parts are the comedy which often take you off-gourd but drama is perfect as well. There where few small moments when movie felt manipulative (playing sad music in a scene that otherwise would be happy moments)but my only honest complain is the fact that the movie Driss doesn't look a thing as the historical one, and the fact that they show the footage of actual Driss during the credits doesn't help much.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

As one go deeper into the movie, it gives an understanding of how life truly is and how people sometimes are not what they really seem. 'The Intouchable' is truly a fun, entertaining and meaningful movie.

The actors are great and unlike other movies I have watched recently, there is no over acting on their part. Every character adds to the colorfulness of the movie and the movie obviously was sure how the plot would go from beginning to end like most great novels. Since it is based on a true story, it makes you wonder how two people from two totally different world find a friend in such condition. I do not know how much this movie achieved, award wise but I am positive, it is a movie for all people who watch movies for all reasons.

246,1.0,27 March 2023,"""The Intouchables"" (2011) is a touching and humorous film that portrays the unlikely friendship between two very different men. Philippe, a wealthy quadriplegic, and Driss, an ex-convict from the projects, develop a deep bond through their shared experiences and sense of humor. The film is beautifully shot, with stunning scenes of Paris and the French countryside. The acting is exceptional, particularly Omar Sy's portrayal of Driss, which is both hilarious and moving. The film is a perfect balance of comedy and drama, with moments of pure joy and heartbreak. It is a powerful reminder of the human capacity for empathy and connection, even across perceived boundaries of class and ability.

Director Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano have created a masterpiece with ""The Intouchables,"" which has become one of France's most successful films. The film is both entertaining and thought-provoking, with a powerful message about the importance of friendship and understanding. The script is smart and witty, with many memorable lines that will stay with the viewer long after the film has ended.

Overall, ""The Intouchables"" is a heartwarming and inspiring film that will leave you laughing, crying, and feeling grateful for the people in your life. It is a must-see film that will appeal to audiences of all ages and backgrounds.","November 2, 2011 (France)"
247,7.0,11 November 2014,"After he becomes a quadriplegic from a paragliding accident, an aristocrat (François Cluzet) hires a young man from the projects (Omar Sy) to be his caretaker.

The Independent called it a ""a third-rate buddy movie that hardly understands its own condescension....Why has the world flipped for this movie? Maybe it's the fantasy it spins on racial/social/cultural mores, much as Driving Miss Daisy did 20-odd years ago – uptight rich white employer learns to love through black employee's life-force. That was set in the segregationist America of the 1940s. What's this film's excuse?""

While ""the Independent"" is right to call out the film's unrealistic portrayals of race and class, perhaps it somewhat misses the point. This film is obviously humorous, clearly not based on reality, and is probably not meant to be taken seriously. The movie has very much the same spirit as ""The Birdcage"" (at least the American version, if not the French one).

Now, this means the film also happens to be overrated, currently (November 2014) sitting high on IMDb's Top 250. A good comedy, yes, but not a film that offers any sort of deeper meaning or one that will remain important over the long term.

This narrative, centered around the evolving friendship between a wealthy quadriplegic and his caregiver, is both deeply touching and refreshingly humorous.

What sets The Intouchables apart is its approach to delicate themes like disability and social disparity. It addresses these issues with a blend of humor and honesty, steering clear of clichés and patronizing tones. The movie is an honest portrayal of life's challenges and the power of human connection to overcome them.

The chemistry between the lead characters forms the core of the film. Their relationship, evolving from mere employer-employee to deep friendship, is portrayed with a sensitivity and realism that's both engaging and inspiring. The performances are remarkable, bringing authenticity and depth to their roles.

Balancing emotional depth with light-hearted moments, The Intouchables avoids becoming overly sentimental. Instead, it offers a compelling narrative that is as thought-provoking as it is entertaining. It's a celebration of resilience, friendship, and the transformative power of empathy.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

260,1.0,16 December 2020,"Having read plenty of hype about this film I was preparing myself to be disappointed but, luckily, the film felt engaging from the very beginning and went on to be a wonderfully touching and funny experience. There is also a fair amount of excitement and romance thrown in for good measure!

Despite appearances, Untouchable is not really about race, disability or class; it's about friendship. The two main characters both feel disconnected from society for various reasons, yet the connection between these two outsiders is so genuine and believable that you are drawn into their relationship. In fact, the performances from Omar Sy and François Cluzet are simply incredible. The massive amount of meaning conveyed in the slightest look between them is acting at its very best. On many occasions, you find yourself laughing with them and the fact that one is a rich white guy in a wheelchair and the other is a poor black guy fresh out of prison ceases to be an issue.

One of the most interesting themes for me was the effect that Driss's lack of pity had on Philippe. I understand that the film has been applauded by many disabled groups and I can see why. Pity is a very selfish and unpleasant emotion and I can imagine that the effect of such pity would be quite destructive on a person in Philippe's situation. Driss simply reacts to him in natural and honest way, which is extremely refreshing to see and a lesson for all those who would look down on anybody with pity.

The film is not without flaws however. It is a little 'lightweight' in places and there are a few clichés here and there (even though the film manages to avoid most of the more obvious stereotyping). The subtitles are also not brilliant in places and some of the meaning is slightly lost on occasion, but I guess that happens all the time. Overall, I would have said that this was a lovely 8/10 'feelgood movie' but the superb quality of acting easily bumps it up to a 9. Unmissable.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

I entered the top 250, and when I saw that the film, which was added to the ""must see"" list a long time ago, was already in 10th place, I immediately chose it. So, ""1+1"" or ""Untouchables"".

The plot of the film is a story from the life of one simple person. An accident chained him to a wheelchair, permanently depriving him of the ability to walk. Moreover, he deprived him of something that people had never appreciated in their lives. In this situation, you can not do without outside help. And if you can find a person who can help, that's good. But if you manage to find a person who can not just help, but illuminate your life, then here you can say ""lucky, so lucky"".

The difficult fates of two different people. The desire to live. Fight. Light, without which it is impossible in the first case. And the situation that makes you rethink is in the second.

I came to this unusually for me, through the trailer, coz it seemed to be such potentially feel- good 'based on a true story' inspiration: and perhaps it was: but for me the ultimate betrayal was to see in the final credit sequence the two it was truly based on, the one who the real hero was  (da, da, da credits plot spoiler alert) NOT BLACK!! He was white and of mid Europe descent: Apparently, the directors just preferred the black actor; nothing to argue with there (if he's good - and he is) but, beware, that particularly relevant factor then, is NOT BASED ON THE TRUTH. The original inspiration has been marginalised/ 'white'washed outta da movie public's knowledge/appreciation/enjoyment.

Then - as several have here also well noted - the (French?!) attitude portrayed towards women is positively neanderthal! Did they mean that? Or is that automatic to French storytelling? Even to excuse one women's (sensible) brush off of the black helper's unsophisticated bathroom overtures, in the end they make it all alright she declined him, by inferring the only reason she would turn him down is coz .. (da, da, daa) she's lesbian! NOT because she thought he was immature arrogant chauvinist 

As in spreading the fact that it was 'based on truth', then certainly as uplifting as the Omar Sy character is shown doing for his paraplegic saviour (he's saved from a downtrodden marginalised poor life by his 'service'): otherwise, 'based on' bordering a travesty of the truth.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

Francois Cluzet played a disabled man who has lost the meaning of life. He believed that since he was disabled, he no longer existed in the world. He hired nurses not only to look after him, but also to help him morally. After all, his days passed the same way. Parsing letters, writing letters to his beloved, whom he could not even call. Probably, before Driss appeared, he didn't even want to live.

Omar Sy played a wonderful man named Driss. It was Driss who taught Philippe to look at the world with different eyes. Through the eyes of an optimistic person who, even in a wheelchair, can hope for the best. He was real, without the mask of a cultured person, he was from a simple family in which, although there were cruel laws, they were correct and taught life. He looked at the world through the eyes of an optimistic person.

The director's work was excellent. Beautiful landscapes, everything was shown so well. Simply wonderful. In particular, the parachute flight and car ride at the beginning and end of the film were very memorable.

The music was pleasing to the ear. So calm, she approached every moment she played.

The film is wonderful, amazing, kind, sincere. It's worth watching for everyone. This is the truth of life. Motivational film and motivating characters. It's a shame that this film wasn't nominated for an Oscar.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

273,1.0,22 December 2023,"""Intouchables"" is a very unique movie. If I were to describe all the events that happen in the movie, you would think it was a TV mini-series full of episodic misadventures. But, with the way the movie edits its scenes, it moves along at a clip, never wasting a minute. Hearing that, you may think that the film is action packed. But no, it is a very mellow movie. The film is at its strongest when our two main characters are just hanging out. Whenever Philipe and Driss are sharing screentime together, it is a good time. It is whenever the movie jumps to a conflict it is less interesting.

I'm glad to see that so many people enjoyed this relatively small French film from 2011. I genuinely wish I would have liked it more, I just found the conflicts with the kid, the egg and the family to be draining. But the time our two leads are just hanging out, it is a real good time.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

The story is about Philippe (François Cluzet) a millionaire who lost control over most of his body parts, and he starts to look for potentialities to fill the gap and take after him for 24/7, the unexpected happens when a black guy opened the door of the office without waiting for his turn for the sake of getting a sign for some papers to get unemployed advantages, but Philippe offered him the position and they started to make the most genuine friendship based on sincerity and respect.

Even though Driss (Omar Sy) was a Senegalese unemployed guy with extensive social issues with his aunt and his days in prison, Philippe embraced him genuinely and extracted the pure gold of this wasted talent, Driss after all showed an impressive painting skill and great conduct.

280,7.0,12 March 2024,"""The Intouchables"" (also known as ""1+1"") is a heartwarming and poignant film that delves into the unlikely friendship between two individuals from vastly different backgrounds. Directed by Olivier Nakache and Éric Toledano, the movie tells the story of Philippe, a wealthy quadriplegic aristocrat, and Driss, a young man from the projects who becomes his caregiver.

At its core, ""The Intouchables"" is a tale of friendship, empathy, and the transformative power of human connection. The dynamic between Philippe and Driss is both humorous and touching, as they navigate their differences and learn to appreciate each other's unique perspectives on life. The film beautifully captures the evolution of their relationship, from initial skepticism to deep mutual respect and affection.

One of the film's greatest strengths lies in its portrayal of disability and caregiving with sensitivity and authenticity. Philippe's physical limitations are not sugarcoated or glossed over; instead, they are depicted with honesty and respect, highlighting the challenges he faces on a daily basis. Driss' role as his caregiver is portrayed with humor and compassion, showcasing the importance of empathy and understanding in providing care for individuals with disabilities.

The performances of François Cluzet as Philippe and Omar Sy as Driss are nothing short of exceptional. Cluzet brings depth and vulnerability to his portrayal of Philippe, capturing the character's emotional complexity with nuance and subtlety. Sy, on the other hand, infuses Driss with charisma, humor, and warmth, creating a character who is both endearing and relatable. The chemistry between the two actors is palpable, elevating their on-screen interactions to a level of authenticity that is truly captivating.

In addition to its powerful performances, ""The Intouchables"" also excels in its exploration of themes such as resilience, acceptance, and the value of human connection. Through Philippe and Driss' journey together, the film conveys a message of hope and optimism, showing that even in the face of adversity, friendship and compassion can triumph over hardship.

The film's direction and cinematography are equally impressive, with Nakache and Toledano expertly balancing moments of humor with moments of poignancy. The pacing is well-executed, allowing the audience to become fully immersed in the characters' lives and experiences. The use of music, particularly the soulful soundtrack by Ludovico Einaudi, enhances the emotional impact of key scenes, creating a rich and immersive viewing experience.

Overall, ""The Intouchables"" is a moving and uplifting film that resonates with audiences on a deep emotional level. Its universal themes of friendship, empathy, and resilience make it a timeless classic that continues to inspire viewers around the world. Through its heartfelt storytelling, stellar performances, and profound messages of hope and humanity, ""The Intouchables"" stands as a testament to the power of compassion and connection in overcoming life's greatest challenges.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

I can honestly say that I had a genuine smile on my face for most of the run-time, thanks mainly to Omar Sy's endearing and energetic performance. It also helps that the picture is legitimately funny and has a realistic edge that prevents it from slipping too far into sentimentality. Even though, at its core, the story is bare-bones and familiar, there's enough fun to be had that the fairly basic concept can be overlooked and the pure joy of two friends laughing together, despite their many differences, can really shine through. 7/10","November 2, 2011 (France)"

First of all...I do not understand French...but I won't watch dubbed films. So we watched it in French with English subtitles. The humour does come across, although I'm sure I missed a bit of it. Referring specifically to some possibly French or Parisian in-jokes.

The flow of the movie was good, the translated script funny - even witty at times. The acting was better than what you generally expect from your standard Hollywood movie.

What I did like about Driss's character is that he doesn't dance around the fact that his new boss is a paraplegic...at all. The bond that evolves between the Philippe & Driss is brought across genuinely...for the most part. I think a 90 minute movie will have a tough time to bring across the core of the relationship between these two characters, but they actors and the directors do a good job.

Overall it's a movie to watch and feel good about yourself, whilst at the same time you are reminded to appreciate the things you have; served with a healthy dose of humour, a dash or two of romance and a smidgen of those earnest, emotional realities of life. A feel-good movie, one can actually feel good about having watched.

286,5.0,26 January 2023,"I found this film, when compared to several other films of the handicapped which achieved great heights, to be rather mundane. My Left Foot, The Theory of Everything, and The Miracle Worker were far more entertaining and engrossing films about the handicapped than this film. Although the movie is worthwhile, and the performances are adequate, I did not get the sense of awe and inspiration that I got from the other films mentioned above. Ultimately, I found the film to average; not bad, but nothing out of the ordinary, either. See it if you think I may have erred. But make sure you see the other three films I have listed first, as they are all vastly superior to this one.","November 2, 2011 (France)"
287,1.0,10 April 2019,"I noticed some jaded critics on rotten tomatoes (generally very positive reviews but I wanted to read the critical ones to see WHAT they missed. it's what I do so I can see what makes one tick & their viewpoint) and wanted to address that first.

What I think they wanted is to see more sorrow, heartache & troubling nature of being disabled (one mentioned the D/bell & butterfly which yeah, I've seen..I do appreciate but did NOT enjoy that one bit. Still, listen up.... this is NOT going in that direction for a reason!) You do KNOW some films regarding similar subject matter have varying things to say as it's multifaceted just like our LIVES are. We can be miserable, full of pity & sorrow one day & full of life & joy another. Thankfully all due to the variety life has to offer. No matter what your condition, physically or mentally. So I'm clear, they in NO way try to gloss over the harsh reality of paralysis OR poverty. I got that, think everyone did. But what of Humanity, what of friendship & of the power of hope, kindness? Is this not universal to all?

Furthermore, to suggest there can be NO humor, emotion, attachment or soul to experiencing that ....then ALL we do is to shortchange human beings & life itself. These actors were simply fabulous & I was not only a willing participant to join on both of their journeys but most of all, good to be mindful that this wonderfully touching film is based on a REAL friendship so to address any suggestion of it being maudlin or sentimental (it's neither) makes me wonder what is wrong with YOU. We witness REAL struggle---even hopelessness. Again, who among us hasn't experienced this at least ONE moment in their life? In fact, for me watching one of our main protagonists wonderfully celebrate the joys of dance while the paralyzed man's face registers clear unfettered elation.... but can't engage in such himself! (yeah...I love to dance) actually caused me strife when I thought...""...just WOW what if I couldn't dance OR hear music!"" Then next ""what a BLESSING it is I CAN!"" Have I counted my own blessings recently enough? Have any of us?

So start counting your blessings & know that life CAN, in all likelihood, be FAR worse. If that's not a good message buried in a great real-life plot--of humanity, friendship, HUMOR, exhilaration of being ALIVE-- well then, apparently I've missed something. But no, really YOU do if this all escaped you. Deeper than it appears.

Yes, you should see this. Don't waste your time on the American remake (the upside..I'm American, I saw it. I love Cranston but can't begin to compare! Know that missed the mark. How happy I was to read these two amazing men are still friends today, so yeah, something we NEED for the times in which we live, affirmation of something that is good. And maybe all coming from place of serious heartache & damage. Yeah, there's nothing manipulative here, I basically can't stand that sort of film...do not cheapen this one bit to compare it to lesser (someone on RT mentioned ""bucket list"" & I almost puked. Same goes for this critic's writing). Then lastly, here is from an American that says IF you are going to object on basis of race, you must be one sad, lonely person looking for trouble that is NOT there. This is about 2 men, to me wouldn't matter if they were purple, race has NOTHING To do with it, we are all just people. So the ""real life gent"" wasn't African American? So what? WHO cares? it's a movie, NOT a documentary. I can't imagine anyone in the role of the caretaker than this actor, he imbues the part with his entire being. They both do. Overall, I see no flaw in this production whatsoever. I see why the French embraced it so fully & wonder why America felt remaking it rather than seeing is as I did tonight, the REAL deal, made any sense. I'm sure that part was financial, they wanted to cash in. Just brilliant. Can't see how this didn't make nomination for every award going (and win it) but assume critics are often a breed most of us fail to understand, much less a snobby academy-award committee who often prefer odd esoteric material that in truth, they likely fail to understand themselves (or it's just plain political). BRAVO to all involved, from script, direction, acting & final piece of work! I know I will give this a second viewing, maybe more as needed. I believe it's an honest & straightforward powerful elixir, in addition to all else it quite successfully aims to do.","November 2, 2011 (France)"
288,1.0,14 September 2020,"At the job interview for the caregiver of Philippe, he is annoyed by the applicants whose answers are all stereotypical. I understand why he chose Driss among them. For the disability he suffers, the hardest challenge, more than pain or inconvenience, would be boredom.

Even though Philippe is a rich and important man, Driss doesn't care at all. Philippe seems to feel comfortable because Driss shows no pity that would embarrass him. In Philippe's slight smile, we see how he is amused by Driss's behavior. Driss is a brisk and responsive man. Philippe has fun with Driss's blunt remarks on things, like painting, opera, and classical music. They enjoy their witty exchange.

Being completely opposite at first glance, they in fact share some kind of recklessness. They feel they have nothing to lose because Philippe has lost her wife, and Driss is in low life. But their friendship gradually encourages each other to overcome that.

The tempo is well controlled. Emotional scenes are slow and comical scenes are quick. It is like a piece of pleasant music. The indoor and outdoor scenes make a good contrast. Philippe sometimes feels suffocated in his palace and wants Driss to take him outside for fresh air. The shot where the two men run on the wheelchair is very exhilarating.

You might expect the film to deal with social issues, like disability or race, but it does not really. The film is about friendship and how it helps you overcome difficulties in your life. And it is truly heartwarming.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

292,9.0,29 May 2020,"The Intouchables (2011) : Brief Review -

This French cinema sensation is too easy to predict but the true story factor still makes it work. The Intouchables is based on a true story of an quadriplegic rich man who finds a true friend in one of his hired reckless caretaker. The film is a big story but definitely it is time consuming as the narrative is strictly modified within 112 minutes. There is fun, there is love, there is life, there are problems and then there is a friendship bond and humanity values. I won't deny the fact that the story isn't overwhelming at all, of course it is predictable and too simple. But sometimes simple things works. The problem i have with the film is the hype creted by audience about it. When i am watching a film with IMDb Rating of 8.5/10 and also the Rank 44 film in IMDb Top Rated Films WW i expect something sensational or outstanding and this predictable tale is surely underwhelming by far. Critics didn't admire this film as much as audience and i would like to go with critics for this film (I always don't agree with Critics) at least. The Intouchables lacks the attractive elements but it is Highly entertaining flick by all means. It has laughters on consistent basis. Some of them are vulgar, some are organic and some are outdated but that all keeps it engaging. Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy put up fine performances and lovable chemistry. The background score works pleasantly while Cinematography is okay. Olivier Nakace and Eric Toodano has made a very good film but looking at all the acclaim it recieved globally it is certainly below my expectations. Maybe attending the biographical story didn't let them use cinematic Liberty upto the course but i have seen so many Biographicals being one of the greatest films of all time, haven't you? There is definitely something less in the film but if you can neglect that then there's lot to enjoy in The Untouchables for sure.

Its extremely unrealistic, and i guess i dont like these types of movies, Especially not when its suppost to be one of those ""deep deep"" movies about life, friendship, poverty etc. Not sure if its because im not french, but i didnt like the humor in the movie either. Its not a very exciting movie either. I would have liked some more depth, a deeper story, and to see more of Driss challenges. We never Saw which problems he had with his new job, comming with no experience etc. It was just so painfully unrealistic which is annoying, when its suppost to be a deep meaningful movie.

It is a tale of friendship, love, and care that is too often lacking in an industry increasingly obsessed with grimdark lifeless cinema. My partner is disabled and this film has helped me see that nobody should be treated like an invalid but as the whole person they are.

303,1.0,25 May 2020,"I had to watch Intouchables because I am on a mission to see all of the imdb top 250. Turns out that this list tells much more about the viewers than the films.

Intouchables is a case in point. First off, despite being a rom-com (more specifically, a bromance buddy flick), it ranks, nearly a decade after its launch, #44. Must be a masterpiece, something so unique and original that it has never been done in romcom before, right? Wrong.

I regret to report that all of the comedy of this brom-com revolves around the defeat or support of deeply entrenched stereotypes of black people. If you invite them to the opera or a classical music concert, they will disrupt it. The quality of women of most importance to Africans in Paris is white booty. They eat Nutella with spoons out of a jar. They have never seen a full-sized bathtub. They live in HLM (Habitations à Loyer Modéré, aka housing projects) with literally neighborhoods of siblings, all being cared for by a stressed-out single mother, as all of the fathers have disappeared. Black males resolve problems through resort to violence. But they love to dance (to Earth, Wind & Fire!) and are always up for a good ho-op. Please just put them behind the wheel of a Maserati Quattroporte, pass the doobie, and let the fun begin!

But, hey, it's all good: because one of these guys proves to the rich white world that a person corresponding to the above stereotype can also be a Mensch!

My guess is that most of the 10 ratings of this flick were given by people who have as friends no persons of color. These inflated ratings reflect the viewers' own pleasant surprise at how nice (and clean!) black people can be.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

Even though the plot develops like a typical Hollywood-y romantic comedy (two people meet, they have a good time, then they break up and finally they are together again), in this case it's about a different kind of relationship, the friendship between two men, a quadriplegic, Philippe (Francois Cluzet) and his caretaker, Driss (Omar Sy). Driss' role goes way beyond helping Philippe overcome his physical limitations, he shows him how to have fun and enjoy himself. The movie's biggest asset is the performances and the great chemistry between the two leads. The comedic aspect is stronger than the dramatic, as the latter can get too simplistic, plus it can lose touch with reality due to its excessive optimism, not to mention it doesn't avoid various cliches.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

I hope for you both a long, happily, true life forever.","November 2, 2011 (France)"
318,7.0,22 June 2017,"I have seen this movie tonight at a preview session as the official french national release is set on 2011, November 2nd. Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakashe, accompanied by the lead actor Omar Sy were meeting the audience and cheerfully answering questions.

The movie is very well written. Although opening on a flash-forward, it is fairly classic comedy about the meeting of two opposite people who were very unlikely to meet. The first one is a paraplegic white middle aged very rich and lonely man, the other one is a young black, poor, unemployed, coming from poor suburbs and a very large family.

What makes the quality of the film, beside the humour present in every scene in which Omar Sy appears (actually most of the film), is the emotion you can feel, through increasingly attaching characters.

The story is based upon a true story, and real characters.

If you want to watch and enjoyable comedy, with very touching moments, this is a must go.

There are interesting insights about arts as well (paintings, classical music, and funk music). What is art? What is its use?","November 2, 2011 (France)"

I have watched this movie, so many times I even can't keep counting. This is an excellent example of how a strong bond between two people can be and how one's illness can't affect their friendship. Philippe being a high-class persona, becomes friends with Dris who is far away from high class and is just Philippe's care taker.

Could be a rather banal story if it wasn't for this Omar Sy, who has a vitality which lightens both the screen and high brow Paris. It's often funny, seldom touching and quite French.

339,9.0,19 January 2022,"When people for some reason are limited in their abilities and cannot live their own lives, they either begin to take an excessively active part in someone else's life, or try to realize themselves through another person. So, for example, single mothers act, having one beloved child, which becomes the meaning of their whole life. Or housewives merging into their husbands. Or that's why grandmothers at the entrance love to gossip so much. Or remember the hero of the movie ""The Benefactor"" played by Richard Gere. However, it is possible to realize oneself through another person both in a bad and in a good way.

The paralyzed aristocrat Philip, whose life is not to be envied at all, is sent by the Lord God himself, the gouging Driss. It is only in the opinion of others that Driss is the least suitable for the role of a nurse - a criminal past, uneducated, from the lower strata of society, and generally colored. Maybe Driss is not entirely attentive to details, but he has an excellent sense of humor and quickly ""cuts"" what exactly Philip needs - namely, fresh air, literally and figuratively. He is trying to restore Philippe's taste for life, to diversify it with the help of such simple but important little things - puffs with a joint, a quick drive through the evening streets of Paris, erotic massage. And Philip needs such adventures much more than the close attention of other - ""correct"", but boring to the point of toothache - nurses who also feel sorry for him. Pity and treating him like a porcelain figurine do not give Philip pleasure, but rather only irritate him. But he is delighted with the carelessness of Driss, who without a second thought puts a cigarette into Philip's mouth and rolls it at an exorbitant speed. Philip gets pleasure when Driss treats him like an equal (what a Senegalese thug can do, a wheelchair user can do). This new life experience gives Philip the opportunity, at least for a while, to escape from his sad thoughts - he does not spend all his evenings in the living room, dictating high-flown letters to his secretary. Driss succeeds in changing Philip's life for the better, helping him get rid of the fears and insecurities that prevent him from establishing a personal life. Charming Driss wins the sympathy of not only Philip himself, but also other inhabitants of his house. It is quite obvious that he does his job not just for money, but also gets real pleasure from it. Quite naturally, the relationship between Philip and Driss goes beyond the ""customer-servicing staff"" and turns into a friendly one.

On the example of Driss, we are once again convinced that it is not always worth evaluating a person by his appearance and making hasty conclusions. Here we see Driss in a sweatshirt and baggy jeans, and we are immediately tempted to label him as a dim-witted bum. But as soon as he changes into a suit and shoes, he immediately transforms. And when he incendiary dances to rhythmic music, setting the tone at first for Philip's boring and official birthday party, you can't take your eyes off him at all. This is the talent of Driss - defiantly, but organically deviate from the protocol, giving Philip the opportunity to truly feel alive. What can I say - Driss is just a unique character. For all his outward rudeness, he has amazing plasticity and acting skills. Even such a boring and unloved activity by many men as shaving, he manages to turn into something exciting. That's why Philip is so attached to Driss - because he ""breaks"" the standards that Philip is already fed up with.

Through Driss, the filmmakers are perfectly able to broadcast the installation to the viewer - you should not feel sorry for Philip. He is limited in his physical capacity, but not at all limited in his inner qualities. On the contrary, such a person is worthy of admiration - he does not slide into depression, misanthropy, but, on the contrary, is very strong in spirit, has optimism and retains human dignity. Of course, we must pay tribute to the fact that Philip has access to a lot that is not available to other people in his position, constrained in their means, because Philip is very rich. But, as the French say, ""se la vie."" We deal with what is. The stronger the contrast of the main characters - the rich and the poor, the aristocrat and the uncouth resident of a high-rise building from an emigrant district, white and black. And this contrast ""holds"" the viewer throughout the film, as well as a very strict adherence to the framework of the tragicomedy genre. The result is a very balanced mix with neither one nor the other outweighing the scales.

The Untouchables made me associate with another film made 5 years after the release of The Untouchables, namely Me Before You. There we also deal with a paralyzed aristocrat who is hired a nurse, only in ""Me Before You"" the role of nurse is not an African-French, but a young, flowering girl who also manages to do for the protagonist what was not possible before. Others.

""The Untouchables"" is the perfect movie for a pleasant evening viewing when you want something like that. It is like the quintessence of everything French - simple but elegant. The film is moderately light, moderately touches on social topics without tedious moralizing and teaching, moderately provides food for thought, and, most importantly, is based on real events. ""Trust me,"" says Driss. And there is no better slogan for the film.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

Occasionally, the film does well with that winning premise: the snobs against the slobs. Some moments are pleasant and mildly moving though not as hilarious as they could be. Still, it was difficult to be taken into this film mainly because of the characterization of Driss. Frequently, he's rude, overbearing, arrogant, and bullying. The film goes too far when Driss is disciplining others who seem spoiled when he himself seems to need the most discipline. Nonetheless, actor Omar Sy does a fine job in the role.

The viewer hardly knows about Philippe's character and why he would take so well to Driss although scenes of upper-class stuffiness around Philippe might give some hints. Knowing more about Philippe might have helped.

The film makes you think about life, values, family, friends. I think initially that Driss, that Phillip decided to communicate with each other only for profit. One needed money, the other needed a person next to him who wouldn't feel sorry for him. And Driss does it perfectly, treats Phillip like an ordinary person, without any problems. But he also takes care of him and does all the work to take care of him. And Phillip at the same time pays him and helps to sell Dris' paintings so that he also gets an income...

When Driss tells Phillip about his life, it becomes very sad to think that people still live in other countries.. They give their children... But I think it only hardened him.

It was just as sad to see what Phillip's life was like after Dris's departure. There came people he was avoiding, those who treated him like a sick man.

Also in parallel throughout the film they show other characters and their situations, it is also interesting to watch and distract a little from the main story.

And of course, I can't help but say about my favorite scene from the movie, I think it's not just my favorite.. This is, of course, the one where Driss dances at Phillip's birthday party...

To sum up: a film about true friendship, about a person's deep feelings for a person.

It's also nice to know that this is a film based on real events. I always love that at the end of such films they show photos of real people. It's interesting to compare how the heroes seem to have been picked up.

360,1.0,1 September 2024,"""Intouchables"" is more than just a film; it's a profound exploration of human connection that transcends social barriers. Directed by Olivier Nakache and Éric Toledano, this 2011 French masterpiece tells the true story of an unexpected bond between two men from vastly different worlds-Philippe, a wealthy quadriplegic (played by François Cluzet), and Driss, a young man from the Parisian suburbs (played by Omar Sy).

The film brilliantly balances humor and emotion, with Omar Sy's charismatic performance bringing a vibrant energy to the screen. His character, Driss, is unfiltered, raw, and refreshingly honest, providing a stark contrast to Philippe's refined but isolated existence. Their relationship evolves from one of mere necessity to a deep, mutual respect and genuine friendship, challenging societal norms and preconceptions along the way.

What makes ""Intouchables"" truly remarkable is its ability to tackle complex themes like disability, race, and class with both sensitivity and humor. The chemistry between Cluzet and Sy is undeniable, making their journey together not just believable but deeply moving. The film's uplifting message, coupled with a soulful soundtrack, leaves a lasting impact, reminding us that genuine connections can be found in the most unlikely places. ""Intouchables"" is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit, delivering a powerful and inspiring story that resonates long after the credits roll.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

363,1.0,19 May 2021,"The Intouchables / The Upside (remake of ""Intouchables"")

The Upside is a movie directed by Neil Burger. The writer is Jon Hartmereis but his screenplay is based on The Intouchables, inspired by a true story. The two original writers of ""Intouchables"" are French writer/director duo Olivier Nakache & Éric Toledano. The American version is staring Kevin Hart (a well-known stand-up comedian turned actor) as Dell Scott (the caregiver of Phillip Lacasse), Bryan Cranston (from Breaking Bad fame) as Phillip Lacasse (a paralysed person on a wheelchair), Nicole Kidman as Yvonne Pendleton, (Phillip's devoted personal assistance), Golshifteh Farahani as Maggie (Phillip's attractive physical trainer).

Dell and Phillipe have a good relationship between music, women, etcetera. In their relationship a lot of ups and downs happen. Phillipe has a surprise party organized by Yvonne, but Phillipe wanted to have nothing for his birthday. Phillipe ask dell to break things for him because he was mad and uncapable from his quadriplegic condition. I found this scene emotional and heartbreaking. This scene was one of the best improvements to the original French version.

Olivier Nakache and Éric Toledano are a duo writer. Their 3 other popular film are C'est la vie! (2017), The Specials (2019) and Tellement proches (2009) which they all made together! Intouchables is the most well like by the public. The English version is funnier at times, while the French version is more emotional between the two main characters.

The Upside is a comedy. A lot of moment in The Upside has humor. The Intouchables and The Upside has still a lot of differences. In The Intouchables Driss (Dell in The Upside) likes Magalie (Yvone in The Upside) and flirts with here a lot. In The Upside Dell (Driss in The Intouchables) is making a lot of joke but Phillipe is more serious. But in The Intouchables the both are laughing and telling jokes more equally which makes for the stronger bond. It is a touching story, and fun that is based on a real life unlikely friendship like the Green Book.

I will rate both 9/10. I recommend them.

The performances by François Cluzet and Omar Sy are outstanding. They have great chemistry together, and they make the characters feel real and relatable.

The film is based on a true story, which makes it even more heartwarming and inspiring.","November 2, 2011 (France)"
375,9.0,6 October 2024,"You'll definitely enjoy this film like you'll in every average good French film, the storytelling is very warm very joyful, but the problem you'd face with the film is it very plain, yeah, you may even find it vulgar in some scenes in a bad way, I have no problem with mimicking arts, social norms and make fun of them for sure, but when you take an overlook over the plot a poor guy from the ghettos or the suburban make a great friendship with very rich paralyzed businessman, you like it isn't it? This point is touching nearly half of the people in the planet that those think that the more rich you get the more no life you get at all, it's a common sense and that's what all the film display to you nothing more nothing less, just displaying to how funny they both mocking the lifestyle of monsieur Philippe and exploiting the heresies of these communities, it's you'll enjoy all of these scenes, but after this, all you'll see goes on it's straight lined story in a cliched style.

It gets sidetracked in a few parts and I don't think it's one of the BEST movies out there, but it certainly showed off its beauty quite convincingly in a few parts.

379,1.0,19 December 2023,"For starters, this movie is a true story. The film is about two men who come from different social classes. One being Driss who is from the suburbs around the city, and Philippe who lives in the center of Paris. The narrative of this film begins with the last scene of the film at the beginning of the film. The movie essentially unfolds as a recollection leading up to this particular moment. Throughout the story, we learn that Driss serves as a caretaker for Philippe. As the plot progresses, their bond gradually transforms from a professional association into a deep friendship. From the first time watching this movie in 7th grade it has remained in my list of my all time favorite movies. Its significance is not solely due to French being my primary language, but rather stems from the profound morals and lessons that I have taken away from this movie. Throughout this movie life's challenges, compassion, and the inherent beauty that surrounds us, that we take for granted.

I truly recommend this movie to everyone, but especially, to people who are learning the French language. I have gone to a French school for the majority of my life, so the way I was taught French is very different from those who have been taught in an American school teaching system. Something this movie has to offer for the people learning the language is the non textbook French. This movie accurately represents the French language of this generation. In other words it will greatly help with improving french speaking. Now for everyone else who is just watching to watch. This movie accurately represents French people and not by the negative stereotypes everyone constantly associates the French with (rude, mean etc..). The dark humor and the expressions in the dialogue is exquisite and hilarious. Watching this movie while being so far away from my french environment, makes me feel comfortable and at home.

Although based on a true story, the actors portraying Philippe and Driss showcased remarkable talent in encapsulating the emotions and real-life experiences inherent in the making of a profoundly wholesome and authentic bond between two individuals. I find it fascinating how society categorizes both of them, and has deemed them as lower class. In the sense that Driss is just a lowlife, criminal that is untrustworthy, and Phillipe being deemed as incapacitated. Despite these biased perceptions of their background, they are people who are incapable of doing anything for themselves. Both of them together prove society wrong.

Their unique friendship showcases to the public how two people from diverse backgrounds enriches a friendship, gives us experience and learns different things about each other, whether it was through them sharing their different music taste, or trying different activities for each other, and going out of their comfort zones. Through the respect they have fortified for each other. Driss treated Philippe like any other human, and not treating him differently because of his condition. While Philippe refrains from associating Driss with his past mistakes, acknowledging that everyone has the potential to grow and change, from the person they used to be in the past. Lastly, being there for each other emotionally, whether it was Philippe understanding and encouraging Driss to go back home and take care of his family that needed him. Or Driss being there for Philippe when he had his panic attacks, and soothing him.

In essence, their relationship stands as a testament to the transformative power of friendship, breaking societal barriers and teaching us invaluable lessons about acceptance, empathy, and the capacity for personal growth. It also becomes a profound platform for mutual growth and learning. You most definitely will not regret spending one hour and fifty two minutes of your life watching this movie.","November 2, 2011 (France)"
380,1.0,2 August 2024,"The film ""An Unexpected Friendship"" gilds the heart in addition to touching it. Few movies are able to mix humor and drama as well as French directors Olivier Nakache and Éric Toledano's gripping tale.

It is based on the friendship that actually existed between two guys from quite different backgrounds. It takes us on a journey through disappointments and victories, demonstrating the incredible ways in which an unexpected relationship can transform lives.

The performances by actors Omar Sy and François Cluzet are funny and heartfelt. A true and endearing relationship is created by Cluzet, who plays the wealthy and disabled man Philippe, and Sy, who plays Driss, the vivacious and unexpected caregiver. One of the movie's best aspects is their on-screen connection, which also adds a lot to the emotional impact.

391,9.0,4 July 2023,"""The Intouchables,"" also known as ""1+1,"" is an emotionally captivating film that effortlessly blends comedy, drama, and the strength of human connection. Directed by Olivier Nakache and Éric Toledano, this French masterpiece takes audiences on a profound journey that touches the heart, challenges societal norms, and celebrates the beauty of diversity.

Based on a true story, the film introduces us to Philippe (François Cluzet), a wealthy quadriplegic who hires Driss (Omar Sy), a charismatic ex-convict, as his caretaker. Initially, their relationship appears to be an unconventional pairing, given their starkly different backgrounds and circumstances. However, as the story unfolds, we witness the transformative power of their friendship.

One of the film's greatest strengths lies in its ability to tackle serious themes with a delicate balance of humor and sensitivity. The script masterfully navigates the challenges faced by Philippe, his physical limitations, and his emotional struggles, while shedding light on the less privileged world that Driss comes from. The juxtaposition of their lives creates a thought-provoking narrative that challenges preconceived notions of class, race, and disability.

The performances in ""The Intouchables"" are nothing short of exceptional. François Cluzet delivers a nuanced portrayal of Philippe, capturing the vulnerability and resilience of a man confined to a wheelchair. Omar Sy's performance as Driss is both hilarious and heartfelt, as he brings an infectious energy and unfiltered honesty to the role. The chemistry between Cluzet and Sy is palpable, and their on-screen dynamic forms the beating heart of the film.

Beyond its powerful performances, ""The Intouchables"" is visually stunning, with elegant cinematography that captures the beauty of Paris and the contrasting worlds inhabited by the two protagonists. The film's soundtrack, featuring a combination of classical pieces and contemporary tracks, adds another layer of depth to the storytelling, enhancing the emotional impact of each scene.

With its poignant storytelling, remarkable performances, and a powerful message, it transcends cultural boundaries and resonates with audiences worldwide.

392,9.0,16 August 2024,"This was my second time viewing the film and it was at least as joyful and as fulfilling as the first time.

I must admit I've been an admirer and a fan of Omar Sy for quite some time, he brings so much charm and so much presence to his performances, and he absolutely owned this film. He was spectacular, however Francois Cluzet was also brilliant, and the film was very well crafted, beautifully directed, and just a lovely, joyful, funny, uplifting take on humanity.

Because Omar Sy as Driss sucks all of the oxygen on screen, it may be too easy to overlook the masterful performance by François Cluzet as Philippe. He's the balancing understatement to Sy's showboating, though the latter won a Best Actor César, France's Oscar, for this role, beating out Jean Dujardin of The Artist. Talk about splitting hairs. Both are charming, effortless, and have an old-school showbiz sensibility. However, Dujardin's performance is more vulnerable. Both characters would make fun blind dates, but you can be assured that Driss wouldn't lose your number.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

396,1.0,6 January 2024,"""Untouchable,"" originally titled ""Intouchables"" in French, directed by Olivier Nakache and Éric Toledano, is a heartwarming and humorous film based on a true story. Released in 2011, it stars François Cluzet as Philippe, a wealthy Parisian quadriplegic, and Omar Sy as Driss, his caregiver from the projects. This unlikely pair forms the central relationship that drives the narrative and gives the film its emotional depth.

The film's greatest triumph lies in its ability to balance humor and sensitivity in handling its subject matter. It avoids the pitfall of becoming overly sentimental or patronizing. Instead, it presents a realistic, yet uplifting portrayal of the challenges faced by people with disabilities, without defining them solely by these challenges.

Omar Sy's performance is a standout. He brings an infectious energy and charisma to the role of Driss, providing much of the film's comedic relief while also displaying a surprising depth of emotion. His chemistry with François Cluzet is remarkable, and their interactions are both believable and heartening. Cluzet, on the other hand, delivers a performance that is both powerful and nuanced, portraying Philippe as a man of dignity, intelligence, and wit.

Cinematically, ""Untouchable"" is beautifully shot, capturing the essence of Parisian life from the opulent world of Philippe to the vibrant streets of Driss's neighborhood. The soundtrack, featuring a mix of classical and contemporary music, complements the film's tone perfectly, enhancing both its emotional and comedic moments.

One criticism, however, might be that the film occasionally relies on stereotypes, particularly in its depiction of Driss's background. While these moments do not significantly detract from the overall quality of the film, they are a reminder of the delicate balance required when portraying cross-cultural relationships.

In conclusion, ""Untouchable"" is a genuinely touching film that manages to tackle serious themes with humor and grace. It's a story about friendship, resilience, and the capacity of human connection to transcend societal boundaries.

Despite their vastly different backgrounds, they form a deep bond that transforms both of their lives.

Omar Sy's performance as Driss is magnetic and full of life, injecting energy and humor into every scene. His portrayal earned him a César Award (the French equivalent of an Oscar) for Best Actor. Sy's charm and comic timing contrast beautifully with Cluzet's more reserved, nuanced performance as Philippe, who learns to embrace life again through Driss' influence.

It treats disability and social differences with sensitivity while emphasizing the importance of human connection and understanding. The film is not about pity but about two men learning from each other, with both characters experiencing personal growth through their relationship.

Since then, I have watched this movie a few times and it has become one of my favorite films ever. Intouchables is a heartfelt story about friendship. The film is loosely based on the true story of Abdel Sallou's friendship with a paralysed millionaire Phillipe. In the film, Phillipe hires a young man from the projects named Driss to take care of him and they both develop an unlikely friendship.

The story is very interesting and shows that two people from different races can confront their obstacles in life. The main leads, Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy, are fantastic and share great chemistry together.

It also has great moments of humour that brought a smile to my face. I love how the relationship between Driss and Phillipe develops from two people arguing against each other to becoming true friends.

Some movies can work with a good story but they need good performances; in Untouchables, it's almost impossible to determine who carried the film, both Cluzet and Sy were great.

I always think that the worst feeling to have for someone is pity what ever the situation is. The scene most magical scene is at the party of Philippe's birthday - that music by the orchestra was not to dance-to everyone thought that if the music is danceble is going to make Philippe uncomfortable but when Driss decides to dance everyone just started to dance with him and Philippe really was happy despite that he couldn't.

Give me low budget mind-bending sci Fi, and I'll be satisfied with anything you could throw at me. While I enjoy typical dramas on occasion, you'd rarely see me mark one more than a 6 or 7. Even something like 'The Father' had to have a certain twisty element like it did to work for me.

To be brutally honest 'Intouchable' is far from an original movie. The 'odd-couple who end up bringing out the best in each other' trope has been done a million times.

In the scene where Driss takes Philip for a ride, dynamic shots capture the relaxed atmosphere in the car, showing the transformation of their relationship. As a comedy drama, the film alleviates the heaviness of life through humor and warmth, showing friendship across social classes, and has a strong emotional resonance.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

420,8.0,26 December 2023,"No explosions, no special effects, no superheroes.... OOppps superheroes... there are two of them.,..... wonderful story told by two fantastic actors..... And script played so well that you cry and laugh at the same time....

Story is simple - [simple?] - a very rich aristocrat get paralyzed and he is limited to wheelchair with no control over his body except head. He gets a care taker who not only proves to be black but also seems to have no respect to the man. And since he does not struggle to please him he treats him a as a normal guy!

That is a story of a friendship and bond created between two unique men. They fit. They complete each other. Their energy is filled with will of life.

Lots of wonderful sense of humor. Watch for the moments when Omar Sy plays barber and makes fun from his ""helpless victim"" who gets most of the fun of it actually ....

422,1.0,9 March 2023,"The first time I watched Intouchables was back in high school. We had to watch the film in English in order to improve our listening skills. Since then, I have watched this movie a few times and it has become one of my favorite films ever. Intouchables is a heartfelt story about friendship. The film is about the relationship and prejudice between two races. The film is loosely based on the true story of Abdel Sallou's friendship with a paralyzed millionaire, Phillipe Pozzo di Borgo. In the film, Phillipe hires a young man from the projects named Driss to take care of him and they both develop an unlikely friendship.

The story is very interesting and shows that two people from different races can confront their obstacles in life. The main leads, Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy, are fantastic and share great chemistry together. It also has great moments of humor that brought a smile to my face.

I love how the relationship between Driss and Phillipe develops from two people arguing against each other to becoming true friends. Some movies can work with a good story but they need good performances; in Untouchables, it's almost impossible to determine who carried the film, both Cluzet and Sy were great. The soundtrack of the film is also brilliant and adds to the emotional scenes in the film.

Great movie, it's a must-watch 🙂","November 2, 2011 (France)"

The superb performances by François Cluzet and Omar Sy give life and authenticity to the characters. Their dialogues and emotional fluctuations will not leave any viewer indifferent. ""1+1"" is not just a film about friendship and acceptance; it is a true story about self-discovery and finding one's place in the world. It teaches us that we should not judge a person by their appearance or past, as each of us has our own unique story and merits. Despite the heavy moments and profound themes, the film is enveloped in an incredible light of optimism and hope. It shows that even in the darkest times, one can find a glimmer of light and together overcome all trials.

429,1.0,20 October 2012,"Hilarious and moving, Intouchables is simply one of the best films of 2012. Based on a true story the unlikely pairing of an immensely wealthy quadriplegic with an African immigrant carer produces line after line and scene after scene that are genuinely funny (and I mean really funny not just a gentle smirk) and also wonderfully acted.

It's a hard film to fault - it isn't over-sentimental or maudlin, but it makes us care - the drama could have been deeper and more dramatic but I, for one, like that it is a genuine odd couple, buddy comedy - it is simply a pleasure to watch - I have seen it twice and enjoyed it more the second time around.

It is also, significantly, one of the most affirming film about disability to date - this is not a film looking for your sympathy or tears - but neither does it gloss over or veer away from disability - but it shouts that disability is not inability or shaming - it is certainly a very strong contender for Best Foreign Film and expect to see an American version (Dustin Hoffman would be great - they are almost twins) soon....","November 2, 2011 (France)"

I do feel compelled however to comment on the film simply because I have not enjoyed a movie as much as this in a long time, especially a foreign language film which is very much a minority in my viewing history. It's a wonderful heartwarming story of two people from polar opposite walks of life who form the strongest of bonds living in each other's pockets and it is also at times hilarious and I have not laughed so much for as long as I can remember.

I think, that the black man (Omar Sy) was a very good actor in this role, and the white man (Francois Cluzet)was a good actor in this role as well.

And I think that racism will be no more virulent only when people are no more interested in the question if a black, yellow, white or mixed person plays a certain role, but only in the question if he/ she plays the role good or not.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

437,9.0,21 July 2012,"If you are looking for an alternative to blockbuster superhero movies or Hollywood cookie-cutter romantic comedies, you can do no better than Oliver Nakache and Eric Toledano's film, The Intouchables. Though it has aspects that are familiar and even formulaic, the film redeems itself with its honest emotion and humane message of how vastly different people can learn from each other. Hugely popular in France where it earned $280 million (the second highest grossing film in their history) and was nominated for nine Cesar Awards, The Intouchables can make you forget, however briefly, the day's headlines, and feel good once more about people and the world they inhabit.

Omar Sy, César Best Actor Award winner, is Driss, a poor Senegalese man from the ghettos who is hired to take care of multimillionaire Philippe (Francois Cluzet), a quadriplegic from a paragliding accident. Based on a true story adapted from the memoir ""You Changed My Life"" by Abdel Sellou, Driss is an ex-con who served six months in prison for his part in a robbery and applied for the job in order to be eligible to receive government benefits after he was turned down. Surprisingly, Philippe hires Driss to be his caretaker, telling him that he likes people who ""tell it like it is"" without overt displays of pity or compassion.

The film begins with Driss driving Phillipe's Maserati at dangerous speeds with Philippe next to him on the passenger seat. Stopped by the police, Driss tells the officers that his paralyzed friend must be taken to the hospital immediately as Philippe pretends to have a stroke. Exhilarated by their experience, the two men drive to the seashore to watch the waves in contemplative silence. The events leading up to the incident are then told in flashback. As Philippe's recently hired caretaker, Driss moves into the aristocrat's opulent Paris apartment and learns the job quickly. Before long, he is carrying Philippe from his bed to a chair, carefully dressing him, and even flirting with his assistant Magalie (Audrey Fleurot), but he does draw the line on some activities.

As a result of Driss' high energy, Philippe begins to renew his enthusiasm for life and the two are drawn together by their love of music of diverse types, fast cars, and off-color humor. There are a few sub-plots including Philippe's snarky teenage daughter (Alba Gaïa Kraghede Bellugi) and her problems with her mop-haired boyfriend, and that of Driss' younger brother Adama (Cyril Mendy) and his fears of being the victim in a drug deal but they do not distract from what is essentially a two-character story. There is a lot of warmth and humor in the growing relationship. Driss introduces the staid Philippe to the music of Earth, Wind, and Fire to which Driss dances flamboyantly at Philippe's birthday party, the young caretaker becomes Philippe's barber, showing him some different and not too flattering mustaches, and they enjoy a hang gliding adventure in the French countryside.

While some aspects of culture are ridiculed, the film shows respect for the arts in a way most Hollywood films never would. We actually listen to classical music, view paintings in a museum, and hear Philippe's impassioned poetic letters to Eleonore, who lives in Dunkirk, a woman he's never met. Driss also takes up painting and sells his first work for 11,000 Euros. Also, unlike mainstream American films that seem to exist in a vacuum, there are even references to real life contemporary figures such as Obama, Bush, and Nixon.

While the opportunity is certainly present for mawkish sentimentality, Nakache and Toledano steer clear of that pitfall and opt instead for a genuineness and sincerity that allows us to truly care about each character. Though The Intouchables does have aspects of racial stereotyping, it can be enjoyed simply as a charming, warm-hearted, and funny depiction of friendship between two very different people who are willing to learn from each other about how to celebrate life. While happiness in their lives may still be elusive, in the words of existential psychiatrist Rollo May, ""Joy, rather than happiness, is the goal of life, for joy isbased on the experience of one's identity as a being of worth and dignity.""","November 2, 2011 (France)"

439,1.0,28 November 2018,"I don't often get the chance to take in foreign cinema, but in the case of The Intouchables, I'm reminded of why I enjoy every opportunity to watch something fairly magical unfold on the screen. Sure, it sounds cheesy, but I have to say, the more foreign films I see, the more I find that I truly enjoy.

The Intouchables, written and directed by Olivier Nakache and Éric Toledano, is a total wild card, and it works in ways that are completely indescribable. The sense of purity and genuinity is evident throughout the film, and is wholeheartedly embraced by the audience. The Intouchables is based on the true-life events of Philippe (François Cluzet), a wealthy quadriplegic, and Driss (Omar Sy), a young man with a troubled background, who Philippe hires as his caretaker. The film follows the interesting relationship that develops between these two men - one of mutual respect and true friendship.

While the foreign reception of this movie has been overwhelmingly successful, the stateside opinions of this movie have been fairly varied, most of which find this movie to be racist, demeaning, or otherwise offensive. I feel as though these opinions are somewhat ridiculous, as the movie itself doesn't ever make race an issue; unless you are trying to read into the fact that the white man is rich and the black man is poor, these men are more peers that initially meets the eye. The unexpected companionship of these two men results in fantastic comedic opportunities, and not only are they hilarious, but they are touching and emotionally raw.

The true magic in this film shines through by way of the incredible acting talent, and their obvious fervor for their craft. It is no surprise that both actors were awarded the honor of Best Actor at the 2011 Tokyo International Film Festival; additionally, Omar Sy's performance as Driss helped him to edge out Jean Dujardin (The Artist) for the César Award for Best Actor. It is rare to find two individuals that have the connection that Sy and Cluzet share on screen, and their interaction is wholly refreshing.



This and the remaining components of the movie all seamlessly work together to provide a satisfying backdrop for the heartwarming story. At one point, Philippe's lawyer displays concern over the choice of Driss as Philippe's caretaker, due to his questionable background. Philippe indicated that such was of no concern, and he was merely grateful to be treated as a person, not as someone with a disability.

While I understand that many American viewers will maintain a perception that this movie is offensive on some level, I feel as though the way we as Americans view race is severely different from those in other countries. While I don't consider myself an expert or ""advocate"" for awareness of racial discrimination, I find that the perpetuation of such through the media is unacceptable. Still, I think that this movie warrants an open mind, as it ventures beyond the obvious issues, and touches on a level of humanity that surpasses the pulling of the racism card.

To be quite honest, this movie was probably one of the best movies I have seen all year. From a fantastic cast to an emotionally touching story that doesn't get lost or muddled in translation, The Intouchables has leaped its way to the top of my list for possible Oscar nominations (which isn't a far stretch of the imagination). I would definitely recommend this as a movie to put on your ""must see"" list - I don't think you will be disappointed.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

And, over a period of two hours, my life, my world view, my sensibilities went, for the lack of a better word, *boom* The performances were not good, they were subtle, understated, deep, and so incroyably French! While most say - and, I agree - the movie rides on Omar Sy's very capable shoulders, the music is the Horse that Omar Sy rides on.

Ludovico Einaudi could not have done a better job if he had the invisible hand helping him.

If you want a deeply moving movie that makes you laugh out loud, helped along by a background of soulful classical music that gently intertwines with funk, or if you want a movie that pokes fun at art while being deeply reverent of it all at the same time, or if you just want a movie that simply ticks all the boxes and then creates some new ones - this will be it.

445,1.0,14 April 2013,"Script-wise the film follows all the rules, but doesn't make an stiff movie, or a collection of predictable clichés, far away from that. All the resources that are used in the movie are used in order to tell a story that it is the core of the movie, the growing and life changing friendship between Philipe (François Cluzet, the French Dustin Hoffman) and Driss (Omar Sy), the second has worked in previous movies of the directors and writers of the movie (Olivier Nakache, Eric Toledano).

It is a movie that can blend together perfectly humor and drama in many levels, all the time it plays with that. The spontaneity of Driss is key to explain the force that drives through out the movie, along with the intelligence and sensibility of Philipe.

Many of the scenes that we can find it funny and interesting in the movie, it is under this blunt honesty, socially we are under so much scrutiny and so much expectations of behavior of what it is expected, that we can end up drowning in our skin, and probably no one would realize. How can we overcome, our own fears, the weigh of our own lives and really see one another?

Friendships can do that. And that it is the story of the movie. Two true friends. ""Brothers"".

He laughs at the Opera, which I have been one time in Austria, and I would definitely agree with him, unless you are over 70 year's old, you will might like it though (just don't forget to bring your pants, they won't let you in otherwise). He is able to look at Philipe with no pity and with compassion. They are both able to acknowledge one another and have fun.

Movies are made of scenes, of fragments of life. The whole plot can only work, because these emotions and moments come in high level into the movie. True as for what can be recognized by our emotions. - Moments of friendship, it is so easy to see their intimacy. - Moments of teenager joy. (when he gets to drive the car) - Moments of real emotion for the characters. etc...

Some truths we think, are so hard to face, that we are not able to admit to ourselves, but only a true friend, can look at it and be able to help us out, to be who we truly are. We usually live with two lives inside our hearts and minds, but things only really start when they become one. And that it the whole story.","November 2, 2011 (France)"
446,1.0,18 March 2017,"This was one of the first titles I watched after taking a deep dive into the foreign film market. And as a result, I have never looked back in the endless search for more and more ""foreign hidden gems"".

The Intouchables is a movie which comes out of France. A passionate story directed by Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano which ultimately would become one of the most successful French films to ever hit the box office. You may also know there work from another film titled Samba, another hit which also starred Omar Sy (has also played several smaller roles such as Barry in Jurassic World - 2015).

The general premise is that Philippe has been a lifelong paraplegic who is searching for an everyday caretaker to help him with menial tasks such as showering, shaving, eating, and any inconveniences that he may encounter on a given day. Driss happens to apply for the job, desperately in need of a new source of income. While many would have tossed aside Driss on his past alone (criminal record and seemingly never ending impatience for people), Philippe wants a person who will look at him as more than a handicapped man. He wants a friend and someone who will treat him like he is just as capable as the next.

I quote a line from the film where Philippe is approached by a colleague who is concerned that hiring someone like Driss, a person with a rough background:

Colleague: These street guys have no pity. Philippe: That's what I want.

Antics ensue.

I claim this to be one of my favorite films and gems for several reasons:

1) The chemistry between the two leads, Omar Sy and François Cluzet is perfection. You truly believed these two individuals from polar opposite upbringings had becomes the closest of friends having discovered the beauty and benefits had from learning about one another. And quite frankly, chemistry of this magnitude is a rarity in film nowadays.

2) The imagery was beautiful. Every scene from the nights at dinner or concerts, visiting private art galleries together, snowball fights (that humor could be drawn from having a snowball fight with a paraplegic speaks volumes), Driss helping Philippe with his everyday health needs, all the way to merely feeling like he's just a normal person who also wants to have fun once in a while.

3) The story was told in such a way that keeps us wanting more. Both directors cleverly scatter humor throughout in order to offer the viewer some relief from the dark drama which is drawn out of these two characters with equally different struggles and rough pasts.

I think what ultimately made this entertaining for me was thus: in situations where you have a helpless or handicapped lead (in this case a paraplegic), the first thing I wanted was for a physically capable person to stand up for them in situations where the other is not able to do so themselves.

For example, early on in the film we are shown a situation where Philippe has a neighbor who constantly parks in the front of his drive way. It clearly bothers him but he can't do anything besides wait for the ignorant guy to move out of the way. Driss is now Philippe's right hand man, and upon recognizing the situation, jumps out of the car and gets in the drivers face, yelling for him to move his car and never park there again. You get a sense of satisfaction from this kind of relationship, as well as the developing friendship these two develop for one another as they learn to depend on each other.

I won't ruin the ending for you, but rest assured that it won't disappoint. This is truly a hidden gem for any American, and I cannot recommend this title more highly.

It begins with one helping the other because of his disability and ends with the disabled helping the other to be autonomous. Yes there are several stereotypes, but unfortunately they aren't : in France, the ""cités"" are mostly left apart from work and help, which can lead to situations such as the one of the character here presented ... I don't think the color of the actor should be taken as a main fact, this film is about mutual exchange, not stereotypes on the color.

The story is based upon a true story, and real characters. If you want to watch and enjoyable comedy, with very touching moments, this is a must go.","November 2, 2011 (France)"
450,9.0,23 December 2014,"""The Intouchables"", so let's start from the packaging of this movie. It is very simple yet humble. You can easily divide this movie into two parts. First, the story part, it is my own term to call the conversation scene, usually without music background or sound effect. And this movie utilizes this part perfectly, I mean it can make the audiences feel the melancholic sense of this movie. The conversation story also delivered in a very natural way, actually with some humble jokes too. And the other part is the catchy part, it is my own term too. This part is when the soundtrack takes place in the scene, very dynamic shot, comedic scene, or attractive act. You know, this part makes the boredom of audiences vanish, and start to laugh as well. Also, this is a kind of stimulant to make audiences keep watching the whole movie. ""The Intouchables"" mixes those two part with great sequence that makes synergy from each part.

The second point is, this film combines two extreme paradigm of how we see the world. Philippe represents the upper-class people, who admires art strictly, enjoys expensive sport, also follows the rich- man ritualism. The only weakness of this class is the lack of true love, everything is blur with so many luxurious things that he has. He can feel the beauty of painting and music, but doesn't feel the art of life itself. Even after the tragic tragedy of his life, he still in search in true love. What I mean isn't a love from a man to woman, more than that it is compassion and conscience from every human. Again, even rich-people has a human-side, when he feels cold in his plush property. The other perspective is from Driss, an easy- going man, works as the caretaker of Philippe. Of course, such as a shameless and past-criminal-man mustn't be the keeper of quadriplegic millionaire. This the very point of the movie. The upper-class touch the low- class in a very dynamic interaction. Both Philippe and Driss, learn each other's paradigm of how he sees life. Although Driss has a dark- track record, he is a pragmatic and funny character. It makes Philippe conscious with all the ritualism he had done. Melancholic, that's who Philippe is, learn the way of compassion throughout Driss comical character. So it's just like a motivation show or inspiring talk show, about a batch of social stratification. But, wrapped in a interesting comedy movie.

Another view is, this movie actually a satire movie, an elegant satire I think. Let's say how can the upper-class buy an expensive yet simple paintings, in the same time there are so many hungry people throughout their city. What is the meaning of life for the lucky person such as millionaire. Is it just a place and time for them to throw away the money by temporal things. Their compassion is simply blur with all those things. Real human instinct of love is died by the greed. Yes, a deep message one. The feeling of full-life as human, that's what we all the human seek. And unfortunately, usually the low-class-human found out it in spite of the others. Just like what Bibles said.

So that's all the implicit contents of this authentic work of art in cinema. Maybe the director, writer, or cast isn't to important. But since the great idea of humanity is the main theme, there is no way to say it's a bad cinema. Simply wonderful.","November 2, 2011 (France)"
451,1.0,4 October 2015,"As an enthusiast for film in every aspect, I truly believe this French drama to be a masterpiece. Beginning with the incredibly well suited score by Ludovico Einaudi which captures the essence of the film I was initially unsure what to expect. The opening scene was majestic and beautifully filmed with dramatic cinematography and introduced the clever comedy throughout the picture.

The true story that the script is based off may not at first glance seem relevant to many people, however I realised that actually this film notes a lot on differences in culture and creates a character for Driss, the protagonist who is low in the socio-economic scale, that expresses a lot of ideas that we might not realise and shows that the ways of the wealthy are not only largely different on the surface but deep beneath are much like that of any class.

What really made this film get the rating I have given it is the heart that it has, Driss and his friend Philippe have masterfully scripted conversations which have a beautiful mixture of melancholy and satire which gives the film a very natural sense and elevates the fluency of the pacing. Many scenes I found myself bursting with laughter as if i were having a laugh with close friends, the film feels very personal because of this and the accompaniment of Einaudi's soft yet tenacious performance generates a homely atmosphere throughout.

the beautiful cinematography carefully mimics that of a persons sight, with artistic blurring and intriguing angles. These angles and camera effects bring you deep into the character of Philippe, whom is paralysed beneath his neck, as it feels much like his view. Philippe's character tends to stare out into the distance and the filming resembles this aspect.

Finally this incredible film is accompanied by acting which feels very real and each actors style worked perfectly with the character that they played. the film as an entirety felt natural and real and the superb acting was the heart of the greatness.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

I loved that the film provides an irreverent approach to subjects usually dealt with in a sombre and overly PC way and hope the American remake does it credit. European humour does tend to be more daring often and fans of British comedy will love this. Whatever your preferences, I highly recommend this to anyone needing cheering up, honestly it's like a warm bath and a hug from a loved one - and that it's in French does not detract one bit from the humour.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

The fact that in this months Top Gear Magazine ( September 2013) I was advised by Mr Jeremy Clarkson to see this film makes it more special to me (even if his point was based on the very cool Maserati Quattroporte they use in the film)

454,1.0,15 May 2013,"What a marvelous way of story-telling is this! Adding huge ounces of principles, love, friendship & emotions into a bucket of life story is something so splendid the filmmakers have succeeded in doing, that not only will The Intouchables touch you, but also will stay with you for decades.

I say it because the story is not new to our cinematic brains. It has been sampled before (check out Guzaarish (a Bollywood debacle), Jab We Met (theme), etc.). But, the freshness & adrenaline pumping sequences are high above the reach of typical non-standard plots & SFX or CGI. Without making use of cheap-stakes, surrounding itself with pure blessings of wonderful music, budding cast, performances & screenplay is what makes it a beautiful drama. The comedy will stay with you with lots of improvisation in the slapstick. While the character depth is astronomical, what works for The Intouchables is that it is genuine. From its core.

A good 8.7/10 for a wonderful experience. A wonderful story talking about human relations, notwithstanding the stereotypes, flashing the happier (& the dull) side of humanity & its nature, topped with a perfect climax. Minus 1 for the blunt center-story. The Intouchables is simply the best movie to come out of modern France... yet!

BOTTOM LINE: 100% Recommended. Go get touched by this magnificent celluloid!

The movie is a very ""easy watched"" movie with a lot of small funny characteristic jokes between Philippe and Driss while it also handling bigger questions like how quadriplegic and physical disabled people often strikes self confidence, the thrill of feeling alive in a wheelchair and how you want to get treated by the people around you.

Its subtle humor and honesty are refreshing amid overly-cheesy movies, This is because it's actually based on a true story. Two men find friendship when everything in their respective cultures says otherwise. It showcases the vast socioeconomic differences between Driss and Philippe and how these barriers are overcome. When we think of Paris and France in general, we do not think of the slums outside the major cities, the poverty, and brokenness housed just outside the ""city of love.""

466,8.0,18 May 2012,"The Intouchables has broken all the box office records in France and Europe recently and is attracting a lot of audience. Being a fan of French cinema, I decided to be a part of this experience. The Intouchables, based on a true story, tells the tale of a handicap millionaire named Philippe played really brilliantly by Francois Cluzet who appoints Driss (Played by Omar Sy), a broke ex-con, to be his caretaker. Because both of them have somewhat same kind of nature, they develop a deep friendship.

I have to say first that the performances were very impressive. Each and every actor was natural in their roles. For example: Driss is supposed to very funny which he is, very much. Even the opening scene was great! Millionaire is shown as a tried old man who's bored of his own luxuries and he appoints Driss just because he sees himself in him: a young exuberant yet a wasted man. Secondly, the relation between the both, their friendship, is the whole point of the film. It was good I guess, I just thought that there were some aspects of it that I had already seen in other films , the same clichés that appear again. But just like I said, the performances were great. So the acting made their friendship more energetic and realistic. Thirdly, it was quite hilarious. One scene where both the leads exchange their taste in music was one of the best. Although there wasn't anything new in it, but their love for each other matters the most in this film. Lastly, the plot is quite simple, no twist or turns. It's a simple but great tale of friendship, in which both the characters learn something from one another and so do we...

Though The Intouchables doesn't show us anything new, it's entertaining and a new addition in the French cinema that I would love to discover and rediscover. Highly Recommended.

Nothing that we have not seen but still the life interactions shown here is a rare phenomenon in our everyday busy life.

474,1.0,30 December 2012,"I have read the review of a famous french movie journalist called Pierre Murat, in the very intellectual magazine ""Telerama"", and I'm furious about it. He wrote that the worldwide success of this movie was highly predictable : good feelings, a ""feel good movie"" in a gloomy time of economic crisis, etc, etc...

Nonsense. Who could have thought that a french movie about a tetraplegic man on a wheelchair would be seen by 37 millions people in Europe, that is to say more than the US family blockbuster, the last Harry Potter movie ? Please, be serious Mr Murat.

Mr Murat too says that this movie is just good feelings, not good acting or good movie direction. Here again, it's completely out of base. the actors are wonderful and have a perfect chemistry between them, the script is perfect.

I laughed and I have been ""touched""at the same time. Laugh and emotion at the same time, it's a rare combination in a whole film.

But infamy didn't come only from some pedantic french journalists who always denigrate and despise the successful movies (of course, when a movie is liked my many people, they say it's demagogic and bad taste). Some US critics dared to say that this movie was racist because the actor playing the man who helps the rich paralyzed aristocrat is black ! My god. Why some Americans are so obsessed by the skin colours ? As a French, it's not at all something that I noticed ! Who cares if Omar Sy is Black ? They totally missed the point.

What is important in this movie, it's precisely the universal message delivered behind a true story wonderfully told by 2 brilliant actors : beyond all of our possibles differences (physical or social disabilities or prejudices), we are human beings after all, who can be friends.

Intouchables is not simply a ""buddy movie"" or a ""feel good movie"", it's a movie about humanity, devotion to others, friendship, tolerance.

Unfortunately, Mr Murat kept is social prejudices (he thinks that a popular movie is always a bad one), as some US commentators kept their racial prejudices about black men serving white men.

I really believe that the whole meaning of the film is exactly Sy's energy. We can see how someone with positive energy can totally change your life even if you are in the worst position like a quadriplegic person.

Of course the film does not reflect the majority of quadriplegics (don't think they are that rich), so we cannot really see the difficulties that these people are going through. But the fact that it is a true story gives hope to everyone for sure.

It's like a man's version of the chick flick Beaches. Two unlikely guys become friends when a strong and virulent African guy named Driss is called upon to become the manservant of tetraplegic and rich Phillipe. The two of them become close friends and a lot of hilarity ensues.

It's a completely unique film about friendship as it lacks all of the schmaltzy, sickening sentimentality of Hollywood movies of the same genre. Instead there's a deeply funny and human type of friendship that's based on two guys doing what guys do - smoke weed, get b**tches, get money etc.

479,1.0,6 June 2013,"The French movie, the intouchables, is a comedy about a disabled aristocrat named Phillip and his encounter with Driss, who is a young man who comes from the outsides of Paris and is fresh out of jail. Phillipe decides to hire Driss as his helper even though Driss does not have any education or experience. Together, they go on an adventure that will make them find the value of friendship even though they are totally different characters, they learn to live and see life from a different perspective and at the same time complement each other perfectly. The directors of this marvelous story are: Eric Toledano, who is forty to years old and Oliver Nakache who is 40 years old. Both of them, who have known each other since the beginning of the 1990's, were born in France and did their first their first short film in 1995. The directors were inspired to do this movie in 2003, after watching a documentary about the life of Phillippe Pozzo di Brogo. Eight years later, they decided to adapt this story and create the movie named ""The Intouchables"" I will now analyze several cinematic aspects of the movie and whether they succeed or fail in these within the movie. The title of the movie is suitable and adapts perfectly to the movie because thee friends are inseparable even though they are absolutely different. When they meet, they find happiness and become comfortable with themselves. Hey complement each other because Phillip does not like a person that have pity on him, which makes them the perfect duo due to the fact that Driss treats him like any other person. Phillipe, after a long time of not doing so, laughs and smiles thanks to Driss's personality. On the other hand, Driss finds another way to live; he learns to be honorable and to work hard, to earn things for himself without stealing others' objects. When they are together, they are unstoppable, intouchable. At the same time that the title adapts to the movie, the cast is totally adequate. Omar Sy interprets Driss, a tall and big man who is funny and always smiling. This creates contrast with Francois Cluzet, who interprets Phillipe as a serious and elegant man. The clothing is another success of the cast from the movie. These reveal the different characterizations of each character. When the movie starts, Driss's clothing are scarce and in bad state but as the movie goes one, his appears to have more clothes and also more sense of fashion thanks to his new job and new lifestyle. Phillipe's clothing is elegant all throughout the movie due to the fact that people that know him expect to see him dressed that way because of his social status. He also dresses according to his age and gender. Phillipe's maids have an elegant uniform to work with, and his daughter has a tendency to dressing inappropriately for her age. Driss's family dress with dark, loose and old clothes, which reflects the type of life they have thanks to the society they live in. The script is simple, clear and adequate. Each character has its own way to talk and express themselves according to their characterization. For example: Driss has a more informal way to talk than Phillipe. Music is not a central point or focus of the movie, but when there is music, it is wonderful and helps create the perfect environment for the movie. When Driss and Phillipe are paragliding, the music is harmonious but moving at the same time, it gives a sense of happiness and adventure, which is the exact situation they are going through. Another moment in which the movie is important is in Phillipe's birthday party. The band is professional and present famous songs that make the audience feel identified with the movie. It makes us remember why music is so important in peoples' lives. The sound was low and high according to the situation the character where experiencing. On Phillipe's birthday, the music is loud, as if it were the one talking, instead of the characters. On the other hand, when Driss is leaving Phillipe's house, it is low and what is loud is actually the rain. The scenography, along with the photography is excellent. It is different in each place including Paris, houses of different characters, mountains, etc. The different environments are perfectly portrayed. The photography is simple. The framing is usually from the hips to the top of the actor or the whole actor. One can rarely see the characters and their whole surroundings, which creates emphasis on the characters and the situation they are in. The movie achieves teaching us, through infortune and humor, that everyone is different and we need to help one another because not everyone has the same privileges or problems. Also, that we need to enjoy life to the fullest because you only live once. We have to be happy with what he have and not with what we do not have. I recommend this movie to everyone out there. It is entertaining for people of all ages and genres. It maintains everyone entertained and interested every second and at the same it teaches a great lesson to the public. There is romance, suspense, friendships and a lot more.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

483,1.0,2 March 2018,"Damn, this has put me in a really happy mood...which is rare, trust me. One of the highest rated French films currently, Untouchable is the true story of a rich handicapped man employing the assistance of a benefit scrounging man where the two make for an unlikely friendship. Whilst this does follow the ever so popular formula of ""poor man temporarily lives in rich lifestyle that now changes him for the better"", it is somewhat different in which simultaneously the millionaire is also touched by the lifestyle of the ex-con caretaker. It is this balance of these glimpses into each lifestyle that makes these characters relatable and likeable. They are down to earth, they are just like you or me and I really admire that approach. It's a story of opportunities. Being able to give someone a job that they may not usually receive that, not only brings them plenty of money, but changes their way of life. Their way of thinking. A story like this is the definition of a crowd pleaser. I can say, with certain, that everyone will enjoy this. What assists with my certainty, is the outstanding performances by Omar Sy and Francois Cluzet. Sy was phenomenal. A very grounded and understated performance and you can see he is having fun which really elevates the optimistic mood that the film conveys. Cluzet's performance is rooted with honesty and a hint of sarcasm that makes the dialogue refreshing. There were many moments where I laughed which again is a rare accomplishment in itself. It's does try to tug on your emotional strings a little too much and personally I don't think it achieved this. It does enhance the character development but you can see that it does not quite reach those heights. Didn't feel like a natural progression in the story, like the writers just had to throw some emotional conflict for the sake of it. Formulaic?

He comes from poverty and walks into luxury: but he's not overwhelmed by it, no tugging the forelock and being intimidated for Driss. He never wavers from being himself. He is unpredictable as he explores the rich world he has walked in to. He might break something, or steal something, or assault someone. If he thinks something is rubbish he says so. He laughs when he feels like it, which can be considered inappropriate - but Phillipe usually agrees with him - he has this way of freeing Phillippe to see things another way.

Driss is as big, powerful, energetic man - who is quite happy out in the street sharing a smoke with a bunch of other almost homeless guys like himself. He's like a panther, he could quite easily knife someone if he had to, to survive. He is raw energy. Then here he is placed in a rarified, alien place, learning to put support tights on a bloke!!

What I'm trying to get across is this tornado of energy being gentle & compassionate, but never being tamed. He's not a tame panther, not particularly safe, but with Phillippe he is nurturing. He's authentic. No politically correct, spin crap here, if he's irritated he'll tell you to f--k off. Very refreshing - a real person.

Philippe is great too, that he sees the potential in Driss and isn't scared off by the idea of Driss, his background and all.

It's so refreshing to see a man portrayed as a man and to be so powerful, sexy and loving on his own terms: when he can walk comfortably in completely different worlds without apologising to anyone.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

It was past midnight already and I had an 8am French class. I told myself I will just watch 20 minutes, read the plot summary on Wikipedia, and then go to sleep. However, I just couldn't stop watching it after that 20 minutes. It was warm, delightful, and funny from the very beginning. So I watched most of it that night... and finished it the next day.

During our French discussion, people started talking about the stereotypical representation of race and class, like how Philippe is a white rich guy who is only fond of high art while Driss is a funky low class dude with a big heart. I found these criticism unnecessary and too political for a comedy film. These representations of the main characters aren't offensive, and the friendship and feelings are real and touching in the movie.

Given to me as birthday present, I was sceptical of the ""rave reviews"" splashed across the DVD sleeve (and the subject matter put me off).

The film is authentic and genuine.

""Untouchable"" made us us laugh because the scenes were both funny and brilliantly done - real life on screen as opposed to ""Actors-Being-Comedians"".

Everything is deadly serious, ""Untouchable"" is based (however loosely I cannot tell) on actual events.

Eye candy it is not, here we have an insight into a world behind doors that keeps itself to itself. I found myself looking into two greatly contrasting lives.

The characters evoke empathy in different ways and for different reasons, even when someone is ""being bad"".

The casting is excellent, timing, pace, mood all have been handled with impeccability.

Would it have come across differently if it had been presented as pure fiction? That may be a hard question to answer, telling myself I was watching the retelling of true events undoubtedly added to the strength of the film.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

The story, superficially, is a simple one of a quadriplegic guy who hires a new carer to do everything for him because he has no movement from his neck down. The guy he chooses to be his new carer (he is extremely rich also) is a Senegalese migrant who needs the work but has absolutely no training. The movie, and it's very funny, revolves around this strange relationship between the white guy who can do so little for himself and the black guy who can do everything for both of therm. The episodes this African guy gets the white guy into constitute the bulk of the movie and I would put it on your list of can't miss films.

The Intouchables explores the strange blocks that are put in the way of people trying to make a life with a severe handicap: Cluzet's character must overcome his physical disability and Sy's character must overcome his race in a city that prides itself on being proper which means having no colour. They use each other's handicap to their own advantage with wonderful movie delights for the viewer.

I was taken by how Driss, Sy's character, used his remarkable force of character to over awe all the people that he needed to do something different: his relations, people going about there daily business or virtually anyone in which he came into contat.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

And while the film is overflowing with heart, it is also fun! Humor and a lighthearted look at reality keep the pace, with seamless transitions that surprise us into feeling something new.

The first scene captivates the audience in a way unlike any other, by showing the unlikely, and genuine, relationship between two people who would appear to be, upon first glance, polar opposites. I have read through a handful of negative reviews and it, quite frankly, really bothers me. Not only did I find the movie to be laugh-out-loud funny, but it was also very sentimental, especially more towards the latter portion of the film. This is one of only a few movies that I have ever watched that has had my utmost attention for the entire duration of the film. Not once did I find my mind wandering off, and I most certainly was never bored. However, on a more serious note, I think that the movie also shows how, sometimes, the most unexpected people could become some of the most important people in your life. I would, without a doubt, give this movie a 10/10 and recommend it to everybody.

It shows that joy doesn't come with material possessions, that there are so many things we just take for granted and forget to appreciate ""what is"".

501,9.0,19 May 2012,"It's not hard to see how Intouchables become a hit. It's a crowd pleaser in the true sense of the word; a movie that works to appeal to every sector of the audience, and uses a familiar formula that's been seen many times before. Interestingly, though, it doesn't resort to the lowest common denominator. Nakache and Toledano were clearly aware of the fact that they're not offering any new revelations, and instead focused on making the movie as entertaining, touching and effective as possible, and it works, loath as I am to admit it. The movie is fast-paced, fantastically edited, always entertaining, sitting squarely on the border between comedy and drama; the two leads, François Cluzet and Omar Sy, have perfect chemistry and make even the crudest jokes work. More impressively, they make even the most cynical viewer forget that they heard it all before.

Intouchables is, in fact, one of those precious few films I can label as 'almost perfect', in that it's impossible to point out any particular flaws. The biggest flaw, and the only reason I gave it a less than perfect rating, is simply how predictable it is. It's very easy to ignore while you're watching, but Intouchables is, in fact, a formula movie, which doesn't really have anything that new or interesting to say, and doesn't do anything that wasn't done before. That doesn't detract anything, though, from the fact that it's an excellent movie and practically impossible not to enjoy, if only because the two leads are so incredibly likable and so much fun to spend 90 minutes with.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

The direction of Eric Toledano is masterful, showing both men's backgrounds in such a way (subtle comedy, gripping drama, heart warming moments) you learn so much about them as individuals and how their feelings develop gradually for each other and their own families.

With some real laugh out load moments, romance and action too, you really get everything with this movie.

There are moments so intense and so impassioned, though of course not obvious, that will make you feel indebted to this film, with their subtle portrayal in a manner which cannot always necessarily be perceived by the senses otherwise. It will take time for you to understand the parallel facets that follow every measure being pursued by the actors. The background music is almost heavenly took me somewhere so unknown.

Subtle, delicate and masterful, the build up and pacing of the film is very well managed and not once drags or feels boring, the characters are simply perfect and no single character feels forced or out of place, each one playing an integral part in the story. The acting is overwhelmingly real and as with a majority of modern foreign cinema the suspension of disbelief is never once broken dragging you emphatically into this beautiful at times; otherwise grainy and staunch Parisian reality. The mise en scène is stunningly portrayed and carefully picked by an experienced cinematographer Mathieu Vadepied who really comes into his own here. Simply put, this film is a must see for this generation and should be regarded as one of the most magnificent pieces of cinema to come out of France since Amelie, and certainly one of the great works of modern cinema regardless of language barriers.

The story of a quadriplegic man helped by another man for day to day work and living the beautiful moments of life is sure to impress you.

PROS:

The thought that fascinated me most was the demand of Philippe from people not to be sympathetic to him. That is so true and original. People met with accident want a normal life again and do not want sympathies which eventually look like forced upon. Omar Sy as Driss has definitely stolen the show. The main story revolves around what the two do all day, but it also gives fair judgment to the personal life of Driss. He has been shown as a realistic character that is kind hearted but on the other side, is not able to live properly with his family. The film, its characters, its locations, music, cinematography and almost everything else is soothing.

Phillipe is looking for someone who won't pity him and what he gets is a person who gives Phillipe a perspective that makes the both of them grow to become better people.

The film is funny, sad, and above all else extremely well made. The story which is superbly written flies by. The cinematography and the editing contribute to the film's smooth style.

From the opening scene, the movie kept you engaged with its memorable characters, which provide great chemistry with each other. Makes you wonder if a price can be put on your health and freedom. I had to ask myself if I would trade places with Philippe, with all his status and material riches, but to be totally dependent on a caretaker for the most basic of daily tasks. The Driss character was a total contrast and provided what Philippe could not provide on his own, not just from a physical viewpoint. When I went to see this it was only playing in one theater in the Chicagoland area, a shame that a quality films doesn't get the distribution while the mass marketed produced junk that Hollywood churns out pushes out rich films like this one.

I only knew Omar Sy (Driss) from director Jean Pierre Juneauts' ""Micmacs"" where his knack was a proliferation of clichés that trailed off topic, but ended in that contagious smile and accompanying laugh. Not much to work with.... Not so here. From the opening scene, we know the unconventional inertia of Driss, as childlike stating the elephant in the room and his street smarts, but without Francois Cluzets' portrayal of Phillipe the paraplegic, we would have an immature caretaker with a drooling invalid with no heart or purpose. We couldn't be laughing at our own self imposed limitations. Yes, without Phillipe being rich beyond belief, we'd have no action. Much like the brilliant ""The Diving Bell and The Butterfly"", this story takes us away from our spoiled selves, not just cinematically but spiritually. Here it is filled with its own Hollywood clichés of dance scene, car chase and feel goodness, but that doesn't distract from the plot as much as it could have in a s""sell out"" studio requirement. There is personal acceptance over stereotypical forced growth experiences and makes for a good film.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

The Intouchables is a sweet French comedy drama all about a disabled man and his carer. It is a tale of not only happiness but life affirming thoughts and actions and one film you mustn't miss. It is sweet and very emotional, but can then change into a kind of vicious emotion, attacking your very emotion but by the end you come out thinking nice thoughts and you really do feel something for all involved.

Now it isn't that this is something completely new, a revolutionary new thought process in film, we have seen films like this before. The thing is that this movie is hilarious as well as interesting and all together it just breathes brilliance and fun. The funniest character has to be Driss(brilliantly played by Omar Sy) who is not only hilariously funny, also holds a deep side which can really draw you into him.

In general the movie is all round acted well, Not only Omar Sy puts in a good performance, Francois Cluzet is great as the disabled character Phillipe and members such as Anne Le Ny and Audrey Fleurot add to the beautiful portrayals. I think as I said before, you can really connect with the people in this and they feel like real people(it is to be fair based on a true story), but they really feel similar even if stinking rich some of them.

The direction is beautifully done by Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano who both seem to skilfully deal with the matter and make it feel so normal and also of course humorous. Along with the direction, the cinematography is done well too and the shots used are not only perfect but add to the atmosphere the scenes are trying to get across.

The true gem of this movie and the true heart and soul is the script, written by the two directors, Nakache and Toledano seem to bring in a lovely thought process and make this a movie containing loud laughs and then down to maybe even near tears. The script is the best thing about this and I felt that more nominations could have been given to it for that, maybe even international awards that weren't just for foreign film.

All that saying it can be said, this has been done before. Now I explained what I thought but some may feel this is too similar to the kind of feel sorry for them story this really does have. Another point is the partly cringe thing that is, a white millionaire and his poor black carer, it just feels too much like ""oh hey lets make it like the poor guy can change and so can the rich guy, and lets make them different races"", it kind of annoyed me and although it works well in the end, it could have just been anyone and still been interesting.

This movie really does represent French cinema at it's best and I dare say it makes you want to see more. With it's quick wit and well time and length(112 minutes) this is really a movie I couldn't recommend more, to those who feel maybe they need to see film that really talks about true life, this is one, and although most of us will not experience anything in this, you still feel like your in the characters skins anyway. Overall I felt it was brilliant just gloriously wonderful, not perfect by a little way but still a movie all should see.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

Omar Sy leads to the driving scene, where happens a beautiful part of the movie, a part which is accompanied by Ludovico Einaudi's track.

I suppose I was initially deterred by the subtitles, and then the potential of this movie actually being as cliché as the main image presents. However, the film has your eyeballs glued to the screen within the first minute, regardless of how much your eyes are twitching back and forth to the subtitles.

The script, acting, photography, set design, etc; all is realistic and really without any noteworthy flaw. I was captivated from beginning to end, whilst having experienced a whole gamut of emotion, which I think is pretty difficult to come by from any film. I enjoyed this film very much! There's a really decent moral to this story, executed tastefully and in a very delicate manner.

540,8.0,20 February 2015,"Every now and again you come across a film that makes you feel good to be human. Intouchables is one such film.

The subject matter sounds depressing. A moneyed man who is disabled and seems very much alone in the world. A carer who seems not to care. A feral, street savvy, young black man, who the world has taught to look after number one.

What blossoms between these unlikeliest of companions is a friendship that touches on the best of human emotions. Kindness, compassion, mutual care and above all a wry sense of humour in the face of adversity. Indeed, this is surprisingly, a comedy. Both of the lead characters are, at their core, a pair of rascals who enjoy having a good time. And what a time they have!

I do not remember smiling or laughing so much in a very long time. Or, for that matter, being so honestly touched by this thoroughly unpretentious film.

The acting is superb. The chemistry between the leads is amazing. I can not recommend this film enough. I'm only able to rate this film ten out of ten. But really saying this film is just excellent does not do it justice.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

Central to the films success are the two leads Francois Cluzet ( looking remarkably like Dustin Hoffman) and Omar Sy. Both are likable and bring real depth to their roles making you root for both of them. The supporting cast are excellent and there isn't a false performance throughout.

The films pacing is excellent and although it was nearly 2 hours long you really just want it to continue. A lot of films are let down by the ending but this one really delivers on the emotional front.

Within the field of psychiatry (the act of giving medications to a seriously mentally ill individual) there is usually little room for psychotic behaviour / symptoms. For example in the film the care-giver takes a certain number of risks, that to me borders on psychotic behavior, namely, driving down highways at high speed zigzagging in and out of cars at high speed, experimenting on his patient and stealing. All of these symptoms could also be experienced as criminal through the lens of a police officer - but this movie was more then it's details. It was a movie about a connection, pure and simple. These two grown men connected with each other one way or another. It was real bond that they formed, and this bond was unconditional. No matter what the other one would do, it would be forgiven.

I think that a critic's judgment, although in most cases accurate, is often clouded by ego and limited appreciation towards the human side of the movie and more towards the aesthetic value of it and the notions of motion picture ""art"" and ""science"". So what if it's a modern version of Driving Miss Daisy? That's not the point of the movie. When one lets go of all these distractions and the film works it's magic, the human feeling it exerts on the viewer is incredible. Also, I didn't get the nonsense about the ""racial stereotypes"". In their shallow selves, the critics, especially the American ones, paid too much attention to these alleged signals of race stereotypes. I, for one, didn't think once about it and I was shocked to read that the movie contained racial stereotypes (I like to read reviews after watching a movie to avoid being influenced) Furthermore the instances where the film tackles cultural differences (not the plot of the movie), albeit unfortunately, are not necessarily stereotypes but a reality for many people of different cultures and ethnicity; even in America, as much as American critics hate to admit it.

So therefore if you haven't seen this movie yet, let go and immerse yourself in a touching and very human experience and don't be prejudiced about it and you will agree that this is a case where critics get it spectacularly wrong.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

580,8.0,19 January 2022,"The film ""1 + 1 or The Untouchables"" is based on real events, tells about the life of an irresponsible guy from a poor family, an unfavorable area, making ends meet through petty theft and a rich aristocrat paralyzed from neck to toe, who are brought together by chance. The script for the film is written competently, and the film itself is not even shot very badly, it looks easy, in one breath, while it perfectly combines touching moments that grab the soul and comic scenes that make you laugh out loud.

But still, when watching a movie, the idea that something like this has already been observed somewhere, experienced, does not stop spinning in my head .... A lot of melodramas have typical and sometimes identical moments that do not differ in novelty and originality. And the ending of the film is not quite clearly revealed, there is not that ""emotional Boom"" like in ""Knockin' on Heaven's Door"", ""The Fault in the Stars"" or ""Hachiko"".

In my opinion the story tells about two people from different worlds. Philippe is wealthy paralytic man who lives in a huge house in Paris. Driss is poor ex-prisoner from suburb. Philippe is bored with frequent variation of his caregivers and Driss reluctantly starts as Philippe's caregiver. Surprisingly they make friends. Other characters are in small roles though these have their own important place.

Intouchables is almost magical film because it contains many glad little situations and different types of humour without forgetting drama and failures. A few scenes aren't credible.

However, I will not agree that this is the best French movie as it is certainly not! Le fabuleux destin d'Amelie Poulain is the top French movie (for me)!

I think that the movie has to thank its high score to the brilliant and utterly convincing acting of Omar. His acting and presence really are believable and you feel connection to him and to the millionaire through him. Of course, the story itself has the universal appeal of compassion, understanding, struggle and faith.

I liked the part that touches on art. 40.000 euros for a painting with a red dot on canvas?! And Berlin gallery new artist painting ... clever!

Yes, this is a clever movie. No wonder it gets high scores.

Although it is set in Paris, somehow I think it would have been better if there were more scenes with the city itself. Nine from me!","November 2, 2011 (France)"
604,1.0,27 July 2023,"I've known of this movie for a long time but never got around to watching it. The story didn't appeal to me as I am not a fan of dramas and even though I am Francophone, I rarely watch movies that are not in English. But after watching a few scenes on YouTube, I decided to give it a shot and I was blown away. The story itself is nothing special on paper, rich white man meets poor black man, poor black man helps rich white man and they become friends despite their differences. What makes this movie special is three factors: acting, chemistry and subtlety.

Acting is self-explanatory. Both Omar Sy and François Cluzet are fantastic in their respective roles. Omar Sy especially just radiates off the screen and delivers a fantastic performance. He is kind, but not a pushover, he is strong and will use force but only up to a certain degree, he has flaws but he is extremely likeable. As for François Cluzet, he doesn't make the mistake of falling into the trap of being either too angry, too reclusive or trying to lay in on to gather pity. This is also true of their chemistry on screen. You truly believe these two men are becoming close friends and that relationship grows before our very eyes. This movie wouldn't work without that chemistry, and it's what drives the plot forward. If you just read this screenplay, it wouldn't really be as effective. The casting is on point and Omar and François are fantastic together.

Subtlety is a big strength of this movie. Never does it try to make you feel bad for Philippe or Driss. We are shown their pain, Philippe of losing his wife and losing his ability to move and Driss of being an immigrant in a foreign land with a large family and a strained relationship with his adoptive mother. The relationship between Philippe and Driss also grows slowly. There's not one single moment where everything changes. The love these two men have for each other feels earned and Driss' eventual move out is not a big blow-up, it's just a small human moment where circumstances change. The score is not overused, the direction is not heavy handed and it helps the movie's message feel more realistic.

The movie is clearly better if you understand French but I think even with subtitles, it's worth a watch.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

I am very doubtful towards comedies and they fail 9 times out of ten. If you want to see a touching movie with a great moral perspective this is your movie. I really love the challenging topic and the versatile humor in this film.

I have to be honest. I did not know anything about this movie and the cast before I watched it. The actors really nailed their performances.

I always refuse to give a 10/10 because who am I to say that some movie is perfect. This is suitable to everyone and I always recommend this movie to all regardless viewers age or preferences.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

Ultimately, it's a fairly predictable film, but the familiar beats and tropes do little to detract from the Omar Sy and François Cluzet's outstanding performances, nor the movie's large heart. It's a crowd- pleaser, very funny at times, and a rousing testament to the transformative power a single friendship. My only real quibble with The Intouchables is that the prologue scene at the end of the film showing the two real people upon whom the film is based has a funny way of stealing some of the affection I felt for the honest depictions of the fictional characters.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

It is interesting because I don't really think this film is anything super special. Its competent and enjoyable, but nothing that truly impresses.

The two lead characters of the film, played by François Cluzet and Omar Sy have a interesting chemistry between them and it is well acted, but the film suffers from having a mega rich person as the lead character. There are tons of people who have terribly crippling physical ailments that are also poor, that don't have the resources to have anything in the world they wish, that would be much more interesting stories. The only poverty and struggling we see through the film is Sy's character, but it is grossly underused, instead having him live the high life for the majority of the film.

The film also tends to shy away from the hard hitting depression that afflicts physically disabled people. Even looking at the real life person the film was based off of would show that he attempted suicide by wrapping and oxygen tube around his neck. I feel like it is important to illustrate these emotions and feelings more effectively in films like these.

Despite all this there are some really funny moments and a real genuine charm from the leads to be found. Sy has a better performance than anyome else in the film, but I would say all parties do a good job. The dancing scene later on in the film is incredibly endearing and the soundtrack of the film is a blast.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

How is it possible to make a film on such a sad subject with so much humor? For me, this is almost a masterpiece. The film is also based on real events. And this is always at least catchy. Film genre drama, comedy.

What is the movie about? A wealthy aristocrat named Philippe (Francois Cluzet) is confined to a wheelchair after an accident. It is difficult for him to find a person whom he would like to see next to him, but nevertheless such a person was found. It turned out to be a young man - a black Driss (Omar Sy), although he was not going to work much. Nevertheless, they agree on mutually beneficial terms to try to pass the time together. Despite the fact that Phillip is paralyzed, Driss manages to bring a breath of fresh air into his life with a dose of adventure and humor.

An excellent film about the struggle for life! The actors are just amazing! I always enjoy watching this movie! If you haven't watched it yet, I highly recommend it! It will not leave anyone indifferent! More films like this. Pass the time with this movie as well.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

And here one of them accidentally falls on the interview, and the second, as an experiment or due to interest hires to see how it will be and what will come of it. And it comes out quite a serious and friendly attitude between different estates and various cultures, which can be combined not only by a disease, but also the desire for life, freedom and love .. The most important thing is that the film is raised on real events, of course, it is changed and the characters are reworked, but The fact remains a fact.

Also, negligence in work led to the fact that the main character realized that there was no pity for him, thereby he realized that this brought him back a little to normal life.

622,1.0,18 November 2017,"The ""Intouchables"" is a French movie that includes both comedy and drama. I can't describe it in words so I highly recommend you to watch this work of art which shows us that there are still people with a wonderful soul nowadays. The plot is inspired by a real story. Francois Cluzet plays the role of Philippe, a rich man who paralyzed after an accident. Philippe hires a young African man named Driss, played by Omar Sy, who only wanted a signature, not a job, so he can receive his unemployment benefit. Philippe offered to the young man a period to gain experience helping him. After that Driss can decide if he wanted to stay with Philippe or not. I'll let you discover what decision Driss took but I can say that their lives have changed completely. The movie, directed by Oliver Nakache and Eric Toledano, has an impressive soundtrack, made by Ludovico Einaudi, which fits perfectly with the action and the scenes. To be honest, I didn't expect to like it. But now I think it's the kind of movie that goes right to your soul, full of humanity and emotion. I enjoyed every minute of this even if the real story isn't the happiest. I was also impressed by the friendship between two people from different ""worlds"", countries, who have totally different behavior. It is like an antidote against sadness and negative feelings of our lives. I found on the Internet(IMDb) that 5% of the profits from the movie were donated to an association which creates living spaces for disabled people. This left me speechless.

626,1.0,20 November 2013,"It's been a while since I have had such a good laugh, quickly followed by tears when watching a film. The last one was probably 50/50. The Intouchables, however, I found to be a much more emotionally evocative and explored difficult topics (i.e. racism, socioeconomic strata, gangs, disability, sex, parenting, loyalty, and acceptance) with eloquence. Not to mention the soundtrack, which was diverse, including both classical/piano solos and R &B, but exceptional.

Omar Sy, a little known actor, showed impressive acting talent on par with Francois Cluzet; The two had wonderful on screen chemistry. Any lesser performance of Drisser could have easily made him a hateful character. Somehow, despite the harsh things Driss says and his seemingly unempathetic actions (brazenly making his way into the interview and demanding a signature; refusing to compromise for his gracious employer or any of his coworkers; aggressively pursuing Magalie, making almost offensive passes; pouring hot water over & over, fascinated to see that Philippe cannot feel it, always acting like the tough guy and refusing to show any kindness or weakness; his carelessness almost causing serious harm to Philippe a few times), Omar Sy manages to make Driss quite the opposite. Of course, we soon learn that despite the act he tries to put on, he has a very kind heart. This is exemplified in so many indescribable gestures, allowances, and gestures throughout the latter part of the film, my favorite being the final scene of course, where he has set up a date for Philippe to meet Eleanor. Philippe and Eleonore had been carrying on with an epistolary relationship for over six months, but Philippe had, to that point, been understandably too afraid of rejection to reveal his true physical state and situation.

The other more minor characters are almost all played wonderfully as well, Yvonne the awkward co-worker, Magalie, Philippe's secretary and Driss's love interest, Driss's mother/aunt, and his other family members. Even Philippe's brother and the caretaker who replaces Driss.

The impressive thing is that this film manages to not only be funny, but witty. And there is a significant difference. References to popular culture, art, music, and current events (Obama, Hitler, Bieber, Michelangelo (The Turtle), Goya, Dali, Opera, Mozart, Schubert, Earth Wind, & Fire, etc.) are welcomed and educated, usually given in the context of witty banter. The cinematography, especially on the weekend paragliding adventure and the closing scene by the Cabourg seaside, is extraordinary. The use of angles and mise en scene is great throughout, even in the opening scene of the car chase in the Maserati.

In the end, the title really says it all. It should really be named ""The Untouchables"", as ""intouchable"" is French for ""untouchable"". This is a story about disability, racism, and all those other difficult-to- discuss topics. But on a deeper level, it is about friendship, love, and loyalty. Throughout most of the film, nobody understands why Philippe has hired such an unqualified individual, seeing Driss as a true outsider. The two of them, however, in their own way, don't give a damn about what anyone else thinks. Through their friendship, they teach each other things, learning and enriching each others' lives, bringing out the best in each other. Like any great friendship, they have many inside things nobody else would really understand, illustrated in numerous favorite scenes, like the erogenous zones of the ear, Driss's comments regarding the audacity of The Opera, Driss's initial lack of appreciation for art but then creating a masterpiece of sorts, ""Nice knowing you!"" (Philippe giving Driss a difficult time during their flight), ""Where can you find a tetraplegic? Where you left him!"", the endearing way in which Driss dances to Earth, Wind, & Fire and encourages other guests to do the same, turning Philippe's usually sad affair of a birthday party into a fun one, etc. etc. etc. In this way, their unlikely friendship is untouchable.

Individually, of course, they are also separately untouchable, Driss with his blunt, hardened approach to life and others, and Philippe quite literally, being a quadriplegic. (Notably, in regards to his birthday party, he mentions how everyone acts like they care, but the sincerity is questionable.) For these reasons, sadly, most of society treats them as ""untouchable""; individuals of a lower class.

That this film is based on a true story makes it that much more extraordinary. I realize some of the facts were misrepresented, but that is why it is ""based on"" and not a true biography. I intend to locate a copy of Philippe Pozzo di Borgo's ""A Second Wind"" and/or Abdel Sellou's (Driss) ""You Changed My Life"" when I can.

For me, the idea that this film was predictable means nothing. The art of great cinema is taking a story, predictable or not, and illustrating it in such a way that viewers fall in love with the characters and walk away feeling differently than when they began; inspired to think differently, act differently. The Intouchables did this, without a doubt.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

The movie is about a quadriplegic that looks for a personal assistant which will take care of him, feed him, bathe him and everything else that's needed.

After an ""assistant audition"", he chooses a rather foolish man to care for him. After a while, the main message of the movie kicks in and shows us what does true friendship mean, and what is really the stuff that we should give our attention to in our lives.

To summarize, imagine sitting on a bench in a park and watching as two people grow to be friends. Nothing is forced onto them, nothing is disrupting them, and sure, they have their differences, even coming from two separate worlds entirely; but you have the chance to watch what true friendship is based upon without even realizing this is a movie. It's like sneaking in a theater and watching a ballet dancer exercising with no public.

633,1.0,19 January 2022,"The old saying goes: ""The best stories are the stories written by life itself."" The directing duo of Olivier Nakasha and Eric Toledano managed to correctly tell a tragicomedy based on the real story of a poor young Arab from the French ghetto and a paralyzed businessman, whom fate linked with an unexpected friendship, despite the fact that in reality they are not connected by anything, be it social status, or views on understanding life.

The charming tragicomedy ""The Untouchables"" first of all has a heart and a mind completely free from cliches about showing compassion to the disabled and other incapacitated people. The film correctly allows them, in the person of Philip, to feel like almost full-fledged people like everyone else, conveying all this in a humorous form, often bordering on disarming frankness. And this happens on the screen thanks primarily to the fascinating atmosphere created by the excellent duet of Omar Saya, who seems to have a fresh joke in his pocket, and Francois Cluzet, who masterfully makes this film a success only through facial expressions and voice. In addition, the film also touches in passing on other topics that still raise many questions in French society, whether it is unemployment among emigrants, or child crime, in between which, having the opportunity to also criticize contemporary art, which in 90% of its cases borders on a simple childish daub, but being highly appreciated by critics is given out as something brilliant.

Having finally created a life-affirming, witty, funny and charming explosion of a mixture of drama and comedy in the most effective proportions, ""Untouchables"" has become almost an ideal film for any audience and certainly one of the best French films of 2011!","November 2, 2011 (France)"

It sounds like music, and it tells us something which we can understand just because of we don't know French. In addition, actors facial expression is also remarkable thing for me. There are some scenes which have no dialog, only back music. In those scene, characters facial expression tells us a lot of things. And, I think the music in this movie is wonderful.

It is nuanced, witty, unpredictable and true artistic/creative expression. It is also quite humorous, adding lightness and hope to the situation at hand.

I didn't know what to expect from this movie, as I'm not one that follows foreign cinema that much, but after hearing excellent reviews from fellow movie goers, I thought that I would give it a chance and man, am I glad that I did. The director brought these 2 complete different worlds together brilliantly and the mixture of humour and drama kept the film interesting throughout. I don't know how close this movie is to the real story about these 2 extraordinary men is, but it's amazing that such a rich man was prepared to give a down and out benefit claimer, a chance of a lifetime and boy, didn't he handle it well. It's been a long time since I have enjoyed a movie so much and judging by its takings at the box office, I'm not the only one. A Great Watch!

Round-Up: Since the release of this movie, Omar Sy, the helper, has starred in the new X Men and has been casted for the new Jurassic Park which isn't bad for someone who was completely unknown. I mist hope that he keeps all of his good qualities and that he doesn't get brainwashed by Hollywood. As for Francois Cluzet, the guy in the wheelchair, it doesn't look like he is going to crossover anytime soon, but he was brilliant in this movie. Anyway, I'm sure that Hollywood will be taking this concept and making there own version soon, but this is one of those movies that shouldn't be touched because your never going to get the same chemistry as the director captured.

Budget: N/A Worldwide Gross: $430million (WOW!)

The movie is very well written. Although opening on a flash-forward, it is fairly classic comedy about the meeting of two opposite people who were very unlikely to meet. The first one is a paraplegic white middle aged very rich and lonely man, the other one is a young black, poor, unemployed, coming from poor suburbs and a very large family.

What makes the quality of the film, beside the humour present in every scene in which Omar Sy appears (actually most of the film), is the emotion you can feel, through increasingly attaching characters.

The story is based upon a true story, and real characters.

Now, at times it seems too idealistic and probably it is, with the ""lord"" giving a chance to the ""peasant"" and then becoming friends when intimate enough to learn about each other; a bit like a fairy tale.

A film that inspires and moves . But what are the reasons for this , and why is it so popular? This question I want to address here and reply deliver .

Phillip , heavy Disabled , needs a social worker who goes to him in his everyday life at hand. Driss , pretty broke, needs three unsuccessful interviews to longed to get hold unemployment benefits . A conflict-ridden history is thus created .

Driss , who actually want to present only because of a cancellation at Phillip himself , has little sensitivity to the suffering of others . Phillip underestimated this property and provides Driss promptly as a new social worker . Quick note , the two that they differ in many respects. Nevertheless, they become friends and enjoy their time together .

So far, so good. Similar stories exist in other films as well . So what is the secret behind the success of ""Pretty Best Friends "" ?

Perhaps the most important point - the main characters are authentic. The direct type of Driss , who is played by Omar Sy is so poignant sympathetic that you simply like to have to have him ! The viewer can identify from the first minute with him , not least because you are often able to have the desire , even to say that really what you think straight. Also, Phillip , played by Franzois Cluzet , exerts a fascination on the viewer. Because we are interested in his illness and infects the person behind this . Another factor of success is the juxtaposition of both character types . The funny and easygoing manner of Driss and the rigid view of life by Phillip are so opposite , since it is difficult to the audience not to sympathize .

Conclusion:

Comedy with level seems to work! Anyone looking for a very unusual French film for a friends evening , is hereby served very well . A credible story with lots of charm and great actors. And rightly one of the best comedies of recent years.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

A grounded yet unique experience emphasized by outstanding cinematography is what can be savored after watching this lighthearted feature film. Two men, coming from contrasting parts of society, accompanied each other, partaking a variety of activities around charming Paris and beyond. The Intouchables could be consider rather straightforward with the main characters eventually found their happiness if not for one small detail that was masterfully executed during its length. Appearing multiple times throughout the film in different forms was the word 'Pragmatic'. Most activities carried out by Driss and Phillipe can be considered practical (apart from some, especially the paragliding scene which bears similarities with the skydiving scene in a similar themed film - The Bucket List) and in reality, would not have changed Phillipe's monotonous life, but perhaps it was Driss, a man from an ever struggling part of society, whose actions and the 'pragmatic' ways he handled these daily activities, that had transformed Phillipe from a sanctimonious, highly educated, self-centered man into a carefree yet thoughtful person.

689,9.0,19 January 2022,"The film '1 + 1' has not yet had time to die off at the global box office, and the Americans are already preparing their remake, because having been released in only eleven countries, the picture of Olivier Nakash and Eric Toledano has already collected $ 300 million. No one can say exactly what exactly served as the box office success of an ordinary European film, which is far from such an Americanized concept as a 'blockbuster', nevertheless, this dark horse of the box office deserves at least respect, because it is very difficult even for Hollywood majors to raise such money around the world without attracting stars of the first magnitude and the lack of a powerful advertising campaign. '1+1' works in the genre of dramatic comedy, showing the story of friendship of people from different social strata. In short, a paralyzed French businessman (Francois Cluzet) by chance, he offers a job as a nurse to an inveterate parasite and just a former prisoner (Omar Si) in order to diversify his life a little, and at the same time pull a morally degraded person out of the social pit. All this is great, of course, and sometimes even instructive, but for some reason the authors have not been able to move away from those boring stereotypes that steadily pass from year to year.

From the very beginning, the creators draw a racial line between the main characters so that the viewer, God forbid, does not feel excessive originality. For example, a rich gentleman is necessarily a white-faced gentleman, and a careless boor is, of course, a black man, and such cliches are accompanied throughout the film, giving exactly the same informative characteristic that Hollywood screenwriters gave twenty years ago when they tried to convey the entire culture of Russia according to several outdated criteria, starting with nesting dolls and felt boots, and ending with drunken bears playing on the balalaika. Olivier Nakash and Eric Toledano took too 'onion' material, well, in the sense that the story itself about a paralyzed person is able to evoke emotions even in the most unflappable moviegoer, so the creators simply had no right to look for slack in the viewer. Instead of proving the autonomy of their story, the directors decided to play on the audience's feelings by assuming the functions of the main conductors, then including touching music in the relevant episodes, then overly dramatizing, once again hinting to us what kind of complex material they selected for the film adaptation. There have already been a lot of similar films, so it's hard to answer what makes '1 + 1' stand out from the others, because, by and large, we were shown another tearful film where the creators tried to put increased pressure on the audience, forcing them to perceive events with their hearts, and not with a clear cold-blooded mind.

Intouchables is an overcooked French dish, the recipe of which is not innovative. The picture is not so bad as to smash it to smithereens, but it is not so good as to give it carte blanche in the form of leading positions in all kinds of audience ratings.

Final scene is very strong, emotional and Ludovico Einaudi's Una Mattina is so great. This song and this ending scene are perfect match.","November 2, 2011 (France)"
701,8.0,5 April 2020,"The Intouchables, originally a French Film, a winner of 38 ""Best Foreign Language Film award"", is the movie based on true events, is an intricately fabricated profound work of art, which surely is a medley of sparkling humor, subtle emotions, and a deep dive into nature of human relationships. It's truly an irresistible delight for the connoisseurs of the finest cinematic experience.

The movie revolves around the two main characters - Philippe and Driss.

Philippe, played by François Cluzet, is a millionaire, and handsome aristocrat who is deep inside a free-spirited, fast-paced, adventure-loving, energetic and humor seeking person, meets an accident while Paragliding and happens to become a quadriplegic, a person who is paralyzed right from the base of his neck to the last toe on his foot. Philippe's life, now due to the helplessness given by quadriplegia, is limited to mostly the walls of his mansion, the routine care of doctors and caretakers and the pity of the rest of the world. In summary, he is living hell in the midst of his affluence.

Due to the consistent exposure of pity, dependence, and helplessness, he happens to devote his life to intellectual activities, arts, music, drama, literary events, and epistolary relationships (distant conversations with a person through letters only). There is a lot of insipidity in his life, his true innate energetic and adventure-loving nature is now lost, which he has now accepted as his fate.

He happens to meet and finally hires Driss, Omar Sy, as his caregiver, who is totally opposite of what Phillipe is from the outside. Driss is black west African, he is impulsive, he is uncultured, raw, reckless, violent, free-spirited, fast-paced, humorous and aimless person, who comes from one of Paris's poor, suburban high-rise ghettoes, and is seeking some money. He has also been recent to jail for 6 months for robbing a Jewelry store.

In spite of two of them being so different, what binds them together is their total love for honesty, sense of humor and contempt for stuffy hypocrisy. And, most importantly Driss is actually the outward raw and honest manifestation of the true deep character of Phillipe. What Phillipe likes about Driss the most is, he treats him like a normal human being with all his arms and legs, he doesn't pity him, he doesn't make him realize of quadriplegia all the time and rather he makes him feel good, makes him feel lively and makes him laugh again, the laughter which was missing in Phillipe's life since ages. This becomes the greatest binding force in their relation.

Philipe shares that he lost his loving wife the same time he got quadriplegia and his true disability is not having to be in a wheelchair, but it's having to be without his wife.

Driss brings taste in Phillipe's insipid life. They both learn and grow with each other. Phillipe learns to enjoy the daily life mundane things apart from his literary and intense interests and at the same time, Driss gets more responsible and civilized in the journey!

Both of them have performed phenomenally. Their every action and expression is praiseworthy. It's an epitome of a true and deep friendship that grips, holds and takes the spectator on an around 2 hours long journey of humor and subtle emotions.

An inevitably must watch.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

703,9.0,16 January 2015,"A French movie about a friendship that develops between two characters that came from the opposite sides of the society: a middle aged aristocrat Paul confined to a wheelchair after a paragliding accident and a young Senegalese man (Driss) with a criminal past, no job and limited prospects in the projects where he lives.

The rich surroundings of Paul's mansion are a stark contrast to the environment that Driss knows. It is not important to question why Paul took an immediate liking to Driss, perhaps it was the unpretentious humour and his obvious unfamiliarity with the protocols in Paul's world. Against the advice of his caretakers he hires Driss for a trial period. The ensuing ""training"" provides funny moments and both men benefit in their own ways.

Maybe one could question the risk that Paul takes in trusting such an unknown but he goes on his instincts and lets Driss take him in directions where he would not dare go himself. Both men enjoy the journey and develop along the way. I have some criticism of the unnecessary exaggerations in the script, such as pouring hot water on paraplegic's legs just to emphasize the point or what is the likelihood of a happy end in the final scenes or the interactions with Paul's daughter and her boyfriend but it is not relevant.

The movie portrays tolerance, disability and friendship in a humorous way and with great acting. Worth seeing.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

715,9.0,14 April 2014,"I found ""The Intouchables"" to be a very enjoyable film, made even more so by the fact that it is based on a true story.

The story is about an odd couple--a wealthy, older, paraplegic white man who seems to have little joy in his life, and a young, poor black man who doesn't take life too seriously.

Each of them has something to offer the other. Through their relationship, which becomes a friendship and more, they each gain so much. Especially Philippe who, due to his immobility, has limited power to control his day to day activities.

This can be called a comedy because of the light-hearted banter and jokes that are in it. But the banter and jokes help Philippe attain a more positive view of life--a touching and dramatic development.

Finally it was playing on my flight to Bali the other day and I decided now was the time. I'm very glad I took the time to see it because it is a very fine film.

The chemistry between the two leads (and to a lesser extent the rest of the cast as well who also did an excellent job) is what makes this film so special. Unfortunately the fact that the real life version of Driss wasn't black is a little distasteful. I think it is disrespectful to the real life person. If it were the other way around there would be hell to pay. This is one of the very few negatives I can aim at this film.

The story is funny, charming, heart-breaking and joyous all at once. It is a great watch.

This film made me laugh as much as reflect: it tackles many topics without explicitly highlighting them making the film too dramatic but masking them with many, but many laughs. Driss is an incredible character, his story is excellent, all due to a colossal interpretation of Omar Sy. Philippe is also a beautiful character like all the others present and like all the actors involved. The direction is excellent and the photography is wonderful. I loved the writing of the film, with a start in flashforward and below all the story explained of how they got to the initial scene. The setting is great and the costumes are beautiful too. The dramatic tone in contrast to the comedy made my experience space, with so many laughs that at the beginning made you laugh but immediately afterwards make you think about the discrimination that really happens to disabled people. The ending is incredible and best expresses the meaning of friendship, in which one wants the best for the other even against their principles and their will and therefore expresses the true heart of the film, friendship.

There is something very touching in how Philippe finds more joy in sharing a joint with Driss than going to art galleries or the Opera.

Even though Driss and Philippe are polar opposites of each other, this is why they work so well together. Philippe wants a carer like Driss due to how laidback and lazy he is. Philippe is sick of being pampered to and pedestalised. He wants a carer who will accept him for who he is.

I was watching this spectre in awe and with my mouth open. Since then I have seen the movie dozen of times, always with the same impact. Flawless script, unique way of incorporating beginning / towards the end scene. Brilliant actors, great music which sometimes intensified the scenes from behind and in some parts it was cruicial to the actors and, hence, played a partner to leading actors. In 2017 American version was created but I do not have a heart to watch that version. I have already done so with Girl with dragon tattoo and I do not have to repeat that experience. On the other hand, I never say never and there is a possibility, that in a time of weakness I might actually watch American version just for studying purposes. The story has that gradation, moment of surprise and that development of characters I always hope for. In one sentence : It is a bromance, where the leading characters safe one another. Unforgetable scenes like: shaving, birthday celebration, seducing co-worker, Omar´s dancing and mainly his laughter at a theatre.

744,1.0,19 June 2023,"""The Intouchables"" is a film that exceeds expectations, providing a unique cinematic experience. Released in 2011, this French drama based on real events introduces us to a story that masterfully blends humor and emotion.

The screenplay is exceptionally well-written, skillfully balancing moments of comedy and emotional depth. The comedic situations provide genuine moments of laughter, while the more heartfelt scenes deeply touch the viewer's heart. The dynamic between Philippe, brilliantly portrayed by François Cluzet, and Driss, brought to life magnificently by Omar Sy, is the true highlight of the film. The chemistry between the actors is evident, and they breathe life into charismatic and complex characters.

In addition to the exceptional performances, the cinematography also deserves praise. The cinematography captures the atmosphere of Paris perfectly, showcasing the city in a charming manner. The soundtrack, composed by Ludovico Einaudi and other artists, complements the scenes perfectly, intensifying the conveyed emotions.

A notable aspect of the film is how it tackles sensitive themes such as physical disability and social inequality. By addressing these issues authentically, ""The Intouchables"" avoids clichés and stereotypes, bringing a more realistic and human approach. The film reminds us of the importance of empathy, acceptance, and breaking down social barriers.

However, despite its overall quality, ""The Intouchables"" can be criticized for some predictable narrative choices. At certain moments, the plot follows an expected path, avoiding genuine surprises. Nevertheless, the strength of the characters and the actors' performances compensate for this slight flaw.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

Second, it's drama. An interesting personal story with a rather unexpected ending - many at the end of the film break down and cry, but, again, in a kind way. The spice to this whole story is added by the fact that it is based on real events.

Thirdly, the cast - ""live"" played straight all. But most of all, you will remember the main characters: Omar Sy, who maintains a positive attitude throughout the film, and Francois Cluzet with his kind smile.

The film is not so much about the tragedy of one person, but about two different ""extremes"" - about the world of a financially prosperous (but physically helpless) person and a person in whom life is in full swing, but who is not able to support a family. The contrast of these two worlds throughout the film makes you think that many of your problems are not problems at all. After the film, you begin to enjoy the little things, appreciate what you have - after all, you can lose all this in one moment.","November 2, 2011 (France)"
750,1.0,2 November 2022,"Untouchable (Intouchables) (2011) -

I was very pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this film. I tend to steer clear of films with illnesses, disabilities and so on, because of their usually sad undertones and often overtones, but this biopic story was a pure delight about a fantastic bond between a wealthy paraplegic, classical music enthusiast and a random man from the street that he employed to take care of him.

Although there have been remakes of it, including the American 'The Upside' (2017) starring Brian Cranston, I have been repeatedly told to watch this original French version. It also featured on two of the Top Film lists that I refer to. I'm glad I did actually watch the original, because it seemed to have a charm about it that I felt would be lost if it was based in another country, certain elements and quirks that could only be found in France.

The paraplegic Philippe was like a Parisian Dustin Hoffman and was equally as capable of delivering a warm and charismatic, yet humorous performance that was engaging and I found relatable too. His isolation and social anxieties were familiar to me and I felt for him in that respect more than any pity I might have had for his other medical situation, because they didn't labour that point, which was refreshing.

The carer character of Driss was brilliantly inappropriate. I loved the fact that Philippe gave him a chance, because he wanted someone genuine to look after him and that's what he got. The friendship that blossomed between them was great fun to watch and Driss' way of dealing with things was brilliantly real. He also delivered some cracking laugh out loud moments.

I actually think though, that the majority of the humour was what I could expect from a day to day conversation with my friends and family, so I wouldn't call it a comedy as such. It certainly didn't seem to be played for laughs at every opportunity, but delivered a script that was full of the humour of every day moments instead.

It bears a definite similarity to 'The Scent Of A Woman' (1992) in which Chris O'Donnell goes to work for a blind Al Pacino and learns about himself as much as the care of a sightless man and that was a good film, but I think that 'Untouchable' will stick with me a lot longer.

I also felt that the soundtrack of this film was not only appropriate, but also beautiful. It fit perfectly with the different men in the lead roles and really helped to show their differences and show the environments that they found themselves in.

I can see why it was remade in America, India and Argentina, because I'd want to tell the story again too and I might be tempted to watch the U. S. version purely for comparison, but I think those that have said to watch this one, and with subtitles, not dubbed, would be right in their adamance that this was the best one.

And then one of them accidentally gets into an interview, and the second, as an experiment or out of interest, hires him to see how it will be and what will come of it.

I am not a French speaker at all, yet this did not in any way stop me from my enjoyment of this film.

Full credit to François Cluzet for his incredible acting as a paraplegic - this is a very difficult thing to play convincingly when you still have full range of motion, yet I was so convinced by his acting I had to check whether he actually was disabled after the movie finished - literally no movement of anything from the neck down through the whole thing - it is up there with Daniel Day-Lewis in 'My Left Foot' and Eddie Redmayne in 'The Theory of Everything'.

Omar Sy stole the show for me - absolutely convincing portrayal of a man who is from the projects and with a deeper, more troubled past than he lets on, yet his comedic timing through subtle expression, and delivery of his dialogue is nothing short of masterful.

Very few films leave you feeling so wonderful, so much so that only two spring to mind - The Shawshank Redemption, and It's a Wonderful Life, and to be compared to two such films is very high praise.

The relationship of the two central characters is akin to that of Red and Andy Dufresne in Shawshank, but with more humour and a wonderful co-dependency which becomes clearer as the film progresses. Supporting cast and characters are a joy to behold, with the roles of Yvonne and Magalie being expertly fleshed out by Anne Le Ny and Audrey Fleurot respectively.

This movie is all about heart and humour viewed through the lens of two people from vastly different ends of a cultural spectrum. The result is one of the very best films it has been my pleasure to watch. Bravo.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

766,9.0,3 June 2024,"""Intouchables"" is a profoundly moving film that beautifully explores the unlikely friendship between two men from vastly different worlds. Directed by Olivier Nakache and Éric Toledano, this French comedy-drama is based on the true story of Philippe Pozzo di Borgo and his caregiver, Abdel Sellou.

The film stars François Cluzet as Philippe, a wealthy quadriplegic aristocrat, and Omar Sy as Driss, his exuberant and unconventional caregiver from the Parisian suburbs. Their chemistry is the heart and soul of the movie, driving the narrative with a blend of humor, empathy, and raw emotion. Cluzet delivers a restrained yet powerful performance, capturing Philippe's vulnerability and strength. Meanwhile, Sy's portrayal of Driss is dynamic and charismatic, infusing the film with energy and joy.

""Intouchables"" deftly balances humor and poignancy, offering a refreshing perspective on life, disability, and human connection. The film's humor is genuine and unforced, providing levity without undermining the serious themes it addresses. The narrative is uplifting, emphasizing the transformative power of friendship and the importance of seeing beyond superficial differences.

With its engaging performances, heartfelt story, and deft direction, ""Intouchables"" is an unforgettable film that resonates deeply, reminding viewers of the beauty of human resilience and the bonds that unite us. It is a celebration of life, laughter, and the unexpected connections that can change our lives forever.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

769,8.0,8 January 2024,"The Intouchables (2011) is a comedy-drama film by talented directors Olivier Nakache and Éric Toledano. The movie is based on a true story from the book ""Le Second Souffle"" by Philippe Pozzo di Borgo and Abdel Sellou. The book tells about their time working together after Pozzo di Borgo became quadriplegic in a paragliding accident. This film strikes a unique balance between humor and drama, earning an 8/10 rating in my view. This film's strengths lie in its cinematography, music, and script, all of which contribute to its distinctive character.

The film opens with captivating cinematography, particularly notable in the car scene. The director's style is reminiscent of Scorsese, with medium close-ups, point-of-view shots, and short pans, yet it maintains originality. Special techniques, such as quickly changing scenes and using different people or outfits in the same place, make the story more interesting without confusing the audience. Additionally, the inclusion of breathtaking natural landscapes enhances the visual appeal.

The soundtrack by Ludoviko Einaudi is a mix of melancholic piano and 80s music, oscillating between bittersweet and amusing tones. This dynamic range in the musical temperature significantly enhances the film's emotional impact.

The script is well-crafted, balancing witty humor with dark humor. Humorous scenes are executed efficiently, contributing to the film's overall charm without feeling overdone.

The inclusion of dance scenes adds a vibrant layer to the film, fitting well within the comedy-drama genre. Dance scenes, in my opinion, in comedy drama movies are almost always a very good addition as it adds more contrast to the films.

The film excels in developing the main characters, Philip and Driss, making them empathetic and relatable. However, it falls short in fleshing out the side characters, lacking depth and background, which leaves them feeling somewhat distant.

The film's ending is particularly powerful, leaving a lasting impression and evoking strong emotional responses.

In summary, The Intouchables (2011) is a film that successfully blends humor with heartfelt moments, marked by excellent cinematography and music. Despite some shortcomings in secondary character development, its main characters are well-rounded, and the script is engaging. Personally, I would watch it a second time but all in all, this movie is worth to watch.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

Unlike so many difficult-to-watch and hard-to-love dramas dealing the subject of physical disability, 'Untouchable' handles the subject with a belligerent acceptance that is far more relatable than the worthy wringing of hands that seems to be the standard technique. The direction of the film's writers Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano is assured, with hardly a missed step, and they explore many interesting and novel ways to cast light on the protagonist Cluzet's difficult situation. Sy is a revelation, a fireball of energy and charm, and both are impossible not to root for straight from the gripping opening sequence.

The African, Driss (Omar Sy), is by contrast crude and lovably lecherous-a sensualist-as well as a drug user and possibly former dealer who lives with several younger cousins on the road to gangland.

Almost every phase, and every point in this movie is so conventional and unoriginal. However, this movie is very remarkable! That's because it surpasses all the feel-good movies of its kind.

Needless to mention the high-class direction from Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano that made this movie exceptional. Thanks to this superb direction, The Intouchables delivers broad laughs and tugs at the heartstrings without delving too deep, or present anything new. Sometimes the movie becomes so hilarious, and other times you couldn't help shedding some tears, often, of joy! The best thing about this movie that it kept its lighter tone throughout its runtime. The tonal shift when the movie moves from its second to its third act wasn't smooth, though. That being said, you will never find any movie of this kind that has half its magical moments.

The friendship between Philippe and Driss is simply unparalleled. That's, of course, due to the insanely magnetic chemistry between Omar Sy and François Cluzet. I bet you can find such chemistry in any other movie of the same kind.

The soundtrack is perfectly utilized to match the movie's bright tone. And the cinematography is beautiful, but what I think made the movie looks spectacular is its fancy production design.

The third act is definitely a bit rushed but I feel like the ending more than makes up for it. This ending could be the sweetest and most charming ending ever. You couldn't decide if you should cry or laugh, but don't worry because you would do both.

It is a film based on real facts that occurred from the relationship between a rich French aristocrat and his trusted servant, an Algerian who lived in the suburbs. Here, however, the African origin of the servant is reinforced by the intentional choice of a black actor, Omar Sy, while the other role was given to veteran François Cluzet. Both actors were capable of exceptional chemistry and look fantastic when they split the screen. Sy's jokes, in his character, are laughing to tears. The cinematography and the scenery are very good and the soundtrack, Ludovico Einaudi's responsibility, is simply a masterpiece of ""contemporary"" classical music.

790,1.0,3 December 2023,"Normally I am not the person to be impressed by overly sugary, saccharine, or light films. I think they can be corny, formulaic, and trite affairs. Which is probably why I felt pleasantly surprised when I viewed The Intouchables. There should be no qualms that this films intention is first and foremost, to make its audience laugh. The script is impeccably witty and very funny, aided by marvellous performances by Omar Sy and Francois Cluzet. Sy and Cluzet are a remarkable pairing, for they enjoy an unabashedly enjoyable, sometimes even riotously funny dynamic with each other. This is also to teh screenplays credit. Philippe is written as a character stripped of almost all pleasures in his life, which lends well for him to adopt a reckless attitude , or at least one reckless by French aristocratic standards, towards life. He is hence a perfect match for the often crude, and profane Driss. He is paralysed waist down, so he doesn't care if Driss talks to him at the opera, or insults or embarrasses his family members. This lends itself to wonderfully hilarious situations in the film, always maintaining a taut pace, and making thetwo hour duration an easy, engrossing, and engaging watch. But I doubt the film would score so highly if it were merely an overt comedy. Indeed what makes The Intouchables a great rather than a good film is its emotionally resonance. Driss and Philippe come from entirely disparate walks of life, and the director does not shy away from portraying both the decrepit, dirty blocks of ugly public housing and the lush, refined surroundings of Philippes home. Like what good friends do, Driss and Philippe helps each other with achieving self fulfilment, and it is interesting that this help rendered to each other originates not only from their common humanity, but also from their different backgrounds. Philippe helps Driss in discovering his talent for abstract art, and even manages to help him sell his painting, through his own wealthy connections of course. Meanwhile Philippe not only lacks the bravery and initiative to pursue Elenor, but also has trouble with his daughter. Driss, with his more direct and tougher personality, helps with encouraging Philippe to be more direct both in disciplining his daughter, and with chasing Elenor. Of course, part of the films appeal is that it balances drama and comedy deftly- the film never feels overly saccharine or overly sentimental. Instead it offers a measured blend of both. This is what makes The Intouchables a sublimely uplifting, yet hilarious watch.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

The soundtrack has a very important role in the movie and it follows and emphasizes the emotions that actors bring to the screen. The point is that sometimes you need to change something to get everything. Oscar worthy!","November 2, 2011 (France)"
793,8.0,18 January 2016,"A touching film that is titled the Intouchables.

I fell on the film through the IMDb top 250 list. I vow myself to complete that list soon.

When I watched the trailer it was reminiscent of another film ""The Bucket List"", so that set the expectation. Yet, when I watched the whole film, I was happier, more involved and I felt it was more realistic.

Omar Sy, the actor who played the role of Driss did an amazing job. After many films, I was left awestruck by such a realistic and easy performance. He lived it, just did not play the part is what I felt.

The screenplay was terrific, it was straight and without any complications. The film just flew by in 1 hour 52 minutes of running time, thus, I owe the credit to editing which was apt.

Directors were faithful I believe to the original story which was two real persons. I thank the writers and directors for being unsympathetic and yet very realistic with the film.

One word that I can echo with the film is ""Pragmatic"". This film shows that interesting stories can be told in a realistic manner and without any melodrama.

A 5/5 for this. Loved it.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

The humor, the compassion and relationship are a perfect fit. It's a bummer that the majority of people in the US don't like movies with subtitles. They are missing out. While the writers add characters outside of the two leads, they keep the focus on the plot and keep it fun and serious at the same time. I watched it again tonight. The movies I watch more than once are far and few between. This movie will be on my shelf one day soon. I liked everything about it. I am just trying to write enough to post it.

Out of blue, Driss cuts off the line of candidates and brings a document from Social Security and asks Phillipe to sign proof that he's looking for a job to get his unemployment benefit. Philippe challenges Driss, offering him a month of probation to gain experience to help him. Then Driss can decide if he wants to stay with him or not.

800,8.0,30 August 2024,"Good film. The film stars Francois Cluzet as an aristocrat, named Philippe, who was paralyzed in a paragliding accident. He's somewhat depressed and has lost most communication with his adopted daughter Elisa (Alba Gaia Kraghede Bellugi). He also has phantom pains which keep him up at night and still mourns the death of his wife greatly, who died before they could have any kids of their own. He maintains romantic relationships with women only through written letters and fears actually meeting or speaking with them. One day he's looking for a new caretaker and a man named Driss (Omar Sy) enters his home just looking for a signature so he can continue to collect welfare checks. Driss lives with his large family in a small flat in a Parisian suburb. So when Philippe actually does offer him a job as well as a room in his mansion, that has it's own large bathtub in it, it's quite a culture shock for him. Of course Philippe is inspired by Driss and both men's lives are forever changed.

801,1.0,6 October 2012,"I knew that THE INTOUCHABLES was playing in more cinemas than the ones a European picture usually gets to in Mexico City. It's still playing actually (and will continue to, at least, till next Thursday), which means that the film has survived in cinemas more than a month – a real achievement since this is a city where not even the films of a modern American auteur like Wes Anderson remain in theaters more than a week or two. I watched the trailer of THE INTOUCHABLES (its Mexican title is AMIGOS, which means ""FRIENDS"") once and it seemed all right, but really nothing that attracted me enough to rush to the cinema. Then I realized it was part of IMDb's always-controversial top 250 – I knew I had to check it out as soon as possible, for mere movie geek curiosity.

First, I will have to answer to that obvious question regarding the top 250: no, I don't think it's one of the greatest films of all-time, much less the seventieth. In fact, I wasn't impressed but then again, I'm not really part of the kind of audience that love or will love it – I mean, one can easily see why this film is a success with audiences all around the world. It's definitely a good one and I got it and enjoyed the good of it.

Is there something bad about it then? Well, not really – the film tried to be both funny and meaningful and it was. One can argue about the underdevelopment of some interesting issues (like the whole background story of one of the two main characters; the one played by Omar Sy), but that would be just unimportant. My girlfriend watched it with me and she enjoyed it a whole lot; in fact, she would watch it again, while I wouldn't. Is clear to me that most women will adore it, so yeah, you should take your special one to see it.

To finish this brief commentary, I'm listing some other thoughts on the film:

1) The music is very tasty; the American band Earth, Wind & Fire plays an important role here. We have a nice and memorable title sequence inside a car set to one of their songs (""September""); for me it will be very difficult from now on to hear that famous song and not think in Omar Sy's character Driss. And I heard some other good tunes, so I'm definitely getting the full soundtrack (although the band is mentioned by Driss, there aren't Kool & the Gang songs, by the way).

2) A joke on how the art world works reminded of Banksy's EXIT THROUGH THE GIFT SHOP. You know, it shows that sometimes art is all about freakin' hype.

3) Omar Sy shines. It was my introduction to this French actor and his character was definitely my favorite element of the film. It's classic stuff really, with a young and crazy-pot-smoking dude who's just f' hilarious – I imagine that the controversial Italian footballer Mario Balotelli is just like Driss (I hope that makes sense to you).

4) The film has the classic ""clash of different worlds"" thing. You know the storyline already, right? The young and crazy dude, from the ghetto, gets a job as the carer of a quadriplegic and wealthy man. It's obvious material, but not really in a bad way – for instance, there's a scene in which Driss is shaving his pal Philippe (the wealthy man; played by François Cluzet, who sort-of looks like Robert De Niro) and I could see the Hitler mustache joke coming a mile away. And just like the joke was still all right, the whole film feels like that no matter of the obvious issues it offers.

817,8.0,3 June 2012,"Recently I have been caught in the web of Marilyn fever, after MY WEEK WITH MARILYN (2011) and the season finale of SMASH (even Uma Thurman could pull off a slender doppelgänger Marilyn), I decide watch this musical/burlesque to quench my thirst and hope to know more about her, the mysterious actress whose shallowness is rather not compatible with our requirement of an eternal icon (after her two more prominent flicks, SOME LIKE IT HOT 1959 and THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH 1957).

The film pairs a soft kitten Marilyn with a pointed Jane Russell, to counterpart not only the hair color, also conceive two precious opposite temperaments between them, and they're indeed BFFs to each other (at least in the film they claim to be). In this Howard Hawk's vaudeville, with the help of Russell, the showgirl comfort zone is the haven for Monroe to perform right on her own track and never mitigates its plain entertaining function, given that one could forget about the tacky script (one unexplained plot hole, how the detective fathom the whereabouts of the tiara?).

The film has been officially crowned as the most successful film in French domestic market (French's much appreciated axiom preferring attendance over grosses), overthrew the 14-year reign of TITANIC (1997). An astonishing victory diametrically wins over the overpowering Hollywood tyranny which prevails in the world elsewhere.

Unlike another sensational but more provincial box-office mammoth victor WELCOME TO THE LAND OF SHTIS (2008), THE INTOUCHABLES nudges a more international vantage point, which may suggest a more wide acceptance than the former's parochial stature. We are living in an imperfect world where people are classified as different classes by money, power and social status, the gaps are the invisible barriers deter the evolution of a more equalized and stable society, the film may not possess the magic spell to solve this conundrum, but it has its heartfelt innovation to allow any individual to witness a sincere friendship ignited between a pair with the least possibility.

Due to the language hurdle, there are plenty inside jokes which is difficult to comprehend for an outsider, but François Cluzet and Omar Sy are both equally recommendable, although Sy has an edge over since he dominates the most joyful parts and steadfastly handles the more poignant segment as well.

Directors-writers Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano show no rookie mistakes, and sufficiently exercise this true story to distill until its most theatrical fodder being left (although some antics are overdone, the lesbian deployment? There is no need to add gay element in every film), and embroider it with a slickly potent cast which reflects a concise judgment towards the kennel - we should treat each other unbiasedly as a human being, without any prejudice of differentiation of any sort.

Ludovico Einaudi's piano score plays a significant role in the film as well, providing this enthralling journey with a passionate catharsis!

If you manage to avoid the Bryan Cranston/Kevin Hart massacred remake, The Intouchables is a heartfelt true story, charting the journey of a millionaire quadriplegic (François Cluzet,) as he is cared for by his projects-raised caregiver (Omar Sy).

Both are well-cast, but Sy steals the show, a cheeky, rough and caring man who begins to see how he can change others' lives.

The story does one crucial thing that so many feel-goods fail to do: it doesn't bring you down just to boost you back up. Without making you sad or remorseful, The Intouchables paints this story's highs and lows - no mean feat when tackling disability and poverty in the same strokes.

Familiar musical tunes appear throughout, and the settings are fairly diverse, given the base of Paris and the money the main character has to play with.

828,1.0,24 April 2017,"The Intouchables, despite the title, really touches viewers' heart without being corny, pitiful or tearful. This a comedy that does keep your mouth on the silly-smile mode from beginning to end, because it's funny, it makes you laugh, but is not vulgar, cheesy or cookie-cutter made. The directors and scriptwriters juggled all the dramatic and comedic elements beautifully, and nothing is too much, too less, or so-so. The dialogues and situations are brilliant at times, very candid frequently, and really genuine at times. I found myself totally absorbed by the story and by the interaction of the two main characters.

This movie would have been different if the cast was not as good and credible as they are, from the supporting roles of the troubled kids, to the upper-nose relatives of Philippe. Yet, François Cluzet & Omar Sy carry the weight of the story, and they are brilliant. Not even for a second I saw them as actors playing a role, but as Philippe and Driss. Besides, they have an amazing chemistry on camera and on this resides, for the most part, the charm of the film.

The movie is beautifully filmed, with lovely indoors and outdoors scenes, and a wonderful lighting. It captures well the real Paris: the wonderful elegant areas of central Paris where the bourgeoisie lives, but also the very poor and marginalized banlieus of the periphery where most immigrants live. However, the aim of the film is not that of showing those dramatic differences but, on the contrary, to show how human connection is possible no matter your origin, it can be possible and magical despite, a priori, thinking that would never happen. It does not matter your social class, your gender, your past, your culture, your family or your ethnic background.

The score is beautifully poetic and quintessential Ludovico Einaudi. If you have ever listened to any of his musical pieces, you will immediately recognize the music in those progressive repetitive a-la-Philip Glass soft wanderings of the piano. Just wonderful.

My only criticism to the film is that we get to know Phillipe's character quite well by the end of the film, but not so much or as much that of Driss. We know that he comes from a troubled impoverished immigrant family living in a poor suburb, but we don't know much about him, the person, the man, what his dreams, fears, longings are, or what he was doing before the story began.

The Intouchables is a mesmerizing, heart-warming and very funny film. The fact that is based on a real story, and not just a feel-good script, gives it a layer of depth that would otherwise not have.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

Basically Philippe is uptight and locked within himself mentally almost as much as physically, while Driss is carefree and very different from those in Philippe's world. Will the odd-couple become friends and perhaps benefit one another's lives somehow? Well, only time (and the genre) will tell. Of course this is pretty much what happens but you know this from the odd-couple comedy/drama feel that it has from the getgo and it is fairly shameless about doing it. There isn't really a depth to the film but rather a superficial but entertaining pace and plot. It feels cynical for the most part but yet somehow it works if you can get through some cringe-inducing ""heart-warming"" moments. A big part of it working is plain and simply the two actors in the lead roles. Neither gives a brilliant performance individually but together they have real chemistry and their banter and shared moments do have a certain genuine and intimate feel that is all down to the delivery.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

837,9.0,12 December 2023,"The Intouchables is a wonderfully heartwarming film that is genuinely touching and exudes endless warmth. Crafted with affection and narrated sensibly, it is an outstandingly performed cinema that celebrates life, love, and laughter. This exquisite blend of drama and comedy is a celebration of the little joys and pleasures that surround us at all times, provided we care to look from a different perspective.

Every interaction, conversation, and action contributes to further strengthening the bonds between the characters. Its lighthearted, precisely balanced, and carefully handled humor is a highlight in itself. The warm color tones, smooth camerawork, and lavish set pieces greatly enhance the film's look and feel. Its 113 minutes of runtime are elegantly paced, and its mesmerizing score uplifts the whole experience.

The Intouchables is steered by phenomenal performances from François Cluzet and Omar Sy, while the rest of the cast does well in their supporting roles. Cluzet is as convincing as Philippe and expresses a wide range of emotions despite keeping most of his body at rest. Sy is even better than Driss and steals every moment with impeccable input, for he's the heart and soul of this feature. However, the best of all is the remarkable chemistry these two actors share, which is truly flawless in every sense of the word.

On an overall scale, The Intouchables is an intimately human drama and an unexpectedly hilarious comedy. It treats its sensitive subject matter with utmost care and tenderness. It's about simple gestures that go a long way in making a helpless person feel worthy again. It's about the realization that sometimes you've to see things from a different paradigm to realize what you've been missing all along. And that even the most unlikely people can turn your life around. Guaranteed to keep its viewers smiling from beginning to end, The Intouchables is both incredibly uplifting and extremely rewarding in every sense of the word.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

In general the movie makes you have a great time with comical resources that go with the movie, unlike other movies that are ridicule when they are comical. Such an inspiring story that teaches you that enjoying life is the best thing we can do. I really recommend this film which can turn your mood up, because of it's awesome soundtrack which includes various songs of Earth Wind and Fire.

844,9.0,7 October 2014,"Normally when I'm watching a foreign film with subtitles, it can be distracting. With The Intouchables, you never once even realize it has subtitles. It's by far one of the most charming films I have ever seen. The chemistry between Cluzet and Sy is incredible. It is hard to even come up with an issue with the film from top to bottom.

It tells the story of an ex-con upbeat young man who is hired by a quadriplegic to be his caretaker and the bond they build over time. They both learn life lessons from each other but most of all they both enjoy life for what it is. Cluzet brings so much joy to a character who is in an unbearable situation. Sy learns to love the little things in life while developing a special bond with Cluzet and the rest of his aristocratic family. I do wish they showed a bit about how Sy rekindled his own family relationship or just stayed true to the real life story. I don't know exactly to what extent this film is fiction but that seemed to be the big complaint among critics.

For me, it doesn't need to be a history lesson. A film is suppose to move you emotionally. Whether it's a comedy, thriller, or drama a film is to entertain. So I enjoyed the film for what it is, and that's a feel good film. The performances, music, and directing are all great and it's just a well made film. Omar Sy gives an incredible award worthy performance and Cluzet compliments him perfectly.

I almost shut the movie off after learning it was only in English subtitles but something compelled me to stay and watch. I am so glad I did. Fast forward to present day. I tried to get my family who is NOT a fan of foreign films to watch this flick and finally they gave in. They enjoyed it as much as I did the first time. This movie is brilliant. I've watched other foreign films and I can't say I am too pleased. However this film combines classic comedy that all generations will enjoy along with the feel good part of a drama we all long for. The film is based on a true story which makes it all the better. This film truly is a gem. It's a diamond in the rough. Often looked over and passed by this film is a movie not to miss.

The film is based on the events that took place and as they say:
There is no better screenwriter than life, and it's better not to come up with.


The directorial duo were able to tell this incredible story right.

Two lives which does not cover each other in any way.

In the film, we see how completely different worlds are mixed into one life for two.

The incredible story of the immigrant thief Driss and the wealthy disabled Philip.

Injured in an accident, Philip hires Driss, the man who is the least suitable for this role. As the story progresses, Phillip begins to feel the magic of life again thanks to Driss and his antics.

The film is strong and the directors deserve a special word, they were able to freely and openly present the difficult issues of our society.

And thanks to this, the key motives and morals of this picture are clear to everyone, and therefore this film is watched in one breath.

The actors seemed to have experienced this life and perfectly conveyed the emotional component of this picture.

Everyone who worked on the creation of this picture coped with the task.

They took the strongest themes and fates of people, mixed them up and didn't make a mess.

Perfect combination of actors , strong motivational themes .

In conclusion, I want to say that this film is on my personal top list.

The film turned out to be of high quality, beautiful and positive. He exudes goodness and love.

This film shows that no matter the background, no matter the limitations, a friendship so extraordinary can form in the most difficult of circumstances.

This movie was an adaptation of the autobiographic tale of one of the writers; "" Le second souffle "" of Philippe Pozzo Di Borgo. It was promoted under the quote: ' Sometimes you have to reach into someone's else's world to find what's missing in your own', it gives a good introduction.

François CLUZET's and Omar SY's performance was a huge plus, it had a stellar cast that's best way to describe it. François played the role of a man who had a paragliding accident and become a quadriplegic, who hires a young man -Omar- to be his caregiver.

Most biography movies are documentaries while Untouchable is a drama-comedy movie. Despite the large amount of goofs in it and it poor production creativity, the film has such great scenario including tiny details about the characters life and background, as well as acts reflecting their personalities. All the previous, makes this film have a balanced features to be an amazing movie.

Couple of scenes are hilarious in the movie. The scene where Driss dances to his own tune on Philippe birthday party , the scene where Driss warns Bastein to stay away from Philippe's daughter are just like icing on the cake. Even the emotional scenes have shot so well coupled with beautiful background score. Coming to the performances , I was totally floored by Omar Sy's gallant performance. He makes the film alive the moment he steps in the scene. His care-free , straight from the heart , funny-loving character will stay with you even after leaving the theater for sometime.

The characters are rich and deep, benefiting from there being so few of them and tell a fantastic and emotional story.

The plot is not particularly deep or fast paced, but with characters and a story as powerful as this, it needn't be.

It is outstanding on all levels. The script is written beautifully, and it flows very well. It's funny, touching and inspirational. Despite its hard subject, it succeeded in making a good balance between emotional and comic timing.

The two leads' performance is spontaneous especially Omar Sy who is really humorous depending not on grabing jokes, but casual comic situations to draw a smile on your face.

The only reason I didn't give it 10/10 because there are some jokes, or say scenes that dragged a little bit. I find that it would have been better if those scenes were shorter as comedy needs to be impulsive.

I'd like to thank les détesteurs for validating the purpose of this site. ""High Concept"" doesn't automatically mean ""this movie sucks,"" it just seems that way because we've been served dreck. So we think looking to Europe, particularly France, led by les détesteurs and expecting to be served ""high art"" will replace those IQ points lost by domestic offerings. The real snobs are the ones who scoff at France revealing her quotidian side- you know, the masses that in actuality pay to see the high concept dreck that we serve them. Now, is that juste? Is thatAmerican?

It was an Englishman that coined the phrase ""imitation is the sincerest form of flattery; we were not ashamed to flatter him or his country by imitating (appropriating) their language. I suggest we allow ourselves to be flattered at their appropriation of our culture. Refusing would only further confirm their suspicions of how uptight we are, beginning with the R rating.

The story concerns a stereotypical white guy: uptight, hyper-rich, insufferable man of privilege who happens to be a paraplegic (François Cluzet). As is normal in such a circumstance, he requires constant care. The movie begins with him interviewing prospects, note to les détesteurs: He's does not attend a slave auction. Among the candidates is a stereotypical black guy: tall, muscular, bald, lives in the projects, in trouble with the law, ill at ease with the finer things in life (Omar Sy). Détesteurs: Did you notice that he's really black, like ""direct from Africa black?"" Your casting's way off.

If you can't suss out the story from here, you probably haven't seen ""Trading Places,"" ""Driving Miss Daisy,"" ""48 Hours,"" etc. Those were all good, entertaining movies based on the same ""cliché."" The critics' log line would be ""Black Man helps White Man become Better Person.""

However, I would bet that you won't be able to predict everything- it is indeed a French movie so some ambiguity is required. For those with psychic cinematic gifts who do guess everything, so what? Predictability is not a bad thing; being predictably bad is a bad thing. The movies mentioned in the previous paragraph were all both predictable and enjoyable.

Instead of calling Omar Sy's character an ""Uncle Tom"" ensuring a Google legacy forever linking him with that slur, wouldn't it be great if instead, this film launched him as an international superstar? It's certainly time for a new face, especially a non-white, non-Anglo one. While I think Jean Dujardin will have a successful international career, I don't think Jamel Debouzze or Gad Elmelah (two established comedic stars in France trying to cross over) have the same comic talent or charisma, and his English is better. Before I rest my case, let me remind you of the most recent Francophone superstar: Jean Claude Van Damme.

Finally, I would like to explain the cryptic title. François Cluzot has been a critically acclaimed actor for many years and hopefully is recognizable to French movie fans. Omar Sy became famous in France on sketch comedy TV shows, like his compatriot, first-ever-French Best Actor Oscar winner Jean Dujardin.

But, the real star of this movie is us, the U.S., the United States. Not our bi-racial kumbaya movies. Not our appropriated high concepts and clichés.

The element(s) that bonds these two men is music, a specific genre of music born in America from an American group that epitomizes that genre like no other and eradicates any overtones of racism.

The recent tragic deaths of two of Disco's greatest artists, Donna Summer and Robin Gibb, retrained my perspective. Anyone who was lucky enough to be alive when Disco dominated everything also remembers the death knells that chimed deafeningly as it was killing itself through overexposure. For a brief time, admitting you liked it was an invitation for ridicule.

Now, let me ask: have you ever, let alone recently, been to a wedding, a bar mitzvah, a club where anyone requested Quarterflash, The Alan Parsons Project, or The Little River Band? It was they who vanquished Disco.

As we all know, Disco didn't die. Its call to dance has always been an affirmation of life.

So, for a life-affirming, feel good movie, it's only right to credit Disco as the true star.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

893,4.66,10 February 2015,"This is funny and touching, about a rich disabled man in his château and his rowdy new caretaker from the projects. But where we'd expect pity and self-pity, we get one man hanging out with another, teasing like he would any friend, sharing a spliff. The real compassion of friendship as antidote. Instead of treating an incapacity, nurturing a capacity. Not just dutifully picking up and massaging a broken body that can't be made whole again, but doing these for a mind that can.

The film is rife with pairs of dual opposites - rich and poor, cultured and not, genuine and not, mind and body, etiquette and humor, duty and bond, thinking and doing. Simple, stacking opposites so that the modern mind stuck behind a facade of disappointing conventions from how to treat a patient to courting love will be freed by messy, spontaneous action. It recasts Zorba where the overthinking intellectual learns a deeper wisdom from his employee's unfettered love for life.

No less wistful in the end about redemption than a lachrymose Oscar film on the subject, neat as inspirational films go, whole - but this is deeper about a response to suffering and view that looks past it rather than just shedding beautiful tears before a deadend wall, I always welcome the former.

And how's this for a French postcolonial view? The white and black French in stereotyped symbiosis of mutual dependence, the first as a gentle intellect perched ontop of a dessicated body, surrounded with artifice and etiquette that fail to sooth, the latter injecting him with goofy new vigor for life. But of course to be stuck behind this intellectual cynicism that sees master and servant, to dismiss the film on grounds such as these, would be only more of that ailing Western mind in desperate need to be invigorated with a film just like this.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

895,4.66,25 December 2022,"The titular characters are what make the movie. The visible chemistry of their friendship despite their sociocultural and intellectual differences is simply lovely.

The ""légérété"" with which the film progresses is so quintessential French.

Furthermore, the multiple thoughtful messages of this movie-tolerance towards the incapacitated, not trying to be reduced to a social background- are also notable as they are laudable.

I just think it's marvelous that we live in a time where we can provide extensively to people with serious disabilities. Humanity still is befallen with imperfections, but it's trying.

The recurring piano theme is beautiful. Especially it's use at the end is striking.

All in all, this is another testimony of French cinemas timeless place in the world.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

""Intouchables"" is a really touching and inspirational story. I really like the fact that both Philippe and Driss are so wildly different from each other, but yet they can complement each other and make each other grow. Philippe is cultured but reserved, while Driss is playful and hedonistic. I like the scenes where Philippe is selling the painting by Driss, the scene in the opera and the final scene. They complement each other so well, and they both treasure each other's friendship. It's a beautiful tale of mutual inspiration. I love it.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

899,4.66,19 January 2022,"""1+1"" is a movie that I watched at a very young age. And then it seemed to me that this was just a film about friendship, but recently, reviewing this picture, I noticed how simple things can make us happy. We often monitor our problems without paying attention to others.

The film shows us, as if from the outside, what difficulties there are in life and that you always need to have a reliable friend behind you.

The film is very fascinating, there are a lot of funny moments, I would call this film a family one, since it is very kind and carries a moral

I rated the film 8 out of 10

900,4.66,23 June 2024,"After he becomes a quadriplegic from a paragliding accident, an aristocrat hires a young man from the projects to be his caregiver. Sy and Cluzet give their parts more conviction than they deserve, but their energies can't revive a corpse this dead, this corny, this calculating , this condescending and this commercial, a kinda wishful drama about the friendship between a rich, white quadriplegic and a penurious black job-seeker. Scripters Toledano and Nakache delivered an offensve film. The moments when they are together fill us with inauthentic feeling-good sentiments. Not a must-see picture.","November 2, 2011 (France)"

902,4.66,14 August 2013,"""Pragmatic"" is the way Griss, an ex-convict from Parisian projects hired by super rich paraplegic Phillipe, as a caregiver describes himself and for me that one word captures the essence of the whole movie. Trough his eyes we see our world in a new and fresh way which is actually - a simple, pragmatic, ""tell it how it is"" narrative. The movie is a delightful version of the old fable about The Stranger who comes to a new place and shows everyone how things really are, not the way people are told them to be. Sort of Polyanna story but here it is not a girl feeding you saccharine but street smart immigrant from Senegal who tells us some unpleasant truths and delivers them as super funny commentaries on some of follies of modern Western society. What are those ""discoveries"" that Griss helps us to see? Perhaps being a disabled person is hard but certainly it is better to be a rich disabled person than a poor one. Maybe the best way to act towards socially superior is to behave as there are no differences at all instead of our usual docility which only gives more power to already powerful. And perhaps some modern art is really nothing more than overpriced crap where experts have integrity of used car salesmen who cheat confused public. And be honest - deep down we prefer pop to classical music but would not admit it because we don't want to be perceived as uncouth. And look closely when movie pokes fun at the way we are taught to apply for a job according to scripted, nailed into our heads set of questions and prepared answers. Griss with his honest chutzpah makes all other identical applicants look like a bunch of robots and phonies. Although telling truth all the time could be problematic but telling politically correct lies all the time so we all feel nice and comfy can leave Western people not well prepared for setbacks. Phillipe knows that very well when he hires Griss. Though money can buy the whole crew of helpers, he needs something more than advanced but somewhat mechanical care to live a full life. He needs somebody to treat him honestly. Pragmatically.","November 2, 2011 (France)"
