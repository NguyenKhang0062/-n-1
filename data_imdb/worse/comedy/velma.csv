1.0,"Jan 13, 2023","They need to remove the comedy tag. Seriously, in no way shape or form could this be considered a comedy.

Imagine taking a kids show and turning it into a disgusting college frat house drama where everyone is a bully and vomiting for laughs. This might be the most hate filled re-interpretation of a cartoon I've ever seen.

The people who created this show obviously have an agenda here. Are they really going for 100% rage views? Is destroying an established franchise going to get them into some secret Hollywood club? Do the creators have some kind of personal vendetta against Scooby-Doo from their childhood? I really don't get it."
1.0,"Jan 12, 2023","This was atrocious. I watched the entire first episode and did not laugh once. Not even a chuckle. The jokes were so juvenile, so heavy handed and the premise so far removed from the original IP, it was embarrasing. I was checking my watch throughout the episode. They made 27 minutes feel like an hour. Will she ever find her mom? I do not know, nor do I care. Why is this series about sex and what does any of the random sexual situations have to do with Scooby Doo? I also don't know, nor care. Speaking of which, where is Scooby and Shaggy? Shouldn't they be a part of this too? If the one kid is supposed to be Shaggy, I only assume because of his clothes, then I would like nothing to do with this alternate universe version of Scooby Doo. Personally, I feel like HBO and Mindy Kaling owe everyone and apology for this abomination of a series.

1.0,"Jan 18, 2023","I heard how bad this was so had to see for myself.

I was expecting to be laughing at how atrocious it was but it's not even bad enough to laugh at, like some terrible shows and movies. This was just so bad it was hard to believe what I was watching. My mouth was open in astonishment at how revolting it was.

How the hell did this get made? It's abysmal on every level. It's not even a train wreck. A train is on it's way performing its duty before it crashes. This train never left the construction yard. Shame the idea did.

The jokes aren't funny. It's not cool. It's not hip. It's the opposite. It's majorly offensive. Offensive for two reasons.

One for how terrible it is and it is really bottom of the barrel terrible, and two for it's obvious sexism and racism. What an absolute insult, really, to anyone with half a shred of respectability. I'm just staggered that this even exists.

And to have it based on a CHILDREN'S decades long loved series is just mind blowing. It's wrong.

Shame on the execs who passed this giant steaming turd. Every single person involved with green lighting and creating this 'show' deserves to never work again.

One of the worst programs ever made. Without exaggeration."
1.0,"Jan 12, 2023","I'll preface this review by saying I have no problems with adult humor, or with a family friendly franchise being reimagined to include such. Nor am I outraged by the diverse casting. I approached Velma with an open mind, and it's just not good.

Like another HBO Max show, Harley Quinn, Velma is full of edgy and fourth wall breaking humor. Unlike that show, Velma seemingly holds nothing but contempt for its source material. Not one character behaves anything like you'd expect, and none of them are enjoyable to watch. Daphne is vapid and mean, Fred is a rich douchebag, and Shaggy is a bore. Velma herself comes across as Mindy Kaling's self-insert Scooby Doo fanfic character. She is the coolest, smartest, and funniest person in the room at any given time and multiple characters want to have sex with her. Everyone else is a loser. It's more sad than it is funny."
1.0,"Jan 12, 2023","This show HATES its audience. It should not have been named Velma. Even the dubbing is odd. Glenn Howerton basically plays Dennis from IASIP as usual but in Fred's body. Daphne is crass, mean and vulgar and Velma is Mindy Kailing.

I don't understand why this is what we get when attempting something adult with the Scooby Doo IP. No one asked for this. The hate is warranted - it's an acceptable, albeit unfunny animation show that thinks it's a lot better than it is.

This was my main issue with the first two episodes: you can tell the writer's room was comprised of mostly ""yes"" people who thought every idea was edgy and current. Instead the finished product resulted in a convoluted, mean-spirited and just all around embarrassing start."
1.0,"Jan 19, 2023","When you see reviews about a TV Show, usually there are two extremes. One side loves the show for its biases, and the other hates it. This is a rare occasion where the general audience opinion comes together and the majority is united in agreeing that this show is truly the lowest tier in almost every way possible.

Poorly written dialogues, inconsistent animation, and some of the saddest attempts at humor since Transylmania.

This show is only capable of satisfying a tiny group of people, which consists of the writers and kids with an underdeveloped sense of life that is solely based on Social Media. This show proves that we truly do need a 0 rating in IMDB, a new low in modern media."
1.0,"Jan 12, 2023","This show is one of the worst things I've ever seen, and I would give it 0 stars if I could. I can't believe how poorly written this show is, how mean-spirited it is and how much contempt it has for its source material. It's not like it resonates with people because of the themes of teamwork, or found family, or about how different people with different personalities and goals and outlooks on life can be friends and love each other.

No, we have to character assassinate everyone, especially Fred and have everyone talk in petty, tired and divisive cliches. There's no word for it other than cringe. I am so sick and tired of these types of shows. At least they're keeping Scooby himself out of his this garbage.

Off to palette cleanse with the original show."
1.0,"Jan 14, 2023","This show literally insults you. I've never known a show to actively try and make you hate it, this is abominable and one of the worst things I've ever seen, I can't stand it. It feels like a straight up slap in the face and I cannot stress this enough, it doesn't even have SCOOBY-DOO in it, what in the everloving God? I have no clue how this got greenlit and the okay from the higher-ups because I'd rather get hemorrhoids than watch anymore of this. It's mentally tiring and I've never sighed from disappointment more than I have while watching this poor excuse for a show... Cancel this, please."
1.0,"Jan 14, 2023","Writing sucks, jokes don't land, doesn't feel like scooby doo at all.

More like they wrote a show and put scooby doo characters over their own characters.

This is the type of show you start watching and you literally can't bring yourself to finish it because it hurts to watch, even if it wasn't scooby doo related it'd still be awful.

The humor is like I'm watching family guy or big mouth, but instead of there being a joke, it's literally just a pop culture reference with no ""funny"" attached to it.

If shows were to be represented with cereal, this show would definitely be a bowl of wheat with no milk. No flavor, no comedy, nothing.

Honestly I'd actually rather eat a bowl of wheat instead of watch this."
1.0,"Jan 15, 2023",It needs to be canceled Immediately and whoever approved this needs be fired it isn't funny It's cringe and offensive it has nothing to do with Scooby-Doo and it is destroying any versions of the velma character it is way to snarky and I don't see how anyone can find it entertaining what is wrong with HBO I'm tempted to cancel my subscription because I don't want to associate myself with people who put out crap like this I hope it backfires and blows up in your face also whoever finds this show entertaining needs to check their own morals Please do better Warner Brothes and put out better shows like Johnny Bravo.
8.0,"Jan 12, 2023","I've been enjoying this new take on Velma and the gang. It looks straight on at all the very well known stereotypes that everyone always associates with this show. Ascot wearing, Ken doll looking, Fred, is exactly who we all thought he might be. Daphne, fits the bill in her role as pretty girl this time with an edge. It's a cartoon aimed at adults about kids in high school, weird things happen and everyone is confused about sex and life and then a lot of murders happen. It's humor is along the lines of South Park or Beevis and Butthead, somewhat ridiculous, a little bit shocking. It's funny, it's unique and it's not the same old Scooby Doo!"
7.0,"Jan 29, 2023",I thought it was hilarious. It's like the most inappropriate version of Scooby. It's not good but it's not terrible. It's just sorta weird. When you're tired and you need to de-stress then it's hilarious. That's the best way to describe it. It's nothing like the original show. I'm not even sure they're solving a mystery lol laughing but serious! Loads of profanity and sexual situations. It would be funnier if the focused on the terrible cop characters and the mystery. But they are trying to make statements about gender roles and beauty expectations but these messages don't belong here. No one should take this show seriously but it's not terrible.
1.0,"Jan 28, 2023","You know when someone thinks they are being really funny, when instead they are just being kind of rude and hateful? That would be this show. It felt more like an edgy YouTube spoof from the early 2000s than an actual show. You really didn't need to mess with such a great, wholesome and generation spanning IP. People are hateful and will review bomb movies and shows because they disagree with the politics or idea of the show. I figured that would be the case, but please know that these reviews are accurate. This show is truly insulting to its audience, the original creators and actors of these characters, and human decency in general."
1.0,"Jan 14, 2023","I'll say this: the collection of voice actors they hired for this show is probably the best thing that show has going for it. The ""comedy"" is...it's just simply awful. Kaling turned a beloved character into a college course on how not to write characters or a show. I forced my way through episode one (really wanted to give this an honest review) but I won't be returning for episode 2...or possibly anything else produced by Kaling (or for that matter Grandy and/or Sekar it seems). Why did they try so hard to destroy the source material? I get that Scooby isn't in it so it was supposed to be its own thing but it almost seems...mean? Like they made it while angry at fans of the original? This one just sailed over the goal. Oh well. HBO Max is more like HBO Minimum now I guess..."
2.0,"Jan 15, 2023",This show is obviously trying to be the next Harley Quinn not realizing what made that show good . Harley Quinn writers unlike the writers of this show respected the dc lore and the characters still felt like their comic counterparts . I have nothing against Mindy Kalling . She was funny in the office . But she was miscast as Velma . This show is just a generic mystery show with Scooby Doo Character names being used . Did they seriously think this wouldn't flop . You can't do the mystery inc gang without Scooby . The original show wouldn't have become so big if it was just a group of kids solving mysteries . Seriously they couldn't figure away to include scooby . If you want a darker Scooby Doo watch Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated Instead . That's a much better show with good character development and overarching plots . All they had to was do something similar to Mystery Incorporated . This is just bad and they changed the ethnicity of Velma and Shaggy for sake of representation . I'm a brown guy and have nothing against representation but I would have rather they have made new characters instead of changing existing characters.
1.0,"Jan 12, 2023","Just saw Velma show up as a new show and I went into watching the first episode with no spoilers or expectations. It was both disappointing and a huge waste of time. I get that they're going for raunchy comedy, a spin on the original series isn't a bad idea but this was so poorly executed. The writing was absolutely effortless and unfunny.

The idea of a show with Velma as the focal point is great, the idea of recreating scooby-doo to be for a more mature audience is great, and this is wasted potential. I just don't understand who could both write and then ""ok"" this and believe it was good content.

Just really disappointing and shouldn't be associated with the scooby-doo franchise whatsoever."
1.0,"Jan 12, 2023","YES... 1 star means that it's a thing. I mean a lot of people worked (not very hard) on the project so it deserves at least 1 star. But why only 1 star?

Let's start with visuals, it seems at times that the artists didn't have enough time to make enough frames, this not only resulted in boring or overly generic backdrops but the character animations seem jittery at times.

Audio- the audio quality is weird. It's almost like the characters didn't record their conversations together so the quality between characters in the same scene having the same conversation have 2 different audio qualities to listen to... imagine listening to 2 people talk in a room and one persons voice is unnaturally crystal clear and the other sounds like they have several layers of napkins infront of their mouth.

Characters: it seems like someone wrote a spoof of each character but was allowed to keep the names. It's like using the Venture Brothers characters but releasing the show as ""Johnny quest 2023""

Dialogue: this show really needs laugh tracks... because nothing they say/do is remotely funny. I feel like we need an audio queue to know when a joke bombed.

Plot: well the first episode did a great job of assuming you should know what's going on without really going into detail of what is actually happening.

I am glad I survived the first episode, I don't know if I'll make it through the 2nd."
1.0,"Jan 12, 2023","First thing first: I don't care about the race swaps, or the LGBTQ content added in, and I am actually all for an adult take on Scooby Doo. I also don't care when people take liberties with the source material = an ""original"" adaptation never ruins the source material, if anything, it just makes you appreciate the original more.

Now that that is out of the way: I could tell from the trailer that this probably wasn't going to be for me, but my curiosity got the better of me, and believing that you should let the art stand on it's own merits, I feel that this art deserves to stand on top of a raging dumpster fire.

Without giving away any spoilers, all the characters are completely unlikable. Fred is defined almost solely by his white privilege, Daphne is the typical hot dumb girl, and Velma is the angry awkward girl who ""knows"" she is better everyone. ""Norville"" is probably the only character I don't hate, but he isn't Shaggy. This is not Scooby Doo and the Mystery Gang. Its Mindy Kaling in animated cosplay still being Mindy Kaling. I'm sure some people who are fans of hers will find some enjoyment out of this, but it ain't for me."
1.0,"Jan 14, 2023","And no, I am not at all exaggerating for the sake of getting attention from the reader here. I have seen virtually every iteration of Scooby-Doo, and experienced its highs and its lows as a franchise, and this is an all-time low. A complete misunderstanding of the property, terrible writing, horrid characterization, and a sense of humor which is so cynical you feel it is giving you the middle finger every minute.

This is a series I honestly cannot see really appealing to anyone. There is nothing for a fan of the property, there is nothing for the average member of the audience who just wants to laugh, there is not even anything for very progressive viewers who just need to see social justice on screen to scream ""yaas queen, slay!""

BEWARE. See at your own risk."
1.0,"Jan 12, 2023","It's a paradoy. It's adult comedy.

This is not the kiddie show. Try not to overthink it.

I was hooked at the first episode. In fact, I laughed so hard I fell off the couch. But, I also have a messed up sense of humor. I can take crass behavior. I knew right away what it would be given the cast:

Glenn Howerton: it's always sunny Melissa Funero: Brooklyn nine nine Wanda Sykes: no intro needed Jane Lynch: no intro needed Sam Richardson: Detroiters

It's kind of a given that this is not a regular scooby kiddy show. Think.

If you can handle adult humor, go for it. If you want the same ole, go watch reruns. This is hilarious."
8.0,"Jan 16, 2023","Is it Archer? No. But it's not so terrible people have to flock to give it a 1 star. I feel like 1 star means you haven't really seen what bad is. Have you seen She Devil? There's enough humor for a chuckle here and there, and enough self awareness to get some meta jokes in. I guess if you are looking for formulaic episodes where you hear the same jokes and the same outcome every time, then ... watch the original Scooby Doo? It's a new take on a character and it won't be everyone's bag, but it will work for enough people to finish out the season, possibly even have a second season. Giving it a try will not leave you scarred for life - an episode or two is worth the time spent."
7.0,"Jan 16, 2023","This series is one of the worst things I have ever seen in my life. I literally prefer to be blind and deaf than to have to watch and hear this big pile of horse crap. I cannot believe that they ruined HBO Max and they cancelled several good productions like ""Looney Tunes: Bye bye Bunny"" and The Porky and Daffy sci-fi comedy film, that could have been masterpieces, wonderful shows like Close Enough that was really enjoyable or Infinity Train. Some potential good shows wont probably be released anytime soon if at all, I am talking about series like The Flintstones sequel named ""Bedrock"", ""Tooned-Out"" or ""Tiny Toons Loonyversity."" All of these good series being cancelled for this garbage? Seriously? The characters have nothing to do with the original characters from the Scooby Doo franchise and the series is horrible, lame characters, stupid plot and no humor.

This crap is even worse than the Scrappy Doo era cartoons, when Scrappy Doo, one of the worst cartoon characters ever made, slowly replaced Daphne, Velma and Fred from the Scooby Doo series. Why they had to ruin HBO Max like that? This streaming platform could have had a lot of animated gems right now, but they ruined everything. Good Job, HBO Max! I think I will cancel my subscription pretty soon."
1.0,"Jan 26, 2023","This was just dull, I watched both episodes and I felt like I lost brain cells while watching this. If you want some silly comedies watch something like Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo that's actually funny. Just don't waste your time on this. It tries to be edgy without any decency and/or class. I wish for those minutes of my life back please. No? I guess not. I'm never watching this again, I'm staying away from this like it's the plague. Also I'll say this up front the writing is atrocious!! It was extremely stiff and forced in some areas in my opinion, especially from Velma herself. It was just dull, that's final."
1.0,"Jan 21, 2023","I really don't know what they were trying to do with this show. Maybe if this had been an original show of its own it would be easier to sit through. I had to force myself to keep watching, and that was in the hopes that the writing would get better. I should have stopped after the first two minutes. These are not the characters we grew up loving. They've completely changed the characteristics of every character. They don't act like themselves, and the things that stay true to character make them all unlikable and obnoxious. I can't see any fan of Scooby Doo watching this show, and it clearly isn't geared towards the younger generation with the mature rating. So, who were they hoping would watch it? Who is the audience? Who would want this?

Bottom line...horribly written, brutally destroys the established characters' personalities, and it has no place in the Scooby Doo realm. Take away Velma and the Scooby ties and maybe...by some very slim chance...it would work as an original show."
1.0,"Jan 15, 2023","I like raceswaps, I enjoy dirty jokes, and a good meta reference is my cup of tea. This show on the other hand is a try-hard fast paced minigun of pop culture references. It's one of many shows that see a beloved media franchise and decide they can do some edgy up to date self-referential humor that completely glosses over the heart of the original. Some people like that. I feel like it's dissing the original show, instead of growing on the lore and tone that's always been what drew me to it. I love Scooby Doo. My favorite flavor of Scooby Doo is, for reference, Zombie Island and the Witches Ghost. That was prime era Scooby. If you're bored by that seriousness, and the exploration of the characters, and wanna watch cockroaches do the nasty while naked teen girls chitter about how funny it is movies have naked girls to hook audiences? Then sure, this is probably for you. Many of the jokes go on too long trying to make themselves funny. The characters are themselves wildly unlikable. Some of the character designs are neat, but they feel like someone decided to use the Scooby Doo characters as a references for an entirely different set of brand new completely original characters (do not steal). It's the kind of show you watch to have something in the background and completely forget about by the time you're done because it has nothing to keep you caring about it. Just a bunch of slapstick and dirty jokes that disappear into the hazy memory of similar shows like this. It's a shame, really, HBO cancelled so many good shows for something like... this."
1.0,"Jan 14, 2023","This show is one of the worst things I've ever seen, and I would give it 0 stars if I could.

1.0,"Jan 15, 2023","I read an article slamming this show, deeming it one of the worst of all time, I couldn't see how it could be possible.....the article was spot on, this genuinely is the worst thing I have ever sat through.

Was it supposed to be funny, the jokes were excruciating, this was about as funny as a chest infection. I can't imagine adults or children liking it, the content is just so strange, unpleasant, not in the slightest bit funny.

An absolute insult to fans of lovers and Scooby-Doo, all this was about, was pushing the dreaded agenda, even the likes of Scooby-Doo, the most wonderful, well meaning loved show, adored the whole world over, even that wasn't safe.

My memory of the show won't change, despite efforts here to trash the characters, why make Freddie and Daphne so awful, did they need to be, but of course Velma is glowingly marvellous. Nobody feels right, it can't possibly be linked to the original.

I sat through one episode, I won't waste any time on another.

0/10."
1.0,"Jan 12, 2023","Really surprised how such a great group of people could turn out such terrible a show. The characters were boring and unlikable. The ""jokes"" range between meta wink and a nudge to just lame dirty humor. Which really makes me question what the actual demographic is. Too mundane for teenagers, yet too dumb for adults. The episode was just a chore to get through, once every few minutes I was compelled to pull out my phone from sheer boredom. Lastly and I think the sin that everyone knows. Scooby... How do you have the gall to make a Scooby Doo reboot and not have the talking dog? He wouldn't have saved the show but at least he might get a laugh."
1.0,"Jan 14, 2023","The writing is so bad, I can't tell if the ""like every comedian before #MeToo"" line is supposed to be ironic or genuine. The very idea of Scooby-Doo characters discussing sexual assault is as ill-advised and tone-deaf as when it happened in the Family Guy/Simpsons crossover.

Also I have yet to see a single justification for why the new character isn't just Shaggy, although considering how the other characters are written, maybe it's for the best that he was left out. It's not like he'd in any way resemble any previous iteration of Shaggy. Same goes for Scooby-Doo as well. Some out-of-touch greaseball in a leather office looked up from his piles of money and said ""Nah cartoon animals are kiddie stuff, adults can't relate to talking dogs!""

With every project Mindy Kaling launches, her own personal issues become more and more prominent, leading to the most embarrassingly mean-spirited jokes I've ever seen in such a beloved franchise.

Don't even hate-watch this, Warner Bros. Needs to learn their lesson."
1.0,"Jan 19, 2023","The people who got paid actual money to produce this must surely be truly ashamed of themselves. It's mean, it's nasty, it's offensive, and it's just terribly made.

The original Scooby Doo had a wholesome message about a group of friends from different backgrounds learning to work together to overcome challenges, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, and the mystery could never be solved without working together. Velma, conversely, is the perfect hero and everyone else just orbits around her in stark inferiority. She presents no values and the show repeatedly emphasizes superficial characteristics. It embodies every negative stereotype and cliché of the modern remake, exuding pure bitterness and hatred.

HBO once commissioned some of the best TV entertainment available, with actual talented writers and producers, and yet someone at HBO actually made the decision to release this utter puddle of steaming diarrhea."
8.0,"Jan 13, 2023","If you actually accept it for what it is, a comedic and satirical adaptation of a nostalgic show for adults, it's actually funny. It's clearly making fun of itself, as well as absurd stereotypes. Like all the references to the fan theories spread over the years about the scooby-do characters. Such as ""is Velma gay""?

It's just a funny origin story about how all of these very different mis-matched characters formed a detective group. And includes some great comedic actors in the cast. If you go in to it thinking it's just a newly animated scooby-do like the remakes in the past, then I can see how you may be disappointed. But if you come in open minded and willing to laugh at absurdity, it's a good show."
7.0,"Jan 15, 2023","Saw the rating for this show and was perplexed why it was so low. We've been watching it and enjoying it quite a bit. It's snarky, funny and completely inappropriate for the younger crowd, but adults are the target audience. Is it anything like other scooby doo shows? Not at all. The trailers give you a good idea what you're going to see.

Velma, Daphne and Fred are nothing like their typical characters and that is quite alright.

The adult characters are interesting in their own right. Daphne's moms are cool. Horrible police officers but cool. Velma's Dad is a little pathetic but not unlike a lot of dads out there with a you her wife and new baby.

Don't let the low rating scare you away if the trailer piques your interest."
1.0,"Jan 16, 2023","Scooby Doo is one of my favorite cartoons of all time and to see Velma and the other characters ruined and changed like this almost ruined my childhood tv cartoon memories!! I love Scooby Doo and there's NO need for a ""grown up"" version of these characters!!!! Not sure what need there is to try change or make different versions of these characters that were fine to begin with because it was a cartoon show for kids who like the horror/mystery aspect of it, nothing more!!!!!!! If Hollywood feels there's a need for characters like these then create a new show and not this garbage!!!!! Please listen to us viewers and please leave these characters alone!!!!!!!!!"
1.0,"Jan 31, 2023","How do I put the awfulness of this show into 600 characters? It's impossible! I'm gonna have to fluff it up a bit. Well.....The Scooby Doo gang is stupid. The story is stupid. The writing is stupid. Pretty much everything about the show is stupid. How did anyone come up with this re-work? The ultimate question is who actually thought this was a good idea? Who asked for such show?

In the meantime, in some alternate and diverse area of the galaxy, about a thousand light years away, there is an alien culture intercepting the transmission of this show and are planning to annihilate us all. Sure, it'll take about a thousand years, and I know I just ripped off this premise from Futurama, but we would all die....deservedly."
1.0,"Jan 28, 2023","Deadpool did it amazingly. Saints Row does it well. Being meta is a talent. A superpower only being able to be used by the best of actors and media. Velma (2023) tries... and fails so miserably! It's not funny when every five seconds there's some reference to a movie or movie tropes, but the characters continue to be the most idiotic when it comes to the mysteries. I honestly forgot what the first episode was about halfway through because the show was too busy shoveling jokes about ""in a TV show, the pilot..."" etc. I truly believe that this voice cast could do so much better if they legitimately just focused on making it a Scooby-Doo show."
1.0,"Jan 14, 2023","Perhaps the worst version of any Scooby made, and yes, I have seen ""the 13 Ghosts of Scooby"". The characters do not resemble the standard gang at all, save for names. No Scooby. The group dynamic is gone. The humor is mean spirited. There is nothing of value here. Nothing at all. I have no idea which executive greenlit such an idea, but clearly they either had no idea what was being made, or didn't give a damn about the content at all and only assumed the name meant money.

In short, watching the scrapings from a septic tank dry in the sun would be more entertaining than this terrible waste of time."
1.0,"Jan 15, 2023","At first i was quite excited, velmas design looked very cute. As the first trailer released all excitement vanished. The attempt to be ironic was a complete failure. The writers somehow mischaracterised every single character. Daphne and Fred are really mean. Shaggy isn't even shaggy, they've basically made a new character as the only resemblance is his clothes, he isn't even named shaggy. The sexualisation of 15 year olds is also a big problem for me, it made me so uncomfortable watching it. The first 3 minutes of the first episode is just naked 15 year olds talking about sex and being horny. Definitely would not recommend to anyone ever."
1.0,"Jan 14, 2023","Don't waste your time on this. Absolutely nothing here worth watching. Story is horrible, acting is horrible, entire concept is horrible, and the animation looks like it was done by a Jr High art class.

""Adult animation"" that's too dumb for adults to enjoy and too adult for children, it has no real target audience. The characters are completely unlikable and one dimensional.

This is obviously a pet project for Mindy, yet it fails on every level and makes me question everything she's ever done. I would call it absolute garbage, but I won't bring garbage down to that level. I watched the first episode, I wan't that time back."
1.0,"Jan 14, 2023","If you like the Mindy sense of humor you'll like this show. It is quite divergent from the rest of the franchise. If you find Scooby-Doo to be a sacred thing, it will probably upset you. I personally don't hold a 60's stoner Partridge Family meets Sherlock cartoon as sacred to anything so, this is fine.

Not a kids show at all but I found it pretty funny on its own. I wouldn't say it is Mindy's best but it is good for a few laughs. To be honest Family Guy has edgier humor and I'm not sure what needs to happen to make it better. I think pacing is where it could be better. Story development is very slow. The jokes are well done though and there are subtle intellectual easter eggs. On the whole I found it pretty entertaining."
1.0,"Jan 15, 2023","This show is not great, not the worst thing ever either though.

I am a huge Scooby-Doo franchise fan. I grew up with the old school cartoon and the movies of the '90s-'00s and I love them so much. I loved Mystery Incorporated and even didn't mind the goofiness of Be Cool, Scooby-Doo.

Having said that, I like Velma. It is fine. It is crude and vulgar and not very sensitive when it comes to sensitive topics, but it's fine. I didn't love some of the overt and weird sex-stuff, police brutality, and poor taste jokes, but it's fine.

This show is not nearly as bad as the live-action TV movies from the around 2010, the Velma & Daphne movie from a few years ago, or most of the straight to DVD movies they still make, so why is this show a 1.3 on IMDb?

The animation is beautiful, the jokes are fine, and story is good. The show as a whole is fine."
8.0,"Jan 13, 2023","Utter trash dont waste your time. If you grew up loving scooby doo then you will experience having your childhood ripped apart. The characters in this show lack the personalities that made the original great. The concept of the show could have been great if the execution was not so poor. You can tell the writers think they are hilarious but you will cringe the whole time watching it. You will waste your time watching this and never get it back. Also scooby doo is not in this, thankfully, saving his character from this dumpsterfire of a show. I can not believe this came from the same network that has house of dragon on it."
6.0,"Jan 12, 2023","I am not usually a critic of tv shows or movies, but this was indeed horrible. I knew nothing of what was going on with this show and wanted to go in as ""a surprise"" (big Scooby Doo fan) but the complete revamping of characters is... not it.. and this is supposedly an ""adult comedy"" but seems more on the lines of teenage comedy and the jokes were mediocre to say the least. I feel like the show would be 110% better if they created a whole new group (possibly friends or even enemies of the original group) instead of cash cowing the name ""Velma"" and ruining the reputation of some of my generations beloved characters.

Probably will not continue watching this series and that saddens me. Not worth the watch."
1.0,"Jan 16, 2023","Why? I ask why, did this have to be made. Who wrote this? This is not the Velma or the Scooby Doo characters we know. Now I like Harley Quinn and enjoy watching other adult animation, but why did they have to mess up Scooby Doo? And what is it with the sexual content. I notice in Hollywood that if you don't have a good story throw in some sexual content and hope that will bring people in. Who was this made for? I've had HBO Max since it was offered but this is a disappointment. It has a few laughs but this seemed like a self serving work that Kaling wanted to make? There have been some good reboots but this is not one of them."
2.0,"Feb 13, 2023","I went into this assuming the collective opinion had to be exaggerating about Velma. Sadly, I was mistaken. This take on the characters is damaging to the status quo of the Scooby Doo! Franchise. It isn't the lack of Scooby, or the fact that ethnicities, characteristics and personalites are changed, it's the fact that they're all so damn unbearable, and it isn't just the ""gang"", it's everyone with a speaking role. None of the jokes are funny. I couldn't find myself warming up to the brand of ""humor"" at any point through the first episode, and when it's not the lack of humor, it's the highbrow themes being broken down to you after the joke didnt land in a conversation between characters or the cringe-inducing situational humor. How this fell into full production is a true mystery of it's own."
1.0,"Jan 29, 2023","This is my first time rating 1 star and i think that says a lot... Why this show has the scooby-doo characters in it is beyond me. Velma, Daphne, Fred act NOTHING like the characters that we know and love from previous instalments, all i see is two-dimensional caricatures having only one personal characteristic. The jokes don't land, the animation is the same *cough*ugly*cough* animation every adult animation show has these days.

The creators need to realise that you can make an adult show without having all the characters be vulgar, cynical and cruel. I wanted to watch this show because i was interested in velma but this snarky, mean, annoying girl that never shuts up is not velma. The creators didn't respect the source material and it shows.. Also i was looking forward seeing Velma and Daphne get together and even that felt blant and their romance was rushed and not organic at all.

Shame really..."
1.0,"Jan 15, 2023",This is just Scooby-doo with the comedy taken out of it. The show tries so hard to be comedic while just falling flat on its face. And all the forced attempts at self awareness just make the joke worse when it fails. The entire time I'm struggling to watch because I'm constantly burying my head into my hands because of how much CRINGE the show is producing. I was hoping when I saw the trailer for this that they wouldn't make too many changes and that the self aware aspect of the show wouldn't be too distracting. But no the show just hammers in your face unfunny joke after unfunny joke. The only time the show even came close to making me laugh was In the trailer and it was only a slight chuckle. 0/10 why did they even bother.
1.0,"Jan 15, 2023","I tried. I tried giving it a chance but it's so bad, the comedy sucks, the story so far sucks, the characters are bad and this show is a slap in the face to classic fans, and apparently Velma is a self inset for mindy kailing (highly rumoured) so that could explain why Velma's a awful and bad character. Most self inserts do not work, there is the rare occasion but this is definitely not it. And they literally they made fun of scooby doo fans , everything is just horrible so far and the only reason im making the review now is because I doubt it'll ever get much better, but if it does I'll delete this and re review it. First off they literally insulted us scooby doo fans for being scooby doo fans... second the jokes are so bad, it's almost like they have to explain the jokes like we are children and they are just bad and basic repetitive jokes that make you watch in cringe wondering when it'll end. Nothing is original and it's just there. I didn't laugh once through both episodes. They tell the same jokes that aren't funny nor unique, the characters are really stereotypical and don't have much going for them so far. Velma is probably the worst character in her own show! She's rude and unlikable to everyone and it makes you not want to watch it. I know she's not the same Velma but this is supposed to be somewhat similar to the original. She's the least likeable character, now they may change it but what was the point of using the scooby doo characters without trying to stay somewhat close to themselves or improving on the characters. No one is entertaining here it's like your watching a burning trash can, although that would probably be more enjoyable than this. It's just a slap in the face to anyone who liked the original. They constantly crap on the original show and insult our intelligence as viewers. Who was this show made for? Seriously it's not for fans, not for casual viewers? Not for people who want comedy because there's way better shows out there, like I genuinely believe this show was made specifically for the self insert character aspect. They could've struck literal gold here, Imagine a darker scooby doo show that improves on the quality and characters, story and made it more relatable and if it actually had scooby and shaggy, like imagine seeing an actual stoner shaggy getting chased by actual killers lol and have a running storyline throughout it all that has an emotional impact. But we got this instead. I don't care about the changes of the characters races but the way everyone is written makes them so genetic and unlikable. I think im done with this review. Im mad and this show is awful."
1.0,"Jan 16, 2023","The problem of attempting to ruin old classics instead of creating something new and unique was more than perfectly displayed here, the whole shows premise is just an attempt to please current generation of zoomers and milenials and failing shamefully in the process.

Nothing much needs explaining - the main cast is an absolute mess plus one of main characters that made this whole franchise so iconic isn't even present. It's just a below average writing series with terrible characters that can't even be related by most people or let alone be likable.

I can't say this is the worst thing I've ever seen but its definitely nothing that has any redeeming qualities or at least somewhat good of a writing."
1.0,"Jan 14, 2023","First off, anyone who is complaining about this show not being safe for kids, didn't do their homework. It's funny and it's dumb, it's clearly meant to be ridiculous. It's a cartoon. Truly nobody is safe, this show makes fun of literally every type of human, it's pretty clever. And if you pay attention, it's very very obviously not for kids, it says so, in like the first five words of dialogue. So of course there are vulgar and offensive jokes. These bad reviews are hilarious, people need to chill.

The story is decent enough, mysteries and love stories, teen drama and such.. along the same lines as the original show. A few ""cast"" changes to make it a little more different. I see nothing worse than Rick and Morty or family guy here."
1.0,"Jan 15, 2023","I watched scooby doo and every version that has been made but it was obvious this show was going to have next to nothing in common with the original. And that is spot on. I actually watched the first 8 episodes the last couple days and was thinking this was better than a lot of the animated shows out right now. I came here to look up how many more episodes were still to come, and I was pretty shocked at the rating. It has decent animation, decent storylines, pretty solid production, and decent voice acting. There are a few refrences to the original here and there to keep the scooby vibe going. All I can figure is the low ratings thought this was gonna be a 100% remake of scooby doo."
8.0,"Jan 14, 2023","The script was unoriginal and filled with cliches, and the special effects were laughably bad. The characters were one-dimensional and lacked any depth or complexity. The pacing was slow and dull, making it difficult to stay engaged. Overall, I found the show to be a complete waste of time and would not recommend it to anyone.

The performances were cringe-worthy, the writing was lazy and uninspired, and the direction was amateurish. The plot was nonsensical and filled with inconsistencies, and the special effects were so bad that they were a distraction. The characters were poorly developed and lacked any semblance of realism. I found the show to be an insult to the intelligence of the audience and can confidently say it is one of the worst shows I have ever had the misfortune of watching."
7.0,"Jan 15, 2023","Mindy Kaling plays a stock Mindy Kaling character, a self-deprecating embittered narcissist, in this ill-conceived retcon of the Mystery, Inc. All of the characters are entitled, self-absorbed morons. About 5 percent of the jokes land; the rest of the theoretical humor is lazy, forced and insipid. The show's attempts to be meta and/or current come off as desperate pandering. The shock value of turning a formerly wholesome children's cartoon into cynical vulgarity wears thin after about thirty seconds, which is coincidentally about how long into the first episode it takes to realize this show is dedicated to being mean-spirited and aggressively awful for no apparent reason."
1.0,"Jan 16, 2023","I just watched the first two episodes of the Velma series. I can safely say that it is 50 minutes of my life that I will never get back.

The Velma series focuses so much on bad jokes and bad meta that it overrides the entire plot. Instead of focusing on solving the mystery, they focused wat too much on saying look at all these stereotypes and modern trends, is it not just fun. The animation was not bad, but it was not good either. And the humor was not timeless, which means this series will get outdated really quickly.

The jokes in the series are just really bad, and fall flat most of the time. I know humor is subjective, but who was the comedy, and even series meant for? All the characters are horrible, and not at all someone you want to look up to or identify with.

I think the best way I can describe the show is Mindy Kaling saying, ""F* you all I totally don't care what the fans want the most important thing is me and that's why I'm the main character of the show."" Thank god the did not put Scooby Doo in the series about ""The mystery gang""."
1.0,"Jan 17, 2023","Pre-dog sure. Garbage decision though. I'd at least give it 2/10 stars if Scooby was given the respect he deserves! He's the whole franchise!

Besides that, why not make something that's actually original? This idea is sloppy. You could've at least ripped off the idea and created a whole new ""no dog"" boring group of teenagers who solve crimes or whatever.

Yeah, my main problem is the lack of talking dog. Sue me. Scoobert Doo is the whole appeal of Scooby Doo and without him??? You've got NOTHING.

I can't see this show getting green lit past this one odd season. Especially if you continue to hate talking dogs and fun. Not nostalgic at all."
1.0,"Feb 12, 2023","This show is absolutely horrible. It's the laziest, most absurd destruction of an established masterpiece I've witnessed since The Last Airbender debacle. All we can hope is for it to be rightfully cancelled as soon as possible so the world can commit to forgetting its existence.

Velma is vapid and ignorant (in no universe would she care even remotely about dating...she was an analytical genius not to be bound by petty romance). Shaggy lacks all semblance of a personality. Scooby doesn't even exist. Daphne is a mean girl, despite everyone knowing what made her unique was her beauty and kind nature both inside and out. And Fred is a whiny, useless weakling with no courage or commitment to friendships. The original characters grew up together from childhood (we're talking elementary school and under). So saying this is an origin story is absurd. We already had their origin stories. This is lazy writing at its finest."
1.0,"Feb 4, 2023","It's quite incredible to see just how far Hollywood of late has fallen completely out of touch with reality. I'm not sure what this mess is meant to be. It's puerile junk. For the vast majority of those who grew up watching Scooby-Doo then this is just going to be an insulting mess. If you didn't watch Scooby-Doo when you were younger then... well why are you watching this?

Velma has joined the ranks of the worst IP Appropriation of all time and is vying for the top spot; Rings of Power, Witcher: Blood Origin, Resident Evil and Willow. It seems the Hollywood machine remains locked on a path to erase the past, rewrite the narratives and destroy original works. We can only hope this mess goes on to wake up the Hollywood machine from it's deluded fever-dream."
1.0,"Jan 15, 2023",Where to even start... the personality change did not sit well nor was it presented well either . Velma character doesn't goes well with her attitude and new approach. This is just bad all around. The jokes are not funny. Changing the mystery crew personality and character was a horrible mistake. Making Fred a complete idiot and talking about his penis isn't funny at all. If this was it's own show and not tied to the Scooby-Doo universe maybe this would be great. This is a waste of time. This new approach does not go well at all . The mystery to solve isn't even interesting and the main story is not worth seeking either. Just a disappointment all around.
1.0,"Jan 23, 2023","It's ok - I wonder if the reviewers, having watched on HBO max, were fans of the animated Harley Quinn show that has garnered quite a strong following and is highly reviewed - because, obviously this is not that, nor is it in the same vain (sp?) despite it being gussied up for a more mature crowd with some adult language and some initial satirical nudity (and ya, ik what you're thinking here.. 'satirical nudity'? Lol.. Yep, that's the best way I can describe it) But real talk, I believe Mindy Kaling to be talented enough and she sure is industriously attempting to pilot new shows in different genres and classes of the medium - I think Sex Stories of College Kids (or whatnot) is hers, but overall she seems to be struggling to find that sweet spot - this Velma, is not it - however that being said, it's not altogether unwatchable and has entertainment value - it's just neither appropriate for kids nor really exciting or funny for adults - like with so many things in this over saturated era of content - it draws heavily on Nostalgia, in this case Gen Xers thereabouts, having grown up on Saturday morning cartoons and that mainstay Scooby Doo but ultimately Ruutt Roe."
1.0,"Jan 13, 2023","The animation in this show is very appealing and voice over is well done. That's it. Other than that it treats the audience like we are dumb. Instead of allowing us to see through the jokes about different cultures, genders, and races it just says it with basically no execution. Whether it's white people jokes, jokes about hairy arms of Indian girls, or making certain characters ""beta"". The show is just offensive not because of the stances but just how horribly it's presented. Genuinely deserving of the hate it's getting. It completely destroys anything about the scooby doo universe. Honestly pretty pathetic to all involved and not a great look for HBO max."
1.0,"Jan 12, 2023","It is by far the worst use ever of the iconic Scooby-Doo Where Are You? Characters. The characters are used very well for nearly sixty years and then HBO chose to ruin them. I will of course always treasure the good. But I will never treasure garbage. Not this kind of rubbish at least. Can we not have teenagers on TV without all the stupid drugs and sex? Not every teenager uses drugs, has sex, and uses profanity. The show needs to be removed from HBO and destroyed. Its time to make good content for us. The show focuses so much on sex and drugs use that its hard to remember that its supposed to be mystery show."
9.0,"Jan 12, 2023","Why?! Clearly the people behind this have never watched a single anything of Scooby Doo. This is the only explanation for this poorly conceived excuse to milk more money out of a beloved, 54 year old franchise. Even the live action movies maintained a high level of charm and innocence while introducing more adult levels of humor.

But this?? This is vulgar, crass, unimaginative, and the worst adjective, lazy. Had this shown any signs of intelligence, I may have been more forgiving. Alas, someone decided that ruining the legacy of everyone's favorite dog would be easier than creating something that would be cherished more than 50 years after its inception.

I always thought Scrappy Doo was the worst thing inflicted on my beloved Scooby Doo, not anymore."
6.0,"Jan 14, 2023","I had an open mind going in, but I was so wrong...

I defended the show before it came out saying ""Let's wait and see, it could be good! It could surprise us all!""

Every single ounce of hatred towards this show before it came out was warranted and I am sorry I didn't listen.

They tried so hard to be inclusive that they forgot to make the show watchable.

They forgot to make it entertaining.

They forgot to make the characters remotely interesting.

They forgot to make it enjoyable for an audience.

They forgot to make it Scooby Doo in any way at all.

There are few things in this world I regret watching, but I'll go ahead and put this on the same shelf as A Serbian Film, Antichrist, and Salo and leave it in a dark closet to rot away from existence.

If there is any sort of God or higher deity, I hope that they will not allow this to ever see a season 2."

Not saying it's not fun. It's kind of funny and more similar like Rick and Morty , American dad etc.. should have done something different without dragging Scooby-Doo characters in to this.

I would have given 6+ stars if this is something separated from the Scooby-Doo and a unique story. This is just disgrace for the original series. 💔"
1.0,"Jan 13, 2023","Velma, Daphney, Shaggy, Scooby & Freddy all are iconic characters from everyone's childhood memories. They should have been more careful to handle our loved cartoon characters rather than destroying them. Diversity is a good thing, but this thing showed how bad it is. The only thing in this show is that they sexualized everyone. The producers just wanted to make a weird, sexy, and violent show for a bizarre audience. Garbage shows with nothing to enjoy. I don't see a big problem making Velma a black girl, but the worst thing is they made her a complete idiot and a crazy person. This Velma is not the Velma we knew this Velma is a total mess."

I could barely make it through the first 10 minutes. Before turning it off. This show is ABSOLUTELY NOT worth your time. Please don't waste any seconds of your precious life on this horrid redesign of a classic show that should never have been tampered with.

If this show wasn't based on Scooby Doo then maybe it could get a better review but as an adaptation of that it fails badly.

I'd much rather spend time with my terrible in-laws then spend another second watching this show.

That is what watching the pilot episode feels like. I refuse to suffer through a second. I felt a part of me die while I was watching and I have no desire to revisit that feeling.

This is not Scooby-Doo. It is a crass, vulgar brutalization of the franchise, and it was only done because the writers knew their work was too poor to stand as its own IP.

If I could leave negative stars, I would gladly do so. Stay very far away from this dumpster fire of a show, unless you wish to irrevocably taint your memories of the Scooby-Doo franchise.

A big fat zero out of ten."
2.0,"Jan 22, 2023","For every comment you see rating this show below a 6, the reviewer is not the target audience. Save yourself the headache if you mirror their thoughts on other shows.

Now for those of you who get it (See Harley Quinn animated series), this is for you.

The under lying jokes are there. The adult themed tropes about the characters of the mystery team...there. A Nineties R&B anthem...woven in there.

No there is no talking dog, which isn't too bad. I think the other reviewers are kind of upset he's not here. This show is about the people associated with the franchise and it's given a modern, mature spin."
1.0,"Jan 16, 2023","I'm up to episode 6 now and I don't hate this show. I think some humor lands, some doesn't, and a lot of it is crude. However there is enough narrative to keep me watching new episodes. There are attempts at character development after the first episode which many people say they did not continue past.

I can see that piggybacking off the success of a children's show and showing us ""unlikeable"" teenagers that visually resemble the old characters we know has backfired. This isn't a 1 star show but the creators obviously hoped the nostalgia of the franchise would attract viewers and that's where they messed up. This show wouldn't have such a low opinion if the characters had nothing to do with Scooby Doo, but maybe also wouldn't have garnered the viewership to gain so much hatred? Who can say, too late now. Probably won't see another season after this backlash."
1.0,"Jan 16, 2023","It seemed like every attempt at humor was some over-the-top jab at identity stereotypes in the true crime genre.

The topics aren't what necessarily bothered me, it was how low brow the jokes themselves were; if you're going to make fun of tropes at least do it in an original way.

However after numerous attempts at comedy over the same subjects it did begin to bother me. Take a note from Rick and Morty or South Park - just make fun of everything - especially yourself if you want to be ""self-aware"" kind of show.

Loved the animation style. That's what initially pulled me in. Too bad it was wasted on awful writing.

Idk, im not a writer but i honestly believe i could right better than this /s."
1.0,"Jan 13, 2023","Velma is just a questionable show. It takes the characters names and puts them in a adult show. It feels like it's disrespecting the original Scooby-Doo franchise by putting in weird and unfunny ideas. I'm sorry, but whoever created this was just out of their mind.

Adult animated shows can be entertaining, explicit and fun, but this is not one of them. South Park was better and I don't even watch it anymore. Heck, even a lot of other animated shows are better than this. Velma tries to be as funny as other well acclaimed adult shows, but it just doesn't work out because it's just vile and crude.

I would give Velma a -9000/10 if I could just because it is honestly imo one of the worst shows ever created."
9.0,"Jan 12, 2023","The only credit is given to the animators, it didn't look bad.

The show itself is outdated, lacks relevant humor and the characters are not likeable at all. You will find yourself not rooting for anyone.

There is bitterness and anger from the main characters which is really odd, even if she is cynical, there are no redeeming qualities to counter that.

The group dynamic is stale and not realistic, even for an animation, no one feels ""real""

As for butchering the source material, That is a whole different issue but the quality of the show itself in terms of writing and perfomances, is terrible.

It will be the lowest rated tv show of 2023."

They also made EVERY. SINGLE. CHARACTER a hateful and horrible person, on top of being a bully already. Remove the comedy tag now, also. Jokes are horrible and played out, making them obvious and boring, and even if they were unexpected, they'd still be terrible!

This is a disgrace beyond everything of beloved childhood IP I dont even know who's the target audience either. The joke is too edgy for adult and too bizarre for children. So who are you targetting here?

The humor is so forced you might need to use laugh track just to hint the supposed ""fun"" part. But then again it might get stale real fast as they keep using the same ""joke"" topic over and over and over again throughout just 2 episodes that I've managed to watch without holding urge to vomit.

Now I'm grateful they don't called it ""Scooby-Doo"" and Scooby isn't here, he's spared from this cataclysm."

I was hoping to watch a clever, funny, more adult oriented story about some of my favorite characters in cartoon history (even if they have new looks). However after watching the show i felt nothing but sadness. The show is almost self aware that it is bad, the writers had to know how poor the jokes and story were, there's just no way anyone found the final product entertaining. With an obvious agenda and writing that sounds like it came from a 12 year old, this show does not deserve to be viewed by anyone who appreciates comedy and animation as an art. I HIGHLY recommend just enjoying some classic scooby doo, as this show is just an insult to any scooby doo fan. I have never felt actually disgusted by a show, but Velma made me physically feel ill after listening to the ""jokes"" the show has to offer. The writing in this show deserves it's own category as ""Attempted comedy"". Would give 0 stars if possible!!"

It's the new era nowadays everything is changing and the world is being introduced to so many things and this is the first animated adult show to ever express that. Why this show is awesome is because It's animation style is new and unique the characters are diverse and I love how it related this show to the new generation with different races and sexualities, it's comedy and style of jokes are boring and make no sense but it's a really good."

It's a show that won't be for everyone, but if you go into it having seen the trailer and an open mind, you can appreciate it for what it is trying to convey. I personally think the characters differ and really have their own personalities while still playing on the tropes of the originals hinted at characteristics. Like I said, if you are going into this show with the mindset of having somewhat of a backstory on the 60s iterations or looking for a reunion will be incredibly disappointed."

The only decent thing is the animation but an animation with not just a boring but a terrible plot still equals with a 1 out of ten for me. It was an instant drop after two episodes because this type of Velma is so stupid that I am suprised she is alive. If you want to remember Velma as a good character do not watch this at all."

Shaggy is absolutely horrible. And without his sidekick Scoob ! Which is blasphemy!

And this fake walmart velma cant be indian as she cant even get the basic quadratic formula right in the scene with all the formulae.

Kaling had a golden chance to create an original character of an indian teen detective which could have gone on to become iconic. Instead she gave in to fear of failure and chose the easy way of messing up someone else's character and hard work. Real shame. This should have been its own thing instead mindy decided to cheat and piggy back on someone else's work for easy success and pre-built fandom but she failed and how. The worst thing associated with mystery inc. By a huge distance!"
7.0,"Jan 12, 2023","I don't have a title yet, but it would be a foul and insulting adult spinoff series with a bad script based on a beloved, timeless childhood cartoon, and the series got renewed for a second season because the network's new overlords decided to blatantly ignore the abysmally low rating of 1.6/10.

Oh wait.

That really happened.

Jinkies.

I have no idea what the H. E. double hockey sticks Charlie Grandy and Mindy Kaling were thinking to begin with, nor do I care. Velma is not cute or funny. The show is adult and unfunny. Beavis and Butt-Head was funny. This is not.

For perspective:

Euphoria - TV-MA.

Velma - TV-MA.

Euphoria is wayyyyy better and has substance.

For more perspective:

Grandy said in an interview: ""I think the key was always keeping the original in the forefront of your mind and really just letting that be the compass.""

Compass malfunction confirmed.

Save your brain cells.

Skip this steaming pile. It's THAT bad."
1.0,"Jan 15, 2023","Absolutely awful. They have just used the names from Scooby Doo and changed the characters so they are unrecognisable. Why not just make an entirely new show instead of ruining a classic. Don't bother wasting your time with this it simply isn't worth it. The writing and story lines are simply awful. The characters are awful. The animation is awful. It appear they have just had a meeting and collected all the worst ideas and thought they should just use them. The voice acting isn't good, the script is poor. This is so far from the classic that they have forever soiled the name of Scooby Doo. Awful."
1.0,"May 2, 2023","I'm still not sure what I just watched. I had binge watched some ole Scooby-Doo series, and thought what the hey, let's give it a try. This act made me die a little bit inside. If the world can have something like this show in it, then I weep for the humanity.

Has Hollywood gone mad? Who green lighted this? The absence of sympathy of the main character makes Velma seem like a sociopath. And as this clearly is a self insert, it certainly speaks in volumes of the people who created this show. Didn't anyone in the writing room think that ""hey, what if we made the main character likeable""? Was that person thrown through the window like in that meme?

Honestly, this show has made me question humanity. If that gang does go solve mysteries, I hope the first monster kills the whole crew, so the audience doesn't have to suffer anymore.

Or maybe the real monster is Velma herself. Jinkies!"
1.0,"Jan 15, 2023","I recently had the displeasure of watching the new ""Scooby Doo"" spin-off centered around Velma, and let me tell you, it is a train wreck of a show. From the lackluster animation to the uninspired writing, this show is a prime example of how not to make a TV show.

First and foremost, the animation is subpar at best. The characters are poorly drawn and lack any sense of detail or nuance. The backgrounds are bland and uninteresting, and the overall look of the show is cheap and unappealing. It's clear that no effort was put into the animation, and it's a shame that a beloved franchise like ""Scooby Doo"" would be represented in such a poor light.

The writing is just as bad, if not worse. The plotlines are lazy, uninspired and predictable. Every episode feels like a retread of the same basic formula with little to no variation. The characters, particularly Velma, lack any real depth or development, and their actions and dialogue are often nonsensical. The humor falls flat, and the attempts at suspense and mystery fall short. The show is just so bland and uninteresting, it's hard to keep watching.

The voice acting is also a huge letdown. The actors sound unenthusiastic and wooden, and it's clear that they were just going through the motions. Velma's voice actor in particular, fails to capture the spirit and energy of the character, and it's a disservice to the fans of the franchise.

One of the most egregious issues with the show is how it handles Velma as a character. Velma is often portrayed as a stereotypical ""nerd"" who is socially awkward and lacks any real agency. It's disappointing to see such a strong and independent character reduced to such a one-dimensional stereotype. It's not only disrespectful to the character but also to the audience, particularly young girls who may look up to Velma as a role model.

Furthermore, the show seems to be lacking any sense of continuity, it's not clear if it is a continuation of the original series or a reboot, and the show's creators seem to have no understanding of the characters and their history. The show's creators have failed to capture the spirit and magic of the original series and it's a disservice to the fans of the franchise.

In conclusion, this ""Scooby Doo"" spin-off centered around Velma is an absolute disaster. The animation is subpar, the writing is lazy and uninspired, and the voice acting is wooden and unenthusiastic. It's clear that no effort was put into this show and it serves as a prime example of how not to make a TV show. I would advise anyone considering watching it to avoid it at all costs and stick to the classic series. It's a shame that such a beloved franchise has been represented in such a poor light is the worst adaptation of Scooby Doo that has ever graced the world.

Do yourself a favor, watch it just so you have a baseline for what poor quality is."
2.0,"Feb 17, 2023","The writing of this show and it's characters is at a level of the most popular animated shows if not even better. The amount of laugh out loud jokes per minute is extremely impressive. The problem seems to 100% be the choice to make this a version of characters from Scooby-Doo. This show could have easily been a hit with original characters. I understand all the negative reviews to an extent, but it's pretty immature and unreasonable to throw a fit over diversity changes. That being said I truly don't see the point in choosing to that over just creating a series with fun new diverse characters. If this show does get cancelled I really hope this same team of people work together on a new show."
1.0,"Jan 28, 2023","Honestly, it's quite bingeable in the ""turn off my brain for a night"" kind of way... I agree with a lot of reviews, I weirdly wish that all the characters resembled OG Scooby doo gang.... But in all honesty opening up it said it's an origin story which I thought was interesting and expected it to be different. I guess this is an origin story for Velma except maybe in like a parallel universe ? Idk... I'm interested to see season 2, but would be surprised if it continued to be renewed. If their target audience is for adults, think the writing should be a little better. I've usually loved all the voice actors in either their own standup or other shows... but it feels a bit one note in some areas and some characters are a bit under utilized. The trope for Fred seems tired, as does the moms who are cop partners. I did like the plot about Daphne. Wish it didn't come across as forced lines but was more organic."
1.0,"Jan 25, 2023","Genuinely did not think it could be as bad as people said yet here I stand corrected. I made an IMDB account purely so I could rate this pile of trash 1 Star and lord knows I wish I could give it less.

Being a life long Scooby Doo fan this show makes me sick to my stomach at the level of disrespect to has to the beloved mystery incorporated characters. Mindy Kaling probably thinks all the controversy is over the race swaps but it seriously has very little to do with that. It's the way that none of these characters personality's resemble ANYTHING about the characters we've known and adored for decades

I could go on for much longer but I don't wanna have to waste any more time on this show."
3.0,"Jan 15, 2023","The movie is a modern generation cliche where the plot is too much. Trying too hard to cover everything to appeal to the audience but looks like it's driven by extremely common things you see in social media. The first episode was very repetitive and too boring because it is not unique. There are other episodes which might be better in the future I guess. But if they continue with a direction towards what they seem to be heading in the first episode, the show is in trouble. Hopefully they change to become more flexible and not so much of a tight squeeze. I was excited for the show but they really let me down."
1.0,"Jan 15, 2023","Man I loved Scooby-Doo as a kid but what they did to the characters and jokes Are just disgraceful!

This show is Basically Big mouth combined with family guy

The characters are butchered so bad to a point I don't recognize them anymore and the jokes are Just Cringe To hear

The story sucks, yeah on paper it sounds good the Scooby gang Solving a murder mystery but was executed very badly!

And worst of all Scooby doo doesn't exist in the show at all and he's the main character! But I think it's for the best that he isn't because scooby's character would be badly Butched where he would be cringe, if you wanna watch something good watch shows like Scooby doo where are you, Mystery inc, new Scooby doo movies, the Scooby doo show, the 13 ghosts of Scooby doo the list goes on."
8.0,"Jan 15, 2023","I turned this on for just a few minutes and felt the impulse to immediately turn it off. I can't believe HBO would be involved with the making of this show. It's an unnecessary extension of the Scooby-Doo universe, seemingly missing the dog, satirical dialogue of high school students, and came off as unsettling. The design choices for some of the characters was also very off-putting. It was a waste opportunity from a streaming service that I feel gives top quality content almost always. Hopefully HBO learns from this blunder and takes into consideration what wrong with this series when releasing future content."
6.0,"Jan 12, 2023","I'm not even sure how HBO MAX allowed this quality of work to be put on the platform. This has got to be the worst writing I've ever seen in years. Please don't let a second season happen. It would be wasting money to go towards other shows that people will want to watch. My family laughs about how terrible this is.

On the bright side, this could be studied in universities to figure out how to waste talent, resources, and time. I'm not sure who approved this but I hope they do not keep their job with the new warner/discovery merger.

Mindy Kaling is funny but it never shows here. I'm surprised that her being executive producer didn't help here.... maybe it did. No one could tell though.

This whole thing can be summed up as terrible plot lines, story arc, comedic timing, and just overall writing."
1.0,"Jun 25, 2023","Velma, the namesake of the show is worst character in this series with no redeeming qualities to be found. Her insufferable attitude and poor excuse for comedy leaves you cringing at anyone who could consider this comical.

The choice to Leave the beloved character of Scooby-Doo behind is the only good choice in the writing of the show. Because it at least left one character to not be bastardized by what is simply an embarrassment to HBO and all of their original series'. What could have been an interesting spin on Scooby-Doo was completely derailed by terrible writing.

In conclusion if you want to watch the series equivalent to a toilet joke this is the choice for you."
1.0,"Jan 13, 2023","The show isn't that bad at all. I was only going to watch one episode to make my own opinion and had to keep watching. The jokes are not all hilarious but I was laughing more than not. All the characters are pretty similar to the original just overly exaggerated.

Lots of little callbacks to the original shows/movies

The animation is also pretty decent. It's not the original obviously but it definitely doesn't look bad.

People are obviously bandwagon hating and it's pretty lame because the show is a lot of fun and I would like a second season for sure.

Give it a watch if you actually enjoy the Scooby gang and aren't a big snowflake."
1.0,"Jan 12, 2023","This is not Scooby Doo. It's a re-imagining, so go into it as if it is its own show and you may be less disappointed. It's a decent adult animated show but it has its disappointments.

The main character Velma is very unlikeable and doesn't really redeem these unlikeable qualities. The story is ok. Some of it is very predictable but there was an ok twist to it. The show has a handful of kinda funny moments but I wouldn't say it's a hilarious cartoon like South Park, Rick and Morty, and other similar adult cartoons.

If you aren't a fan of vulgar adult humor you won't like it. If it is your genre than it's worth watching just to give it a chance. While it wasn't my favorite adult animation, I enjoyed enough that I would watch it again or would be interested in watching a second season but wouldn't be too disappointed if there wasn't another season."
1.0,"Dec 3, 2023","Velma, a modern take on the beloved Scooby-Doo character, has garnered mixed reactions from audiences, particularly among those who grew up watching the original series. For Gen Xers, the show may not resonate in the same way as it does for younger viewers. The humor and themes in the original series were undeniably ""smart,"" and while the new adaptation attempts to capture that essence, it falls short in delivering the same level of wit and cleverness. Instead, the show comes across as trying too hard, resulting in an annoying and somewhat grating experience for older viewers. The characters and themes in Velma may not be relatable for those who have a strong connection to the original series, making it difficult for some to fully appreciate the new adaptation. It would be helpful if the show included warning labels indicating its target audience, such as ""for 22 years and under only,"" to better manage expectations and cater to the preferences of different generations. While it's possible that the show may improve as the episodes progress, the initial three episodes may not be enough to keep older viewers engaged. For those who are unsure about whether to give Velma a chance, it might be worth sampling a few episodes to see if it resonates with their tastes. However, for those who are deeply invested in the original series, it may be best to approach the new adaptation with tempered expectations."
1.0,"Jan 18, 2023","I don't know what the writers were thinking, but this was the most embarrassingly bad show I have ever tried to get through. I tried hard to laugh but couldn't. It almost feels like they tried hard to purposely make it unwatchable. Jokes were forced and not funny, characters were nothing like the originals. I just don't get it. I know it's supposed to be an origin story, but it seems like the whole show was about how bitter Velma is. Its awkward, and makes no sense. I said I would give it three episodes to give it a chance, And I struggled to make it through the first episode. I finally mustered up the fortitude to try episode 2 and made it about halfway. Its a huge no from me."
1.0,"Feb 3, 2023","So i heard about this show while at work yesterday. I was told it was really bad, but i assumed it was brand new since i hadn't heard of it. I have HBO MAX and sometimes watch old Sopranos episodes before the football games come on Sunday's, and i remembered my co-workers talking about ""Velma"" so i put on the 1st episode. Growing up, i wasn't a major Scooby-doo fan, but i did watch it here and there, so i have some frame of reference for the plot and characters.

Unfortunately, this show has nothing in common with the Scooby-Doo from way back. I understand taking source material from the past and trying to put a different spin on it, even taking a kids show and turning it into content for adults....but i doubt many ""adults"" were involved in this project. It didn't take long to see why people at work were ragging on this so bad.

They took the character of Velma and decided to turn her into an awful, cynical and downright nasty woman.....and try to portray her as being the 'righteous' protagonist. I notice this being a trend in Hollywood and entertainment over the last 5 years or so, and i can't for the life of me understand who enjoys watching this??? On top of coming across as a bitter and lonely cat-lady, Velma is also a bit race-obsessed and VERY sex-obsessed.

But this is only a result of the times we live in. For whatever reason, Hollywood or at least a chunk of it, has been hell-bent on pushing the most toxic aspects of thrid-wave feminism down the throats of everyone who dares to watch their action/sci-fi movies of late. I know they believe they are accomplishing some great feat and they just might be onto something, if they didn't write their female characters so ridiculously cynical and hateful. I could go on, but i don't want to spend too much time here, but i want to say this...

At the beginning of this review i mentioned i enjoy watching old ""The Sopranos"" episodes. Anyone familiar with that show knows that the lead character ""Tony Soprano"" is ALSO hateful,racist,sexist etc. , so naturally one would ask ""What's the difference between Tony Soprano and Velma....they both share some of the same characteristics?...do you just not like Velma because she's female"" No i don't like Velma because she has absolutely zero redeeming qualities and is a hateful shallow women from the moment she came on screen until the episode ended. I didn't need to watch another episode, i knew it wasn't going to get better. Tony Soprano is ultimately a very bad man, but he was also a very complex character who did have redeeming qualities from time to time.

Also, the writers in the Sopranos were not trying to portray Tony as a 'righteous protagonist' like Velma is clearly trying to be portrayed. I couldn't believe the people who were involved with ""Velma"" (some pretty reputable names) wrote her as if she was a hero and made just about everyone else around her ignorant fools.

0/10 If i could give a lower score i would and i didn't really even get into just how awful this show is. Not even ""so bad, it's good"" territory....just a shallow hateful mess."
1.0,"Feb 8, 2023","I will tell you honestly, you can find better in the original Scooby Doo Where Are You series we've grown to know and love as kids!!! This HBO original series is nothing compared to that original series as it contains the most graphic content you would never in any way expect in any cartoon featuring especially the character Velma, even if it is all about her life story!!! I would never dream to see such a horribly written new series that is supposed to be child friendly enough to feature one of the most recognizable television canine characters ever created by Hannah-Barbara! So if you want any advice from me as my own personal television critic, then look to the one and only Scooby Doo series that we're meant to be accustomed to viewing as entertaining and mystery solving!"
1.0,"Jan 25, 2023","Mean-spirited, self serving, show that portrays itself as an edgy story meant to challenge an unfair system but in actuality, appears to be Mindy Kahling inserting her teenage angst into a show meant to attract attention simply by being crass and off brand given it is apparently taking place as a Scooby Doo story sans Scooby Doo....in truth, Riverdale and Harley beat them to the punch and they do it with so much better writing.

I have zero issue with Velma being black or gay as I had always assumed Velma was of mixed race and that while unspoken in the past, she was gay.

I do have an issue with lazy, poor writing inserted into an established fandom simply for the attention the fandoms name would bring the new product.

Server: ""And the wine is to your liking""

Viewer: ""Well actually it isn't wine, not sure what it is actually but I know it's not wine""

Server (HBO): ""Wel that's really too bad, we call it wine....why do you say it's not wine""

Viewer: "" well, it has no grapes in it and it actually appears to be a collection of various past drinks all mixed together in a confusing and or otherwise, just a horrible tasting mess with the odd highlight which is quickly washed away by the other sour notes."""
8.0,"Jan 15, 2023","Wish I could give a zero star rating. It's super sad because I was looking forward to this spinoff as a life long Scooby Doo fan. It's really cringey and overly self-aware. Not sure who thought these tired jokes were actually funny or original.. many jokes in weird/poor taste (Hitler joke?!). Oddly forced sexualization of the characters and plot lines. Why smear this classic show?! It could've been an adult show while still paying homage to the OG. The only thing that related to the original was using the same names and outfits.. Rick and Morty knock off. Too say the very least, save your time and skip it."
6.0,"Jan 15, 2023","I would honestly rate this even lower if I could. The pacing's horrible, the jokes are worse, and so many unneeded changed to the original Scooby-Doo characters. I'm here for racial inclusivity, but really? They tried too hard to make an ""edgy"" project and just failed to make a good, even decent thing completely. It's just fundamentally bad on such a level, I genuinely think I'd rather sit watch paint dry than watch this abomination. The producers try too hard with edgy humor, and this show is for ""edgy"" millenials who wish they had ""more representation"" in media. Jokes seem poorly written and WAY too forced, and if a Gen Z (like myself) says your jokes are bad, you really messed up, because we laugh at everything."
1.0,"Jan 15, 2023","The show is definitely still finding itself, and can be almost too self aware (especially in the first episode) which comes off kind of cringey. What people seem to dislike is the show's mischaracterizations of our old beloved characters. I will admit it's not your childhood Scooby doo, but they needed to make some changes to make a show like this. The characters do need some work, but there are genuinely funny moments and I am excited to see where the mystery leads because that's what Scooby doo has always been about. People need to at least give it more of a chance. Especially as it develops and we see more of what the mystery is about and what we uncover about these characters."
1.0,"Jan 13, 2023","Charlie Grandy grew up in the 70's which is where these characters came from. He, I believe has many many issues with the Scooby-Doo show. Maybe was scared by the ghosts investigated by the Scooby-Doo team. How can someone write such garbage. Another of the writers is Mindy Kaling who also plays the voice of Velma. There are many ways to make an adult Cartoon, this is not one of them. The jokes are based on sexual inuendos that fall short of funny. Each Character is no way near the original from Scooby-Doo.

Yes they say this was written for adults and this is true. Kids should not be allowed to watch it. Do not watch this unless you are ready to accept these characters who fall short from the original.

Fred is a rich entitled teen.

Daphne is a typical mean girl.

Norville is a badly written shagy Velma is a self righteous person who believes she is better than everyone else.

HBO another failure allowed by you, and you allowed 2 seasons to be aired after such bad reviews after the first season."
1.0,"Jan 15, 2023","Considering that Mindy said she had a lot of love and respect for the character of Velma she definitely decided everything about her needed to change. Not just her the whole cast and they are all unlikeable and unrecognisable to their original counterparts. If they hadn't made this a scooby doo prequel this show would just be bad but forcing a beloved series to be associated with this is just wrong. It goes for shock and offense than try to be funny if they had included scooby I wouldn't be surprised if episode one they just started with him being euthanised and play it off as a joke.

Only positives I can say is the animation team definitely have put in the work but a turd covered in glitter is still a turd."
1.0,"Jan 15, 2023","I strongly stand by if you are going to work on an IP that is not yours, you must respect it first. And learn everything second, you could continue it with a whole new story or make it almost identical, doesn't matter, just know what you're doing. The writer's for this series have no respect for anything. They are to busy trying to play ""middle schoolers idea of edgy and dark"" to make anything even remotely entertaining, I realize I sound preachy, but as someone who's very passionate about this field it angers me more to see beloved franchises treated like this then Velmas dumb jokes. Please don't hate watch this, let it die."
1.0,"Aug 24, 2023","You know when older generations make attempts to appeal to younger audiences, but because they haven't been to highschool in twenty years and their youngest child just turned 23 so everything appears out of touch? That's what this show is.

I also have to wonder who the audience is, they make jokes that could have been written for a disney channel original while simultaneously attempting to cater to an older teen/young adult audience.

I have to ask why they don't just create their own show instead of slapping characters names on characters that aren't recognizable in personality at all. With a combination of flat and disjointed comedy combined with a bastardization of an already beloved show, I assume this is all a giant cash grab."
1.0,"Feb 7, 2023",Only character worse then Velma was Daphne. Seems like the jokes were between the creators then for the audience. It could have been good if HBO had spent some real money and got real writers like Angela Nissel or Andrea Savage and it could have been off the HOOK! Hopefully some day someone will try again and really in some effort and heart into it. Everyone loves Scooby-Doo and this new show is a failed attempt and waste of time. Seems rushed and and awkward at times. I want my 27 minutes of my life back!! First jokes was to let guys know they hate them and this show is not for them. You know what your right. There are 1000's of other things to watch other then the crap show called Velma.
1.0,"Feb 17, 2023",In all my years of watching television I have never seen a show that's so poorly done the show's jokes around funny it paints itself as a comedy even though the jokes just come off as being stale and not funny you have two great comedic geniuses working on the show and you're only using them as voice actors on top of that I found the show to be actually some racist and sexist. Personally I don't like seeing trends in society that think that we should knock one group down to give another group a leg up I think we can support all people I positive respectful way. Also this doesn't really feel like Scooby Doo.
1.0,"Jun 24, 2024","The show drips with satire and sarcasm. It goes about exposing the mindset and behaviours of modern day teens. It displays the shallowness and lack of awareness very well and pulls no punches. It presents teens as they are: mindless, self centred and without empathy or concern for others. This show will get a lot of people (teens) offside with its portrayal, but is an interesting watch, and is worth the time each episode takes to devour. It presents an interesting take on established characters, and is not for those who want a series about mystery solving in a bus. I'm enjoying the dynamic and will continue to watch."
8.0,"Jan 14, 2023",I thought it was ok but unnecessarily vulgar and profain. My grandson loves Scooby Doo but won't be able to watch this. After a single episode watched by 3 different face members nobody likes it or wants this mess. It's constantly trying to make you laugh and didn't succeed in an entire episode a single time. I don't know who approved this mess but if Discovery thinks it's what people want they will have a lot to learn where no one wants their service soon. It just mind boggling how bad they actually made such an easy show stink. I almost believe they are trying to make it fail and probably will if this is the trash they produce.
7.0,"Jan 25, 2023","I finished the pilot, and while I give some kudos for doing something different for the characters of Scooby Doo, I have admit this show is garbage. It's like The Room with none of the funny charm. It's a Scooby Doo show without Scooby Doo. Going TV-MA wasn't a good selling point, and trying to capture the Harley Quinn gold with the Scooby Doo IP let to a diamond hard piece of dog****. I don't fault the voice actors or anything, but the charm from the original Hanna-Barbara show is just absent here, and it's replaced with an ultra-vulgar and ultra-violent junk heap of a show that I really don't want to watch past the pilot. I normally don't wish this for any show, but I kinda hope it gets cancelled after the first season concludes.

I'm going to go watch the original show. Or Mystery Incorporated."
1.0,"Dec 18, 2023","Really poor show. Outdated jokes that feel like they're trying too hard to be funny and relevant. Doesn't feel anything like scooby doo show or a mystery inc. Show!

There's much better things to watch instead like vox machina which is a much better mystery and sharp funny humour.

Mindy's Velma is just a bunch of annoying teenagers with random dialogue. The show feels like an old boomer using all the latest buzzwords in a single sentence at a teen party in an embarrassing attempt to look cool.

Velma comes across as an annoying karen who can't even get basic equations right instead of a smart indian girl detective persona. Absolutely failed on making her Indian. The back stories are really weird and too far fetched.

The state of education and attitude and immaturity of the characters shows everything wrong with the US education system and how american pop culture promotes being stupid and no wonder why asian immigrants end up taking up all the jobs.

Mindy should have made this an original show instead of trying to force a weird mould onto the scooby doo universe.

Shaggy is horrible and wasted in the show esp without scooby."
1.0,"Jan 17, 2023","Okay, first problem is the jokes. From what I've seen, 90% of the jokes are dried out and unfunny. There are barely any scrap(py doo)s of comedy it's almost boring to watch. They also like to clown on their audience, as if the writers, in a last ditch attempt to save anyone of the horror that is ""Velma,"" made their best attempts at diverting any potential customer from this dumpster fire house of horrors. My second problem is the cast. In an attempt to be as original as possible, they changed the ENTIRE cast. To be clear, I don't care about the skin color changes. My problem was that they gave everyone entirely different character traits from the original. Shaggy doesn't even look like shaggy. They could have made him black but still look like shaggy. I could forgive all of this, everything I already said, if only they didn't do the worst thing imaginable, the unforgivable sin in the scooby doo universe; the removed SCOOBY DOO. Yes. They made the decision to remove the titular character, the icon of the series, the one and only, scooby doo. It's like when cerial companies sell boxes with only certain components of the cerial. Scooby doo, oops, no scooby doo. To add insult to injury, we don't even get a mere scrappy doo. For shame."
1.0,"Dec 19, 2023","I am one that still watches the original scooby doo tv shows and movies. The show makes it extremely clear that anyone like me is not their target audience. To be honest, I have no idea who it is. It is far too adult (immediately) for children and far too niche for the general public. It isn't funny, it isn't interesting. It feels like the creators make this just for them to watch in private screenings. It's a fan fiction gone bad. It's a bastardization of any of the source material. It's sad to say but hopefully this kills any possibility for remakes and get lost in the annals of history for the sake of generations to come."
1.0,"Nov 6, 2023","This show is an absolutely uninspired horrific mess with ""jokes"" that constantly fall flat and a tone that at times even the show doesn't seem to have a grasp on what it wants to be.

The biggest change that can't go unignored is the characters. I don't really care about the race changes at all but the personalities? Night and day. Velma is nowhere near the character that she is supposed to be derived from and neither are any of the others in the mystery inc. Gang.

The show feels more like someone wanted to make a new idea and use old characters because they knew without those characters, the show would fall flat on it's face.

The execution of the writing has to be my biggest gripe. With phrases such as ""hashtag"" and a million other acronyms that nobody has ever said once in real life. It feels like a bunch of millenial writers got drunk and wrote down what made them laugh. The writers have 0 grasp on who they are trying to portray in the show and it shows.

In all honesty, Im happy Scooby Doo was not in this show. It makes one less character for the writers to ruin with some weird ""edgy"" joke.

A word to the wise: when using an already established character, stick to their morals and characteristics and you'll actually write a good show. And for god's sake, not everyone who watches TV is into millenial humor, learn to be versatile while also figuring out what tone you want."
1.0,"Jan 14, 2023","A lot of people were right about this show being bad, so bad that it's not even worthy to receive any star rating from me. I'm not even going to bother to watch any other episode. What can I say, the characters were so unlikeable, the jokes were crappy, the stereotyping was uncalled for, the nudity in the beginning was just plain wrong, and I don't recognize the gang from the Mystery Inc. No redeemable qualities whatsoever but that's just my honest opinion. I think it was for the better that Scooby Doo doesn't make an appearance, I've said this once in YouTube comment section and I'll say it again; I shudder to think how Scooby would've been handled if he was introduced.

I'm sorry but this show's not for me and I wouldn't recommend this to anyone else. I'll stick with the classics like Scooby Doo and Scrappy Doo, thank you very much and have a nice day everyone. Oh, and one more thing; humping cockroaches? Did we really need to see that?"
1.0,"Jan 31, 2023","I'll admit the first 2 episodes felt like so much potential that wasn't landing, trying too hard to be edgy and crass at times... but 3 & 4 actually had me laughing quite a bit.

Stylistically and thematically this show is an acquired taste, but I'm starting to enjoy myself and I feel like the show is also finding its own voice, and getting its footing right.

Will it be great? Unclear.

But I've enjoyed Mindy Kailing's other work, and so I didn't wanna give up too soon. There is something there... a heart to it which does keep me invested. Also, I do love the cast and art style.

Personally, I'm glad I stuck around. And I'll probably be watching for the rest of the season."
1.0,"Jan 21, 2023","Hilarious and self-aware, Velma is her origin story before the Scooby gang unites to solve crimes. Because it's from her first person point-of-view, we see the modern high school world through her jaded, teenage vision. The humor rises from her fast-paced, pop-culture, tech driven view of the world.

It's the animated cousin of Edgar Cantero's novel, 'Meddling Kids'.

This is not the 'G' rated Scooby show. It's more of an animated Scream/Riverdale high school murder mystery which contains language and suggestive teenage thoughts and actions. It clearly shows personal pain and PTSD from past trauma and denial. And it all works.

The truth: if this wasn't a part of the ScoobyVerse it would be praised for skewering the tame 60s/70s depiction of rebooted animated blandness."
7.0,"Feb 7, 2023","The only positive about Velma, it united everyone on all sides, to agree this show should not exist. This abomination is a talentless rip-off of a far better adult cartoon...HBO's Harley Quinn. Velma is the She-Hulk of adult animation, and somehow worse. Fowl, bitter, cruel, spiteful, mean spirited, tone deaf, and very self aware of all this doing just to upset audiences. The idea of an adult comedy version of the Scooby-Doo characters is worth exploring and I welcome it, but this was very fowl. I actually forgot I was watching what was suppose to be the Scooby-Doo characters at heart and spirit, because this show makes the Scooby Doo IP a far far secondary. Mindy Kaling is not the real Velma. Mindy Kaling plays herself in the body of a 15 year-old teenager being mean spirited with unnecessary use of nudity, genital shaming, drug dealing, hating while also crushing/flirting with racism, the list goes on. No imagination, no creation of a character you wish you could be. Mindy Kaling placed her own identity in Velma, and Velma is despicable. Where are all the parents from the 90s who protested South Park as mean-spirited hate? Velma is the show that 1990s parents were accusing South Park of being. South Park got slammed by parents, despite the fact South Park is a well-written comedy. While Velma is pure rotten garbage.

First off, one of the biggest problems is the comedy. It's not funny, and feels wrongfully out of place. Episode 2 got one little chuckle out of me and that was it for two whole episodes.

Second, it's far from subtle in its social messaging themes, while also mocking them. The messages get crammed into your face and it becomes very eye rolling. It's purple hair The Last Jedi level bad. Good stories will not forcefully include socially acceptable themes. They'll do so in a clever, less than obvious manner, and subtly serve the story and character developments. Velma, both verbally and non-verbally, shouts and beats you over the head constantly with them. And this is just within the first 2 episodes! In Harley Quinn, Harley and Poison Ivy don't fall in-love until end of season 2, after building it up and well-establishing the two characters should be together. In Velma, this happens in episode 2 for no reason.

Third, this show wants to have the same dark and raunchy adult comedy you get in Harley Quinn. With loads of graphic violence, sex, cockroach sex, all the profanity, drug dealing, PTSD, sucky rich people, and everything else you'd expect in Scooby-Doo. If you're curious in knowing what is wrong with Velma, watch the first 2 minutes of Episode I, before the title credit even shows. Right out the gate, after an opening jab at origin stories which focus on white males struggling with more power we get an all female shower scene with nudity featuring high school teenage girls ages ranging between 13-17. Follow with Velma, committing full-out physical assault on Daphne for no good or comical reason, and getting away with it. This is our immediate introduction into Kaling's created world. Fred is introduced as a blatant dumb racist who Velma dislikes but is also sexually attracted to. Later, Fred seeks the attention of his classmate's in the hallway by cutting off another teenager's leg. Later, Velma trespasses into Fred's home resulting in him getting knee-capped by lesbian police. Velma, boosts out loud, if she were a white male she would want to get away with murder too, while Fred gets wrongfully arrested for murder without evidence.

These ""Scooby-Doo"" characters are straight-up vile villains, and the show's creator wants them to be this way. The Scooby characters are all extremely unlikable. Classic characters who were never vile beings with villainous traits, and yet here they are. In Harley Quinn, they're bad guys, it's what they do. Hate Velma for making me quote Suicide Squad.

Key changes are made to these characters without it being better written into the story, instead there is no real creative reason for these changes. Also, we have Velma, Daphne, Fred, but not Shaggy? Instead we get Norville. I get it, he'll get introduced to weed and become Shaggy later. How ""clever"". Immediate annoyance at this obvious misfire of comedy. He should start off as a stoner loser who goes on to show his talents with mysteries.

There are 2 ways to look at Velma...

1) This was a long time passion project for the creator.

2) This was a project in-which the creator had no interests in doing but did it.

No matter which one of these is accurate, both badly reflects the showrunner's credibility.

As a millennial, I honestly don't know who this show is for. Velma's creator is not funny and Velma is a disastrously unfunny tone deaf abomination. This is a show that does not know what it is. Again, I forgot this was supposedly Scooby-Doo. What She Hulk and Velma have in common is their both out to troll trollers by sacrificing story, characters, any all intentions of good just to purposefully make audiences hate it. A better written show like South Park will do this successfully by making the incorporated message secondary to the story. Velma, it's sprayed constantly and comes out of nowhere for no reason or purpose at all. Velma might be worse than dumpster fire bad. A real shame too, because there could be something fun here. However, it needed someone who was not MK, and someone who actually likes or has some level of respect for the handling of the Scooby-Doo IP."
1.0,"Jan 15, 2023","As a devoted Scooby Doo enthusiast, I find it disheartening when a new rendition strays so far from the essence of the original series. It's akin to a betrayal of the source material, as if the creators have discarded everything that made the franchise iconic and beloved. While I understand the desire to put a fresh spin on familiar stories, it feels like they've disregarded the very essence that drew fans in the first place. It's not just about adapting narratives; it's about respecting the core elements that fans have cherished for years. When those elements are discarded or fundamentally altered, it's difficult to connect with the new version. It's like losing a part of what made the franchise special in the first place, leaving fans feeling disconnected and disillusioned."
1.0,"Apr 27, 2024","We are meant to believe this is an adult parody of the mystery inc gang. But not a single character shares characteristics from their iconic selves, so what are they parodying? Every character is completely unrecognizable and awful. They are all just mean spirited to their core. It's quite obvious that Scooby-doo is not the inspiration for this show. They wanted to do a show mimicking Harley Quinn but if Harley was filled with hatred for her squad. Daphné is nothing more then a carbon copy of Harley's girlfriend Poison Ivy. We are supposed to believe that those kids will become friends one day but it's impossible to feel like they could be friends. The group has no dynamic whatsoever, in the original each of the kids have a role to play. Fred is the leader and the one who comes up with the plans, Velma is the detective, Daphné is the bait who poses as a damsel in distress but then she subverts expectations by being the most capable in a fight, and Shaggy and Scooby are the hearth of the show. The creators of Velma had no clue what each of the characters brought to the team so instead they made everyone pointless except for Velma who not only is the detective but also takes Fred's role as the leader and the person with a plan. Daphné takes the same role as Poison Ivy, she's there to back up her girlfriend. Fred is the character they really want us to hate for no reason and Norville (Shaggy) is just there to simp for Velma."
2.0,"Feb 6, 2023","To be really, REALLY honest, there's no way this is a Scooby-Doo show, it has nothing to do with Scooby-Doo because it's basically from a different Scooby-Doo universe where Scooby-Doo doesn't exist, and there's different people of the gang from Scooby-Doo with the same names. I really don't understand why they would make this garbage. I hope it disappears on HBO Max, because this show is very unnecessary to make. Why would they make this? Who cares what people imagine what's in a different universe? I would prefer to see an actual Scooby-Doo show from the original universe and with the same characters!"
1.0,"Jan 20, 2023","I grew up with the Scooby Doo franchise and have been in love ever since I first saw it.

I even used to own every piece of Scooby Doo media that I could find on DVD at the time. Hearing about a spinoff with one of my favorite characters should've been a good thing, however I was sorely mistaken.

""Scoob"" was already such a disappointment, so this new ""Velma"" being a blow really made things all the more sour.

The wholesome fun, gags, and anticipation of mystery has dissipated. All that's left is the stereotypical sass, sex, drugs, and other pointless nonsense that shows and movies have become over saturated with.

I wouldn't watch this alone, and I especially would never put someone through the pain of watching it with me."
1.0,"Jan 13, 2023","How dare you take a wholesome iconic character and turn it into something sordid and nasty. And then renew this shameful excuse for a series.

I grew up watching Scooby Doo and continue to watch each series and the movies. I was excited to see this series and began watching it. I couldn't get through the first episode. It was so repulsive - on multiple levels - and an utter disgrace to the entire Scooby Doo franchise. This franchise is iconic in its formula - a good wholesome cartoon. The excessive cursive and sexual innuendos just don't work.

The HBO and WB execs that signed off on this should be terminated - and so should this series."
1.0,"Jan 14, 2023","If you like bojack horseman or camp dingleberry, you will like this show.

DISCLAIMER: this show has absolutely nothing to do with scooby doo and that world, the creators just wanted to steal the fanbase of that show for views. To cover their butts the creators added ""jokes"" and nods to the original series, as well as use the names of the characters but other than that it a whole new show.

BUT once you remove the fact that you have been lied to, the show is alright.

The story overall is decent; 3 mysteries are the story arc for season 1 (velma trying to find missing mom, daphnes mom, and finding a serial killer). I binged it in a day and while i dont think it is a show that could hold my attention if i sat and watched it, it is good for casual watching and doing laundry.

It moves at an enjoyable pace so you arent skipping 5 minutes at a time to get to the next plot point and it has quick references in the dialog if you happened to miss a part.

This isnt a gut busting comedy, but again if you like bojack or dingleberry comedy where they try to be contain outrageous, this show is for you."
1.0,"Jan 14, 2023","I would like to start off by saying that I haven't watched the original Scooby Doo series nor the spin offs.

Usually, I like Mindy Kaling's productions and her writing but this was atrocious. Who is this show intended for ? If it's for adults, is it supposed to be funny? Is it supposed to be ""Shock"" television saying things that are against the grain? For me it is neither, it lacks substance , it's not funny and the characters are forgettable.

With an all-star cast like this, they could've created something quite decent but the writing is atrocious! This is getting all the hate it deserves and there are PLENTY of better adult TV Shows than this pile of junk.

I felt compelled to write my first review after being a member for nearly a decade to fore-warn people not to waste any of their precious time watching this vile, ghastly affair.

0/10."
1.0,"Feb 12, 2023","...and got so far. But in the end all it amounted to was an unwatchable mess. Not everything about the show is bad. The animation is fine and I took no issues with the acting. I just don't understand why this is a Scooby-Doo show.

It's like bringing back a treat from everyone's childhood but changing the recipe. It isn't the same thing. I don't want new Coke. New Coke sucks and tries too hard. The directions and dialogue are too distracting for me to enjoy that cool, crisp taste. Instead all I taste is forced jokes and failed attempts to be meta. It tries so hard to be edgy without knowing what makes edgy appealing and instead comes off as disconnected and mean. I want Classic Coke. There's a reason why it's classic. And there's nothing wrong with putting a twist on a old classic but this was a few steps too far.

Ultimately, I don't know why this show exists. What are they trying to do? What are they trying to say? Why is this a Scooby-Doo show? If they had said it was something else I'm sure it would have gone over better. Just no. Squandered potential."
8.0,"Jan 23, 2023","Dear God no, but for how bad it was, there are at least three things I have to give it credit for.

#1: There were times when it did look visually stunning, mainly during the hallucination scenes.

#2: This show tried to break out of the mold of what we expect a Scooby Doo show to be like. They failed horribly, but they tried none the less.

#3: The overall plot was ingenious and really showed that this was more of an adult remake.

I feel this show had some potential, but it seems, to me at least, that Mindy Kaling was trying to push her views rather than create a show that people could enjoy."
7.0,"Jan 13, 2023","I honestly have no idea what I just witnessed,I tried to give this show a fair chance,but it was truly awful,the jokes if you can call them that fell completely flat Velma was basically just Mindy being herself,there is no Scooby Doo at all from what I've seen they exaggerated all the worst qualities of the rest of the supposed mystery inc. They totally changed all the characters and pretty much made them caricatures of themselves,the messed up part is I've been wanting a more adult Scooby Doo show for a good while where they might solve murders and junk, unfortunately we got this turd of a show,if you want more adult style Scooby that's actually worth watching check out Scooby natural. Velma is absolutely not the show I've been waiting for 😞"

It's just a complete mess written by someone who hadn't watched a single scooby doo."
1.0,"Jan 12, 2023","Can anyone criticize this show without being labeled a sexist or racist? Probably not. So with that knowledge going forward I will take my lumps and just say that this is an objectively bad show based on an objectively bad premise. Nearly everything about this show is just moronic and ill-conceived. Being a try-hard show is extremely obvious from the very first scene. Cartoons can be very adult and crudely funny but the writing has to be there, just watch Big Mouth and you will see what I'm talking about. The blatant 21st century ""edginess"" attempted, and subversivness of expectaions, toward an IP over 50 years old is to be expected by people who really have no talent in furthering the narrative or desire to enhance and enrich the characters and stories. This really is like giving the keys to the kingdom to a bunch of 14 year-old kids who think they, and they alone, can make REAL comedy. They think understand the nuances of humor and are writing a masterpiece but in reality they aren't talented enough to even invent their own IP that can stand on its own so they stand on the back of something already established and still manage to fall spectacularly.

Let's be clear, nothing....and I mean NOTHING about this show is related directly to Scooby-Doo outside of character names and vague parallels of a group of teens solving some sort of mystery. The irony of it all is that had they not attempted to attach it to this franchise and just created their own show people wouldn't even criticize or make allusions to it being a rip-off of Scooby-Doo because it bears almost no similarities. People would be judging it solely on the merits that any show gets judged on. It would fare better and not get as much hate. Don't get me wrong, it's a bad show, no doubt, but it's an abomination as a Scooby show spin-off. This show shouldn't exist and if there is any justice in this world it gets cancelled immediately as a show of understanding by Warner Bros. That they made a huge mistake by green-lighting this farce. This is not what the public wants and as a business there is no profit in alienating your audience."
1.0,"May 3, 2024","Awful show with no redeeming quality or reason to watch. I'm surprised that it got greenlit and aired. With all the things the WB is shelving, how did they miss this hot mess of garbage. This show looked like they were trying to imitate what worked with Harley Quinn, but like if a person with two left feet and both of their legs were asleep tried to copycat a professional ballroom dancer.

They totally crapped all over the source material and basically give a middle finger to the audience and fanbase. They are like the toxic slug version of their characters. Can't believe I sat through both episodes, but I kept hoping for something of value or positive to say about the show, but there's nothing good about this show."
1.0,"Jan 16, 2023","An updated story line surrounding mental health and a comedic reimagined perspective with a coming of age tale makes for a fun laugh along mystery that is entertaining. The all star cast lends additional fun with cameos and appearances but unlike the original scooby shows, this builds on known a established episode by episode for a fun origin story of the mystery inc gang we all love but more deeply developed characters influencing their decisions. Somehow even with the plots being heavily adult themed or scary it is still a fun watch with just enough of nostalgia to remind you of why you clicked in the first place."
1.0,"Jan 14, 2023","All the hate this show is getting is completely warranted and it deserves even more. This show makes you detest the writers, as it feels like they detest you. Vulgar for vulgarities sake. So far off from all previous iterations of Scooby-Doo. I didn't laugh once while watching this, but I cringed several times. This was truly atrocious, a mockery of all previous iterations of the Scooby-Doo franchise. It is as if they took the worst aspects of adult cartoons and put them atop a watered down husk of Scooby-Doo characters. None of the jokes landed, the characters are unbearable, and it comes off as more of an insulting parody than anything else. Embarrassing."
1.0,"Jan 16, 2023","The show is so excruciatingly awful to sit through due to the lack of any ounce of subtlety. Everything is laid out in a ""I'm-calling-out-this-cliché-so-when-I-still-do-it-I-sound-so-smart-and-ironic"" but that just makes it even worse. I hope everyone involved remember this as their lowest point. I also just hate the shock value and ""ironic"" humor they rely on. It's like they're trying to emulate Family Guy but make themselves cool and edgy. It's so utterly uninspired and full of itself at the same time. It just feels like Mindy Kaling is appropriating these characters solely for their name and image, and then creating characters that have no relation to their mainline counterparts."

Maybe try coming up with your own material, but even then, like I stated before, this show has nothing good to offer other than being some annoying background music while you try to overpower the sound of a vacuume."

I don't understand why you have to take the Mystery gang and dumb them down instead of making your own creation. Fred is just stupid in this show. Oh and the trailer made making fun of the traditional fan base was a super low blow and is one of many reason I don't think this show will see much success. Im not sure why the writers just couldn't create their own fresh story and characters instead of butchering these iconic characters. This is sad.

They are trying to make a show without the star scooby. There a reason why the show was called scooby doo.

Honestly if your not going to have the characters realistic of the gang why have them. If shaggy isn't a stoner why have him. It's whole personality is a stoner. Taking that away is like not have scooby doo."

Nothing ""scooby doo"" about it, none of the characters stay true to their original themes and all the characters and story is about sex and validation. Why can't a kids show just be a kids show about mystery and friendship, if they wanted it to be adult they could have just handled deeper topics of death and loss. Give them a reason to be banded together and searching for a mystery, maybe their family/parents disappeared. Mystery Incorporated was a cartoon show yet handled deeper topics than this and was able to provide a much more coherent story while still keeping true to the material.

2.0,"Apr 12, 2024","This show is called Velma and before it released the catch was its different from the original so folks rating it and hating it because it's not like it original is crazy. It's not amazing but nowhere near as bad as people are saying, it's a good kind of corny comedy mixed in with murder mystery. Before watching it forget 90% of the stuff you know about the original scooby do because this is not that. If your watching because you heard it was bad and want to see then of course you'll think it's bad, watch it with a open mind. Once again it's not the greatest show but nowhere near as bad as people are saying. The plot is basically it's taking place from Velma's point of view, her mom went missing and she's been trying to find her while sorta sacrificing her social life in the process, while looking for her mom a serial killer is on the loose and as she searches for her mom she finds that the search for her mom and for the town serial killer are starting to intertwine, while all that is going on shaggy, Fred and Daphne are facing personal problems as well and theirs also sorta intertwine with the search for Velma's mom and the town serial killer. The characters aren't like the original, some of the humor is corny and inappropriate, and it's not like the original scooby do cartoons but it's a pretty good show. Watch with a open mind."
1.0,"Jan 13, 2023","Well I finally watched Velma and it was just as eye rollingly awful as I expected it to be. This is one of those projects that I'm asking myself what is it that these Hollywood Executives are smoking when they give this project the okay to go pass the pre-preduction stage, this is up there with projects like Jeepers Creepers: Reborn (2022), Netflix's Resident Evil (2022), Netflix's Cleopatra (2023) and Madame Web (2024).

Positives for Velma (2023-): There is points in the show where the animation is really good. And finally, the episodes are all under 30 minutes long, so I didn't suffer through a lot.

Negatives for Velma (2023-): The ""characters"" are literally just caricatures, they all have one characteristic about them and nothing else. The dialogue is some of the worst that I've ever seen in a form of media, forget about that infamous line of dialogue from Velma cause that's the least of its problems. Mindy Kaling's Velma is probably the most unlikable and insufferably annoying ""character"" you can have as the main protagonist of your movie or TV show. Every single storyline is some of the most cynical and abysmal eye rolling stuff that I've watched in the 26 years of my life.

There's nothing else I can say, but Velma (2023-) sucks and it's a show that needs to be seen to be believed."
1.0,"Apr 9, 2023","Velma is, hands down, one of the worst shows I have ever had the displeasure of watching. From the very first episode, it became quite apparent that this series was nothing more than a poor attempt at capitalizing on the success of the Scooby-Doo franchise. Despite its promising premise, the execution falls flat in every possible way.

One of the biggest issues with Velma is its complete disregard for the beloved characters and their personalities. Velma Dinkley, who is typically portrayed as a highly intelligent and resourceful member of the Mystery Inc. Gang, is reduced to a mere shell of her former self. She is portrayed as angsty, irritable, and self-absorbed, which is not only completely out of character but also incredibly uninteresting to watch.

Not only does the characterization of Velma miss the mark entirely, but the supporting cast is equally disappointing. The other members of Mystery Inc. Are reduced to cardboard cutouts with no depth or purpose other than to simply orbit around Velma's self-centered life. The chemistry and camaraderie that were a trademark of the original series are completely nonexistent in this iteration, making for an incredibly dull and uninspiring watch.

Furthermore, the plot of Velma is convoluted and poorly constructed. It tries to take a more serious and mature tone, but instead comes across as forced and contrived. The mysteries themselves lack any real suspense or cleverness, and the attempts at adding depth and complexity to the storytelling fall flat. It feels like the writers were trying too hard to deviate from the classic Scooby-Doo formula, resulting in a messy and unenjoyable narrative.

Another major drawback of Velma is its animation. The art style is bland and lacks the charm and vibrancy that fans of the original series have come to expect. The characters' designs are unappealing and lack the distinctiveness that made them so iconic. It is apparent that little effort was put into creating visually compelling and engaging visuals, further contributing to the overall underwhelming nature of the show.

In conclusion, Velma is a prime example of a failed attempt to resurrect a beloved franchise. From its poorly written characters to its lackluster storytelling and uninspiring animation, there is very little redeeming about this show. Fans of Scooby-Doo will be sorely disappointed with this lackluster spin-off, and any potential new viewers should steer clear if they are looking for quality entertainment. Velma deserves to be forgotten and buried in the annals of television history."

How this won any award outside of a razzle, is beyond me. The writers have to shove every trope inside every episode. We get it. You hate white people, but does it need to be spelled out in every episode? The ""jokes"" aren't funny and barely recognized. The continuity issues plague the show episode to episode. This show would have had a shot at being good if any of the writers actually watched the host content. If I could insert the sound of a toilet being flushed, it would still be too kind of a review."

Terrible, just terrible, it's trying to be edgy, be shocking for the sake of being shocking, oh and make fun of stereotypes and so on but it's execution and concept is horrendous... It's honestly an insult to the creators of Scooby Doo and an insult to it's fan base that grew up with the shows... If you thought that the Freddy Prince Jr live action Scooby Doo movie was the worse you have ever seen, well it's a masterpiece compared to this trainwreck of a show... Fingers crossed it's not renewed... Just yikes... Or should I say jinkies that was terrible..."
7.0,"Sep 20, 2023","I've watched a lot of bad shows, and I mean a lot of bad shows. Usually they make me laugh, I enjoy watching bad shows to make fun of how truly awful they are. I say all this to make it clear that I usually have no problem finishing a bad show. This is different, the utter agony I felt while trying to make it through the first episode can't be properly described. It took all of my willpower to not chuck my TV out the window sitting through this mess. This has nothing to do with scooby-doo, the dog isn't there, the characters have all been changed to the point where they are unrecognizable, and to top it all off the main character is one of the worst written abominations i've ever encountered. This show is more like a ""try not to quit watching"" challenge than a piece of entertainment. If you think you can survive it, please know the risk to your mental health."
1.0,"Feb 8, 2023","Genuinely terrible. After some friends said it was really bad I decided I wanted to see watch it and get a taste of how bad it really was. It was MUCH worse than I thought. Just who thought it was a good idea to make an adult scooby doo? It isn't funny goofy or at all enjoyable. Seriously just put a bad taste on the nostalgic franchise. I'm not much of a hater for tv shows but I wanted to come here to tell you this and make sure you don't waste your time watching this show. Bad pacing, unfunny and overall easily the worst show of 2023 and I can say that one month into the year. Moral of the story: Just don't watch it."
1.0,"Jan 14, 2023","Ok so, I'll start with the positives..... This won't take long

Positives: The animation is pretty good. It doesn't look cheap, nice colors, and the hallucination scenes look pretty good. You can tell there's some money behind this show and it doesn't look stiff and crappy compared to something like Johnny test or something.

Negatives: Literally everything else. This show is the worst adult animation family guy wannabee tropes all rolled into one. References, unfunny sex jokes, characters are literal idiots and its just not funny. For some reason every character was written to just be a total obnoxious jerk. Velma and Daphne are jerks, fred is a wimpy rich boy and poor shaggy is like a nice guy. Even though he's the butt of the joke, Shaggy is still the most likeable character on the show. Poor shaggy, they turned him into a wimpy guy obsessed with wanting to date Velma but doesn't take the hints that she doesn't like him.....and he's the only one I'm rooting for on the show. They even have a joke where he helps her out of her hallucinations by making her laugh by admitting his love for her. Zoinks! It's just all around painful! I mean, maybe this show can improve in the 2nd season if they just stop thw awful family guy style jokes, write actual mysteries and make the characters likeable.

TL:DR Good animation is wasted on terrible jokes and characters."
1.0,"Jan 15, 2023","This show is truly a great spin on classic Scooby Doo. It's very funny and very well written. The jokes are biting and clever and I was laughing every few minutes.

It's very similar to the office where few characters are actually ""likeable"" from the start but as the show continues, they become much more likable, despite their quirks and faults.

This show has an ""Office"" feel but pushes the envelope even more than The Office. It has a few moments where you might say ""did they just 'go there?!'"".

The animation style is great and the voice acting is well done.

I love Velma's backstory and can't wait to see the rest of season 1."
1.0,"Jan 17, 2023","HBO really got rid of all their animations projects just to put this out?

Boring and annoying characters that basically get rid of all the charismatic and loveable personality of the mystery gang we all knew and loved, swapping it it with a generic, teen drama for each member.

Velma is as annoying as modern day Lisa from the Simpsons, Daphne is your stereotypical meangirl just so Mindy Kalling as Velma can let all the bottled up hate she had in highschool I guess, Fred is now the butt of every joke and harrasment, and Norville tries to be what Shaggy was, but isn't most of the time, him trying to get Velma to be with him, just for her to manipulate him and cuck him with Daphne wasn't necesary. Like, who asked for this show to be like this? At least if you are going to make a Scooby Doo prequel, make it interesting, and not this.

It tries to ""be for adults"" when it mostly seems to do the same lazy jokes and meta references every modern day show ever has done, plus, was it really necessary to have the show insult the viewer if they still watched animated shows? IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, WHY ARE YOU AN ANIMATED SHOW IN THE FIRST PLACE?

Also minus points for not having Scooby."
1.0,"Nov 27, 2023","Another exhibit of: take popular/beloved IP and give it to hateful and incompetent writers. I am convinced that if you tell an AI to write the script for this show's synopsis it would be better than what we got here. It is mind boggling how this script got approved by anyone that read it. The so called ""jokes"" are so juvenile and heavy handed you would expect to find them in some (awful) children cartoon, but this show markets itself for adults, so they don't work at all.

All the characters in this show are the most hateable characters you will ever see; they are only in name related to the original Scooby-Doo. Seriously, if this show was called anything else and was not using the Scooby-Doo IP you wouldn't even know the main character was supposed to be Velma.

You will not find in this any comedy, any intriguing plot or anything worthwhile; only cringe and a poorly written self-insert fanfiction from the writers who should never find another job in the industry ever again after this fiasco."
1.0,"Jan 15, 2023","Oh my god, Velma is nothing but a disgrace to the Scooby Doo franchise the new characters in this show are just forgettable and Norville looks like a lazy rehash of Shaggy Rogers, it also uses a lot of dirty jokes and Warner Brothers did this for you know well money and if this show got renewed for a second season i am not watching that rubbish none of the characters in this show are likable instead they act obnoxious and unsympathetic at the same time. This is also one of the worst shows from the 2020s next to Thomas And Friends All Engines Go, this show is so terrible that makes Be Cool Scooby Doo look like a good show in comparison."
1.0,"Sep 16, 2023",The idea for the show was really interesting to me and was stoked to hear about it and I was really hoping we were getting another Harley Quinn type show with this one I had such high hopes the trailers looked decent and mindy kaling tends to be good when it comes to comedy shows like I loved Kelly in the office and the fact that she wrote most of my favourite episodes of the office really gave me high hopes but this is just boring and cringy at best. The shaggy character just sucked. Then for a brief moment I had hope when I heard the voice of the golden god himself I got excited but even the comedy genius of the great Glenn howerton could save this train wreck of a show.
1.0,"Jan 12, 2023","It's not that the ppl are mad at an adult scooby doo, it's the fact that this isn't that. The gag: there is no scooby doo in this show. I saw somewhere Kaling mentions that it's and adult show and no one wants to see a talking dog. Kaling must not be aware of a myriad of shows especially family guy. I am utterly disappointed because as an adult, 26, I am elated when my child hood ips grow up with me instead of being rebooted for the same modern demographic. This show has nothing to do with the originals outside of the character names and colors. My main question:WHO IS THIS FOR? Every character is insufferable. The diversity is lazy. The characters are all diverse it seems to just meet a quota and mark a check box. None of their cultural backgrounds have anything to do with their characters, well except for Fred. This shouldn't matter but I am a black women. I find the constant berating of Fred unfunny and like commentary of someone making fun of what they think Twitter feels about white men. If that even makes sense. For this to be an adult show the humor feels very middle school. I have laughed once and I can't even tell u what that was I don't remember. The show makes a nod to Riverdale and maybe that's even the point. Trying to create satire of what has made shows like Riverdale popular. But that's the thing, there isn't another show like Riverdale. And as someone who has watched every bizzare episode I'll tell you what makes the show stick with its loyal audience: the character relationships. Velma struggles the most in this area. Every single relationship is terrible. That is quite literally what made the ""gang"" in scooby doo stick. Each character brought their own strengths, weakness and personality to the whole ensemble. It was a formula that worked for decades and one that, in my opinion, each new iteration did a great job at modernizing( in all ways besides diversity). I don't want to spoil this show for those who may want to watch it and I do want to point out the animation is incredible, great job to that part of the team. But to sum up how I feel about Velma I will refer to a comment I saw on a YouTube video:' it feels like all the actors are phoning in their performances and the show feels like an AI generated show (this is a very funny comment)'. Velma feels like another show wanted to be made but the scooby doo ip was slapped on top of it. It feels like a lazy social commentary whose writers are more full of hate than humor. It's a diatribe that mimicks the perception of the biggest Twitter topics lol. It feels like a bunch of middle age adults trying to 'be cool'. I honestly think the show would have been better received if it didn't have the beloved names and colors of the icons from Scooby-doo. But alas here we are... Jinkies!"
8.0,"Jan 13, 2023","I honestly tried with this series of season one but after the first few minutes after the title card went by I lost interest... Then to make sure I wasn't missing anything I watched some other peoples reviews who were actual scooby doo fans (as I wasn't a big one myself); they confirmed my suspicions about how carelessly that Mindy Kaylin and the writers had botched this series.

Then when didn't think it could get any worse; a season two came out and after watching the trailer it seems that the writing staff had learned nothing from season one. I'm not even going to give season 2 a chance because season one was such a steaming pile of shiet. Please series writers do better; I mean I just got a job writing a Storyline for a horror role playing game and even with my baseline idea that I came up with in less than a minute I am already miles ahead of this show that is going nowhere after two seasons."
6.0,"Jan 12, 2023","This is probably the worst thing ever put to screen, Chat-GPT delivers better zingers than this woeful excuse for comedy or entertainment, has made edginess dull, intolerable in every sense and yet Max dumps season 2 out who are you that is watching and enjoying this? Are you ok?

Token haha tropes that are actually just surface level and not meta or biting commentary, Glenn Howerton, why?

Tired of the bubble, out of touch with what is actually good and funny as opposed to an echo chamber of self reflection, the character of Velma is perhaps the most grating protagonist of all time, perhaps in any media."
1.0,"Jan 14, 2023","This show is good, well produced and beautifully animated. It has a unique charm thanks to the animation, giving it a great slap-stick feel.

It is not the best thing to ever shine on my eyeballs but by no means the worst. The narrative that it is pissing on the source material is falls as it clearly diverges from it quickly in to something new. But also keeping a feel of the old. Making it fun to follow along every week to se what this version of my childhood characters are doing.

I hope for a good season finally and for some humans to hink critically about new additions to IP's. Sadly only one of those seems likely. Time to grow up and learn to have fun!"
1.0,"Jan 13, 2023","After spending precious time watching episodes 1 and 2 of Velma, I have come to realise that I would never ever recover the time I spent watching absolute garbage. This show insults the memory of the Scooby-doo cartoons. And Mindy Kalling has clearly lost the plot when it comes to producing and starring in Velma. All the male characters are either weak or useless. And there is absolutely no cooperation at all between the main characters in the gang. I would not try to influence your thinking, so you are most welcome in watching Velma. But please don't blame anyone else if you feel that you've wasted your time."
1.0,"Jan 14, 2023","I don't know who this garbage is aimed at, but it's certainly not any demographic I can think of.

Awful characterisation, terrible dialogue, not one joke that takes off, never mind lands. Even the animation is terrible, it actually looks unfinished, like they ran out of cash midway through and were forced to just throw this out to cover some kind of contractual obligation.

This show really had the potential to be amazing a la Harley Quinn, especially considering the calibre of some of the voice talent and production team involved, but what's actually been created is an unbearable mess of lazy writing, crass intention, and the legacy of one of animations most golden IP's left in a pile of dirt.

Doured out ten minutes of this garbage before I had to put it off. How this could have been saved from the swingeing axe at Warner Discovery, but projects like Batgirl were canned is really beyond me.

Just AWFUL. Avoid."
1.0,"Jan 13, 2023","They couldn't have made it worse if they tried. Honestly every second of it is painful to get through, none of the jokes are funny, everything feels forced, the characters are unlikable, it's an absolute garbage fire. Don't waste your time on this, in fact, between all the good shows HBO max just got rid of and then airing this, I'd recommend canceling your subscription. That's what I did, I don't see the point in paying for this garbage. How in the world did this get green lit? How do any of the writers for this show actually have paying jobs? It's as if they scraped the bottom of the barrel in terms of facebook boomer humor, gave it a greasy coat of paint, and then flushed it down a recently used Taco Bell public toilet. What the hell."
1.0,"Jan 13, 2023","How bad is it? That's a question I've been asking myself recently, so out of sheer curiosity, I decided to give it a shot.

Let's just say there's not much I need to say that hasn't been already been trumpeted around the digital universe. This show has many repulsive qualities, including horrible character makeovers that make them genuinely despicable. The comedy is frustratingly dull, and the uninspired attempts to convince audiences that the ""jokes"" really ARE funny, well, it's a display of egocentric writers (and creators) who believe they are masters of their craft no matter what.

What about the connections to Scooby Doo? They've been incinerated by its creator, who seemed to be channeling her own personal garbage into the title character. There were a few tiny glimmers of good ideas every now and then, but they are very few and VERY far between.

The animation itself is actually pretty decent, but it's nowhere near enough to rescue this lifeless spinoff."
1.0,"Jan 12, 2023","This is raunchy, disgusting, obscene, and just god awful. I've been a huge fan of these characters for over 40 years and this is just awful no inclination of these characters and who they are supposed to be. The animation is awful, the story is worse, the characters are obnoxious and no signs of the characters people have loved for 50 years.

Why do we need porn in a Scooby show?

How did Warner Brothers okay this but cancel Young Justice?

I honestly think this is the worst tv show I've ever set through it had no redeemable qualities at all.

If you wanted to create such an awful piece of trash why attach names of some of the most beloved cartoon characters of all time come up with your own characters."
1.0,"Jan 19, 2023","If you want an edgy adult comedy reboot of a beloved franchise focused on fleshing out prominent female characters in a modern way. Watch Harvey quinn. I think Harvey quinn is a very flawed show, and think the secind half of season 2 was kinda abismol. But its actually enjoyable and has a fun plot in season 1 that picks up again by season 3. Velma on the other hand, is another tedious and stale trainwreck.

Obviously it could improve its plot, but when you start at a 2/10 you don't go much higher than a 2/10 without severe shakeups. 5/10 can often just be a shaky start, but not 2/10. As someone who was a massive scooby doo mystery Inc. Fan, the franchises last attempt to promote itself to a slightly older audiance, this is insulting. I'm not one of the annoying people going on about race or gender, I have zero problems with that. It's the fact you've turned them all into bland and unlikeable people. Velma has been transformed into a self insert botched version of daria. The character who's meant to be replacing shaggy feels just like some random background character with zero development who just isn't shaggy. And Fred has went from a slightly stupid obssesive jock, to a rich a*se. Like yeah he has a rich a*hole design with the shirt and the ascot, but you've completely taken all his defining traits just to make jokes about how much of a douche he is... like, if you want to make characters realistic, make them realistic, don't turn them into parody of themselves that somehow manage to be even more shallow than their 1969 selves. Daphne is the only character that turns out somewhat ok but she's still feels like all of these people deeply unlikeable

In terms of plot there was nothing engaging, sure its not quite as bad as something like paradise pd or hoops, because atleast velma actually has a somewhat orignal throughline, but it's still not intresting because I'm not rooting for velma to succeed. There's no emotional attachment because she just feels like a person built on hate. Furthermore for a comedy, the jokes are on the ""haha character exhibits trait we've given them, or subverts trait past writer gave them, that is the joke"" tier of comedy except like all adult animated comedies nowadays... the fact that jts edgy is meant to make you laugh. Instead it feels like a massive insult to anyone watching who enjoyed scooby doo and characters, and a reduction down to another corporate animated shill that you'll get called a hater for disliking brcause people have an irrational compulsion to defend anything diverse regardless of its actual quality. And sure those peiple who are jsut hating because of the changes to the characters races do exist but thats no reason to gaslight yourself into seeing gold where theres only a show thats bland, generic, and annoying. Its not fresh, its stale, its just putting the packaging of scooby doo on the same stale, adult animated comedy, bread every other merchant is trying to sell you.

I've seen a lot of postive reviews compare this to big mouth, (like 2 but that accounted for like half of the positive reviews I saw when I scrolled down)... I agree, bjt jt says a lot about the type of people this show is for, when such a deeply lifeless show like big mouth shares fans with it who consider both of them on the same level."
2.0,"Jan 16, 2023","Honestly, I didn't have any expectations coming into this and actively ignored reviews to have an open mindset on it. After watching both episodes I can safely say that I don't have a clue what's going on. Pacing is horrible, jokes never landed, and found more enjoyment out of the ads that played during the show. It throws too much at the viewer too quickly. The VA's did a good job and I had no trouble with the animation quality, but those are the only good points I can pick out. As someone who enjoyed the original shows, I feel kinda disrespected as a fan and as a viewer. I don't see what audience this was made for. Even as its own thing and not referring to the old shows, it doesn't hold up as a cohesive and well written story on its own merit. The adult theme isn't the problem, but the commentary on current stereotypes and such gets a bit much and annoying at times. Watching paint dry has more comedic value than the jokes made here. I believe me and my brother paused a total of 32 times just to discuss certain lines that made us take a step back and regret our choice of watching these episodes. I'll keep up with the episodes just to see how far it goes down the drain."
9.0,"Jan 29, 2023","It's a mystery...that a show with such a talented cast, can go so wrong. It attempts to be funny but all the characters come of as rude, especially Velma. Velma is incredibly unlikeable. Daphne is unlikeable. Fred is unlikeable. Shaggy is okay-ish. The writing is tedious. This is 180 degrees the opposite of spirit of what Scooby Doo is about - good natured friends coming together to solve a mystery because it is the right thing to do. This show isn't targeted towards children (thankfully), but the writing is so poor that even adults won't find it engaging enough. I am a big fan of Glenn in IASIP, Constance Wu in FOTB, and also liked Mindy in the office - all extremely talented. Unfortunately this show is poorly written."
1.0,"Feb 6, 2023","If you know the premise of this show, it's a solid fun time. I enjoy it so far and it appeals to my nostalgia while also being its own thing. I want more shows like this, low stakes but entertaining. This show takes a familiar setting, characters we all grew up with, and provided a new twist. Much like ""Harley Quinn"", ""Wednesday"", ""smallville"", ""Sabrina"", or ""Riverdale"", we are taken to a place we thought we knew and reintroduced through a new and creative lens. Characters are recognizable but reimagined. This show feels like it's grown up just like the fans of the original. Velma is a thoroughly good time."
1.0,"Jun 7, 2024","While this show is no where near an accurate depiction of the original or many adaptations of the ""Scooby Doo"" Franchise, this show is still great. Individuals are judging it as a comparison to previous adaptations despite the time we're currently in being vastly different from back then. The humor, representation of high school, the queerness, and even the food reviewing content are all accurate representations of today's age. The show is funny and a good laugh, it's an original take on a old concept and I think it's great. Young adult comedy is a hit and this show provides nonstop unforced laughs. The jokes aren't made to be corny, the characters consistently have common interactions that young adults today do that are both awkward and funny. All these old people want another Scooby Doo show, well to you all go back and watch the 100 different tv shows and movies that have come out over the years. Give this show a chance, you will not regret it."
2.0,"Aug 14, 2023","I already didn't expect much from this show as soon as I saw the trailer for it, god. It was even worse than the trailers. This. Is. Awful. I think awful is nicely said tbh. The only good things about it are the designs and art style, so props to the designers of the show. Too bad they are written terribly.

I cant believe they even approved this show, it's unfunny, over the top crazy and the fourth wall breaking every 15 seconds is annoying as hell.

Couldn't even finish the first episodes because of teenage nudity and 2 cockroaches going at it. Goddamn. I've seen so many reviews and the backlash is absolutely deserved. Please stop this madness.

The show was meant to be inclusive by changing some of the races of the characters, yet they make them extremely stereotypical and lame. Im fine with the race swapping just wish they would've done something better with the characters.

Nothing is left of the old cast. They're all crazy, mean, dumb, narcissistic, bossy and so on. I hate it so much. Can we cancel this show already????"
2.0,"Feb 9, 2024","Pointless, trashy, downright insulting. I have nothing positive to say about this show. Watching even a few minutes in and I was already in a bad mood. It disrespects the original shows and characters. The artstyle is bland and rather inoffensive. I can't believe in any way the creators expected this to have a positive reaction. Removing skooby may seem like a bad decision but I am glad that they chose not to desecrate him along with the original cast like this. I am in disbelief that a show like this would ever be made. The show is edgy just for the sake of being edgy and offers nothing else in terms of value."

The live action movies were bad but this TV MA show just awful. I hope it doesn't get renewed for a second season the characters are awful and the stupidest thing in the show is the swearing I grew up watching the cartoon how can Hollywood ruin it I can see why it has a very low rating on IMDb Also glad I didn't watch more than Four minutes of the show."
1.0,"Jan 13, 2023","I didn't care for the show Velma. The teaser for it I thought the show was going to be only Velma and I dug it. However when the show came out and had the Scooby gang and most written very badly, I didn't care for it anymore. There is some jokes that are funny, but I feel they are ripping off clone high a little bit. Velma is a strongly unlivable character in this and it's not so fun. Animation is great in this. It's why it's scored a little high. But execution and writing aren't great. I don't have a care for any of the main characters. Some of the cast is lazy with voice acting. And it just has very tiresome tropes that we see too often in shows that it's boring and unoriginal."

After watching the first episode, my family and I sat in a state of confusion, unsure as to whether we had just watched a great parody, or a train wreck.

The humour is physically forced down your throat, the script itself may well have been written on the back of a packet of Cigarettes, and we found ourselves struggling to remotely identify with any of the characters.

I'm a strong proponent of reimagining Childhood Classics - However the producers really didn't do their homework on this one.

Disaster."
1.0,"Jan 31, 2023","It is an awful show which ruined the Scooby-Doo characters and the show overall. It's even hard to laugh at how bad it is; would not recommend it because there are about a million other things you could do with your time.

The performance is terrible on every level, it's not entertaining, terrible writing. I think that anyone who had anything to do with this should be fired. I really don't understand how people don't rate it one star. I don't think I went 5 minutes without cringing, I could barely get through the first episode.

I think that the Scooby Doo title has a lot of potentials and could be used for a great show, but this is not that."
7.0,"Jan 15, 2023","First off, I love everyone on this project. I think they are talented and probably very nice. My problem is that this is not Scooby doo in any way. The characters are twisted completely different people, they seem extremely imature. Even the characters in a Pup Named Scooby-doo were more mature. The story is overshadowed with jokes about small d, bugs having sx, photoshoots out of nowhere etc. This for me will never be a origin story of Vemla Dinkley. This will be about Vermin, sadly. As a fan of Scooby doo, I do not recommend it. This could have been great, but this is a mystery I wont finish."

This truly epitomises a cartoon in 2023. Its so unbelievably hard to even develop a likeness to velma.

Scooby doesn't exist which is just absolutely nonsensical.

People are mean! There's minimal ghost Or monster hunting.

I watched it just because I had heard lots of bad reviews and went in to this with a truly open mind. I have absolutely no intention of watching again and it's just a real shame that a cartoon I grew up on and loved. Has been ruined by this 'edgy' take on one of the characters.

Put it in the bin."
2.0,"Jan 31, 2023","Ya know, ""Be Cool Scooby-Doo"" did the EXACT same thing Velma is criticized for and nobody complained or even care. In fact, some people would even go as far as saying the worst Scooby-Doo title is serviceable. But most of us forgot that even existed despite still running on Boomerang.

Unlike Be Cool Scooby-Doo (which was the first series to depict the Mystery Inc gang as Jersey Shore cast members), Velma did what that show did and make did it in a more intelligent and thought proking matter that doesn't insult the viewers. The writing is funny and steller and actually felt like real characters.

As reboots on Time Warner Channels go, Velma is better than Sidekick, Scaredy Squirrel and Cloudy w/ A Chance of Meatballs: The Series, but not as good as The Mr. Men Show, Pink Panther and Pals and Care Bears: Unlock The Magic."
1.0,"Jan 15, 2023","The new Velma TV show is an utter travesty. As a longtime Scooby-Doo fan, I am appalled by this horrendous reboot. The writing is atrocious, with a chaotic plot and cringeworthy dialogue. Velma's character is unrecognizable, stripped of her intelligence and charm. The bland, soulless animation fails to capture the original's spooky vibe. The show relies on cheap, crude humor and shock value, insulting viewers and tarnishing Scooby-Doo's legacy. Beloved characters like Shaggy, Daphne, and Fred are reduced to irrelevant caricatures. Avoid this disaster at all costs.

I do hope that the creators of this show never try again with something like this."
2.0,"Apr 3, 2023","Now this is far from a perfect show. Some of the comedy can be too much. It feels like it's reaching far out of its own grasp. There's far too much satire that can get old after a while. The show also feels like it isn't sure what it wants to be or how to be it, but definitely wants to check some boxes. The tone like I said I like, but it also tries too hard to actual be creepy, and it does fail at it. Some side plots feel rather unnecessary, and some of the character changes feel weird.

Overall Velma is flawed, and doesn't quite know what it wants to be yet, but it's not that bad, if I had literally nothing else to do in my whole entire life.

The guy from office space is literally the only reason I considered a 2."
1.0,"Jan 15, 2023","The show has no clear audience. It also doesn't have a clear idea on what story they are trying to tell, it's all over the place with different stories being told at the same time & none of them are going anywhere. Plus the character changes were not needed & it's going over the top to try to be different & edgy. They keep going out of the way to ostracized previous fans & are not doing anything to bring in new fans. With so much material from the past to use they decided to try to make something different & it's not working. Mindy decided to pretty much made the character into herself then just named her Velma, also Velma is the carbon copy of every character she's ever played. She's pigeonholed herself into a where she plays the exact same person in every single role. No one asked for this show Warner Brothers just needs to listen to the fans & cancel this dumpster fire of a show."
2.0,"Feb 1, 2023","This is awful and tries too hard. The writing had potential but blows it making race and sexuality the only thing people have as their personalities. The jokes are not funny. Why would they pull Scoob 2 but let this thrive on the vine. I'll never understand the greed slime at HBO and their shallow decisions to skirt having to pay royalties. Life is reflected in the art we consume. It fails the mirror test. I can't take the one star away to give it a half of less. It's horrible. It's horrible.

It's horrible. It's horrible. It's so bad. It's awful. It's weak and clearly was created to cause more friction between the people that desperately need each other in these awful times. What's the point? It promotes stereotypes while saying they're championing them. Scooby Doo is about overcoming your fears and sticking together to overcome an immediate danger to friends and strangers who hired a group of stoners to stop big corporations from running them off their land or stealing their life savings or inheritance. This show is the person under the rubber mask. It's not worth watching. I can't believe we won't see Scoob! 2 but this still exists."
2.0,"Jan 21, 2023","So, when it opens with an example of the personality they decided to go with Velma, you immediately get a sense of ""oh no"" and the dread is justified.

From the opening 5 minutes, until the end of the first episode, you are greeted to sheer, unadulterated, ruination of a fantastic IP.

It feels like they made this awful terrible show and then put a ""scoopy doo"" character skin over it to try and mask what was the real monster all along- the writing and director decisions.

The only saving grace is they omit some characters like Scooby and SHaggy themselves, and it's probably for the greater good."
1.0,"May 3, 2024","Who remakes a show and completely cuts out the two main characters? No Shaggy (Norville isn't Shaggy) or Scooby. Of course the base you would/should be marketing to don't like it. I can get past everything else. I don't care about changing race, I kinda like the idea of Velma being the lead and I like most of Mindy's projects. You gotta give fans something though, just a touch of nostalgia if you are going to make all of the other jumps including making it an adult centered cartoon. This could have been a good show with a new spin, but it doesn't stand a chance turning off such a large part of the shows fanbase."
8.0,"May 16, 2024","Mean-spirited trash! That is all! Disgrace to the franchise entirely! You do better not watching this at all! HBO max is Harley Quinn is 10 times the show this will ever be. Certainly not for kids, but equally certainly not funny for adults. Not funny one bit. They even have a trashy Hitler joke in this! Just bad in every way imaginable! Don't bother! Save yourself! Lol. I mean that quite literally! This is nothing but hot garbage with a flaming bag of feces! One of the worst things ever created! And the producers at Warner Bros. Should be ashamed of themselves! If I could get this show negative stars, I definitely would!"
7.0,"Jan 27, 2023","The show is called 'Velma' not 'Scooby Doo'. While it may be based on characters from the show; the target audience for this is not children but for those adults who grew up watching it and loving it.

'Velma' is the story of Velma- and how she began solving mysteries with the gang. Not the story of Scooby Doo the dog.

And for anyone really surprised at the content of the show? It's on HBO... and targeted to adults. As for people saying it's racist and sexist; I say the opposite, that it aims to be inclusive of races and genders. Mindy Kaling calls out the stereotypes of the original show and brings dimension to the characters.

The original 1960's show and subsequent spin offs are basically carbon copies of each-other trying to reach new generations of kids.

This show is sarcastic, silly, outrageous and obvious. If you don't like it don't watch it! ( And maybe watch more than the first episode if you are really trying to give it an honest chance).

I enjoyed it! Give it a chance :)"
1.0,"Jan 22, 2023","So many controversial stuff about HBO Max's Velma, folks. At first, I was very skeptical and interesting about it and I'm willing to give it a fair shot because I'm one of those folks who can make fair and honesty opinions.

I get that why people are so mad and salty about Velma being adult animated, judging that Velma is from the family-friendly Scooby-Doo franshise, and I have to agree with them. But, that's not the case here. I had decided to watch it on HBO Max when it comes out, and I've got to say...it's not bad. Seriously, it's not that bad, but it's not good either. I think some of the writing in this show is kinda nice and the animation is pretty great too. The characters were kinda dumb down, Velma's personality matches with Mindy Kaling's other characters such as Disgust from Inside Out for example, which kinda makes sense because Mindy voices both of these characters. Daphne is the typical snobbish popular girl, Fred is the pompus rich boy, and Norville is Shaggy's replacement. Also, I wouldn't mind if they add Scooby in the show or not, they didn't add Scooby in the show and I honestly don't mind....sorry, but Scooby wouldn't fit in a adult show unless it's some kinda a crude parody cutaway gag scene from Family Guy or Robot Chicken.

Again, the animation is amazing, like some of the part makes the animation looks fluid and impressive and the the show's visual art style kinda reminds me of The Venture Bros. And there are some interesting moments with the characters, not to mention that the show's mystery solving murder case story is obviously interesting to me.

Overall, you can hate this show all you want, but it does have a few great qualities about it when it comes to the animation and the visuals. If you disagree with me saying that Velma is average, or you can agree with me. I can respect your opinion if you dislike or hate the show.

Again, it's not a bad show, but it's not a good one, I would call it mixed and average.

I give HBO Max's Velma a 6.4/10."
1.0,"Jan 13, 2023","Oh my goodness, where do I even begin...

Now, I am not the biggest Scooby Doo fan, but this show absolutely deserves every one star, any negative reception it gets by fans and viewers alike so we make sure that something like ""Velma"" never EVER happens again. I am very passionate about good shows with good animation, compelling stories and well written characters, and this show just felt like it spit me in the face for wanting to enjoy any of that. You know, bad media can be enjoyable to watch, it's possible. Take The Room for instance. Objectively, the acting and writing are bad, however, at least there is humor in such terrible and corny performances that you can't help but laugh at. The show actually goes out of its way to not only be bad on purpose, but make your viewing experience as difficult to sit though as possible. I'm actually impressed at the lengths this show will go to ensure that you will be as dissatisfied as possible until the very end to spite their target audience. Never have I watched a show where I felt so emotionally drained and SO exhausted. The jokes never land and are way too repetitive. The writing is TERRIBLE and one of the worst I think I've ever had to sit through. It's insulting to these characters who already have established backstories, designs, and personalities and rewrite them completely to the point where they are unrecognizable. You start to wonder why even make it about Scooby Doo if they hate the original concept so much, let alone make it an origin story? This is like some 14 year old's terrible Wattpad, self-insert fanfiction come to life... Actually, scratch that, they probably have more dignity and respect to the source material and their audience then this piece of horse dung ever will.

I have lost a lot of respect for Mindy Kaling and hopes she takes all of this negative feedback into consideration and stays far, FAR away from the animation industry. I would give 0 stars if I could. I'm not wasting my time watching future episodes. Please do yourself a favor and spare yourself of this abomination."
1.0,"Jan 13, 2023","I was raised on this cartoon like millions of other fans. Scooby and Gang go on to solve mysteries daily only to rip the masks off the villains at the end only to find out it's Mr Roberts who owned the local Inn. Brilliant!

This was a show of characters nobody knew,related too or cared about. The writing was really bad and had its ""jokes"" fall flatter then a person at the local pool doing a belly flop.

Oh..No Scooby Doo either. Who needs the main fan favorite...this show did.

Watch this and ask yourself why they didn't just make another cartoon instead of taking a classic and handing the audience a cubic zirconia instead of a diamond."
2.0,"Feb 1, 2023","Velma promised to be a comedy with relatable and lovable characters, but unfortunately falls short of its mark. The main character, Velma, is overly concerned with the race and class of her peers and puts them down every chance she gets. The humor is mean-spirited and not funny, leaving the viewer feeling uncomfortable rather than entertained.

One of the major issues with Velma is the way it approaches sensitive topics such as race and socioeconomic status. Rather than handling these subjects with nuance and understanding, the show takes a cheap shot at marginalized groups and perpetuates harmful stereotypes. This not only makes the show difficult to watch, but also sends the wrong message to viewers.

Furthermore, the jokes in Velma simply do not land. The humor feels forced and falls flat, leaving the audience unamused. The show's attempts at comedy often come across as insensitive and offensive, rather than clever and relatable.

Despite the shortcomings in its writing and humor, Velma does have one redeeming quality: the animation is well done. The characters are well-designed and the backgrounds are colorful and detailed. However, this alone is not enough to save the show from its detrimental flaws.

Overall, Velma is a disappointment. The show's attempts at comedy fall flat and its approach to sensitive subjects is harmful and offensive. While the animation is well done, it is not enough to make up for the show's shortcomings. I would not recommend watching Velma."
1.0,"Jan 14, 2023","Why, just why? Why take a beloved set of characters and create a show where they act as complete opposites of what they've been established as? And no, I'm not talking about their race or sexual orientations. I'm referring to their personalities.

They are nothing like the Fred, Daphne, Velma and Norville we grew up with. And that wouldn't even be a big problem if they weren't so terrible and one-dimensional.

Despite his Ken looks, Fred has always been a smart and ingenious person, a good leader and a true handyman when it came to setting up traps. In this series he's portrayed as an insecure man-child who can't even feed himself. He's selfish, self-centered and an overall ""donkey"".

There are only two things good about the show: the voice acting which is decent and the potential of the main plot, which is nothing groundbreaking but interesting nonetheless.

Everything else just falls flat on its face. Writing: abysmal. The script writers felt the need to explain every single joke or reference. I guess it tries to be meta but instead it breaks the pacing and makes it a slog to watch.

Unfortunately even if they didn't use the Scooby Doo IP it would still be a poor show. I managed to go through the first two episodes but that's it. I will not be continuing. Shame on whoever owns the license for allowing such a series to be made."
1.0,"Jan 13, 2023","This piece of truly dreadful garbage and truly miserably unpleasant version based on the scooby doo franchise is not only the worst of the franchises, it is also the worst television of 2023 to date, failing to extend the perimeters of a psychological mystery, the tv series is a big time absolute single failure to be precise, the animation is worthless and nonexistent, the performances are horrible throughout, the writing is completely ridiculous, the teleplay is a mess and the editing is a disaster, this piece of junk is not only a bad television series, but a pathetically tasteless animated series as well, this is total junk.

Hanna barbera, ruby spears and the rest of them are rolling in their graves as we speak.

1.0,"Jan 14, 2023","Seriously, how is this show so unfunny? Who wrote this and on what planet were they on when they believed that these types of mean-spirited, painfully lazy jokes would land? The creators of this show very clearly make spots in the episodes where they think you should laugh, but the jokes are so flat and lifeless. Listen to the other reviews on this one; this show is utter trash and should never have been made.

I swear to god an edgy 8 year old would write jokes like this. Nobody at any point thought to watch these episodes and vet them for whether they can actually make people laugh? Or was this just a bunch of people who have never been told that they have no talent all cheering each other on. This show deserves to fail on every single level.

There are no jokes here."
1.0,"Jan 21, 2023","It's cringey, boring, and annoying to watch all at once. Guys, this is not a Scooby-Doo show AT ALL. This is basically Mindy Kalling's Bizzare Adventures alongside funhouse mirror versions of our beloved Mystery Inc characters.

Absolutely nothing works on this show besides the sometimes pretty animation. The dialogue is absolutely horrendous. I cannot believe human beings wrote and greenlit this show. Let alone that actual money and time was spent to animate this show. The script sounds like something an AI would come up if you trained it to datamine Twitter threads.

This is cleary an ego-project for Mindy Kalling and not something done out of passion. Stay away to preserve your own sanity."
8.0,"Jan 20, 2023","There are things that work. No matter the time or space they exist in, they are enjoyable. Then you have someone come along to try and take away what made that formula work, because they think different is better. And it fails. Either make something completely different and new or honor the original concept. This was not fun at all. It seemed hokie. I wasn't expecting genius show but I wasn't looking to be dumb downed either. I always suggest that others should watch and see for themselves but I honestly think you should avoid this and not waste your time. There is talent in the voices the actors take on their characters."
7.0,"Feb 23, 2023","I watched the old Scooby Doo cartoons when I was younger. I was skeptical about Velma after reading about the controversies. After watching the entire season I can say the show was fun and it made me laugh numerous times. I think the approach is interesting and I rapidly got used to the characters (at first I was comparing to the old). The animation/art is gorgeous. The show is fast-paced but does give you time to digest during the dramatic moments. BLUF: thought I was going to hate it but I enjoyed it. I hope it doesn't get cancelled because I'm looking forward to where their adventures take them, and if Scooby will make an appearance."
1.0,"Feb 1, 2023","People keep saying how this isnt like Scooby Doo. And I have to agree, its nothing like Scooby Doo. I expected to hate this but once I saw this as more of a Scooby Doo parody, it made sense of it to me. Fred is over the top. But I was never aware that Fred had a personality to begin with. Same with Daphne, so they took creative license with them. I guess you could be mad if Velma doesnt live up to your picture of her, but again, I never had much of an opinion of that character anyway. I only ever watched that show for Scooby and Shaggy. Neither of those characters are in this so.... I dunno. I find myself laughing a few times per episode, and I am generally amused by them. There are jokes in there that arent meant for me and they just go by. The way I see it, there is a ton of garbage shows out there and this one keeps bringing me back when new episodes drop. Im up to ep8 now. My advice, in your mind, watch it as a parody and not a serious show. Thats how it feels to me."
1.0,"Jan 13, 2023","I gave it a chance but the show was really lack luster. I grew up watching Scooby-Doo and I was just disappointed in the direction they went in. It was over sexualized and underwhelming. I've watched porno movies with better storylines. The voice acting in it wasn't great either, did they cast a 60yr old smoker to play Velma? They changed everything I loved about the show, most of the characters in the show are wholly unlovable. It in no way made me want to watch a second episode. Well i might watch another episode if I'm trying to punish myself one day, actually I'd rather claw out my eyes. Unfunny, horrible, and it kind of hurt my feelings how bad this show is!"
1.0,"Mar 20, 2023","I'm disappointed with this series. I love Scooby Doo and the gang; however, this is just trash. The characters are rude, self-centered, self-deprecating, and disgusting. None of this is Velma. I know she's somewhere asking: now, how did I get in this? Original stories are great, this one is not! There was so much potential here that was wasted on cheap laughs, stereotypes, bad writing, bad voice acting, and Mindy (are you OK?). HBO should be ashamed for giving this the green light. I expected so much more and was left with so little. It's not a comedy at all and should be placed into the horror genre. Scary. Very scary! 0/10 Do not recommend at all."
1.0,"Feb 1, 2023","Honestly, I downloaded the IMDb app just to give this show a negative review. I wouldn't have too much to complain about but they did Scooby doo dirty. As a stand alone show, it still stinks. But the fact that they made it Scooby doo related makes it worse. My friends and I watched the show out of curiosity and I regret even making it 10 minutes into the show. The characters are poorly written and play into their normal fun stereotypes way too hard. Fred, who is normally a ditsy funny guy is now an unnecessarily arrogant and rude guy, Velma is now way smarter than everyone else and has no shown flaws and so on. Characters are not like able as they used to be. People try making characters flawless representations of what they think society wants instead of giving them character flaws built into them to make them more appealing to everyone who by the way isn't perfect."
1.0,"Jan 13, 2023","This is a complete waste of any scooby doo fan's time and a disgrace to William Hanna and Joesph Barbara. Thankfully it is not getting a second season.

Scooby Dooby Doo where are you in this series but on second thought I think it's best your not in this hot mess of garbage, at least Frank welker, Wanda Sykes and weird al yankovic made a guest appearance but it's the only good thing for this series 0/10."
1.0,"Feb 8, 2023","I honestly don't understand how shows like these ever make it to the point where they are being watched by the general public.

How does it make it past the first pitch? How do they spend this much money on development and marketing for an absolutely below acceptable finished product?

Not only is it unfunny, it doesn't even make any attempt at presenting itself as something anyone could possibly enjoy.

It doesn't follow the established lore or backstories of the previous series, or the established personalities and attributes of the characters we have a history with.

So I ask you, what is the point? Why even make this series? Why not create your own series within the scooby spoof teen mystery genre? Why this?

It appears HBO just has too much money, they don't know what to do with it at this point so they've resorted to burning it producing content like this."
1.0,"Jan 13, 2023","This has to be a joke on Scooby fans like myself. There is nothing that has anything resembling Scooby Doo other than the names. This is just a blatant rip off of the name recognition to get people to watch,probably because they weren't capable of creating something original. And the worst thing is,Scooby is a children's show. This is just basically x rated porn. There is no real plot and seems to want to just make fun of the original characters and degrade them to a bunch of stupid,horny and drug dealing psychos. Can't see this lasting past 1 season.

Hopefully reality will return in a few years and someone will create something worth watching."
1.0,"Jan 23, 2023","Does Mindy K. Have dirt on someone at the Warner Brothers executive table? At this point it's the only thing that makes any sense. There's times when I feel that maybe I'm just not the right demographic for the show and so I pull back the harsh judgment as bias but this...this is bad, much much bad. The humor is a string of fast spoken asides and ironic twist of Scooby-Doo tropes that I think is supposed to elicit a...chuckle? I'm not even sure if I'm supposed to laugh at the ?jokes?

Who was this for? You could have made anything with this IP and you managed to make the worst iteration of Scooby-Doo possible, a show that holds the record of most remakes and versions across the world. There could have been a dark humored adult Scooby-Doo, diverse characters, more cool modern plot lines that are relevant to late teens/20 somethings. It could have had relevant satire to current events, SOMETHING to make it worth watching. Instead it just feels like they shoved run on sentences in place of jokes.

I will say I respect them for taking a chance, the worst part about this is the elevator pitch to this show had potential, and it was fumbled on a Chernobyl level disaster scale.

As an aside I'm a late 30's dude but my son is 18 and he thought this show was trash too soooo...again who was this for?"
9.0,"Feb 5, 2023","As we are only on episode two, my opinion may change about this show as the season goes on, but for now, if you look at this show on its own merits, it's enjoyable. I get why people don't like it. It takes characters most of us have loved since childhood and turns them on their heads. Daphne is an Asian-American drug dealer. Fred is a spoiled, pathetic rich boy. Shaggy is not a stoner and not even called Shaggy... There is no Scooby-Doo at all.

All of that is almost too weird to get past and I had trouble at first. I even turned it off during the first episode, but I found myself wondering what was going to happen and came back to it. I decided to just think of it as an ""alternate universe"" and enjoy it for what it is.

First off, Glenn Howerton is amazing. He legit sounds like a kid, and does a great job bringing his unique brand of sociopathy to Fred. Constance Wu is really great too, and the relationship between Daphne and Velma is interesting. Mindy Kaling's Velma is the closest to the original character and I find myself invested in her backstory and really want to see where it goes.

I will admit, as a Scooby spinoff, I don't really disagree with the 1 and 2 star ratings. These are not the characters we grew up with, and expecting them to be will turn you off and likely piss you off. BUT... if you forget about the past and watch this without bringing any of your expectations for these characters with you, you'll see that it's a pretty smart and interesting show."
6.0,"Jan 23, 2023","It tries to appear inteligent and mature, but it ends up being a mix of stupid sexual humor and cringy jokes.

It tries to make jokes out of other series but fails spectacularly, and you can easily forget that this is supposed to be a Scooby-Doo reboot for adults, aspect in wich it also fails because it makes fun of adults watching cartoons.

The characters are nothing like the originals, and while it is not bad to try and change certain things, they appear self entitled, plain, stupid, or just not interesting enough.

All in all, it tries to be a comedy mixed with killing and mature themes, but fails spectacularly, and makes you wonder why did they think this would work."
1.0,"Jan 17, 2023","To be honest, I'm not even sure why I'm bothering to review this show. It feels like a complete waste of my time and energy because it serves no purpose in my life. However, I was so irritated by it that I feel compelled to share my thoughts. My main question is: why is this show even on HBO? How did such a terrible atrocity end up being broadcasted to their subscribers? It's like watching a piece of excrement take a dump, and that might be too kind of a description for it.

This show claims to challenge stereotypes, yet its characters are nothing but walking stereotypes themselves, which is ironic and baffling. It's like the show is trying to erase stereotypes while simultaneously perpetuating them, which is mind-boggling. It fails to please its audience with its constant criticism of stereotypes because it embodies them to the fullest. It's not just bad television, it's a failure as an art form. It pushes the boundaries of how terrible television can be, which is somewhat impressive in its own twisted way.

The only positive thing I can say about this show is that the animators did a good job, despite being involved in such a torturous project. But that's about it. It's not worth your time or mine. Just take a quick glance at the cover on HBO MAX and scroll past it as fast as you can."
2.0,"Jun 8, 2024","If these reviews allowed some of the not so nice words that come out of teenagers mouths, the review would be significantly longer. Alas, I will try my best to explain what this show is about. While it is weird that Scooby-Doo does not appear in this show, I am glad he does not (as I heard the writers had trouble trying to figure out how to make him work in an adult cartoon, and thankfully, Warner Bros. Made the right decision to ban the people behind the show from using him), but the humor falls flat, be it raunchy or meta (as one joke has Velma telling Norville she thinks a 420 is code for adults watching cartoons. Yes, an adult cartoon actually makes fun its target audience for watching cartoons. Hypocritical.) This cartoon is what I like to call a Scooby-Don't, as the story is weak, the comedy is something out of a second grade ""Your mom""-off, and the animation style makes me wish I was born blind instead of half-deaf. I've never seen a show with writers so oblivious to how terrible it is, and it amazes me that this got approved by numerous editors, producers, and animators. I am currently upset by my childhood TV show being massacred, and will make sure nobody has to go through what I've seen."
2.0,"Jan 25, 2023","From the very beginning of the first episode, Velma makes it clear that its jokes will be meta, tongue-in-cheek, and painfully unfunny.

It opens with a bunch of girls in the shower, with perfectly placed soap suds to cover up fine details, while it tries to make clever self-aware social commentary jokes about the sexploitation of women. It would have been funnier if they'd cut to the boy's locker room and poked fun at penis size by having large and small soap suds. But no, the uninspired writers of this show didn't think of that.

Neither of the two episodes I watched got any better. Lazy jokes and changes to characters we already know for no reason seem to be the only things this show wants to do. I wouldn't mind the changes if anything interesting had been done with them, but this show would rather rely on lazy stereotypes and unfunny gags for its humor.

I'll admit, I laughed a couple times during episode 2, but it wasn't enough to make me rush to watch further episodes. Maybe the writers figured out how to write actual good jokes and gags, and make their characters interesting, but there are a lot better written things I'd rather watch before giving this show a chance to prove itself."
2.0,"Jan 23, 2023","When I first saw the poster for this 2023 animated spin-off series off the ""Scooby-Doo"" characters, I must admit that I was already ready to skip on it.

But I still opted to give it a go, and my first impressions were holding up. This abomination of an animated series has nothing to do with ""Scooby-Doo"" in any way.

The changes made to this spin-off series just takes the essence of the ""Scooby-Doo"" franchise and throws it right out the window. I was expecting something akin to the cartoon series that I grew up watching and still watch and enjoy as an adult today. But that was not the case here, because creature Charlie Grandy delivered something else entirely. Trust me when I say that ""Velma"" has to be seen and witnessed to believe it could play out such horribly.

""Velma"" is a swing and a miss on a massive scale. No doubt about it. And even my son, of 12 years age, said this was atrocious, and he sure didn't understand the massive changes that were made to both Velma and Shaggy. Nor could I for that matter.

What does work for ""Velma"" is the art style and the animation, because it was good. But yeah, that was about all that the series have working for it. Everything else in this series is abominable.

My rating of ""Velma"" lands on a one out of ten stars."
1.0,"Jan 13, 2023","I enjoy terrible movies and bad TV. MST3K was one of my favorite shows and Best of the Worst on YouTube are great series that showcase terrible films. Movies like ""The Room"" and ""Suburban Sasquatch"" are funny and hilarious to riff on. Velma, on the other hand, is an affront to every bad movies stand for. It is the cringiest product on TV. It's not even worth ripping on, because it's so sexist, racist, and worse yet, poorly written. It is like we're watching a therapy see soon for Mindy Kaling. I feel embarrassed for all the animators that spend countless hours making this show. I just hope all their checks cleared. I cant recommend this show, unless you truly hate yourself and you have figuratively watched every other show on the planet."
1.0,"Jan 23, 2023","Scooby Gang has had lots of versions through the years. All the most successful series have two things in common. One was for children and two adults could enjoy the story too. All of the successful Scooby Gang series or movies are first about comedic problem solving and then about teamwork and the love and loyalty of the team. The team may poke fun at one another but they are never purposely hurtful. This series is just awful and no fun at all. It is mean spirited. I have been watching the Scooby Gang for my entire life and never has a series made me feel more hurt. I have been equally disappointed like when the majority of the gang was missing from much of the Scrappy series so this series failing is nothing new. Anyway, don't bother with this and help the rest of the fan base wish away. If you want peak Scooby Gang writing with interesting character development and an edge that doesn't destroy canon, See Mystery Incorporated or The Be Cool series. Both are modern and socially progressive and artistically explorative without the negativity of this series."

How do you create a show about a popular cartoon show and not include the character the show was named after. Who was this show written for and how do you call this a comedy?

I don't think HBO asked the writers and show runner any of these question...I don't think they even read any of the scripts. I believe this was approved just because they thought it was going to be similar to the source material with an adult theme ant not this craptacular, unfunny reinvention of Scooby-Doo."
2.0,"Jan 22, 2023","Before I get into it, go watch Mystety Incorporated. It's everything this show thinks it is but actually done well. This show only serves to display what not to do when taking an established IP and experimenting with it. It took a universally loved and approachable IP like Scooby-Doo Doo which has been around for decades and basically injected it with the toxic cynicism of social media, all the worst aspects of liberal ideologies, and served them to us with the wit of that one kid we all went to school with who thought they were edgy, too smart, and inevitably brought every argument back to ""but if Hitler..."" I'm a man so to some that immediately invalidates my criticism but it's strange to me that there is no one to root for in this show. All of the men are portrayed as stupid, shallow, and weak. Velma isn't the first show to do this, but then the female characters are also stupid, shallow, weak, and mean. Who are we supposed to follow because Velma is the worst of the lot and at the start most people seem indifferent to her until she actively interacts with them and drives them to animosity.

Outrage about the race swapping is kinda dumb, Velma in particular has been raceswapped multiple times, it happens. The real outrage should be how each character is now a stereotype of their new race. Why was Daphne, the only character who is good at martial arts in the canon, Asian now? Why is Fred suddenly ultra wealthy and spoiled despite that also being an attribute Daphne has always held? The show is literally trying to get points for being inclusive while actually cramming characters into stereotype boxes.

The show isn't funny. I could go down the checklist of how the jokes are just dated and lame but then I'd be putting more effort into this review than the writers of the show did and unlike them I'm not getting paid for this.

Lastely, why is this so sexualized? Episode one basically opens with underaged girls in the shower, why?! Why couldn't they at least have set this when the gang are in college? It doesn't make showing girls in the shower any less pandering g but at least they're of age. It's just gross that the show draws attention to the bodies and genitals of underaged people and thinks it's funny. It just shouldn't be a thing and it's easily fixed.

Don't even hate watch this show, it thinks you're dumb enough to enjoy it and there are countless better shows out there for you to watch. Punish HBO for releasing this and expecting you to pay for it with your hard-earned money.

My only regret is the animators actually did so solid work but their efforts resulted in this dumpsterfire."
8.0,"Feb 12, 2023","Rarely do I see something that I cannot even finish the first episode. This is a self insert, mean spirited, and trashy adaptation of a dearly loved show. If this wasn't tied to Scooby-Doo, no one would have even watched it.

This show makes me wonder if anyone even reviewed this show before greenlighting it, and the general artistic value of streaming series, especially on HBO as a whole.

The reviews online do not even do this anuff film by the creators killing the franchise. It gives you solid signals less than five minutes in that they hate the fans. I think the popularity of things like Rick and Morty made someone think ""we need an edgy show"" and they are so far from the mark that it isn't even something I would consider entertainment."
7.0,"Jan 12, 2023","Unbearable, it's a damn shame because the animation and art are pretty good but the writing and humor and acting are just plain bad. How this got green lit for another season is beyond me.

Doesn't even have scooby-doo in it on top of all the crap writing.

It's like chatGPT wrote this after being forced to learn about tiktok and tumblr trends from 2016, it hates it's audience, and feels like a vanity self-insert project.

I had high hopes since the people who worked on this worked on the office but it had none of the funnies.

Goes to show that HBO hates it's subscribers when this stuff gets greenlit but then they go and cancel stuff like infinity train. Whack yo."
1.0,"Jan 16, 2023","Pro: The only thing good about it is the Animation, which was a bit inconsistent but there were sequences that were amazingly done.

I loved how it was so distinctive from all the other Animated series available on different platforms

Con: The ""jokes"", dialogue and characterization is really BAD like they need to remove the comedy genre as nothing about it was funny, it was a boring train wreck where nothing in the story made me care or feel anything aside from annoyance about any character to the point that upon ep 3 I have a deep seated loathing for it.

Everyone in the cast was UNLIKABLE, EVERYONE! With the least unlikable one being Shaggy and the most unlikable one being the lead. And I love mean &/ villainous characters and antiheroes(love this) absolutely HATE Mary sue characters but Velma was on a whole new level of Annoying and Infuriatingly badly written as a character making the whole series just rotten to watch."
1.0,"Jan 14, 2023","Before I get to that one good thing, upon watching the first couple of episodes, it is important to note that this series has failed in every important area.

The first is the characters, largely unlikeable characters, with very few people seeking to support these characters in any way, their personalities are downright horrible, and there is no chemistry between the characters that would lead to them making the team that many people loved over the years. Of which the worst offender in this series, is the titular character Velma, who could be best described as a self-insert of Mindy Kaling, on top of that, the biggest problem with Velma as the character, is that she has the worst personality traits of all the cast members of the show, of which the viewers will not support as a result.

The second issue is the ""humor"" of this series which is not funny. It comes across as condescending, mean-spirited, and extremely hypocritical at times. When it comes to meta-humor, it has to be done with good timing and by people who know what they are doing, sadly for this series, the writers don't know what they are doing, which in turn the commentary comes across as preachy. The simple reality is, entertainment is a form of escapism, something the writers of the series don't seem to get.

And finally, the ""plot"" now while there is a chance to scrape together a coherent plot line, the issue, is whether the writers could keep it up consistently. As such the main problem, is that the writers swap and change elements of the story, without providing any clear direction, of which the story has taken a back seat to the overusing of social commentary.

And this series is potentially getting a second season, god help us if that were to ever happen.

Now the one good thing this series has going for it, is that it has gotten people on both sides agreeing on the fact that this series is a massive dumpster fire of a series, how it got greenlit is one mystery that the Scooby Gang may never end up solving."
1.0,"Jan 13, 2023","I honestly can't believe how awful this show is. On paper it seems like a reasonable idea with a decent cast. In reality, this is so bad on so many levels.

The meta jokes are terribly written, or copied from other shows but failed in the execution. The edgy humour falls flat. The storyline is boring. And most of the time it just doesn't make sense. Add on top of that, the interesting art style is ruined by often garbage animation.

No idea what went wrong or how people were paid to make this and felt like it was something worth releasing. I can only imagine the writers thought they were a lot funnier than they were. Avoid this rubbish at all costs."
1.0,"Jan 21, 2023","98% of the other reviewers have accurately described everything wrong with this show, so that saves me the trouble. Thanks everyone. But I am here to remind the Scooby Doo fans that all is not lost. Scooby has been around since 1969, so there is puh-lenty of episodes/movies to keep us entertained. Now, I have long considered Scrappy Doo to be the Anti-Christ, but I think it's possible that VELMA has gotten more hatred than Scrappy ever did. Not to whitewash how incredibly annoying he was. If there ever was a dog that needed to be neutered...... But - smile when you remember that in the grand overall scheme of the Scooby Doo universe, VELMA won't even be mentioned. And if somehow it gets renewed for a second season, it would only be to just flat out pi$$ people off. Or maybe some kind of tax dodge."
2.0,"Jan 29, 2023","I think the problem is this show takes itself too seriously in trying to make blatant social commentary rather than actually using a joke rooted in social commentary.

Both the Harley Quinn animated TV series & the Velma animated TV series are two HBO Max shows using two classic female characters and turning them into adult focused comedy stories.

Where Velma goes wrong is 1) It takes the foundation of all jokes and spoon feeds the ""joke"" to the audience, as though we are stupid. It doesn't make them clever jokes but rather feels I'm in a college course listening to a Professor ramble about why the joke is supposed to be funny.

2) When it attempts a joke, it's scared to make the joke and instead says ""Well, we don't want to make the joke because we don't want it misinterpreted as not being irony so we'll remove the irony, explain what the joke is instead of telling it in order to not offend anyone who doesn't understand irony""

3) It doesn't honor the source characters. Harley Quinn takes all the characters and honors their origins, personalities, and makes it feel like we are actually watching Batman, The Joker, Harley Quinn, etc. They're all likable, even when they themselves are not likable. In this show, Velma is curated to be the only likable character in order to be the big, strong leading character so they attempt to make Velma completely perfect and all the other characters flawed and almost rotten to their core (more specifically Fred & Daphne) but instead it makes Velma seem like an egomaniac and the other characters still horrible people. No one is likable. There's no sense of character development. It's ""Velma is perfect and needs no character development and everyone else sucks and Velma is so perfect that she's a saint for putting up with them"" which makes for incredibly bland storytelling."
1.0,"Jan 26, 2023","This is peak character assassination and a horrible misinterpretation of everything this show stood for. It takes away the friendship and mystery that so many people loved about the series and related to.

They ruin every character's well-known and well-developed personalities that the franchise had worked hard on over the years, for bland, one-dimentional, and frankly inaccurate depictions of common society.

It's clear Mindy Kaling had no love or even knowledge of the franchise and just wanted to make a show by piggybacking off an already successful and loving fanbase.

I'm sorry if this review seems very impartial but it's a very personal one as I was one of the millions of teens and young adults who grew up with this franchise and I think that is truly what makes this such a sad, soulless cashgrab.

Even from an impartial standpoint the writing is terrible, it's textbook adult writing teens. The nihilistic main character could have been interesting but it just comes off as cringy and the jokes are mostly either cheap shock-value or just unnecessarily graphic.

And how are you supposed to make a scooby doo show without scooby doo?!

Don't watch this show, whether you're a fan of scooby doo or not, it's not worth your time. You'd be better watching any other adult swim/adult american cartoon because they're atleast original."

It's trying wayyyy too hard to be funny (unsuccessful, sexism and racist non funny jokes) edgy (forced and over the top) and new (they wanted a new spin on scooby doo but jeez)

This insults the names of Hanna Barbara, Ken Spears, Joe Ruby, Frank Welker, and Matthew Lillard, to name a few. It would have been so easy to make an adult adaptation that was enjoyable."
1.0,"Jan 14, 2023","When you're making a reboot of something, there has to be at least SOME of what made the original content lovable. There is nothing here that even has some semblance of the original material. Each Character is butchered beyond belief, and the fact that scooby doesn't even exist? Please. If you're making a Scooby-Doo reboot you need the dog that makes the content great in the first place. I could even forgive it if the show was funny or even interesting, but no it's just a garbage crap shot from the beginning. The show is named Velma? Where is she, don't ruin a perfectly good character in the name of any kind of originality. This show is a skin suit of what Scooby-Doo is and holds nothing of what makes the concept good in the first place. Do better."
7.0,"Mar 2, 2023","There was a time where scooby-doo was regarded as a great saturday morning cartoon. This being said these are sad times to see it fall and fall so hard we cant even figure out who the target audience is. It tries to redo the formula but into something unrecognizable that its different and in a bad way. The characters old and new are just not all there or just totally re-written to try to fit the premise of the show. The identity sounded great on paper but once it was out there it didn't lived up to the quote on quote ""Hype"". Sad to see this happen to such a beloved show, our memories will be with what we as adults remember about scooby-doo not velma."
1.0,"Feb 7, 2023","I came to see this show with an open mind: after all, is a reimagination of a beloved and very present serie for most of us. Or that is what HBO told us. That was my 1° mistake, believe that.

I know that an adaptation take side paths to tell an old story but in this case they took another path from another world from another unknow galaxy. Characters are horrible! Cant get a single laugh on the entire episode 1 -and im latino, we laugh for everything- i wasnt aware that Mindy Kaling was Disgust on the inside out movie, now I can understand why.

You dont like scooby-Doo? This show is for you."
1.0,"Jan 13, 2023","Velma is... a show. It's a wannabe meta-comedy reimagining the Scooby-Doo mythos in a modern fashion: but the problem is that the characters here are pale imitations of the original takes who don't have a shred of their likability or chemistry. Also: the lack of Scooby-Doo himself (based on what I've watched) is a red flag that is stuck DEEP in this show's flawed bedrock.

This show is painfully average, and the characters are cliches without the sense of smart self-awareness desperately needed for this kind of meta-comedy stuff to work. Rick & Morty did it better because it kept refining its take on Joseph Campbell's Hero's Journey with absurdist sci-fi comedy thrown into the mix.

In the end, Velma feels like it's trying to be a Harley Quinn cash-in without the writing to back it up, and instead giving the Scooby-Doo franchise an unnecessary paint job it never needed to use in the first place.

This show: it's a waste, and feels like it'd be more at home as a theoretical one-off YouTube fan parody rather than full blown OFFICIAL series. And to top all of this embarrassing stuff: it's not fun. It's condescending animation that doesn't even do a good job WITH its animation. It's bitterly milquetoast stuff that pretends to be intellectual with all its self-awareness and in the end it knows it can't say anything new.

For those who like it, good for you; for those of you who don't, ditto; for those indifferent, it's... a show to watch right now. And not a terribly good one.

It would be nice to say that some of us were wrong, but no; the internet was generally right about this turkey. 0.5/5 stars."
1.0,"Jan 17, 2023","Wowee, the hate on this show is something else. I thought it was a fun interesting twist on ScoobyDoo Do I love everything? No.

I keep waiting to see the gang back together. I want to see Scoobs, Shaggy, Velma, Daphne and Fred riding around. Mindy Kaling hate is out of control online right now, which I think is in direct proportion to what they did to Fred's character and I hope his arc gets better The shower scenes are somewhat pornish and very unexpected. This isn't a kids cartoon.

I don't think it deserves the hate its getting at the moment. I look forward to seeing where its going in the meantime."
1.0,"Feb 2, 2023","It has a boring plot, really annoying characters, and absolutely no personality. I put more effort in writing this review than the creators of this show when they wrote it. The fact that it was produced, amazes me. The fact that it was green lit for a second season makes absolutely no sense. It would have been a bad show with original characters, but the fact that they took a classic cartoon with beloved characters, about a group of friends with different backgrounds who worked together to solve mysteries and swapped them with spoiled teenage brats who kind of hate each other it was a mockery. The fact that they rebooted Scooby Doo into a show without Scooby Doo it is an insult to the fans that grew up with that classical, wonderful show and it's amazing characters. What is wrong with entertainment today, can't we have nice things anymore?"
1.0,"Mar 25, 2024","When the main character in your reboot could easily be a villain in the original show, you know you've made a modern masterpiece.

Honestly this is nothing but a self insert ""fanfic"" of artocious quality. Yes, fantic in quotations since any real fan wouldn't remove the premise of the show so far from the original. Eventhough most modern Scooby-Doo movies and remakes didn't come near the older ones in overal quality or funniness, this one has such an overload of juvinile jokes and delivers them so heavy handed it ranks as the lowest point the IP has fallen to.

Not to even mention how much of a character assassination of the original Velma this is. In Velma by Mindy Kaling she has turned into some the original crew would've unmasked as a villain at the end of the episode/movie."
1.0,"Jan 13, 2023",This show is not worth watching. They changed the characters so much that they should have just made all new characters and no based it off of Scooby Doo. It would not have made it any better or worth watching but still. This show is focusing on all the wrong things. It seems like they're trying to create a show with the same vibes as the Harley Quinn show but they are nowhere near the same thing. Harley Quinn is GREAT! Velma? I don't know who okayed this to be released. They're supposed to be high schoolers but Daphne is selling drugs? Fred is an annoying brat. They changed fundamental characteristics of these characters AND where's Scooby? Don't bother watching this series.
2.0,"Jan 16, 2023","Hated this show so much.... All characters are garbage human beings, especially the protagonist. She is the worse actually, hateful, egoistic, stupid... The only thing that's barely acceptable is the single season mystery that's dragged up until the LAST episode... You do cheer sometimes for Daphne's side quest which is far more engaging than the main storyline. Personally I was cheering against Velma all the time... The adults are pathetic, the young are disgusting, there are a myriad of idiotic plot points that are only uncovered in the last episode and NONE of them are worth the time spent watching the season... Really, really hope they don't dare make a second season of this stupid thing... Eyes muscles are hurting of rolling them up so much..."

Don't waste your time watching this unless you wanna throw up and cringe. Let me list my reasons on why this show is horrible

1. It tries and fails to be funny 2. It is both racist and sexist at the same time 3. It changes everything about the scooby doo franchise

If you ever considered watching this show, do not waste your time. This show is the worst show you could find, and it has deserved its 1.4/10 rating. Go watch something peak like Breaking Bad instead."
1.0,"Jan 15, 2023","Before you hate me for giving this a 2 star: I think that the voice acting is mostly fine, and I like the animation style (if it wasn't wasted on this project).

That being said, everything else on this show is a miss. I try not to jump on the hype or hate bandwagons before I have given the show/movie an honest chance first, but from the start of the first episode this show felt wrong. Where do I begin?

Let's start with the concept- I am a huge adult animation fan, be it Bojack Horseman, South Park, etc., and this show clearly wants to be that stinging meta comedy that appeals to young adults and edgy teenagers. However, all of the jokes were just bad- I know comedy is subjective, but from the start of the first episode you have a bunch of naked high school girls in the shower talking about how shows that start their pilot episodes with nudity are lazy and appealing to sex. Being meta just for the sake of being meta is one of the easiest ways to make your audience hate the show, because from the start no characters are acting realistic, or likable, or funny- they are only interested in making fun of themselves or the viewer, which is fun for no one.

Next, lets talk about the IP: Scooby Doo. I mean this when I say that NONE of the characters remotely resemble their iconic counterparts. I don't care that Daphne is Asian or that Shaggy is black- I care that they don't have any similarities to their associated characters. This show is only related to Scooby Doo in name because it would get more people to watch it- which worked, but not the way they intended. Not only are these ""characters"" completely dissociated from the originals, but they have been aged down to 16 for some reason... in a show aimed at young adults filled with nudity, sex appeal, and the like. Now, obviously, 16 year olds get into mischief, but there is really no reason they shouldn't be at least college aged, whenever they are all constantly acting like insufferable adults.

Again, there were only two episodes available at the time of my review, but I'm guessing if I watched more and the quality stayed at this level my review would drop to a 1 star. But, I do not see a world in which I come back to this show. It is sad to see that those who are passionate about animation and making beautiful stories are constantly in conflict with the studios that control them, meanwhile shows like this get the resources that should have gone elsewhere and give animation a bad name. Maybe I would have liked a couple jokes when I was 15, but watching this as a 22 year old I had a very difficult time cringing at the bad humor and feeling talked down to by a show with nothing to say. Luckily, it seems that the entire internet hates this show, so I don't think we'll be seeing much more of it. Hopefully projects like this teach a lesson to the corporations controlling them, but streaming services have made it difficult for animated shows to be successful. I feel like this will just become another tax write off for HBO max, and sadly more proof to the executives that adult animation isn't worth the effort, when in reality people just want quality entertainment with good writing, which is the opposite of this. 2 stars out of 10 (for now)"
1.0,"Jan 15, 2023","Definitely venture Bros vibes. Enjoyable unless you take yourself or the original scooby doo really seriously. I don't think enjoyment of one precludes enjoyment of the other though, just two very different tones and storylines.

Velma depicts the classic characters as their stereotypes then reacts to them. Those stereotypes always existed in the source material, it was just never addressed-they were treated as reasonable and inherent truths. They also create a butt of the joke situation for the ones passing judgement on these stereotypes. Each of these episodes is filled w deep dark humor in my opinion and not a bad way to spend 20min."
1.0,"Apr 6, 2023","The idea to make cartoons for adults have been played with for ages. Ralph Bakshi was one of the innovators of the genre.

This is nothing more than an uninventive attempt to be shocking and to be the moral compass to the audience. Let's start with when Mindy talked about the project before it was even made. ""Audiences will be made with a women of color to lead a story but to make her a lesbian with create shockwaves"" So I'm sure it was deep seeded idea to create a project to gain discussion.

Now the actual product is released and you get nothing about bitching and moaning with no humor. 90% of the jokes are insulting to the audience and 100% disrespectful to the actual creative property.

Taking a beloved character was the first step of an uncreative approach. Mindy lacking depth took an established character to screw with knowing it will get people talking. This is obviously a trend being used. Winnie the Pooh and the Grinch have been exposed to the same perversions.

The worst part, we will see Mindy do a campaign to insult the audience for not liking her monstrosity. This is the biggest problem no accountability for putting out crap."

Mindy Kaling made Never have I ever which is a great show, but this...it is a complete disaster. I can't believe you would change the very personalities of friends who came together despite their differences from one another, this is a disappointment which should have never been aired to begin with. I hope that the writers and directors come to their senses and accept the truth that their writing abilities for this show are absolute trash."
1.0,"Jan 25, 2023",I went in with my head up hoping Mindy would do some sort of service. It's terrible. You would think a classic like Scooby Doo would be easy for a comic to flip into adult material but she completely blew it. I watched both episodes and it's a complete miss. The humor was dry and the material that was used as shock value was completely used in poor taste. They had an opportunity to give Velma some sort of back story and it was so lazy and rushed you would think a child wrote it. If you're going to make the show for adults then make it. If it's for kids then make it for kids. They took some basic kiddy plot and threw their own jokes in. I'd rather watch the classics if the jokes are gonna be this bad.
1.0,"Feb 1, 2023","My Husband and I, (gay couple) Are Life long Scooby fans, This show is absolute trash. Not any one character is likeable or relatable. The crass attempt at humor is abysmal.

The original characters were all different and awkward but balanced, in their strengths and weaknesses, they were friends and chosen family. They supported and cared about each other.

These new versions are insufferable, and unrelatable, to anyone. Why would the creators INTENTIONALLY over Sexuallize Teenagers. It's gross.

The original mysteries were morally corrupt, usually about money, heists, family revenge, etc. But they were Not Violent or Gruesome Murders like in this deconstruction of a globally beloved IP of the last 60 years.

1.0,"Jan 16, 2023","The animation is surprisingly good at times, it strays away from the usual lousy adult animation faces and is nowhere near as bad as ""Fairview"" which is why I give it more than a 1.

The jokes are the typical gross out humor and badly researched commentary which we've unfortunately come to expect from adult animation so the ""jokes"" are Family Guy and occasional South Park ""rape joke"" level bad.

The story is dull, cliched, and un-intriguing because the story doesn't bother offering anything new or creative but acts like it does. The quality of this show's story felt as bad as Seth MacFarlane and Justin Roiland's shows except that their shows started off with some appeal and gradually got worse. Like those properties, the show ""Velma"" gets worse the more formulaic, lousy, and 4th wall breaking continued.

Within the last few years we've consistently gotten weirdly pretentious main characters which is just a tiring drag. It's usually ego-maniac writers projecting their ego, continuing in the tradition of bad writing, but it's not an enjoyable experience for anyone and narcissistic protagonists have already been done a lot better, endlessly before.

It seems that the only way to get rid of this trend of horrible adult animation is to recognize that shows like The Simpsons have occasional decent episodes but have been overall bad for decades, Rick and Morty went absolutely trash after season 2 with the last good episode being in season 3, Family Guy was never good and it's only appeal was appealing to edgelords, and a lot of South Park's humor is just eye-rolling. Negative reception is the only way we can break away from these embarrassments, we can't just disapprove of the new shows we need to point out the fact that those old shows no longer deserve positive ratings ever since they've tanked their shows with countless cash-grab episodes that nowadays outnumber their good episodes."
9.0,"Jan 22, 2023","This tries to be Scooby-Doo, but like low budget. So low budget they can't afford the main character. You'd be much better off watching the live action Mystery Incorporated show on YouTube. It only has one episode so far, but I would rather watch that one episode 1000 times before watching one of these ever again. Why can't Warner Brothers back that rather than this trash with poor voice acting. The Mystery Incorporated show on YouTube has a bunch of amateur actors and I'm way more drawn into the story than this. I barely got through the first five minutes without wanting to turn Velma off. Definitely not worth anyone's time."
1.0,"Jan 29, 2023","The show is great for what it is. Which is an adult cartoon comedy, similar to Family Guy or Rick and Morty. It is light hearted fun, and you are not supposed to think about it too much. Just relax and laugh as the still antics of the characters.

It got reviewed bombed because it makes fun of literally everyone, and some people can't take a joke aimed at themselves or things they like. If you are easily offended the show isn't for you. Otherwise if you have a sense of humor the jokes are all silly and light hearted. Not all of them land, but there is enough of them to get a chuckle here and there and the show is overall amusing to watch.

And yes, the show makes fun of Scooby Doo too. It is more a parody than an actual reboot/remake. So go in knowing they make fun of the old characters."
1.0,"Jan 23, 2023","The show would be better if they put a spoof tag. Velma is definitely not the Scooby gang that you grew up with. They know it. They make fun of it. They're proud of it. If you can get over the fact that they're not the original Scooby gang. They're not the Scooby gang at all, but it's a different telling of the origin story then it can be a really fun show to watch. Certain scenes are so hilarious. I almost fall out of my chair. Certain scenes are so cringeworthy. I have to wear a helmet to keep from slapping myself from the face palms. If the people that grew up with the original or even the next three or four incarnations of Scooby can distance themselves from those and just sit down and enjoy a funny show then this show is worth watching."
1.0,"Apr 24, 2023",If you like big mouth (which I don't) you might like this show but they just take a beloved IP for some clout and then dump all over it. Don't start the show by insulting fans of all the old series and movies and then also put down the source material. Expected better of Mindy Kaling but these jokes are terrible. A more adult focused scooby doo could have worked but sadly this is just a poor excuse of a reboot. It's sad to see a lot of professional critic reviews give it a decent score but then don't mention anything but the diverse cast. The diversity in the show isn't a problem at all with anyone what is a problem is pissing on the grave of an icon with poor writing and nothing faithful to where it's coming from.
1.0,"Jan 31, 2023","With so much negativity out there about this show I actually wanted to give Velma a fair chance. However, I couldn't even finish the first episode. Every time an attempt was made at a joke, it was just cringe!

I did wonder if I didn't like the show as I used to enjoy Scooby-Doo once upon a time. Perhaps the show wouldn't have been as bad if these were original characters and not a rewrite of a classic show. But to be honest, I think I'm being too kind there. I just can't imagine this show appealing to me either way.

And what's the deal with remaking this show without the main character, Scooby-Doo.

By all means be your own judge, but I really wouldn't waste your time."
1.0,"Jan 23, 2023","Well - spoiler alert - it wasn't. If it ain't broke, don't over-retro-fit it. The franchise has veered close before to losing itself by stepping outside of its natural Venn Diagram, as in 'Mystery Incorporated' (eschewing the humour by mid-series 2, the positive introduction of Marcie overshadowed all too soon by 'the gang' somewhat blithely hoiking her out of their circle at the drop of a Daphne, and then, the 'departures' of Marcie and Angel) - but this series has shown so few positives that one finds oneself trying to praise the slightly-less-negatives just not to be callous.

On the human side, the voice cast is so strong, one wishes it was a real-live show, and the animation has touches of originality. But if you are going to take so little from the established Scooby canon - usual voices and all - then why bother? Simply call the show 'Veronica' and be judged on what you are from the opening line, not 20 feet back and playing catchup from the off. It's never a good idea to break your bat before heading for the crease."
1.0,"Jan 24, 2023","I didn't really understand the plot or anything regarding the show. Show was confusing, kinda ruined scooby doo in general. Maybe it's time to move on and create new series along with better characters. They can't keep attempting to reboot series with a slightly different plot expecting people to like it. New original series need to be made. This is just an attempt of brining back old series with a slightly different plot point. Everyone wants new better ideas, not old worse ones. The plot was cringy along with the acting. However some points were funny but the jokes in general were just cringe. Wouldn't watch it again if they paid me."
1.0,"Jan 28, 2023","Did the writers and voice actors have a bet going on to see who can write the longest scene without putting anything in that could even remotely seen as funny?

I have never seen such a hateful, mean-spirited show with so many ""messages"" rammed forcebly down the viewers throat.

Who is/was this show made for other than Mindy and her gang of ""Yes Mindy that is so funny you are a comedic genius!!"" ""How stunning and brave you are for writing that!"" cronies?

The best guess I can make is that this is a self-insert of Mindy who hated Scooby Doo and felt like ""This is what I would do/say if I were Velma.""

TLDR. Badly written, unfunny, hate filled, preachy garbage."
6.0,"Apr 23, 2023","I'd be embarrassed to be associated with this show. The jokes in this show is up right bad and inhumane. Velma was never like that. The violence in this show is too much to watch as I don't think it is necessary to include it as ""dark humor"". The whole show is straight up bad with and jokes and stereotypical unoriginal characters. I hate Fred as a character because he sounds too hard to be attractive. I think all voice acting is bad. Shaggy isn't Shaggy without the snacks and Scooby-Doo. Mindy Kaling and Warner Bros should be embarrassed that this is top 3 of worst rated show on IMDB. HBO Max should drop this show completely."
1.0,"Apr 19, 2023",I decided to give velma a watch for myself because i tend to enjoy adult animated series.. but my god nothing could have prepared me for how painfully unfunny the first 2 episodes were. I went into this thinking who knows maybe it can atleast be an entertaining watch so i gave it 2 episodes and it was hard to watch there is not 1 character you're rooting for they all suck and 99% of the jokes from what i've seen didn't even make me slightly crack a smile the only joke in the first 2 episodes i found slightly funny was the girl singing ginuwine at a the girls funeral that's it.. nothing else landed.
1.0,"Jan 19, 2023","Watched one episode and that was enough for me. Everyone involved in this show should be blacklisted.

I don't know what's wrong with writers these days. They think it's so cool to break the fourth wall and be edgy. But it's not edgy, it's just CRINGE because it feels like your estranged, tryna-be-hip late 30s aunt with a pending divorce wrote it. They even had the show sent in like the early 2000s to have it remind her of the good old days or something.

There's too much unnecessary dialogue (show's ALL DIALOGUE) and not enough action (DOING STUFF) in the show, and the dialogue is already so hard to get through. It's like I'm trying to eat hard tack while actively fighting in the Civil war.

And to make the characters say out loud what their intentions are before doing them in the next scene like a mini character summary is so bad. It legit feels like I'm watching Family Guy when they're in the middle of saying pop culture references I don't understand but the reference scene where they all act out on it never happens.

Don't get me started on how they changed the whole cast of Scooby-Doo and broke their whole dynamic up.

None of the characters feel like Scooby-Doo. Scooby-Doo isn't even in the show!!! I don't know what's wrong with people nowadays when they make remakes or adaptations and they just change all personalites and f up the best friendships and make them all toxic (Another EX: Winx Saga). Imagine if the Fellowship in Lord of the Rings was like this. Imagine if Sam was Velma.

Also, it's really sexual. Not in a funny way. Just in a really gross way. Plus, they changed the SD cast to kids actively tryna learn in high school. Idk how to feel about that. Like there were animators who drew all that? Of a beloved children cartoon? While changing the character ages to...underage? It's literally uncomfortable to watch. Like wtf are yall doing, put these on your Twitter instead of applying to HBO.

It seems to be a fanfic of Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorpated. They even used the same setting of Crystal Cove. I wish they didn't cause that's arguably the best one in terms of writing which this one doesn't have at all. No arguments there. Also, the main plot is literally Veronica Mars.

Anyways, it's bad, Amazon should remove the word count limit for this show. All you gotta say for it is it's bad and don't watch."
1.0,"Jan 14, 2023","It's seriously not as bad as people claim it is. Think of it as a Velma reimagining more than a Scooby-Doo remake. It's not about Scooby...it's about Velma. I think it's nice when a show doesn't take itself too seriously and this one does a good job at being comically meta about the whole teen genre. It also seems to be a show that relies on build up. The only real criticism I have is that it needs to start advancing the plot a bit faster. More action, less commentary/asides.

The diversity is also pretty refreshing. I urge viewers to give this show a season and see how everything plays out. It may be rewarding in the end."
1.0,"Feb 19, 2023","The show itself isn't half bad. Or, as bad as the harsher critics. Essentially what they did was make this into a Scream and ScoobyDoo mashup. It has humour for adults and for teens etc.

Now, I'm basing this on the first 2 episodes, do I'm not sure how it will be over the course of the season. Honestly, with the star power on the show (comedians), it should do well. As long as they don't pander and start to degrade the show. Which is a problem with a lot of new shows.

They seem to take the Heroes series route. Degrade the quality of the episodes over time until you're happy it's off the air."
1.0,"Jan 30, 2023","Mindy Kaling is an amazing writer. Our family has enjoyed her projects over the years. Currently, we are loving Sex Lives of College Girls on Netflix. What we are NOT enjoying... is this show. There are ways to do nostalgia pieces, and this is not it. People love Scooby Doo and all of the associated characters. Were they fleshed out and realistic? No. And that would certainly be nice to see. The previous two live action movies were a lot of fun. This was not. In fact, what comes across to the viewer is a complete and utter disdain for the source material. Written to ""shock"" and be ""edgy"" without a regard for what nostalgia is or can be. What it has done, is angered most every fan of the franchise by not making their favorite characters ""real"", but making them despicable. Fans miss the innocence of the original IP. They miss the fun. They will NEVER miss this iteration which is perceived to be a spit in the face of all fans. Mindy Kaling was misguided in this endeavor. All she wanted to do was offend. Well... she did... a lot of people. I hope she recovers well. I'm sure she will. But I also hope that this bastardization of a beloved IP fades away and is forgotten by everyone."

Dog water show absolutely unoriginal and should have been a completely different show, maybe then it might even reach an audience score of 7 percent on rotten tomatoes. Do not waste your time with this show, would rate it lower if I could, deserves to be set ablaze. Velma is absolutely obnoxious and runs everybody down, she deserves a clip by the ears.

SHOW MAY CAUSE BLINDNESS

1.0,"Jan 13, 2023","This show is painful to watch, and not in a ""so bad it's good way"". The way that the writers have created characters that are totally unrecognizable and absolutely mean to one another makes the show painful to watch. Other than the names of some characters and their clothing, there is nothing to remind you of these characters or what they do - other than the paper thin veneer that ""Velma has a mystery to solve"". Honestly, the show feels like a prior concept for an adult cartoon was rejected, Scooby Doo characters were thrown on it like a coat of paint, and then approved.

Without going into spoilers:
Characters are utterly unrecognizable, changed in both physical appearance and of all meaningful personality traits. Characters are negative, extremely judgmental, and act with aggression towards each other frequently. When this is applied in a meaningful way to some characters it can be entertaining. When all of your ""protagonists"" are at each others throats - you don't relate to them.






This show fails on its face to be an entry in the Scooby Doo franchise, but even ignoring the Scooby intellectual property, the show is still uninteresting to watch. It's honestly quite baffling.

If you want to watch a Scooby Doo series, there's plenty of great history there. If you want to watch an adult cartoon - there's also plenty of much more worthwhile alternatives."
2.0,"Jan 20, 2023","I had no expectations set for this show and it still managed to be worse than I could ever imagine, sitting through the first episode was as dull and painful as it is listening to your aunt talk about her vacation to Peru.

This show pays no respect to the source material which it owes since it would not exist without Scooby Doo. How can one make a show that hates what it originated from and disrespect the fans of the original show?

I really just want to know who is this show for if not for fans of Scooby Doo? Is it for people who don't like Scooby Doo? Who and what was this show made for? And why was it made?

If these are the questions I am left with after the first episode I can't say I would recommend this to anyone at all."
9.0,"Feb 1, 2023","A new worst media is in town.

Velma is replaced with a self-insert of a black woman who's painfully mean. Scooby doo? More like ""Scooby don't!"", as he's not even in this show! You may as well go watch Scrappy-doo instead, because it's terribleness pales in comparison to Velma. Or, you know, stab your eyes out with carrots, like in ASDFMovie. I'd also like to mention that Discovery is at fault for this, because it seems like their goal is to kill western animation for good, simply because it's easier to them just to put a bunch of celebs in a scripted contest than to painstakingly animate an 11 minute episode.

And yes, I haven't even watched it. That's how bad it is."
1.0,"Jan 15, 2023","I know I'm late to the hate train, but I am not even going to lie when i say that this show is the worst piece of garbage I've ever seen. This show has ZERO respect for the source material. The art style looks HORRENDOUS, the show tries to be ""funny"" but it has no personality behind it. And don't even get me started on the characters. Velma is a self insert for Mindy Kaling who acts just as horribly as her, Fred is a man child, Daphne is stuck up and acts like the stereotypical popular girl, and Norvile(shaggy) acts like too much of a simp to realise that Velma is using him. The fact that this show is getting a second season baffles me considering how unsuccessful it was. This show was so horrible in fact, that I couldn't even get past the first episode. In my opinion watch mystery incorporated, it is so much more respectful to the original material."
1.0,"Feb 4, 2023","The art style is pretty good. But that's where any enjoyment of this show seems to end. To start with it's biggest problem, Velma gives viewers absolutely no reason to emotionally invest in its unlikable characters.

There are hints at something more profound during Velma's seemingly hallucinatory experiences. But these moments are immediately upended by smug jokes, that are drenched with self-congratulatory sentiment.

Every aspect of immersion seems to be sacrificed in order to serve as a device for a shallow meta reflection on 90s cartoon tropes or some extant sociopolitical issue.

Immersion isn't the only attribute affected, As crucial plot points that would typically garner longer-term viewer buy-in are told through unimaginative exposition.

Outside of its excellent visual presentation, there's a real sense that its cast, crew and writers are phoning it in. Even the show's star and producer, Mindy Kaling, delivers the script unconvincingly with jarring moments where the show's visual creatives, seem deeply at odds with Kaling's performance.

Who's this show targeting? That remains unclear. What.remains unobscured is the show's unflinching tedium, and apparent desire to alien just about every viewer."
1.0,"Jan 16, 2023","It isn't 'Scooby ""It's only a mask"" Doo', that's why it's called 'Velma'. I expected to hate watch this but ended up thinking it was hilarious. Many of the jokes are really sophisticated and they come at you fast. I did have to rewind often to catch them all.

While I'm only into the 3rd episode and there's still a lot of character development needing to be done, I'm betting that by the end of the season the whole show will be tightened up.

They would have been better off going independent rather than tying it into the old kids' show. And the producers will probably be bullied into nixing a second season. That's a loss."
1.0,"Jul 13, 2023","Velma mite have been successful for season 1 even if it was for how difficult people found it to watch. Season 2 is a good idea thou because people will come back out of curiosity but they won't stay if it's the same as before.

The issues with the show are that its built from the characters of Scooby Doo but that's it. There is nothing else that tells you its to do with them. If your using the characters then make the show relate to it in some way.

Jokes are way to frequent and forced. Like they tell a joke that you don't find funny and then they ram it in your face like someone asking if you got the joke and that your supposed to laugh. But I would be lying if I said I kept a straight face the hole time. At certain times on the less forced and subtle jokes I smiled. If the show cut out the blatant, not funny over the top jokes and made it more quick witty stuff it would be more enjoyable.

Outside of the exaggerated humour the writing is alright. It's not award winning but atleast the story made somewhat sense and was easy to follow which is always a plus when your watching a cartoon.

The idea of using Velma as the main character was actually a good decision. The other characters wouldn't carry as well the ""smart"" one.

I wanna be able to enjoy this show so I do hope the next season is better. If its more like season 1 thou then I don't think I would come back again for a 3rd time."
3.0,"Jan 14, 2023",I was hoping this would be a good show . But lackluster. Storyline is bad . I've watched all of the Scooby do shows and this is the worst one I've seen so far . Took a big risk of changing all the characters and so far it's failed . It's supposed to be a mystery / suspense show . Not a high school drama showAlready have a ton of those shows . If this show gets a another season I would expect it to be better then what ever this is. The animation is is dated looks around 2010 quality which is a shame for a show made in 2022 should been held to a better standard show can be updated by getting better animation.
1.0,"Mar 25, 2023","This is the most terribly written, poorly executed and cringeworthy tv show I've ever seen. I'm in literal awe at how they managed to make the most iconic characters (all of which worked in other previous works) unwatchable. The dialogue in this show makes Riverdale look like it was written by Paul Thomas Anderson. It makes SNL look like peak comedy. A cartoon with boomer lines and undressed 15 yo characters on HBOMax? Who is this show for? My half blind and deaf grandmother wouldn't be able to sit through this pile of burning crap. I honestly don't know what everyone was thinking with this show."
2.0,"Jan 19, 2023",I really disliked this show with how it was just a meaningless dig at adult animation. None of the jokes were funny and felt like they were out to offend anyone possible. This can work and can be very successful like South Park. For a show about mystery there is basically none and there were no clues leading to the final reveal. If you are looking for a great adult animated series with blood and gore watch The legend of Vox Machina the writers actually have a brain. Clearly the whole brain removal thing was a jab at their audience calling them brainless and offensive. Overall if I could rate this lower I would.
1.0,"Feb 11, 2023","They are removing the character realistic of the gang. Shaggy isn't a stoner, fried is a beta, daphne has a dark secret why her hair is red. When you remove everything from the character why even have them.

This is what made the show unwatchable for me. I couldn't get pass what they did to my beloved characters and couldn't understand why even used them at that point.

A adult scooby doo show could be good with shaggy a stoner, Fred the football star, dephbe doesn't need a dark secret for red hair. They change way too much for the show to be watchable.

Final they should of just made they own show, we're new characters."
8.0,"Jan 13, 2023","It was terrible couldn't event get through the first episode, it wasn't funny, didn't even have scooby and completely destroyed the classic series. Wish I could go back in time and never watch it. Even better go back in time and kill it off before it's even made. If they wanted an adult version of this film they need to go back and look at Scooby Doo and the mystery incorporated series. Now that was the right way to do it, a bit dark and finds the perfect balance of sticking to the original series but drawing in a more mature audience, it was well thought out and executed. Cannot say the same for this, do yourself a favor and don't even bother with this show."
6.0,"Feb 14, 2023","Do not watch this show if you value your sanity or time. To give the show the respect it does not deserve, I watched the first three episodes hoping it gets better. Spoiler: it does not. In fact, it actually gets worse.

This show is for no one. It is not Scooby-Doo, only a poorly written show that would not have been made if it did not utilize a recognizable IP. The writers heavily rely on ""edgy"" meta commentary that only shows how out-of-touch they are. The characters frequently refer to tropes or cliches that do not exist in a vain effort to seem smarter than they actually are. The comedy always misses (I have not smiled once watching this show) and the characters are so bitter and unlikable that it leaves you wondering ""Who hurt you?"""

Scooby Doo is one of my favorite cartoons of all time and to see Velma and the other characters ruined and changed like this almost ruined my childhood tv cartoon memories!! I love Scooby Doo and there's NO need for a ""grown up"" version of these characters!!!! Not sure what need there is to try change or make different versions of these characters that were fine to begin with because it was a cartoon show for kids who like the horror/mystery aspect of it, nothing more!!!!!!! If Hollywood feels there's a need for characters like these then create a new show and not this garbage!!!!! Please listen to us viewers and please leave these characters alone!"

While I expected there to be many changes after seeing the previews, what I did not expect was a dull monotonous lifeless bore. I didn't even chuckle. Chances to be funny that were set up just didn't happen. It seems that.none of the characters except Velma are anything like the originals and that is about it as far as material taken from the original. The plot is mixed up and I have to say a little weird. The one positive thing I will say is the animation is good, the character flow on the screen and the colors pop. But that is about the only good things about this mess. It may get better but I don't have high hopes."
1.0,"Jan 22, 2023","Velma, IMO, is an underrated show.

The first season was overrated, the second one is pretty good.

My favorite aspect of this show is Fred Jones and his relationship with his parents, and one thing I like in the second season is the return of Scrappy Doo, One thing I don't like is the humor, I understand, humor is subjective, the humor is mid, Velma is an interesting protagonist, some of her mysteries do go well, but they don't make sense, at least IMO. That's my positives and negatives.

Overall, I'm happy I watched the second season, so yeah, for me, 7/10.

The characters make me wanna break all my fingers with these lame tropes. I can see why they couldn't get Scooby because Warner Bros. Didn't want to risk it. And my second point is to Warner Bros. Why did you think this was a good idea? Changing up everything about these well-known characters after all these years and I'm not talking about diversify or anything else like that, that's fine, but the show completely changed them; its basically a animated version of bad version of Riverdale) In short stop at one season because its not really looking good."
1.0,"Jan 12, 2023","I have a lot of questions. Number 1, how dare you?

Number 2, why would you leave out the beloved main character - Scooby-Doo himself? His lovable goofy personality and interactions with all other characters is one of the fundamental building blocks of what makes this crime-solving gang great.

Number 3, why do you hate your audience? You're riding on the coattails of a decades-spanning franchise that has some very passionate fans, and you think it's a good idea to show outright contempt for the viewers throughout? Bad move.

Number 4, aside from omitting an extremely key character, why did you completely change every single other main character to such an extent that they are unrecognisable? Velma is an incredibly unlikeable self-insert; Norville (Shaggy) is straight up boring and has lost every ounce of what made him a great character; Fred is a hollow shell and a rich a**hole who's used for cheap punchlines and nothing else; Daphne is mean and totally bland... you've destroyed every single one of them.

Number 5, why bother with a second season? Why double down on your failure? The only reason anyone watched this is to talk about how awful it was, and that's really only a one-hit-wonder type of situation. Now the show is just... dead.

Number 6, why so heavy on the sexism and racism? It may have worked in The Office, but it does not work here. This is not funny. This is not clever. This is not enjoyable.

Witcher blood origin is more watchable. If you watch bobs burgers, this is like one of Tina's erotic novels come to life and it is as terrible as it sounds. The absolutely unnecessary destruction of the characters is just mind boggling. There's no purpose to the direction they went with the characters. Whoever made the decision to cancel the Scoob movie and release this needs to be shamed and fired, not because I love the Scoob movies but at least it was watchable. This is the worst show ever made."
1.0,"Jan 12, 2023","In the seedy town of Crystal Cove, awkward loner high school student Velma Dinkley (Mindy Kaling) once had a love of mysteries that she abandoned following the unexplained disappearance of her mother which left her dealing with vivid hallucinations if she ever tries to solve one. When a popular girl is found murdered with no brain inside her corpse in Velma's locker she finds herself the prime suspect. With the help of her best friend Norville (Sam Richardson), and chasing down leads involving popular students Daphne Blake (Constance Wu) and Fred Jones (Glenn Howerton), Velma attempts to unravel the mystery.

Velma is the latest incarnation of the Scooby-Doo franchise taking a separate direction from the prior series by being an adult oriented comedy series hence its TV-MA rating. The show comes to us from producer and lead Mindy Kaling who voices the titular character and is written and developed by Charlie Grandy who worked with Kaling during The Office and has collaborated with her on The Mindy Project and the Four Weddings and a Funeral miniseries on Hulu. Upon the initial trailer to Velma reception to the series has been divisive to say the least. The show has received some positive reviews but upon my viewing of the first episode I really didn't like this series.

To start off on a positive note, I like the idea of an ""R-rated"" take on the Scooby-Doo formula and have wanted one ever since first seeing the Family Guy cutaway joke of a fake Scooby-Doo series called The Scooby-Doo Murder Files which featured Scooby and the gang investigating serial killers. The animation on the show does have a nice level of edge to it in establishing a kind of noirish look and feel to the series and I like the reinterpretation of the character models. But then we run into the problems of what the animation is in service of. Velma while positioned as an outcast we're supposed to sympathize with is also massively unlikable as she's shown to have a bit of a mean streak herself particularly with her relationship with Norville that reminded me of the unfunny Gerry bullying from Parks and Recreation that ran out its welcome before it even started. Further flashbacks showing how Velma's mother disappeared also add to the unlikability of the character especially with the inclusion of bits of gore that seem lifted from the Brickleberry/Later era Family Guy school of ""humor"". Outside of Velma pretty much every other character is some variation of a jerk or a creep and the show seems to think that mean, gross, or cruel are inherently funny in and of themselves as the show features sight gags of two humping cockroaches, a pregnant waitress casually getting nude in front of family members to have photos taken, or a lengthy scene where Velma laughs derisively at Norville confessing something to her. But of course, when the show isn't being cruel and gross for the sake of it, it's trying to be ""clever"" and ""meta"" by calling attention to the tropes of mystery fiction in a manner that's about as subtle as a sledgehammer to the face and while Scooby-Doo is no stranger to calling attention to its own tropes this is one where it feels like there's no real fun spin on it and it feels like the show has a contempt for those tropes rather than any sincere affection for them.

I don't know if I can say Velma is the worst Scooby-Doo incarnation I've seen especially since Shaggy and Scooby-Doo: Get a Clue and certain episodes of The New Scooby-Doo Movies were far more unpleasant to sit through, but this show had promise and ambition and it instead settles for being like a mid-2000s gross-out animated sitcom like Drawn Together or Brickleberry only with a serialized story to try and differentiate itself. Maybe it'll get better but the pilot left me not wanting to go any further with this series. Scoob 2: Holiday Haunt is locked in a vault never to see the light of day while this is released can't help but make you feel slightly disheartened."
1.0,"Jan 26, 2023","The first season is undoubtedly one of the worst things I've ever seen in my life.

This series doesn't respect the original characters at all. Well... their names? Because it really just wants to take advantage of the fame of this saga to make money.

In theory, it's supposed to be a bizarre, gory, violent, sexual comedy, etc. But in reality, you'll only find a script in very bad taste and devoid of talent.

In terms of production, I have nothing bad or good to say. It's adequate.

The second season improves, but because the first one is so bad that getting worse wasn't a real possibility.

If you don't watch it, you'll be doing yourself a favor."
8.0,"Jan 22, 2023","Oh man, this is really bad! I can't tell if it was meant to be this bad as a joke or someone thought this was a good show when they put it together but either way, it's really really really really bad! Stupid dialogue that pays no respect to the original Scooby Doo... In fact, Scooby Doo has nothing to do with the show.

The characters personality do not resemble the personalities. We got to know during Scooby Doo and its other spin offs. There are times that I'm just embarrassed watching it because the writing is so bad it makes me cringe. I don't understand who this show is for. It has no connection to Scooby Doo Again I can't explain how bad this writing is it's literally like an elementary school project that some third grader wrote with a really bad sense of humor. The main character is absolutely horrible, unlikable and a jerk. There's really no likable characters except for the shaggy standing character but he's just a Simp. They literally take a big dump on everything that was Scooby Doo and it seems like they do it just to make people upset. The show has the worst dialogue I've ever heard it is not funny it's just rude mean spirited, and nothing that you want in society. It's literally hard to watch because it's so wrong on so many levels. And again... The writing is trash! So disappointed that they did this with a series that I absolutely love."
6.0,"Jan 18, 2023","As many other users have asked - who is this for? The show itself is, like few of the reviews (very very few) state, not the worst. If it was just a generic animated comedy, it would be a very average but generally watchable show. A comedy in poor taste perhaps, but absolutely not the worst show of a generation. The blend of ""feminist"" humor and strangely conservative pandering the show (if it wasn't Scooby doo) is a 4/10. Maybe a 6 if you have low standards.

Instead of making a new show that would preform as well as you expect it to, it has commandeered beloved characters to force some sort of ""adult"" comedy that comes off as disrespectful to the show and the fans of the show. It can't be for those who haven't seen Scooby doo because the whole ploy has been ""adult Scooby doo characters"", it's not for casual Scooby doo watchers because it's missing all of the whimsy of the original cartoons, and it's absolutely not for fans of Scooby doo because it's laughable how poor the characterization is. The show almost mocks the people who enjoy Scooby doo - but who else would watch this? It comes off as a self insert but you hate the world you're writing yourself into.

There is no consistency in Scooby Doo's canon. But this falls so beyond any of the existing media that it begs the question - why? Why make it? Why market it? And most importantly, why watch it?

If you hate Scooby doo and yourself it's absolutely watchable. If you want to watch anything else, Scooby Doo mystery incorporated is a (relatively) darker Scooby doo that isn't a steaming pile of well... you know."
1.0,"Jan 15, 2023","I saw the very first episode (""What a Night for a Knight"") when the show aired in September 1969. I was five, and became a Scooby fan for the next fifty four years.

Fast forward through many different Scooby Doo Titles, I saw Velma. I have seen the reviews slating this show to death. I wanted to see for myself what the hullabaloo was about, and why many Scooby fans got their undies in a knot. I watched with an open mind - and the love for animation. While I was put out by the fact that Scooby, and the original Shaggy were not going to be in it, I found the characters in this show interesting. The plot itself is simple, but gets right to the point. The early Scooby show references were hilarious (because my being nostalgic)."
1.0,"Jan 20, 2023","""Velma"" is a poorly executed attempt at a comedy animated series. The show, which is attempting to tug on the heart strings of ""Scooby Doo"", fails to deliver on several fronts, making it an unsatisfying, and generally political driven viewing experience.

First, the writing is weak and lacks the wit and cleverness that made ""Scooby Doo"" a classic. The jokes fall flat and the characters lack depth, or even likability, making it difficult to become invested in the story or care about the outcomes. The writers seem to rely on cheap gags, shock and stereotypes instead of building a compelling narrative and well-rounded characters.

Second, the animation is unappealing and lacks the charm and detail that is present in successful animated comedies. The animation style is uninspired and lacks the energy and life that good animation should bring to a show. The character designs are uninteresting and fail to capture the viewer's attention.

Third, the show lacks the fun that made ""Scooby Doo"" so appealing. The show tries to imitate the tone and style of the classic animation in some ways, but fails to capture the essence of what made ""Scooby Doo"" so memorable, not withstanding the mutation of its classic characters. The humor is forced and lacks the subtlety and nuance that is required for effective satire and is generally rallying around the ""Social Norms"" of today that are anything but, creating a road of fake and predictable outrage.

In conclusion, ""Velma"" is a poorly executed animated comedy that fails to live up to the standards set by its predecessors. The writing is weak, the animation is unappealing, and the humor lacks the wit and cleverness that made ""Scooby Doo"" a classic. This show is not recommended for those looking for a quality animated comedy and can only provide an ultimately disappointing and fracturing experience. It's a case of ""Stinkies!"", rather than ""Jinkies!""."
1.0,"Jan 27, 2023","For starters, the took scooby doo out of the scooby doo show. Secondly, they drastically changed all of the beloved character's personalities even though they are in the same universe. Thirdly and most importantly, the show is inanely, painfully, aggressively, unfunny. The humor not only doesn't make me laugh but it also feels mean spirited. Every joke in the show somehow felt like it was targeting me even when they didn't apply to me at all. I also hate this style of animation. It feels lazy and generic. Like every new cheaply produced adult tv show looks the exact same now days and it's gotten really tired in my opinion. Over all, I cant think of a single redeeming factor for this show and I wish I could unsee it."
1.0,"Jan 25, 2023","The show really lets its audience down. The premise was interesting, so I gave it a watch when it showed up on HBO Max but I couldn't get to the second episode. The writing doesn't feel genuine or edgy or funny for that matter I think maybe we should reconsider taking established brands and stories, and remaking them into something like this I say this, as may be my perception of the TV show would be different if I didn't have something to compare it to but then again, it pretty much builds on Scooby Doo name recognition but leaves out Scooby Doo pretty much I felt disappointed and instead of investing more time to see if it would get better. I opted to try something else."
1.0,"Jan 21, 2023","I never liked the original IP so I don't care about the reimagined characters except they're all painfully bad. I can't tell if the writers are serious with their ham fisted social commentary or if it's supposed to be a post ironic take. It's like a skit about how disconnected Hollywood elites are from their viewers written so even children would understand...it's bad. Do the writers think they're so clever or that their viewers are so stupid they need to be force fed their bland ideas?

The writers use crude humor like bugs having sex, naked high school girls, and foul language as life support for their lack of humor and capacity.

Don't hate watch you'll just make them make more of this mess. Hopefully someone loses money over this."
1.0,"Jan 21, 2023","I wanted to like this show. I've always loved Velma, and was excited to see a new interpretation.

Unfortunately, in my opinion, the show's attempts at humor are mean, ugly, and cruel. The characters seem to hate each other and hate themselves. Velma's character in particular appears to have no self-respect.

I am fine with the ideas of diversity in race and sexual orientation. I am fine with racy content. But I'm not remotely interested in watching anything as ugly and mean-spirited as this show. Before the first episode was over, I felt grimy by association and wanted a shower.

Scooby Doo deserves better. The audiences deserve better. You couldn't pay me to watch more of this abysmal trash."
1.0,"Feb 3, 2023","I feel sorry for the animators that worked on this, they had to go through it all. How this script got approved is beyond me. It's like a weapon, grey cells destructor, or something similar. They implemented every stereotype and tried to make the show funny and cool, but it just goes over the top in the sense that Bricklebery is a well-toned show compared to it. I watched 4 episodes and tried to find something even remotely funny, but it was just sad. Like an uncool kid watching cool kids in school doing stuff thinking it's lame, and then when in a different surrounding trying to mimic that stuff making it unbearably lamer. The saddest thing is that the show looks good, but the content is indescribably awful."
1.0,"Feb 3, 2023","So, I am shocked at all the negative reviews. I think this show is right on point for Mindy Kaling humor. If you like The Mindy Project, The Office, Never Have I Ever etc. You'll love this show. It's cute, clever, and very sarcastic. I think the wrong audience found it. I hope it doesn't cause it go get cancelled. It's cute and funny. I think people are upset before they give it a chance because they see it as a reboot of a classic. However, this is suppose to be a prequel. It shows how the Scooby gang was assembled. They didn't start as friends they had to be brought together. It makes the story more interesting and complex. Appreciate it for what it is and stop over critiquing it."
8.0,"Jan 20, 2023",By total surprise Velma got a second season and it seems like I'm one of the few who actually wanted it. Is this the greatest show ever? No but it's far from what's been said about it. For years like many others I've wanted a more mature and raunchy Scooby-doo show so when this was announced I was pretty excited. The first season wasn't perfect but it was funny and had a pretty understandable plot. Same can be said for season two but it actually takes a step forward and imo the comedy/jokes improved. A huge portion of old Scooby-doo fans will never give this a fair shot which is disappointing because I think it puts a fresh twist on what we loved as kids. Sure it changes some things but sometimes it's just not that serious. Hopefully season three (if it's greenlit) continues to improve.
6.0,"Jan 13, 2023","Could be an original animated series (I think that even if it were, opinions would not be different) but instead they decided to take characters that already existed and were marked in the childhood of an entire generation and simply changed all the characteristics to try to adapt to something that no one asked, the characters are poorly written and without personality, they rewrote characters already written and it was just horrible.

Honorable mention for Bhaskara's form, something I learned in my 13 years and an entire studio of educated and competent adults simply was unable to reproduce

conclusion: Velma is a series that is not worth watching

As for not introducing Scooby-Doo I think he was the only one who read the script and realized it wasn't worth it."
1.0,"Jan 23, 2023","Simply horrendous and disgusting, there is nothing more to say.

It's the worst I've seen, it's even worse than Dragon Ball Evolution, I don't understand how this was approved. I couldn't even watch 10 minutes of this without being grossed out, it made me wonder what the hell is this?.

Basically it's not Velma, it's actually the creator representing herself and fulfilling her sick fantasy of looking at herself in an animated series made by her.

One thing to make small changes to something, but this is completely insane, it makes me think that there must be something seriously wrong in the heads of those who made this series and those who approved it."
1.0,"Feb 6, 2023","I had heard nothing about this show until Charlie Moisty did a video on it and I decided to check it out. This is the same type of humor in other poor animated shows like Chicago Party Aunt, garbage Simpsons episodes over the past 20 years, etc. Etc...

The show is not the worst thing I've ever seen and it really does not deserve all the one star reviews (for a one star show look at High Guardian Spice or Ex-Arm); the animation is serviceable, the narrative is able to be followed, it doesn't do anything absolutely awful besides the bad humor.

3/10 - Very poor show that takes a beloved IP and flushes it down the toilet."
1.0,"Jan 25, 2023","I'm 4 episodes into this...it's not even a mistake or travesty, this is possibly the single worst animated Television program to ever be made at all (and it's getting a season 2 supposedly!)

Velma itself is a series that doesn't know what it wants to do, does it want to be an edgy adult animation, does it want to be a romcom, does it want to be a commentary on modern culture, does it want to be seriously violent show, does it want to be a mystery series?

It doesn't know. You don't know. And if I thought Mindy Kaling knew I'd be begging her to tell us what the idea was behind this...fetted mistake.

There is no comedy, there are morals that would sound well coming out of a Bedlam room, there's characters that have no likability and there's a plot that matters less than the idea of telling that plot itself.

We're so far beyond the border of bad in this that I have no clue what will be seen as bad next year, either the dip is over with and we're about to see a massive resurgence of good storytelling or holy hell this is going to get SO much worse."
2.0,"Jan 17, 2023",This is a trash rip off garbage. The writers are a bunch of hacks relying on shock instead of a good written material. The animation was farmed out if you can tell anything about it. They only want to want to get people to tell how daring they are so it can make them feel good. If you can't get a basic story line without cursing or showing nudity or expressing the political correctness of the day you need to go back to a basic language class. I can't believe there are even a single person who falls for this hack level of writing. I hope it will go down in history of what not to do to a tv show or cartoon.
1.0,"Jan 17, 2023","Well, I knew it was going to be one of those days where a lot of money is wasted to make a show taken from a beloved IP so that people could watch it and then watch it crash directly into the mountain without any self-awareness -- other than it being a Psy-op or a way to get more viewers to watch for 'it being so terrible'.

Well, well, well, here we are. The beloved Mindy Khaling who was on The Office and had a few cameos in the edgy television show Always Sunny and films with Seth Rogan, created the new ""Santa Inc""; a giant mess of taking something that people love and perverting it with extremely fringe (and cringe) out-of-touch views by people who are more fortunate that others.

Scooby-Doo is a pretty sacred artifact, in my opinion. It's from better days where mostly everybody got along. This show does not have ""Scoob"". It's a caricature of creator Mindy Khaling who plays very liked nerdy Velma who is the source of finding clues to who the villain is in the horror-kids TV show and loses her glasses. Instead, what we got is Daria who is a bigot with a high-chip on her shoulder and thinks that anybody who disagrees with her is a bad guy from WWII.

Do me a favor, and watch all the Hanna-Barbera cartoons if you have Boomerang or money to buy the collection. Please, give yourself a healthy mind and soul and don't watch this pretentious garbage from people who probably went to Epstein Island."
1.0,"Mar 20, 2023","Honestly I wasnt happy with the idea having adult version of scooby doo they tried it with the Flinstones that didn't work they even tried it with Ren and Stimpy again its one of the shows you can't have adult edge its gonna not end well.

The problem with Velma the show is the characters are very unlikeable every single one especially Velma she too judgemental, rude and cynical she very unlikeable character.

The jokes isn't funny as well watching the two episodes not single joke made me laugh because most of it too self aware and it doesn't work for this show.

Its bad since I love original Scooby doo show and its sad how the characters are I say go watch Harley Quinn its so much better than Velma."
1.0,"May 25, 2023","Scooby Doo is a classic...this is a series of TV shows and movies that has been around forever. I grew up on it. Now you release an ""origin series"" where the characters are completely different people?? Makes absolutely zero sense. I know in this day and age everyone is obsessed with turning Caucasian characters into minorities but this is too far, there is no reason for this. Just write a new detective show with new characters; I'd have watched that and almost certainly enjoyed it. But instead you thought it was a good idea to destroy the existing show. I don't know anyone who likes this new version; black, white, yellow or green. It's stupid. You can't take a show that has been around this long and completely change the characters looks, personalities and storylines. I couldn't even get through the first episode. Leave classic characters alone. Create new, better ones!"
1.0,"Jan 17, 2023","This cartoon is awesome. Its for those who watched original scooby in 80-90s and now are grown up but still have a sense of humor. I fail to understand how in time of lousy comebacks, bo jack, bobs burgers, big mouth or kola man ect... People dont find this funny. Its making fun of all the aspects of previous versions and pop culture cliches, at some point we all wondered why Daphne is not this stock up queen b., Or if rich spoiled Freddy shouldnt be more of an a.hole, This series got violence, foul language, nudity, references to sex, lgbt and some psychodelics, full package which all current adult shows are missing. Its like South park of mystery machines, but animation is better. You want bad? New TMNT is bad, Thundercats is worse, and She-ra disapoints to next level, Velma is fresh voulgar bag of fun."
7.0,"Feb 15, 2023","You should really see it as a parody or alternative reality of the OG Scooby doo. There like a lot of versions of Scooby Doo and in this one the characters are way different than from the OG.

They are way weirder and darker as this show was definitely not meant as a kids show.

The characters have way more dept and flaws. The story revolves more about the character development than it is about the mysteries. Some moments are cringe, the characters are still trying to find theirselves as teenagers do and it are those things what makes it feel like a high school experience.

Little note as it is named Velma, it centres around velma and not Scooby doo. Some seem to forget that."
1.0,"May 9, 2023","How can I not rate this as a zero or better yet a negative infinity. Adult scooby doo within itself is something absurd! Couple that with offensive tone of the show and characters. This is NOT Scooby Doo and it should not have the right to any of the characters names. The characters are not the characters or even close to. Imagine if I took the personality of C3PO for a character gave him a suit and called him iron man. Not the same or remotely close. This show disgraces television ad the entire franchise. If it hasn't completely killed the franchise, I hope the next thing does Scooby Doo right."
1.0,"Jan 14, 2023","Like seriously...why? I am CONVINCED the pitch for this show had absolutely nothing to do with the Scooby Doo IP, but rather it feels like the show runners hated the original show and the only ""jokes"" contained within it are there to belittle everything that makes Scooby Doo and the Mystery Gang themselves. It feels like satire, as if the real meta commentary behind this show is how AWFUL Hollywood has become in their refusal to create anything new, but rather keep consuming and vomiting the same 20 classic shows over and over until they are unrecognizable that they can sell for a quick buck. This show cannot be cancelled and forgotten by time soon enough."
1.0,"Jan 12, 2023","The writing is horrid, simple as that.

While other shows with bad writing at least gotten a chuckle, or some form of investment, this is not a show that can earn that. The jokes range from preachy to bland to forced, the characters are so hard to like because (outside of maybe one character) they aren't given a reason for their horrible personalities, nor do they get any form of punishment or karma for the horrible things they tend to do. As for how it is as an adaptation, it never even tries to show respect for what came before, almost as if it hates the franchise it's loosely tied to. It's hard thinking of how many projects were canceled for this to be released, just to get a project no one seems to care about."
3.0,"Feb 13, 2023","I adore Mindy Kahling but in my opinion this is a fail. Reimagining a franchise is fine, but it should at least be entertaining.

This isn't funny and it makes a mockery of cherished childhood characters, while sewing a divisive, toxic message that permeates the entire narrative. It's a shame women can't have strong female characters that are complex, witty and enjoyable for everyone to watch.

The treatment of Fred is disappointing, and Velma's dialogue is vitriolic and not at all like the heroic nerd I grew up admiring.

I do not recommend this show, save your time and your sanity and give it a miss."
1.0,"Jan 12, 2023","Earlier this week I was talking about how much potential a Velma origin story has and how it couldn't possibly be as bad as everyone says but after episode one I've certainly changed that optimistic view.

The show feels like it's trying to be a new Drawn Together with characters that already exist rather than obvious parodies which might have atleast stopped some of the backlash.

If you must take characters that have seen multiple generations and are recognisable on a global scale then you should ask yourself why they are still popular to this day. To add to a characters depth or even create a new story takes a lot of thought and care but all this show has done is damage a reputation that's taken years to build and removed the affection that's contributed to the popularity of all the characters, not just Velma."
2.0,"Jan 19, 2023","This series is openly presented as an adult-themed, raunchy version of Scooby-Doo but it shows up with no functional ""mystery gang"", Velma and Daphne hate one another, Fred is a rude, cold, and self-absorbed, Shaggy isn't Shaggy but reinvented as Norville, and Scooby-Doo is missing in action all together.

Why is this even loosely based on Scooby Doo, there is nothing useful to tie these disparate alternative universes together, would have been better as a new creation without broken ties to a much loved franchise.

If you can get past the broken universe that didn't have a basis in reality anyway, you are left with weak characters and poor writing leaving a complete mess of a show."
1.0,"Jan 20, 2023","Legitimately trash, just garbage. After watching the first episode I wished to bleach my eyes and mind. Only good part or character is Norville. Which is where the single star comes from. I don't think I have ever seen something more unfunny in my life, hell I've laughed at knock Knock jokes more than this show. A 3 year old screaming toilet jokes at a supermarket would make me laugh harder than this show, if this show even could make me laugh. I'm glad they left out old Scooby-D he deserved much more respect than being put in this Twitter scale dumpster fire. Also they made the main character the most unlikable human ever. I probably rather hang out with Amy Schumer for a day then with Velma, and she'd probably make me laugh then the show could anyways."
1.0,"Apr 12, 2023","I was already going into it with a low expectation considering the feedback from people, but I couldn't make it past the first episode, it is truly a train wreck from every stand point. I hope they apologize to the creators of Scooby Doo for making this abhorrence. Not only have they butchered beloved characters in terms of design, but personality, and their respective plot lines also make them unlikable. As the episode keeps playing, I can only wonder how they approved even making this resemble the original. As far as story line, It's very generic, boring, and just a huge disaster. Can't wait for this to be announced cancelled and the resoectig people fired."
9.0,"Jan 14, 2023","I actually really like the is show, I think everyone is saying it's bad because they're repeating what they hear. It reminds me of a female version of an adult animated sitcom kinda like family guy or Rick and morty. If you don't like anime's or adult swim type cartoons you definitely will not like this show.

The story line is good and I can appreciate the characterization of mental health this show brings. If you try not to watch this show with the expectations of it being similar to the original scooby doo, you will be thoroughly entertained. I hope this show is renewed for a second season!"
7.0,"Apr 29, 2024","Mystery, gratuitous cartoon violence, and a crass re-imagining of family friendly characters. If this had been a stand alone IP I think its rating would have fared much better, it is by no means a masterpiece but I found myself chuckling at a few jokes, such as Norville cutting Velma's birthday painting in half with a sword and Daphne distracting her detective mothers with a text about wanting to adopt a sick cat. I first learned of this show through all the negative reviews on youtube and was preparing myself for something horrible and while I was not a huge fan of the Fred portion of the mystery I was pulled in by what could have happened to Velma's mom. It is not Scooby Doo, that is for sure, and I suspect that this had started as an original idea that was rewritten to fit Scooby Doo cast to better ensure the project was greenlit, but if you forget its relation to any of the other mystery inc properties, it is fun."
1.0,"Jan 14, 2023","Why in the name of inclusivity do people think they need to be so racist and sexist? Seems like the writers forgot to look up the word hypocrisy before the final draft. Stop this. Seriously go somewhere else with all that. No one wants this. It's a disgusting excuse for a show. It shouldn't even be considered a comedy. I could not even laugh at how bad it is. Turned a classic into an atrocious, unwatchable disaster. If this is anything more than the worst rated show ever to have been on IMDB, I will be surprised. Don't waste your time. Find something more entertaining to watch, like ANYTHING else."

Worst show to ever be greenlit (how on earth could this show have been greenlit). The show tries to promote ideology but just ends up being sexist and stupid in the process. The plot is also so terrible that I can literally eat alphabet soup and defecate out a better script than that.

This show is so bad that I dont have the mental capacity at this point to worry about the fact that they completely messed up fun and great characters from an iconic series. Thank God Scooby was not in the show, I dont know what I would have done if they screwed up his character."
1.0,"Jan 20, 2023","I will be 100% honest and say I couldn't watch it all. This isn't an adult remake of Scooby-Doo, this isn't a Velma origin, the only thing that remains of the iconic show is the names and some of the iconic symbols of the original. The Scooby-gang has been stripped of any semblance of their original personalities, the show insults everyone, but not in a truly funny/ satirical way, and Scooby is not a part of the show at all (I understand liscencing issues but Scooby is kind of a big deal if we are going to use the IP associated with Scooby-doo). Velma is by far now the worst character of the main group. Her nerdy but sincere character has been shed for an arrogant and frequently rude/ hateful one that would make any fan of the original deeply sad. The only reason this show has anyone watching it is because of the reference to the original Scooby-Doo IP, and if that is why you wanted to watch this, don't, you will not only be disappointed, but likely pretty irritated."
1.0,"Jan 12, 2023","This is yet another example of an existing property undergoing massive (unnecessary?) changes in almost all facets: including animation style, target audience, characterisation, the removal of the former titular character, etc

Sometimes is good to fix things that are broken, or just to try something new, even when there's nothing wrong with what you have.

The problem is when you miss the mark, it's all the more obvious because there's a comparison.

The show is not as funny, clever, charming, or interesting as the source material. It's a real struggle to watch to be honest.

Also, the script is very poor. I hope hbo max learns from this infamous mistake and starts listening to the audience. They are doomed to a low rating and 1 point unless they listen to people. They need to reboot this disgrace immediately. Scooby doo should be added. The characters should be mirrored in the same way they were before. It is much more enjoyable to sit and watch while the newly painted wall is waiting for it to dry, than to watch this garbage."
1.0,"Aug 7, 2024","I usually like when old characters or shows come back to life with new adaptations. I am a firm believer that if you are going to bring back characters or movies or shows, you have to adapt them to newer ideas...

I also have to say that this show makes no sense whatsoever. Many have complained that it is a disrespect towards a beloved character (it might be) but i really don´t care about that.

What i really care about is the quality of the script. The characters are dull, plain and have no depth. The stories themselves are boring and offer nothing.

Then we have the animation issue: in an animated show with this budget, one will expect to see good animation or at least decent animation... Velma is a failure in regards to the animation. Just horrible.

Some will question me: if the show wasn´t about Velma would you still hate it? What if the character was named Lucy? It´s still garbage. Just doesen´t work.

Don´t waste your time and rather go watch BoJack Horseman, Disenchantment or Rick&Morty."
2.0,"Jan 28, 2023","My eyes burned with so many forced moments, at no time did I feel like they tried to do this naturally. It was not better to create a new series to this aberration and I am not against inclusion, but rather devaluing series, characters to introduce ideologies, when those characters are already appreciated by the public of different generations. Because if you think back to every decade and every generation, they grew up watching Scooby-Doo and I'm sure no one would agree which version is better because we grew up in different eras, but if you ask them what is the personality of Fred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy and Scooby, I think we would at least think the same. But still instead of giving us something new and fresh, they gave us something so bad and disgusting, especially the jokes so poorly thought out and uncomfortable to digest."
1.0,"Feb 7, 2023","I barely ever turn anything off, this is one of the few exemptions where I just couldn't keep watching. Do yourself a favor and yourself from this show. Also why is there a minimum character to leave a review? Anyways, the show's adaptation of each character is flawed, down to the lack of humor. I am a huge fan of scooby doo but this was just a down right embarrassment. I had to turn spooky island back on just to wash my mind of this horrible show. Again I didn't finish the show as it was just to darn painful to watch. Maybe in time I'll try to finish it. But then again I don't want to subject myself to that kind of torture."
10.0,"Jan 30, 2023","The show opens with almost immediately addressing race switched roles in the dialogue. It's witty and self aware like that. The exploration and adventures of adolescents with endless imagination and perhaps a little too much freedom due to lax parenting leads to a hilarious new adult cartoon. It's a refreshing take on a comic/kids show/movie that I'd never been interested previously and I hope that it gets renewed.

Velma is both relatable and funny and makes for an enjoyable narrator, even if she may not be the most reliable one. Daphne and Fred are misunderstood, and Norville is simply wonder and probably my favorite character. I recommend giving it a shot!"
6.0,"Apr 15, 2024","Not sure why people are hating on this so much... it's actually quite enjoyable. Is it Scooby-Doo? No. Is it fun with characters you already love reimagined? Yeah!

I'm glad I watched this to be honest and I'd recommend it to others for sure. It's adult humour and it's fun - everything it's advertised as.

To the people that absolutely hate it and can't believe the travesty that's been done here... maybe chill out? Not everything needs cancelling because you didn't get the jokes."

Velma somehow makes Bojack Horseman seem like a nice and lovable person.

Where are the scooby-doo characters we all know and love? Certainly not in this show.

What happened to Himbo Fred, Quick on Her Feet Daphne, Brains of the Operation Velma and He's Just Like Us Shaggy?

Instead they've given us Douchebag stereotype Fred, Imbecile stereotype Daphne, My Ego Dwarfs Sherlock Holmes Velma and Black stereotype Shaggy.

For a show that claims it's ""colour blind"" it sure takes advantage of making race jokes as often as possible. (If you want to watch a show that actually does the colour blind thing well go rewatch Sandman) You can make an adult show and not make it all about sex jokes and race jokes. The original scooby-doo is liked by all ages for a reason?

You know your show is bad when it manages to unite all of humanity to agree on how awful it is.

Would not recommend to anyone."

The writing was terrible and lacked the wit and charm of the original. The humor fell flat and failed to entertain. I found myself constantly cringing at the poor attempts at humor. I would not recommend this show to anyone, and it is a shame that the legacy of the original has been tarnished by this terrible reboot. It was clear that the creators had no respect for the source material and were only looking to cash in on the success of the original. I wish I could erase the whole thing from my memory."
3.0,"Apr 6, 2023","This shouldn't have anything to do with scooby doo. The writers either actively hate scooby doo or their own show or both.

Unfunny, un entertaining. Considering the quality of voice actors the writing is disgusting. If they wanted to make an updated, grown up version they could have done. But this has nothing at all to do with scooby do.

Even if this was a stand alone ip it would be awful. It's just constant pop culture take downs one after the other with no character development. You can't just have a show on a major TV channel constantly take shots at shows on big TV channels. I think the writers thought they were being edgy and funny. It's just cringy and insufferable."
1.0,"Jan 27, 2023","I would rate it a 0 if I could and here's why.

While I don't mind the race swapping of the characters I find it ridiculous that the one who was kept white, Fred is the butt of many jokes due to his race. Like I thought we were over this sort of thing-?? Oh and where's Scooby-?? There is no mystery gang without him bruh. And while I watched the show I do believe that Velma is Mindy's self insert for many reasons one of them being is that Velma acts nothing like she did in the original show, she's now rude and makes horrible offensive joke's. Like I get you want to make money and milk this series with a guaranteed fan base while giving Mindy her self insert but if you wanted to do that you could have made a new series with new characters instead of making 'Velma'"
1.0,"Jan 14, 2023","This take on the beloved childhood show, Scooby Do, many grew up with, maybe the most offensive, and painful iteration of the franchise to date.

The show writers are grossly out of touch with target audience. Many of the ""jokes"" if you can refer to the writing style masquerading as such fall flat or are just outright offensive. One would get the impression the people responsible for creating these series may not actually like the original show itself. This is something I could see someone making as satire, but seeing as the show not only got past story boarding and production, but launched for live view on streaming services makes me question if this is not just one horrible fever dream. Sadly it's not.

While it would be easy to immediately pick apart the overt changes deliberately made to strike up controversy for the sake of getting attention on the show ... The plan may have backfired. Many maybe afraid to comment on some of the major changes for fear of getting called unfavorable terms such as intolerant for not liking the stark visual changes of the shows characters. Here's something I can say I'm not afraid to say personally. The shock value of changing the characters can be done correctly, but this show decided to make frankly offensive stereotypes of many of the races portrayed. The show relies heavily on cultural shock value and pop culture references that were dated before the show's conception. Much of the writing though can be summarized in just a few words; rude, mean spirited, and pejorative.

This show's characters seem like a bunch of people that dressed up to go to a costume party as the mystery gang; that couldn't even be bothered to bring a stuffed dog with a cardboard colored square with SD scribbled with some crayons.

I wouldn't even recommend this show to someone I disliked."
1.0,"Jan 28, 2023","So poor I had to create an account to express my confusion as to what this show is supposed to be. It's not funny and at times it's just awful. Cartoon like this are supposed to be funny but it seems the writers hate their audience.

It seems the writers also hate Scooby Doo, as it seems they have taken a beloved character group, killed them and replaced with wired drones that are humourless and very predictable.

Such a shame that any resources are wasted on this rather than trying to find something new and funny. There is plenty of new material out there and WB should be looking and supporting this rather than this very unfunny dros."
1.0,"Jun 6, 2023","This is quite easily the worst Scooby-doo adaptation I've ever watched.. I love the new character designs that's the 1 star, everything else.. where do I start. You've completely ruined the characters personality. The whole point of the show was they were different, but they still stuck through everything TOGETHER. The show was about unity, they were the unlikeliest of friends and yet they went through hell and back together. I was so excited for this, I was so excited for the inclusiveness and diversity in the show. I wasn't ready for you to make your own new characters completely who just so happen to have the same names as the originals. I do not recommend watching this if you want to keep your original idea of the characters intact."
1.0,"Jan 20, 2023","What a miserbale roller coaster of abject idiocy. Talks down to everyone including it's target audience. Patronising women, minorities and even sentient slices of cheese. This is the sirt of series you'd watch if you were looking for an excuse to wander into the woods and die. The message is so hollow yet ham fisted Amy Schumer would be envious of the degree of desperation. One or two dark jokes land but the remainder is the table scraps of a wretched 2016 Tumblr post that sent me back into alcoholism. Lord oh Lord do they ever grovel to the bottom of the barrel. God have mercy on whomever condoned this stinking mess of an insult to the portion of humanity they pander to."
9.0,"Feb 4, 2023",I dig this. It's not for everyone obviously & clearly not for kids but dig this reimagining of a classic series and making it adult. It's definitely over the top yet touches on some social issues without being preachy. I really don't get what all the negativity is about. I dig the character voice actor choices too. There's a bit to unpack in the first couple episodes so don't go to the kitchen unless you pause it. I dig the scary element in this as well as a little cartoon gore and violence & they even get a little sexy. Velma is harmless adult animation that falls a little short sometimes but still gets a laugh anyway.
7.0,"Jun 26, 2024","I grew up watching every addition to the franchise. Of course, nothing beats the classics, however the show and it's audience is evolving. I've been waiting for the day we saw an adult version to the franchise and having Velma, especially her being of color, is a great addition! If you're watching this show and comparing it to the original, you will be disappointed. But if you're watching this show as it's own version in the franchise, you will be pleased and find the comedy in it. This is a great cast of actors and it's about time Scooby Doo has some adult humor/horror and a new cast of bipoc and queer storylines. Also this is an ORIGIN story.... Scooby will show up."
1.0,"Jan 29, 2023","It's alright. I absolutely hate that they altered the characteristics of the gang. Going into the episode one, was the worst, I didn't like the whole bit they were doing. I feel like they should have aged them up, it would have been more appropriate for the series. For me it's not a big deal that they changed the races of the characters. I gotta be honesty, it's hilarious that they had to entirely change the characteristics of shaggy because they are considered stereotypes now that he's black. The creators of the show overly emphasis that he's not a stoner. Very funny. I'm gonna hate watch every episode. ALSO WHERE TF IS SCOOBY."
1.0,"Feb 14, 2023","Not only has Velma caused an outrage with the immense fanbase of Scooby Doo, it has managed to either: piss off, annoy, cringe, and enrage almost all viewers who have stumbled upon this show. It had such great potential with the amazing work done by the animations team, but due to the incompetence that is the writing team; this show has insulted generations of fans from around the world. I do hope the directors recycle this show into something worth being excited about and do this series the justice that it deserves.

And here's a little piece of advice to the writers, insulting your entire audience by saying that cartoon's are only for stoned out loser adults is not a great way to make your characters likeable. Try again."
1.0,"Jan 14, 2023","I don't mind LBGT+ content. Or re-imagining a beloved children's show for adults. But the writing is awful in the first episode. Every joke seems forced. None of the dialog is natural. They do more telling than showing. It seems like a jumbled mess of race, women, and sexuality issues, and stereotypes, shoved into a space that is too small. And all of it is over the top. It's too much and repetitive. I'm fine with tackling these issues, but it's gotta flow. I found my mind drifting. Looked back at the screen episode 2 was playing and almost finished. I don't know what happened to the girl in the locker and don't care. None of the characters are likable. Nothing hooks the viewer. As a writer myself, that is the first thing you should do. This was a huge miss, it has potential with a different team of writers.

I updated my rating, after I got through the first horrible episode it was fine. But I stand by my criticism. The first episode is key to keeping your audience. For the first episode 1 🌟 the rest 5 🌟."
1.0,"Jan 24, 2023","I like to watch films and series that are really bad, so bad that they are good. Well, this isn't one of them. I do not understand why they had to ruin a childhood fave like Scooby Doo. I sat through the first one, trying to find something I could appreciate. Nope, nothing. What's with all the sex enthused stuff in there as well? I am a big fan of HBO and trust them to make excellent content, so it's even more heartbreaking to see 2 favourites go down like this. All I can say is, that this show was really really disappointing in all imaginable aspects. The reviews here do not do justice to how bad it is. I recommend you erase the thought of existence of this series from your memories. I really wish for the first time I had that machine from MIB. I'd rather forget my past than having to remember this thing. I'll now go throw up."
1.0,"Jan 16, 2023","I was a huge fan of Scooby-Doo as a kid growing up in the 90s. Watched every episode/movie from the 70s through early 2000s. I loved the show so much that I even had a Scooby-Doo birthday cake, wrist watch, and stuffed animal during my childhood. When I first saw the advertisement for Velma, I was genuinely excited for it to premier. Well, that initial excitement has been turned to major disappointment and irritation.

Aside from the names of the characters, there really is nothing relative to the shows and/or movies we all grew up watching. Based upon the ""TV-MA"" rating, I knew the content would be for adults. However, the humor, if you want to call it that, is just simply NOT FUNNY. Literally everything is based around sex and vulgar language. I expected there to be some sexual references and/or vulgar language, but not every other line.

Needless to say, the writing is terrible, the plot is lame, and the characters are awful and nothing remotely close to the characters in the original Scooby-Doo show. HBO's Velma is a hard pass for me."
1.0,"Jan 17, 2023","I saw only two chapters, I could not see anymore or I would puke.

I'm so sorry W. Hanna & J. Barbera; I just cannot believe the guts to change your so lovely characters into this atrocious things.

I was expecting some real story about the beginnings of Velma and the awesome guys we loved when we were children, but I could only find the vomit from the heart of the producers and the frustration and non self acceptance of an Indian woman, projecting herself into an endearing and loved character, turning Velma into the worst version of her.

She is Velma no more.

I just wanna punch the wall after seeing this filth."
1.0,"Jan 19, 2023","The trolling on this show is so severe. It's funny, clever, fast-paced, and incredibly well written. I really enjoy the character of Velma and the journey that she's on to solve her own mystery. The supporting characters are a departure from the original Mystery Gang - but that's okay! I think it's great that we've had so many different iterations of these characters. I feel like we're getting a bit of Adult Swim into an interpretation of the world of these classic favs. What we're left with is something that feels fresh, hilarious, and a bit obscene. The speed is also delightful! This show clips along and it's fun to keep up - and I love all the shenanigans happening consistently in the background. So much fun!"
1.0,"Feb 13, 2023","I get there's a lot of hate, the Scooby franchise is literally worshipped by some, but it's honestly not THAT bad of a show.

The issue with Velma is the start is like a slap in the face. The writers took the shock therapy route to make it clear that this show is vastly different from previous instalments in the franchise. The first few episodes were a meagre 4-5* rating from me.

It's unfortunately not until episode 7 (of 10) when it feels like a fun Scooby show. Not only are the last 4 episodes way more fun, the writing and pacing is unrecognisably better than the start of the show. This turning point also marks when the show refocuses on the mystery at hand whilst sneaking in a plethora of smile-inducing nods to the previous Scooby-Doo shows.

I honestly loved the last few episodes so much that I bumped by rating up to a 7/10.

If the show get another season (and that's a big IF), I sincerely hope they continue with the same direction/writing/energy from the end of the first attempt. As a fan of scooby doo, I am so excited to see how they do the next part of the Mystery Gang's beginnings."
10.0,"Jan 23, 2023","It is so bad I want to give it a 0, but that's not possible, so I give it a... 1. I have watched and adored Scooby-Doo since I was a child. What in the world was Mindy Kaling thinking??!?!?! Seriously what kind of twisted world are the writers living in where they every person and ""teenagers"" as so vapid, dumb, just bad people. Not a single one of the characters is remotely enjoyable to watch. Velma is also just unlikable. The story line is insufferable and the unnecessary back story given to her glasses and catchphrase further ruins the character. This show knowingly takes iconic characters and makes them horribly unlikable. Seriously one of the worst and unenjoyable pieces of ""entertainment"" I have ever seen in my life."
6.0,"May 7, 2023","I heard of the bad review but being a Scooby-Doo fan, I'd figured why not... couldnt go pass the second episode. Should of listened to my gut and stopped mid way through the first episode.

Horrible! Its wayy more than not-funny-at-all. Feels like grievances coming out every 5mins.

I didn't even have huge expectations knowing this is about Velma. But boy, the Velma I saw growing up, who I would love to see a grown up version working with her friends to solve crimes, definitely missed the mark. It probably would of been better to have original characters and not destroying the legacy of Scooby-Doo. This show, Its not slapstick, its not dark, its just sad.

One star, not worth even the first 15mins."
1.0,"Feb 21, 2023","Now we finally found a device that doesnt break Geneve's conventions about torturing prisoners to get a confession out of them. The deadliest terrorists wouldnt be able to sit through the first 2 episodes, God forbit the whole season. Imagine crashing on a bike with a serious road rush being scraped and cleaned under a hot shower. Thats pretty close to understand a mental pain and strain it can put on a viewer.

My mobile phone carrier offered me a new plan with a free HBO max subscription. After this experience I cancelled the whole plan and got another carrier.

If any of my friends praise this show i will seriously start to question their mental health."
1.0,"Jan 16, 2023","Scooby Doo, a likeable children's show about a group of unlikely friends from different backgrounds solving mysteries and having fun. The show really was pretty simple in its charm and wouldn't be too difficult to get right in a new series. Right? Well, Velma's writers took the challenge and then blew everyone's expectations out of the water. They showed incredible finesse and skill in the way they worked. First, we heard that Scooby was being removed from Scooby Doo. Our expectations dropped in response. Then they announced that the show that had been about the group of friends was now to be focused on only one of the characters. Could be interesting, but hard to pull off, expectations lowered a little more. Oh, and by the way, they needed to come up with some sort of way to make the show appeal to a more diverse audience, maybe add some new characters to explore? Nah, we'll just swap the races of a few characters because it's much easier to toss a nice bone off the table for the POCs to chew on than it is to make anything original with meaningful diversity. My expectations fell as far as I thought possible.

And then somehow this show managed to take my abject expectations and sink them faster its writers' careers. It is saturated with acrimony and bitterness. It's as if the writers despise anyone who might be marginally smarter, more popular, or better off than them, and wish they would all burn in fire. This show has no charm, no whit or fun. Instead, its characters spew hate and self-aggrandizement. The attempts at humor make nails on a chalkboard seem pleasant, and the dialogue is as attractive as a Chipotle enema.

Overall, one might say that this is not a great show: 1/10."
1.0,"Apr 17, 2023","I suffered watching this. I sat down with a genuinely open mind and sat through and watched it in its entirety knowing it was NOT supposed to be the original Scooby Doo gang I grew up watching so maybe it was actually good but good lord was I couldn't have been more wrong.

Now I know times have changed over the years, and what is considered good comedy has changed too, but the writing, character portrayals, everything about this show was such absolute garbage that whoever decided to green light this train wreck of a dumpster fire obviously never read a single script of this.

(At least I hope so because if they did that's even worse).

None against the VA's, but I sincerely hope whoever thought this was going to be a great idea of an show and any other who wrote this shows script never do so again for anything else. Ever."
2.0,"Jan 21, 2023","This is not scooby doo or scooby gang. Its just another forced show with characters from a popular series.

The idea of reimagine the scooby doo franchise for an adult audience is something that many of us wanted because a more mature crime/mystery theme, adding a more inclusive approach is perfect for the scooby universe.

The thing is that this show centers more in a character that feels forced, angry, annoying and hard to like, using a crime background that is just not enough to save this inclusive with a popular ip wanna be of a show. Wich is the perfect formula for an excellent series when is done right.

Sadly this is not the case."
1.0,"Jan 31, 2023","I am 42 years old. I have watched and loved Scooby-Doo and the Gang my entire life. The heart of Scooby-Doo has always been non-sexual teen friends and their awesome dog finding clues, solving mysteries, and catching people disguised as monsters or ghosts.

This Velma show is a disgrace and true disrespect of the Scooby franchise. Nudity, bad words, hate, jealousy and so many other things make Velma outside of bounds for what Scooby fans want and love.

Most important point: This show has every right to exist, but it is not for true Scooby fans and I am sad about the damage that this show does to the integrity of the Scooby-Doo franchise."
1.0,"Jan 21, 2023","It's unfortunate to see such poor writing in this new Scooby-Doo project. The idea of the beloved cartoon characters discussing such a heavy topic is ill-advised and insensitive. The new character, who is supposed to be a replacement for Shaggy, seems like a pointless addition and fails to capture the essence of the original character. It's as if the creators behind this project have lost touch with what made the original cartoon so beloved.

It's not just the new character that is problematic, the entire project seems to be lacking in any real direction or purpose. It seems as though the creators have forgotten what made the original show so great, and have instead focused on trying to appeal to a more mature audience. This leads to jokes that are mean-spirited and out of place in such a beloved franchise.

It's disappointing to see a beloved franchise being mishandled in such a way, and it's important that Warner Bros. Learns from this mistake. It's not worth even watching this new project out of spite."
1.0,"Jan 17, 2023","This show is hilarious! It's smart, clever, and has great feminist and social commentary. It's completely different than the original and thats the whole point. Velma riffs on the basic concept of the Scooby Doo characters and exists in a whole new universe. Freddy as a douchey trust find baby, Daphne as a pretty mean girl, Velma as a band nerd-it's a fun take. There are countless ""adult animation series"" with gross out bro humor or are catered to make audiences. I think Velma doesn't cater to the male gaze and that's why I like it so much. All the people who are bashing it just don't get it! It's not for you."
1.0,"Jan 23, 2023","Tried and tried to think of something positive to say, anything at all.

The writing is bad, the voice talent isn't very good (disappointing considering some of the names involved), the animation is lacklustre, it's a misguided attempt to use an iconic intellectual property. IMDB requires 600 characters and I really don't see the point of slathering more shade onto this negligible body of hot garbage. I mean, I'm sure you're heard how bad this is by now, go ahead and give it a look if you feel like it deserves a fair shake. Everyone's entitled to his, her, or their own opinion. My opinion is that it's terrible. I bet that will be your opinion also.

Somebody, make this go away forever.

Yuck."
10.0,"Jan 31, 2023","This is arguably one of the worst shows I've ever seen. Never before have a seen a protagonist who is constantly cruel & useless. None of the jokes land and they all isolate and patronize any potential audience who may enjoy this show.

The show serves as a pointless IP grab where the writers get revenge for all the mean things that were said to them as kids. However they are being equally as mean as adults.

This is the vicious cycle that this show use as its model for every episode.

The random pop culture references are cringeworthy & the animation leaves much to be desired.

It appears as if this show was green lighted just to trigger as many people as possible."
7.0,"Jan 16, 2023","Velma is the latest HBO TV show to come out and boy is it a hard one to watch. This show doesn't know what it wants to be and has an identity crisis. Im not exactly sure why this show exists. It had me rolling my eyes and it successfully made me cringe within 5 minutes of watching. Scooby isn't even in the show! How are you going to do a Scooby Doo show without having Scooby in it? Got maybe a single chuckle out of me in 2 episodes though, so that's nice. The art direction was super not impressive. I mean seriously, it looks like every other animated show. I don't know why this show exists and who it's made for. Thank you."
1.0,"Jan 22, 2023","This show, which is a modern adaptation of the classic cartoon series Scooby-Doo, doesn't seem to capture the same spirit or tone as the original. It feels as if the creators are trying to make a more mature, adult version of the show, but it comes across as forced and unnatural.

The humor and characters that made the original so beloved are missing, and it doesn't feel like a true continuation of the franchise.

Overall, it falls short of expectations and doesn't live up to the legacy of the original Scooby-Doo series.

Additionally, the mystery-solving aspect of the show could be highlighted more, as that was a key part of the original series.

By focusing on these elements and bringing back the heart and soul of the original, the show could become a true continuation of the beloved franchise, rather than a forced adult version."
1.0,"Jan 23, 2023","I'm cool with adult humor in cartoons. Big Mouth, hilarious. F is For Family, fantastic. Rick and Morty, might be one of the deepest cartoons ever. I could go on, but you get the point. I say all that to say this... Velma is complete trash. It's trying so hard to be something it's not. I'm pretty sure I'd still say this even if it didn't crap on one of my childhood favorites. Even if the characters were original and the show didn't take place (loosely) within the Scooby Doo universe I would still hate this show. Do yourself a favor, read about two of the other reviews (which basically say the same thing as mine) and just save yourself a half hour of your life."
1.0,"Jan 18, 2023","Totally disposable!

Instead of adding, it managed to destroy a franchise, like all those who try to raise an identity flag, modernize a classic with conditions that do not represent the majority of the population, force an unnecessary opinion when we expect a work that would be a more adult nostalgia, but without appeals .

It's not worth watching because you're more concerned about misrepresenting the original work, changing ethnicity, discussions about gender, diminished male, things like that that don't help at all to the hype generated.

It's a pity the waste of time and money developing what's in the mind of those who idealized it."
1.0,"Feb 2, 2023","I consider myself a person of equal chances, when I see a show being trashed everywhere I decide to watch it myself. That leads me to this, this show is without a doubt the WORST show I have ever seen. No other show has made me this upset, it is clear that this show is meant to insult whoever watches it, no matter who. This show should be wiped from all streaming platforms. This show should even be canceled, better shows that are a lot less insulting have been canceled for a lot less. If I could I would've rated this zero stars, but seeing as that is not possible, I have settled with the lowest, a one star rating."
1.0,"Jan 29, 2023",It's very clear that people are reviewing this without watching it but let me tell you it's actually pretty good. There were several moments that made me laugh out loud. Glenn howerton is a star and his portrayal of Fred is the best part. I'm glad his rage is being utilized correctly. It makes fun of itself without being too on the nose. A lot of people were mad that they changed the characters too much but since it's an origin story I'm excited to see how they develop into the mystery gang. All I'm saying is don't knock it til you've tried it. It's not going to be for everyone but if you love adult cartoons you'll probably like it.
1.0,"Feb 14, 2023",What was the reason for this. It is a dark day in Scooby-Doo history to have done this. Not only is it just the names of the beloved characters being used but also a complete opposite of their beliefs in helping people. It is not a funny show and it doesn't help build up the community that should have gotten a boost from Velma. The attempt at humor failed and it is like a rejected season of Daria. The question is what was the cast and crew of this mess thinking. Why didn't they just beat scooby with a stick and see how it played out. I am sure the Care Bears and Smurfs have a show we can attempt such poor writing and humor with also.
1.0,"Jan 27, 2023","I'm an old timer. I remember the original series. I absolutely LOVED ""Scooby Doo Where Are You?"" And I know things change and evolve.

But this definitely isn't for me. I feel like they wanted to do a series, and picked Mystery Inc. To avoid doing all the world building.

But this series comes across as ... well, mean spirited They might have meant some of it to to come across as humor, but it didn't. It comes across as mean, cruel and shallow.

I feel like they've stripped any charm out of all of the other series. I should have stopped with the first episode, but I had hoped the second one would be better. It only served to reinforce how much the first episode (and the series) isn't for me.

Maybe the next one though.

*Fingers crossed!*"
1.0,"Jan 18, 2023","I'm not sure what to say about this show. I'll start by saying that this is the show that pushed me over the edge into canceling my hbo subscription. This show is straight up demeaning. Every painstaking attempt at a joke makes it painfully obvious that it was written by 40-50 year olds trying to connect to the younger audience. I wont try to point out every bad part about this, first, there would be too much to talk about in this one review and also, people have done it better than I could in these reviews and on YouTube, so if you want to know everything I hate about this show, go watch something on YouTube."
9.0,"Feb 5, 2023","For starter's the first episode literally begins on a scene with high school girls in a shower with unfunny commentary on how pilot episodes on shows have more nudity than the rest of the series. It's like Euphoria if every scene had an unfunny commentary on the current situation. Second, none of the main characters are like able especially in the case of Velma. She is mean to every other character in the series and doesn't make any efforts to improve herself. This also sadly applies from Fred who is degraded to a rich either boy with body insecurities. Third, as mentioned before, the show handles teen sexuality very poorly.

Fourth, with the complete lack of Scooby Doo, who everyone and their loves, the show has left out any potential redeeming qualities. And finally it is just rampantly unfunny as it constantly uses meta humor in all the wrong ways and doesn't even try with other materials. A fart joke would be infinitely better compared to what we see in the series.

I thought She-Hulk had it bad, but at least it didn't completely hate on its audience and source material. So in other words. Velma is a series with no respect for its audience or any parties involved and it doesn't help that many other, better shows got the axe in favor of this."
6.0,"Sep 23, 2024","I couldn't finish one episode and I pride myself on staying till the end. I don't know what the messaging was meant to be, stay away I'm guessing. The people responsible for this had no love for the source material and it shows. They don't add to any of the history or attempt to expand on the characters motivations. Unless the motivations of the character was always hate loathing and demeaning of everyone she's come across in her lifetime. All I can relate is there was no hook to keep me vested in this show, just bad humor, preaching, and bile. Don't waste your time, watch a classic like Jaws or the Godfather rather than wast a minute on this dumpster fire."
1.0,"Jan 21, 2023","Words cannot express how bad Velma is, from the very moment we seen the first trailer, or heck, that image of the main cast? The whole point of the show is to be an adult, dull humour version, but all I see is a no attempt, sad excuse of a follow up to the classic show that is Scooby doo.

Speaking of Scooby Doo, where is he? The name, ""Scooby Dooby Doo, where are you?"" Does not ring more true than when watching this series. The plot feels empty, and forced at best, characters are just awful stereotypes that don't even slightly resemble their original characters, heck, shaggy is a whole different character now!

Overall, don't bother watching this pile of utter garbage, it deserves a 0.1/10 on IMDb, and I made an account just to give this a bad review."
5.0,"Jan 20, 2023","So I am one of those few who never watched Scooby Doo. Maybe 2 or 3 episodes, and then the one in Supernatural where Dean and Sam was sent to the Scooby alternative universe.

With that background, I thoroughly enjoyed this! The humor is great, and it's very tongue in cheek with a number of topics. The characters are *not* the same as in the Scooby shows (from the little I know) but that doesn't phase me as I am watching this as an outsider almost.

Not meant for kids though. Lots of explicit references and the first episode had a lot of (covered in all the right places) nudity.

Only on episode 2 at the moment, but I am certainly binge watching this thing to the end with the sincere hope that they will bring out season 2!!"
1.0,"Jan 21, 2023","I have no problem with shows being changed up and made new. Sometimes it breathes fresh air into old characters we all love but this show doesn't do that at all. It tries to tell jokes that never land, it completely changed core characteristics of main characters, and seems to have been written by people in their late 30s trying to connect to teens. The idea of this show wasn't bad if it had been executed in a completely different way. This series seems like it was trying to be the Harley Quinn animated series that's all on HBO but that show actually worked because it wasn't as pushy with the references to ""hashtags"" and other things kids these days might be saying. It's unfortunate because an adult cartoon about the origin story of the Scooby Doo gang could've actually been hilarious but this show just isn't."
2.0,"Jan 25, 2023",Holy Hell it's like the creators want to to ruin the Scooby Doo brand like Scooby isn't even in it and all the jokes are super meta and not in a good way. It's like they took the Scooby Doo IP and they milked it dry until it wasn't milk able anymore. The whole point of Scooby Doo is to have funny and enjoyable characters and Velma has just switch that around and did the opposite like Velma is a really big jerk and they need to make sure that we know that Fred has a small Willy for some reason. I would be fine if this was an alternate mystery solving gang in the Scooby Doo universe but it isn't it's just bad DO NOT WATCH.
1.0,"Jan 17, 2023","I'm going to say this really quickly, my problem isn't mainly Scooby Doo. It's fine that he isn't involved in a show about the crew, but that doesn't matter. My problem is with 1, how the characters were written, 2, what the show is, and 3, the visuals. Velma is not Velma, she is Mindy Kaling. The show reinforces racial stereotypes such as Indian women having hairy arms or masculine faces, and that's what Velma's supposed to be insecure about. Moving onto 2, which is my HEAVY issue, the concept. In order to make a show that caters to adults, they set the story up for ( used to be ) adults now in high school? Not to mention the fact that the first shot we see of anyone is high school girls naked, which I find extremely weird. If you want to make an adult show, make them adults. The characters had their entire personalities changed to make the sole conflict "" Everyone is rude and selfish. "" Not only is that unrealistic, it proves Mindy and her crew only know how to write one form of conflict between people. Lastly, the art is atrocious. The line thickness changes randomly, the facial expressions border on ugly, and the artstyle fluctuates too often. It's like High Guardian Spice had an older sister that's still trying to be relevant. Really, if HBO wanted to make a show about Scooby Doo, at least do it willingly and with heart."
1.0,"Jan 24, 2023","This show is exactly like that kid in your class that thought they were smarter than everyone else. It loudly stands up and tries to criticize and pick things apart, and it thinks it's hilarious. The show is so proud that it had the courage to stand up and say what everyone was thinking. But nobody cares, nobody was really thinking it, and nobody is entertained. Because this kid actually isn't that smart. And they aren't funny, or even vaguely witty. They're just annoyingly interrupting everyone with a bunch of ""edgy"" comments and bad takes. Anyways if you just LOVED that kid in your class, this show is for you. If you want to hear the ""deep"" thoughts of a spoiled rich mid witted edge lord, this one is for you."
1.0,"Jan 24, 2023","If all the things you enjoyed about the Original got roasted by a flame-thrower....you get this PoS. The fact that the writers have completely missed the audience, current culture, and any possibility of humor, is quite embarrassing. The repeated cringe whinge of the main character against anyone different, aka race or gender difference, is shockingly against the supposed progressive world view.

The Original cartoon named after a removed for no reason character in this terrible new version. Scooby-Doo just isn't a part of the crew anymore? Okay.

I want to attempt to say something good and uplifting about this series, but no. I can't. HBO should delete every memory this was ever produced."
10.0,"Jan 24, 2023","I can't even believe that this is a real show. It's seems like a parody of something. Also incudes racism, sexism and bodyshaming. It has nothing todo with Scooby Doo for me. They just stole some good characters and made an own show, which is the worst thing I ever saw. Is there really people outside who has enjoy it? I refuse to believe that this kind of people exist. And if the producers of this show really though that it was a good idea to produce this trash, they should get some help for they mental health and touch some grass instead of hanging on twitter all day and make up problems which don't exist."
7.0,"Jan 19, 2023","This is the worst adaptation ever. But not including Scooby is the first red flag. Within the first 5 mins you see them try to use profanity and nudity to make it more ""adult"" but that just comes off as cheap. There's a reason these characters have been able to be appealing to multiple generations and it's completely lost here. They took away the character traits that made each one loveable. It feels like they are trying to profit off a beloved series but didn't take any care to make these characters pay homage to their origins. Did the creators ever even watch Scooby doo ? This had so much potential but was a complete flop."
1.0,"Jan 15, 2023","I usually prefer live action over animation almost to the exclusion of animated shows. This show is a rare exception. It is meta or self-aware or breaks the fourth wall or whatever you call it. And, contrary to some other reviews I've read (from the 10 user reviews disparaging the story because it goes outside the boundaries of the original), it's directly in line with the traditional components of an ""origin story"". This particular one is even more creative because no canonical basis exists. It's smart and funny and plays with the viewers expectations. What anyone would expect of Mindy Kaling."
1.0,"Jan 12, 2023","I can't believe HBO want to be involved with such low quality comedy with the making of this show. It's like HBO hired Beavis and Butt-head to make an animated television series. It's an unnecessary extension of the Scooby-Doo universe, seemingly missing the dog, satirical dialogue of high school students, and came off as unsettling. The design choices for some of the characters was also very off-putting. It was a waste opportunity from a streaming service that I feel gives top quality content almost always. Hopefully HBO learns from this blunder and takes into consideration what wrong with this series when releasing future content."
1.0,"Jan 24, 2023","Making this show part of the Scooby Doo universe is not baffling, it's a cynical ploy for attention and an audience. For a show that makes a big deal of ideas like inner beauty, ironically its only connecting thread to the IP it's highjacking is characters that look like the ones in Scooby Doo.

Characters:

-Velma is the least likable character in her own origin story. She's judgmental, mean-spirited, amoral, and preachy despite her many character flaws. As an audience member you are asked to relate to and root for her, but her personality makes this impossible. Mindy Kaling plays the role of a miserable, unlikable human being very well which I'm sure is just a coincidence.

-Daphne is the heart of the show (which isn't saying much) because she's still mean-spirited and amoral, but with less of the judgment and constant preaching. In the show's endless cavalcade of varying degrees of anti-hero, Daphne might be the closest we get to a protagonist.

-""Norville"" is a simp. An incel. His defining character trait is an unrequited and inexplicable love for someone that sucks. Other than that his main value to the show seems to be that he's the only one of these high school students that possesses a valid drivers license and has access to a car.

-Fred exists for the sole purpose of allowing Mindy Kaling and the writers room to rip on rich people, white people generally, and white men exclusively at the drop of a hat. They do this anyway regardless of Fred's presence so he is basically a non-character.

-The killer is the only person in this show that you're likely to be rooting for. The killer is the only person that can free us from 5 more episodes in the hellscape of Crystal Cove and mercy kill this abortion of a television series before HBO Max does the same later this year. Let's be real though, it's gonna be some white guy because the social commentary in this show is as subtle as a burning circus. I'll never know who it is because it's episode 4 and I'm out.

Plot:

The writers of this show MAYBE could've handled 1 A-plot, but there's like 3 or 4 A-plots spanning the series and then 1 or 2 B-plots per episode. It meanders all over the place and goes nowhere, but it doesn't matter. In this show the ""plot"" is just an invisible hand that guides the characters to new places and scenes in which to preach, have ""witty"" dialogue, and generally be terrible people.

Writing:

What is there to say? The first 5 minutes is an absolute barrage of trash that is sure to turn off all but the most committed hate-watchers. It's a murder-mystery where you don't care who the murderer is, hate the people being murdered, and hate the people trying to solve the murder even more. It's a comedy that's not funny. Let me set a scene for you. Velma is fighting a character and says she's going to ruin the character's butt lift. The character asks Velma to throw her on her face instead of her butt to protect the butt lift. Velma says she can't tell which is which before slamming the character on her butt thus causing her butt implants to fly out of her mouth. If that sounds like a humorous scenario to you then congrats on being one of the 6% of people that are entertained by this show.

Animation:

It's generic, forgettable Cal Arts garbage just as you would expect. It fits the tone of the show perfectly.

Summary:

This show isn't even worth a hate watch. Between Velma, The Prince and Santa Inc. HBO Max needs to rethink its strategy when it comes to animated shows. This ain't it chief."
1.0,"Jan 25, 2023","So first off pretty sure no one on the writing team has ever seen Scooby Doo and they're just writing it based off vague descriptions. The characters have little to no semblance to the Mystery Gang and just have the same names. I'm not sure if this is supposed to be comedy because there's nothing even remotely funny, but to make up for it there are a bunch of bad takes on social issues. Like a person who tries to be edgy but just comes off hateful and bitter. This isn't even one of those shows that's so bad it's good. Take some outdated pop culture references, add in a sprinkling of racism, a cup of misandry, and a full quart of body shaming and you get this steaming pile of Doo."
1.0,"Jan 25, 2023","I honestly thought HBO couldn't top Santa, Inc. As the least funny thing ever created. I was wrong.

It's not just that the show isn't funny, even though it absolutely is not funny at all... it's that it's miserable. It is so mean-spirited that you wonder what was going on in Mindy Kaling's head while creating it.

There isn't a single thing that works. The voice acting is mixed, the animation looks like every other animated show on TV, the plot is nonexistent and just one meta-joke after another, the whole spirit of the show is hypocritical and (again) mean, and worst of all it completely betrays a set of beloved characters that have survived decades of changing culture.

Joseph Barbera and William Hanna aren't so much turning in their graves as suffering a full-on post-mortem heavy duty spin cycle.

Mindy Kaling and HBO should be absolutely embarrassed and ashamed of themselves."
1.0,"Jan 16, 2023","This show was a complete disappointment for me. I don't think that there was a single thing about this new show that relates back to the actual franchise of Scooby Doo. Genuinely not even sure if any of the producer and/or writers did proper research on the property. I can't even find it in myself to credit them for trying something new cause it's been done before and in a much better way. Hard not to feel like their whole motive behind thing was money/greed. The writing is horrendous and the animation was just okay (again, it's been done so much better before). Definitely won't be watching this series again and I wouldn't recommend it to any Scooby fan either."
1.0,"Jan 24, 2023","If you expect to watch an old fashioned Scooby-Doo show this isn't one. It's not a comedy nor a joyful show to watch, this is a poor written show trying to hit the road with modern matters but with a very wrong heroine. Never thought that i would rate 1 star but this show is worst than Ator films...Poorly written, trying so hard to exploit stuff out of content and frankly it just makes it even worst than it is. At least, in tries like this,you expect the script to be a bomb, to be a revelation and hit the mark pointing out what it needs to be pointed out. But here, there is no need at all for such an action because everything is wrong. You do not do that in such a show and furthermore the final blow is committed by the scenario, the script, its awfully dreadful, disgusting, a monstrosity of a show."
1.0,"Jan 16, 2023","The Scooby-Doo franchise has been beloved by audiences for decades. Fans appreciate the classic mystery-solving format, as well as the lovable and quirky characters. The dynamic between the main characters, including Scooby and Shaggy, is also a fan favorite.

This show was terrible. The characters who actually made it to this version of the show were boring and poorly written, the story was uninteresting and it seemed like the creators had no respect for the source material. This show was a complete failure. No true Scooby-Doo fan would be okay with this. Instead of butchering a beloved franchise, the creator should have focused on creating an original show."
10.0,"Feb 1, 2023","I'm not gonna lie, I actually liked it. Personally interested in it. The characters are a little weird but not that hard to swallow.

The fact that I couldn't wait the next day to be finally be able to see the next episode means something to me. I just went into it not expecting too much and it's enjoyable. As long as you don't treat it too seriously. I did laugh at a few jokes as well, and I'm very picky with my comedy.

Also, I gotta give credit on the hallucination parts. They really were scary. But most of all? This show made me interested enough to find out what happened to Velma's mom. I wish they release the new episode soon already."
1.0,"Jan 21, 2023","It's one thing to change characters ethnicities, that's totally fine and usually is in a tasteful way. It's another thing to completely change the characters to the point where the only thing that shows resemblance is their names and clothing. And the fact that scooby isn't a dog is an absolute travesty. This is not a show about scooby and the gang It's just a animated version of previous Mindy projects disguised as the gang. Definitely one of the worst spinoff shows that will ever exist. Hopefully there won't be a season 2. I know there are still episodes to come out but not like they can change characters at this point throught the rest if the season."
2.0,"Sep 28, 2023","The first episode of this show was so all over the place and downright awful that I had to review it here. Some light chuckles throughout the 25-ish minute travesty...but that's about it. It's a show with absolutely no direction or identity...probably a lot like this review. HBO Max has to hire better focus group participants so shows like this never see the light of day. It's one cringeworthy scene after another. If you have a free 25 minutes and like to torture yourself, then this show is for you! When you think the worst is over with, it gets much, much, much, much, worse. I'd read a book instead."
1.0,"Jan 22, 2023","I'm normally a big fan of more mature themed adult animation. This missed every mark they were trying to hit. Something about the show just felt off. First of all there is the never ending confusion while the viewer keeps asking themselves ""Why"" over and over again. Why be so heavy handed, why be so on the nose, why shoehorn every detail that's not a mismatched, snarky remark. Sometimes why can be funny but not in this case. For some reason most of the jokes just made me feel kind of sad. In another scenario and told in a different context some of the jokes could be funny but in this case the jokes only land to the sound of crickets."
1.0,"Jan 19, 2023","I couldn't get far enough into the show to tell if I really liked the characters or the ideas presented there in. (I quit around 80% of the way through episode 1)

My biggest issue was that the show just keeps going a mile a minute without ever allowing a moment of self reflection or giving the audience time to think.

Were the jokes funny? Well they might have been if there had been any comedic timing. But it just moves from one to the next as quickly as possible like an auctioneer trying to sell a bunch of defective... whatever. Too fast for anything to have any real impact.

I went into it not caring if it was true to the original source material, trying to take it for what it was. But it never spent any time building a world of it's own. Instead it felt like some sort of overly melodramatic fever dream."
1.0,"Jan 17, 2023","I watched it because I thought it couldn't possibly be that bad, I was wrong.

If it was a single episode it probably could have got away with it being mediocre, but I cannot remember anything of note happening. It was bad jokes, poking fun at people whilst not being and not particularly great voice acting. The animation was okay.

There's no shock value like south park or family guy to even begin to try and make the jokes funny. It's just bad.

If I had written, produced or directed any of the episodes I would be looking at legal advice to have it destroyed from human history.

It is honestly the worst thing I have ever had the mispleasure to watch."
1.0,"Jan 20, 2023","It's insulting, honestly. They gracelessly threw a bunch of representation in so carelessly that it feels performative. They lean on violence and drug use to convey adult themes (as if everyone I knew wasn't also horny, violent, and trying drugs in like middle school). They're clearly just trying to capitalize on the Velma renaissance that's taken place over the past 5 years, and hoping we will all ignore the lazy writing for nostalgia sake. They rely on 4th wall breaking and crappy millennial humor that even most millennials can't stand. I can't believe GOOD adult cartoons like dead end: paranormal park and inside job were cancelled, when this gets cancelled it'll get lumped in with them when clearly this show is no where near as thoughtful as either of those shows. Adult cartoons don't have to be like this. You can have violence and drugs and gore and dark comedy while still making a thoughtful show that has depth to it. Honestly this is just another brickleberry. Such a shame when there's obviously successful shows to reference: Rick and morty, futurama, helluva boss, etc etc. Really disappointing."
1.0,"Mar 15, 2023","This series destroyed everything that was good, everything that was fun, everything that made me want to watch Scooby-Doo.

It would be much smarter to have created another universe, with new characters, to develop a new story dissociated from the universe of our dear mystery team, maybe that way the series would just be bad.

However, this idiotic idea, to take the classic, the good nostalgic and then deconstruct it, made the series ridiculous.

If you want to create something new? Do something really new! What they did in this series was a complete bad joke.

Jokes are not funny, they force sexuality in a completely lost way and without context. I don't know if it's a poorly developed mystery series, or a bad teen comedy, or simply a machine gun of vents and clichéd critics about whatever the author is angry about.

And a really tiring series to watch. There was an opportunity to make something big, a good, planned story, but instead they just decided, ""Let's test how well we can make a really bad story!""

My rating and that of the 90% of those who stumbled upon this ""modern"" fiasco. Note 0."
8.0,"Jan 17, 2023","I don't even know where to start.

I've always loved Scooby-Doo, so when I saw everyone hating on this I decided that I'd try to watch it. I can confidently say that this show has nothing to do with the franchise whatsoever. Its hard to follow, full of tropes, and just lazy overall.

I'd love to insult the character development but in all honesty there wasn't a character with personality to begin with. Every character is either a blank slate full of opinions or a walking stereotype.

Outside of it being related to the Scoobyverse, this is a complete waste of time. The only part that made me grin was having Glenn Howerton essentially make Fred into Dennis from IASIP.

I can't hate this enough."
1.0,"Jan 31, 2023","Enjoyable show. Not necessarily canon but uses the characters for a new teen drama. Builds on themes that are interesting like vulnerability, friendship, and self acceptance. The show is crass and pokes fun at the genre of teen drama as a whole. There are lots of great voice actors and the dialog is well written. So far (the first 4 episodes) there are several different story lines that overlap.

In the first episode the recasting of the original cast with a more racially diverse one is addressed in a short dialing between Velma and Daphne. This instance and many others acts as a way to break the fourth wall, allowing the creators of the show to directly speak to the audience about why they made these decisions."
1.0,"Jan 17, 2023","Not much too say except don't waste your time watching this show. Is that bad. First of all, Scooby and Shaggy are not part of the show. Nowhere to be found, not even mentioned. Velma is extremely annoying, Fred acts as a jerk and all the characters are superficial and forgettable ñ. The writing is exceptionally bad, just an excuse to portray these bad characters. In my opinion, Velma is sacrilegious to all of us that were raised watching Saturday morning cartoons and have treasured memories of Scooby Doo. Even my daughter, who's 20 years old, hated the show, remarking it was boring and pointless so it is not a generational thing. The show is that bad, period."
1.0,"Jan 28, 2023","This is God awful, took a great up and changed nearly everything about it. This is nothing but a fan fic that should have never been written.

Watched the first episode, and was only disappointed to see a show I grew up with go down the drain. Figured I'd watch the 2nd episode and It was so bad I had to shut it off halfway through.

So much potential using a well known IP wasted. Everyone knows the scooby doo gang, and this is the equivalent to a dollar store generic brand. There are some things that should have never been written, this is one of them. If I wanted to watch a high school drama, I would rather go watch literally anything else."
1.0,"Jan 22, 2023","1. Political - I don't really get the fuss. Sure it makes some changes to the original content, and makes offensive suggestions in cases; however it seems to try to piss off everyone - which I can appreciate.

However especially in today's political climate its a risk...and I'm not sure the jokes are worth the risk...which takes us to 2.

2. It's not funny. It has some funny moments, but in general it's not funny. It's not entertaining. It feels like you're waiting for something to happen because it's shocking how seldom that happens. The writing is bizarre, the pacing and the story lines are incongruent, the characters...my god the characters. It feels like these people hated writing this. It's like you locked people in a dark room with nothing to eat or drink for 3 days and they came up with this. Which brings us to 3.

3. Why Scooby Doo? I get the studio owns the rights and wants to use them to make money. But who in the hell did it give the rights to? There is no reason for this to be affiliated with Scooby Doo. Some of the characters have the same names, and there is some mystery (which is pretty a pretty serious thing no one is taking seriously) that is spattered throughout the show.

TLDR: It's just not funny, it's not Scooby Doo in any meaningful way, and if you're prone to being offended, you'll probably be offended by the show. Also NOT FOR CHILDREN...Scooby Doo.... For shame."
1.0,"Feb 12, 2023","You know how sometimes you have to get past the first episode and then the show gets good? That doesn't happen here. I was so excited when I saw this pop up on my list. Then I watched it. I can't tell if the beginning scenes were written by a horny teenager or an overzealous young feminist trying to smack us in the face with a point. Less is more. I loved the premise but dang, Velma is just angry. It's connection to the original is barely there. A show can be dark and still fun, the new Sabrina series catches it perfectly, but this just falls flat. This had potential to be so cool. It's a bummer that it's anything but."
1.0,"Jan 23, 2023","Worse than bad, I am dumbfounded with how little respect for the source material and the fans the show had. It takes more than names and clothing to make a show based on Mystery Inc. None of the characters had even close to similar personalities, the writers continuously bashed and mocked the fan base and the source material, and Scooby Doo wasn't even included, not even as a puppy which would've been completely within their capability.

I can't even with this, it's honestly depressing how much Mindy Kaling BUTCHERED such an amazing Show. Mystery Inc deserves better, the fans deserves better, Scooby Doo deserves better. Shame on Mindy Kaling for this abomination, burn it alongside her career."
1.0,"Jan 17, 2023","I was looking forward to watch it and show to my kids what I used to watch on my childhood, but it was a disaster. My kids hated and I couldn't even finish the first episode. It is not funny and it is nothing like the old cartoon that I used to watch. In fact, they could change the characters' name and make a difference show. Look like the writers are more concerned to show Velma's sexuality and they forgot to make the show pleasant and funny.

I just don't get the point to get a old cartoon and change everything instead of create a new one. They just want to use the fans of the original show to give some audience."
1.0,"Jan 21, 2023","I was nervous to watch this because the reviews are awful. It's actually really funny and smart. Later episodes have nice scooby doo Easter eggs. At first, I was unsure, but it just gets better and better each episode. It makes me think most of these one star reviews are the subject of review bombing from people who either didn't watch the show at all, or only watched the first episode.

Contrary to what people say, the show doesn't lean left OR right politically. The jokes lean both ways which makes the show far more enjoyable than many others. The show is quite self aware as well, but it isn't a bad thing, it adds to the charm as the show progresses. Hope there will be a season 2!"
9.0,"Jan 24, 2023","Where's my Scooby Doo? Shaggy isn't Shaggy without his best bud Scoob.

I went in to this knowing nothing apart from the OG show ,had not even watched the trailer. I Was not expecting a ""comedy"" I was expecting something more gritty and character building.

It's nice to see the characters as different backgrounds but they are not faithful to the source material.

As an adult show it was not that necessary. Shaggy doesn't act like Shaggy at all, Velma is rude, show is not very funny or engaging. Fred is a narcissist. Velma was also nicer and I loved her character. I'd be quite happy to rewatch the OG from the 80s now.

I'm hoping something good can come of the feedback and maybe the show can fix some of irs current issues."
1.0,"Jan 20, 2023","Curiousity killed the cat they say, and oh man regarding this show it killed alot of feelings in my body. Im a fan of the scooby do material, watched the tv show when i was a kid and saw the live action movies in theatres and loved them. So i was very interested in seeing the backstory of my favourite character, Velma. But i got something totally different, the character is now obnoxious. Im very saddened on her personality shift. There is nothing likable in this narcissistic character.

And the other characters dont fare any better.

I only managed to watch the first episode btw, i didnt have the heart or patience to see the other episodes. Fans of the Scoobygang should avoid this...i honestly dont know who should watch this, it lacks heart, humour and good writing. This is a sad day for televison :("
1.0,"Jan 12, 2023","One fateful day in January, the boys and I decided to join a call in the popular VoIP and instant messaging social platform Discord and hate watch the first episode of Velma (2023). The show was so horrendously bad that we had an argument that spanned the next 2 weeks about what aspect of the show was the worst. Mindy Kaling peaked as Kelly in the office, a program that, according to her, would be considered ""too offensive"" for modern standards. She essentially wrote the show about herself, realized that it was the most uninteresting piece of media ever created, and slapped the scooby-doo trademark on it. This show genuinely feels like characters such as daphne were added just to farm engagement on the series and it still didn't work. The fact that many of the characters are different races from their scooby-doo counterparts feels unnecessary. This is another example of shows like south park that value shock and humor over story, but for a formula like that to work the show needs to actually be funny. The fact that fred (one of the only white characters in the show) is constantly made fun of for being a dick immediately insults every white person watching the show, and with roughly 75% of america being white, it turns off the biggest audience for this type of content. Overall, the show tries to balance humor, being offensive, and virtue signaling... and it just doesn't work."
1.0,"Jan 20, 2023",They made a complete mockery of the original cast and completely change the characters and who they were straight down to their core. Who ever had this idea should never be allowed to make films again. They obviously did have any respect for the show or and kind of cherished memories of the show. They wanted to make a show that used a few popular characters and get rich off of it and didn't even think about who the characters were and didn't realize how much love the community had for the characters. At the end of the day these half wits need to stay out of the film industry and go back to what every college they learned they craft in and spend a few more years there.
1.0,"Jan 20, 2023","Already calling it, this is probably the worst show of the year and it's still January. Watched the first two episodes and not a single good joke to be found. It tries way too hard and is so heavy handed with its jokes, and all you want to do is cringe, Norville is just a walking don't do drugs psa, Fred is the most stereotypical rich kid I've ever seen, Daphne is your typical popular teen who's a huge jerk, Velma is just an awful person and this show is completely insufferable. This is the worst thing I've ever watched and I've seen Llamageddon, 2 sharknado movies, and Sharktopus vs Pterocuda. Do yourself a favor and don't watch this show."
1.0,"Jan 20, 2023","First of all, I'm a massive fan of Harley Quinn and Archer, so I love a good adult animated comedy. Secondly, I really like the diversity changes that they made, so I gave it a couple stars for that. The animation art is also really nice, and you can't beat the killer cast.

That said, this is a terrible show. I fully watched the first 2 episodes (all that have been released at this time) and I found the humor more self-indulgent than self-aware and mostly not funny or too on-the-nose to be very amusing. For instance, we all know Shaggy is a stoner, but the show reminds us of it every single time he's on the screen, and he never actually seems stoned or even chill. He actually seems kind of anxious. Very confusing.

It sounds like it was written by someone my age (47) trying to pretend they're a teenager (which it is). It gives the whole thing a sad vibe. The raunchy jokes are rarely funny and considering these are teenagers, it's just uncomfortable. I know Scooby-doo is all about ""those meddling kids,"" but I wish they'd set this in college instead of high school. I think that would have made the show different enough from the original to give it a fresh spin AND allow for sex/nudity without giving it a gross vibe.

The thing that makes Harley Quinn particularly fun to watch, imo, is that there's a light-hearted positive vibe to the whole thing. Most of the jokes are goofy, paced well, and usually stick the landing. Velma feels very negative at its core and the humor feels forced."
1.0,"Jan 17, 2023","Horrendous writing. 1 Dimensional Characters. Butchered the series. Ridiculous attempts to virtue signal at every turn. This is among the worst dumpster fire shows ever produced. Cancel this embarrassment before permanent damage is done to the franchise.

Literally I couldn't take even 5 minutes into this show before the cringe began, and the pilot itself proved to be so tremendously bad that there's no point in continuing to watch it.

This show is guaranteed to go down in history as the textbook example of how NOT to reboot a franchise. I think this will cause permanent damage to the Scooby Doo brand."
1.0,"Mar 6, 2023","100% Trash,

There are not enough words to describe this awful take on the scooby doo characters. Only 3 out of the 5 are in this abomination.

Shaggy and Scooby are thankfully on holiday while this was being made.

Fred is not Fred in this. He is a rich stereo type that is the butt of almost all the jokes.

Velma is not smart. Nor capable. In fact she is not even close to being the character from the original show.

Daphne is not present either.

This is one of the worst animation shows in TV history. Its poison.

Who was this even made for?

If you wanted Twitter animated then this is for you."
1.0,"Feb 2, 2023","I gotta say, I don't really understand the majority of the comments here. The show takes a modern, sarcastic take on the Scooby Doo world, centered around Velma (voiced by Mindy Kaling). I saw both episodes currently out and was surprised by the amount of times I caught myself chuckling to the absurd scenes and dialogue. Yes, it is taken to the extreme, but very watchable nonetheless, if you're into that sort of comedy. I usually don't watch animated shows, but this one really took me by surprise.

Before watching 5min of the first episode and immediately run to IMDb to give it a bad review, try actually sitting through the whole thing and you might be surprised!"

Hbo max can't tell the difference between your love or hate for a show, just that somebody watched it.

If your'e looking for a title without a single speck of love for the original property, chalked to the brim with underage nudity, an overload of half baked meta-humor, and no pups named scooby doo than this is the show for you.

I'm all for an adult focused scooby-doo adaptation but it is genuinely upsetting for someone who grew up consuming all the scooby media to see the character of the beloved gang soooo butchered by detached millennial writers using velma as an outlet for their lives going nowhere."

1.0,"Feb 18, 2023","I know many people who went into Velma with a closed mind and already decided a 1 star review before watching a minute of an episode. However, after going into the show somewhat optimistic and hopeful I was severely let down. The show is BAD. And unfortunately it's not even good bad. Just plain boring bad. The suffer love and woe is me attitude from Velma is painful to watch. Also the jokes that only once made me even smile got old incredibly fast. Especially the common joke of getting meta with the humor and being self aware. The first two episodes were so bad that I believe it will be indicative of the whole show. However if the show drastically improves I'll consider changing my rating."
1.0,"Jan 16, 2023","I'm not exactly sure what this is. It's not Scooby-Doo, that's for certain. I feel like if you're gonna take a cast of established characters, then completely and totally change those characters in every conceivable way, then put them in a show completely different from all other media they feature in, you should probably make something original with your own characters. This show is like a badly made fanfiction and has no business being associated with the actual Scooby-Doo franchise. From now on I will refuse to even acknowledge this show exists whatsoever. I mean, who even greenlit this mess? I would assume it takes many, many steps, meetings, and ok's from multiple people in charge around there at Warner Bros to get a show funded and produced. This was a failure on many levels, and an insult to even the most casual Scooby-Doo watcher."
1.0,"Jan 31, 2023","Why? What was the need for destroy a show loved by all, ruining wonderful and interesting characters? What was the need to distort and a franchise like Scooby Doo?

Too much resentment. There are plenty of acid comments with a bad attitude that try to be funny but only end up causing rejection.

Why not create a new series with new characters?

If this series had been a new proposal, with new characters, perhaps it could have found its niche, but the fact that they take advantage of the Scooby Doo characters is an offense and a contempt for all the fans.

Worst possible version of a classic by far."
2.0,"Jan 16, 2023","In an era of bad writing Velma takes it to a new level. This is mean spirited, biased, and seriously lacks any understanding of what the original cartoon was about.

There is nothing to like here, once again the lead characters are unlikeable, and there is no attempt at motivations or anything like an attempt at fun.

Perhaps the biggest sin here is that the titular character isn't even present, as the hacks making the show turn it into a sound board for their own prejudices, dislikes, and general inability to entertain. Sorry Scooby Doo should be the focus here, and don't get me started on the complete sham that is the new ""Shaggy"".

Hollywood, can we please get writers with life experience rather than the pampered hacks that you are currently using.

I'm out already after 1 episode."
1.0,"Jan 21, 2023","I have never watched something so vile before and worse its hating on one of my favourite childhood shows. It's scooby doo related in the names of the characters only. I would love a show about how the scooby gang all got together but this show doesn't come close at all.

The supposed jokes just fall flat and just come across as hateful and racist. It's just painful to watch, plain and simple. All the characters hate each other, all have weird origin stories that just don't make sense to the original show.

The only thing I do like is the ethnic diversity of the characters but I hate that their attitudes, mannerisms and everything that made scooby doo such a great show is missing or twisted by hateful writers."
1.0,"Jan 23, 2023","Too many changes, too fast! The fans just got used to Velma being gay, but no Scobby, clean Shaggy, and the ""privileged"" white people is just to much to fast. It's bold at best and offensive and ignorant to the plot at worst. There is no theme. I'm unsure why Mindy got the nod for this as well, she's gotten an increase in fan faviorte from the Office but I've never felt she was as funny, or accepting as others and this shows that. She's brash, and her political views are all over this. This is less of a before story and more of a Mindy venting piece. It's simply not good not worth your time !!!!"
1.0,"Jan 16, 2023","I believe it's new characters that were inspired by the gusto of mystery inc it's basically them from the 70s reincarnated to the 2020s and with that, I also feel like it's mystery inc but for the mature now, since most of the people who watched it when it was on TV are mature now. I truly love this show, I need this TBH, I love shows in this genre, a little mystery ""horror"" with corny humor. Not only that, but I hope they don't listen to the people who are just judging the show without even watching it, and bring it back for another season. I feel like people should at least finish off the season to give an honest review of a complete show."
10.0,"Jan 24, 2023","I have a handful of peaceful childhood memories...like watching Scooby Doo for instance. As an adult, I enjoy dark humor and adult animation so the concept of Velma seemed amazing...reuniting with familiar characters in the modern world in an edgy way. Unfortunately, Velma miraculously missed the mark on all levels. No nostalgia, unlikable characters, cringy unfunny jokes, and a general disregard for the Scooby Doo franchise and fans. It just leaves a sour taste in your mouth that won't go away. Did someone at the network actually watch this before putting it out? Thank goodness I can rewatch Big Mouth and old Scooby shows to ease the pain."
1.0,"Jan 20, 2023","1 star gives this show WAYYYYYY too much credit. One star actually implies there was effort put into a project. Nothing was put into Velma, the art is mediocre, the jokes are not funny, the plot is not even the slightest bit interesting, this might be the worst piece of animation I've ever had to sit through(and it's not even close to over yet). This was a sad attempt at a reboot with zero passions from the team behind it. The creators of the show have either never seen scooby-do, or hate scooby-do. I myself was never a huge fan of the franchise, but it deserves better than this insult to television."
1.0,"Jan 16, 2023","I'm not sure how they manage to screw up so badly, but they did. Somehow they tried so hard but didn't try at all, some sort of paradox of awfulness. Shaggy isn't even shaggy, he's some random guy who looks, sounds and acts nothing like him. Not to mention there is no scooby-doo, like the entire franchise is named after him. Watching grass grow is probably more entertaining and probably more funny. And the fact there is a season 2 coming when there is hundreds of other shows that deserve a second season but this gets one? Heck there lots of shows that I hate that I'd prefer get another season. It's just a terrible show, and of you are a fan of it, please refer to the title of this review."
1.0,"Jan 21, 2023","I am a huge fan of Scooby-Doo: Where are you. I have all the three seasons plus many others like, Cool Scooby-Doo, Scooby-Doo and the 13 ghost ect... I have so many collectibles. Ask me anything about any season or episode and I can tell you with Passion what happened in each episode.

But this... I don't know what the hell this is, I feel as if the writer of this show just spat in my eyes, as if the spirit of Scooby-Doo is just... it's gone! Heck even Scooby-Doo is gone. Why? Why would you do this to me? I LOVE the mystery team, I love the mysteries that needed solving, the strangeness of the art and animation, the groovy music in the background as chases ensued. All of that gone, instead I get a Velma, that's is not even Velma, it's like a skintaker just took her place and now I have this person that all she does is insult people or just attempts to shame them and even it's viewers with ""doble-standing racial remarking jokes"" like what?!?!? When did they start doing that in the Scooby-Doo series? It's all sexual, tensions and barely any mystery at all. I'm going to pretend that this show never existed."
3.0,"Jan 25, 2023","This had such potential to be amazing. An adult scooby doo could have gone so many directions but the fact that they are trying so hard to subvert the traditional narrative they lost their direction along the way. I could have even lived with that but then they go a beat the viewer over the head with their ""edgy"" meta that it was hard to watch.

I have no problem with the changes to the character race, sexual orientation, etc. It's how they present it that irritates me and shows they don't respect their audience. There is not need to call out everything you are doing that's edgy, we are smart we get that. It was not needed and ultimately ruined it for me."
1.0,"Jan 19, 2023","Possibly my first official review on this site. I didn't even mind the shaggy change, I also didn't care that they removed scooby, I was still willing to give it a chance, but the writing is honestly one of the worst I've ever seen.

Show for mature audience with jokes for 6 year old kids. It is extremely hard to find anything positive to say about it.

And why is everyone an idiot in the show? Everyone's iq is lower than room temperature for some reason.

The animation looks OK. Nothing unique and you know it's been done a billion times but it works here.

There's zero reason to continue watching this show."
1.0,"Mar 5, 2023",My goodness this show is good! It's great animation and comedy horror. It tackles the teenage drama in this era. It also address the stereotypes of teenagers. I hope this show comes on for a lot of seasons. I can't wait to see where they go with this show. I hope people understand how great this show is. Velma has color and that is so cool to break up the original style with a 20th century vibe to the setting. I got a feeling this show reach it full viewership and people stop hating on the success of this show it's been getting hate and positive feedback. That's how I know it will be on for a long time.
1.0,"Jan 26, 2023","Shows about horrible characters are generally popular nowadays. We root against these characters, and as we learn more about them and why they are that way, we eventually root for them. That's what they are trying here.

The problem is they are using the Scooby Doo IP and we already know what these characters are about. We already like them, and we are immediately being 180'd to a world where they all are miserable and mean people. It's not a fun show to watch. The jokes are ""high school mean girl"" quality and it never ends.

Maybe at some point they'll grow and become better people, but so assume the show will be cancelled well before that happens. Currently this show is destroying the Scooby Doo brand."
1.0,"Jan 29, 2023","This is bad. Specially for anybody that watched Scooby-Doo. The quality of the animation itself is not great, but if it had a decent script... but it doesn't.

This is where we going. When they ""borrow"" names and pieces of story from great titles just to cover their lack of writing skills. Is like nobody has a good idea these days, and they pick up something good from the past just to start there and then destroy it. Like they just used the names but never paid attention to the story.

Lot of sexual references, not sure what they target of audience is. I'm so mad that they took something that ""pure"" as Scooby-Doo and made this tras, not sure even why, to capture the attention of teenagers?? They though todays teenagers will watch this trash?"

1.0,"Feb 19, 2023","Where to begin. The show just flat out terrible. Every series that invooved Scrappy Doo was better than this could ever be.

It took me nearly an hour and a half to watch the first two episodes because I was constantly zoning put.

The dialog is trash, the ""jokes"" are anything but. The animation style seems inconsistent at times, but I remember some of the older shows getting ""weird"" like that so I can give that a pass.

I got the impression that the writers were trying to poke fun at ""both sides"" of the aisle. The problem though is today's writers don't know how to do that.

For the life of me I can't understand how a show this bad can already have a promised second season, when shows that are thousands of times better get canned after one or two seasons.

This is why I prefer to watch reruns of classic Looney Tunes on HBO Max."
1.0,"Jan 17, 2023","This is the worst show ever. It seem like they were not even trying to make the show entertaining. It seems like a personal crusade to make the worst show possible. In that respect, they succeeded. Whoever was involved in making this show should be black balled from the business because they will not trick me again. I feel like they owe the viewers money for pain and suffering. I see a class action coming. It was abusive to my brain. There is not a single redeeming quality about this show. Not the acting, story, animation, anything. Was not funny in any way. When you get done watching an episode, you are just angry and violated."
3.0,"Jan 18, 2023","So, here is the thing. The much ballyhooed changing of Velma's ethnicity? It works. It works really well.

That, however, is the end of things that work.

From gratuitous sexuality, to murder, characters hating one another, and a serious lack of anything remotely related to the original materials, this show falls flat. Obviously, the creators thought to make an ""edgy"" and ""adult"" cartoon in the franchise. They should've watched Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated and taken some notes. Instead, they took everything that children AND adults love about the Scooby Gang, and pitched them out the window.

Fred is now a ""late bloomer"" with a small XXXXX.

Daphne is now a nasty, drug dealing cheerleader.

Shaggy is attempting to guilt Velma into dating him. He literally talks about selling something and blackmailing Velma into dating him

Velma...the less said there the better.

Scooby-Doo is utterly absent

Even more annoying is the show's openly mocking other edgy reboots (like Riverdale) while then doing the same thing. The writers literally admit that some tropes are just awful, and then they serve them up to the audience...for what purpose I cannot tell.

The voice cast does the best with what they are given - but one must wonder just how badly some of these people needed the paycheck.

If you have ever watched a Scooby-Doo series or movie and enjoyed it, take a hard pass on this hot mess."

The Show is absolutely not a great scooby do show but for what it is I think that it could be WAY worse. Not to mention the animation is pretty good, and the voice work is well done.

There is ZERO respect shown for almost all underserved communities via this poorly thought-out series; it's shameful and damaging. It's almost shocking that this show EVER got the green light. There's shock value - and there's outright senselessness; this show reflects the latter. And as a prior fan of Kaling - I'm definitely questioning that decision now."

Some animations that change characters/personalities and everything and still maintain the quality of the anime and its essence: Fate; pokemon.

I think it's a mistake to make remakes with adult themes based on children's animations. Defending guidelines is everyone's right, but this animation looks more like passing the limits with the whole history of Scooby's animation."

1 and a half episodes is all I could get through.

This is a show with zero redeeming features and even less quality. The only reason to give it 2 stars rather than 1, is because I truly don't believe most of the things that get one star actually deserve it. One star territory is for when the product is utterly nonsensical or the showrunner comes to your house and covers you in bees after watching.

Alas this one earns its second star by at least making narative sense and no bee bath afterwards. Other than that, its a failure in every way that a show can be a failure. Practically every joke falls flat and the few that don't, well they at best give rise to a slight smile behind a head turn of cringe.

I just don't know who this show was made for? It seems to be as popular as a fart in a space suit...and it's just as unwelcome."
1.0,"Jan 30, 2023","So I had low expectations going into this, and I was ready to make fun of this show a lot, but there was nothing to make fun of. It felt hollow. Empty. Like nothing. And as for my low expectations, well they were justified. Nothing about the show is funny, nothing about it is interesting, its pacing is horrid. The fact that I watched a shower scene that had a bunch of high schoolers made me so uncomfortable even as a high schooler, the racism isn't funny at all, the gore wasn't schocking or scary or deeply gross, the source material is missing, I could go on and on with problems like these but I won't because everyone and their mother has already said everything I would say."
1.0,"Jan 19, 2023","I had great expectations on this, hoping to a masterpiece. Unfortunatley this is the worse Scooby Doo related series ever made. It has too much sexual connotations and it destroys the innocence of the 90s where Velma,Daphne,Fred,Shaggy and Scooby Doo & Scrapy Doo shined.

The idea was good,the animation itself is not bad, but i cannot accept what they did with the characters. I am curious how Scooby will be introduced...Placing the action at their school has nothing to do with the original cartoons. The Mystery Machine is missing and its a big deal. I hope that the reviews will help to cancel such series after first season."

A lot of the jokes actually hit. I kinda like the direction of the characters (things don't always have to be exactly like the original...that would be boring)

People who don't know how to laugh won't appreciate this show at all.

We don't always have to analyze, critique and pull apart every show on this planet... just turn off your cynical mind, relax and enjoy. This show is actually funny... if you have a sense of humor."
1.0,"Jan 22, 2023","The teaser trailer is almost the whole shows humor, except for the shock humor. The show is not funny it's just cringy.

The characters are the worst, the only one that is nice is shaggy and even he isn't likable, his character traits are that he is against weed, is the smart one, and is a massive simp for Velma. Not only do shaggy's traits not fit who shaggy is they also make him extremely unlikeable because of how pathetic they made him.

The rest of the gang are just horrible characters without a positive trait and I wouldn't care if any of them died in the show because they are that unlikeable. None of their personalities fit any of the characters.

This show is obviously made by someone that has no respect for the source material and wanted to make their own show. The plot really has nothing to do with the plots of the original show, and is only loosely connected, by names, clothes, and scooby-doo themes that actually don't have anything to do with the actual plot and could honestly be removed from the show without changing the plot of the show at all."

My hope is that the team either fixes their mistakes by removing politics and adding back Scooby or creating a whole series entirely. This feels like an attempt to add more race into the gang, which is executed very poorly. Past Scooby Doo series added black and Hispanic characters into the series without butchering the original goal of the Scooby Doo franchise. Please do better."

I'm not sure what this show is, Is it a comedy? Because it isn't funny but it certainly is horrifying.

Perhaps it's a new genre of horror movie the likes of which we as a species haven't seen yet, perhaps it's genius and it will take future more evolved humans to recognize it as such because we poor fools aren't ready for it yet....or perhaps it's just garbage that costs the viewer precious brain cells.

8.0,"Feb 13, 2023","It's actually kind of insane. Much like they did with HBO's Harley Quinn, Warner Bros. Took a beloved franchise and made a mockery of it, showing nothing but contempt for the source material. The humour is nothing but desperate attempts to be edgy, complete with over-the-top gore, crude ""jokes"" that almost seem as if they were aimed at preteens rather than adults, none of the characters remotely resemble their original selves, and the animation itself is quite uninspired. I don't know what HBO's obsession is with taking beloved kids' show characters and making them ""edgy"", but it's got to stop."
1.0,"Jan 25, 2023","The nicest thing I can say about this show is I liked the color palette, and some of the retro-animation. But this show failed for me in it's dialog, plot and characters, which were all indefensibly poorly conceived.

This show comes across as a high budget version of tumblr fan-fiction, and not good fan fiction, but terrible, ""edgy"" fan fiction written by a hormonal tween. The humor is mean spirited, offensive and crass. It's uncomfortable to watch, it's like someone who is trying so hard to be funny or to make a point - they have the opposite effect.

Often when I see a show that doesn't appeal to me I think, oh, I'm just not the demographic this show is intended for and I move on with my day without comment. As an animation fan, who wants more adult animation in the world, I wanted to like this.... and I wanted to be able to say nice things about it, but I can't."
1.0,"Feb 7, 2023","Leaves the impression of being written by someone who had never sat through an episode of the original. Like they picked up an envelope with names of characters and a checkbox of inclusion metrics to be met, then shoehorned it into some crappy old script they'd written in fit of teenage angst.

What's with this trend of taking over an old franchise just to ""fix"" or assassinate the characters? The characters have literally no similarity to those from the classic show.

While the blatant mistreatment of Fred is nauseating, it's Velma who got the worst treatment. She went from being the icon of the smart, unapologetically quirky, oblivious to what other's think yet content to share the spotlight to nauseatingly annoying. I guess the writing is on the wall when you make an origin story of the Mystery Gang and title it after just one of them, and not the animal mascot. ""Look everyone! See! Velma. She's the real deal! A strong female lead!"""
1.0,"Jan 18, 2023","This was atrocious. I watched the entire first episode and did not laugh once. Not even a chuckle. The jokes were so juvenile, so heavy handed and the premise so far removed from the original IP, it was embarrasing.

I heard how bad this was so had to see for myself.

I was expecting to be laughing at how atrocious it was but it's not even bad enough to laugh at, like some terrible shows and movies. This was just so bad it was hard to believe what I was watching. My mouth was open in astonishment at how revolting it was.

I was checking my watch throughout the episode. They made 27 minutes feel like an hour. Will she ever find her mom? I do not know, nor do I care. Why is this series about sex and what does any of the random sexual situations have to do with Scooby Doo? I also don't know, nor care. Speaking of which, where is Scooby and Shaggy? Shouldn't they be a part of this too? If the one kid is supposed to be Shaggy, I only assume because of his clothes, then I would like nothing to do with this alternate universe version of Scooby Doo. Personally, I feel like HBO and Mindy Kaling owe everyone and apology for this abomination of a series."
1.0,"Jan 20, 2023","I think all the hate is because the perspective and the affection of the original show. I guess people wanted to see the origin of the gang Mystery Inc. But instead you have a black comedy that has little to do with the show.

The characters don't look that much alike physically, much less their personality, so if you watch this show as a parody of Scooby Doo, you'll enjoy it.

The story is totally different of the original Scooby Doo and it's not bad at all, I think it's funny, like watching ""drawn together"", or similar shows where characters are involved in absurd situations, and everyone acts stupid."
1.0,"Mar 18, 2023","I love the thought of bringing color into this tv show, I am not happy that they have to bring racism into it. It's unbelievably sexual to the point where it's not even funny, or hot. It's completely disgusting. The jokes were so off and not at all hilarious, I only saw the first two episodes and the last because it was such a let down. This show actually had me in tears because of how terrible it was, I love scooby doo and the Gang, but how could anyone let this abomination air? I just can't believe The creators thought this was meta or even good enough to show on live tv. Shame on anyone involved with this tv show."
2.0,"Jan 17, 2023","I have never seen such a horrible series, the jokes are recycled and made to the end, all the time jokes about white men, I have NEVER seen such a writing disaster. How can anyone make Fred, a good, loyal, kind man, turn into a crook, a spoiled rotten guy??!?!?!?!?

Velma is also a disaster because there is nothing coherent, I don't understand! THE FOREGROUND IS TWO INSECTS HAVING S#X ! It is unacceptable ! You've turned Scooby Doo, an ESSENTIAL part of WORLD pop culture, into an avalanche of unfunny, pointless jokes! And not to mention VELMA, who is a narcissist obsessed with her ego, who LOVES TO HUMILLY her friends, and who is JUST UNBEARABLE! The creator wanted Velma to be boring? Because she is in this series. How did this come out on HBO?

Another season 2 coming out... I don't know how I'm going to bear the fact that this series was released on HBO.

How the hell did I spend 4 HOURS of my life looking at this abomination that is VELMA."
1.0,"Jan 19, 2023","Horrible. Just leaving this so the idiots that are so woke and overcome with cognitive dissonance and desperation for this kind of garbage to succeed with have one less positive review and can't claim we are all right wing blah blah blahs that review bombed... it's plain terrible. That's all there is to it. Plain and simple. That's the long and short of it.

Don't even waste your time on this awful garbage. It's not even funny woke, which is still a cancer... it's just...bad. Learn a lesson. People say they want woke but really.... they don't. IT doesn't work....it's kinda like how certain people say they want one thing but really we see they respond to something else. Stop this nonsense, no one likes it."
1.0,"Jan 12, 2023","In its attempt to rekindle the flame of Scooby Doo's fame, we end up getting a raunchy Harley Quinn Show that doesn't hit the notes. I understand the angle they wanted to come from, but taking away the true characters of Scooby Doo and trying to relate to the younger generation is a a failure in this case. They took away Shaggy's charm as a lovable pothead, Velma is an egotistical main character, Fred is a ""social media hypnotized"" character, and Daphne is your typical Mean Girls antagonist. The animation takes on the popular style that Netflix is using for Big Mouth, Brickleberry, Paradise Police etc. A simple show from Velma's perspective with all the original characters would've been so fun. We could've used a Shaggy and Scooby Doo Adventures Show before this."
10.0,"Jan 21, 2023","My general rule with TV shows is to never base something off it's 1st episode; however, this will be an exception. Everything about this show felt unnecessary. The dialog at times makes you want to fast-forward through everything, the easier thing is to just watch something else. When watching the first episode, I couldn't help but think of Harley Quinn & Rick and Morty; in the sense that Velma went with a similar style of comedy. However, this show is basically everyone's worse fears about the aforementioned shows. Unfortunately for Velma, the comedy is all forced, feeling either unoriginal, needing revisions, or yet again just plain unnecessary. I think I chuckled at 3-4 lines throughout the entirety of 20+ minutes of content. This was dead on arrival."
1.0,"Jan 20, 2023","This show has ideas. It has ideas for jokes, ideas for plots, and a lot - and I mean a LOT - of ideas for characters. Unfortunately, the creators didn't have enough ideas to make their own show, so they decided to create a... reboot? Spin-off? Massacre? Of a familiar classic. No, this show is not bad because the characters are different races, and it's not bad because the character is a proud female heroine. The show is bad because it's an overly cynical, lamp-shading mess, that constantly makes fourth wall breaking comments and turns all the characters into obnoxious parodies of themselves. There are good adult shows that do this. This is not one of them. If you enjoy predictable jokes, lazy writing, and dialogue like ""Zamn, dilf city!"" and ""Bump this noise,"" then you'll enjoy this show. If you enjoy Scooby-Doo, then I'd recommend waiting for the next Scooby show."
1.0,"Jan 13, 2023","This was terrible and offensive. I was really hoping that this would be fun and enjoyable, and boy was I wrong. Don't waste your time watching it. The writing was poor. It wasn't funny or entertaining. The characters weren't anything like ALL of the other shows. All I could hear in the Velma character was an extension of the terrible Mindy show. I want expecting this to be so sexualized either, this is definitely not a kids show (or at least shouldn't be). This review will most likely be a better use if your time than watching this show. Don't bother watching this, there are so many other good shows available."
1.0,"Jan 17, 2023","Full disclosure I was 100% willing to defend this due to some absolutely disgusting stuff that was said about it online before we got our first look, then the trailers came out and my hopes dropped, then the show came out and the hate train is 100% deserve, it's absolutely cringe, the editing is terrible, pacing is awful, this show is also just flat out racist and sexist as well. And the show insults not just the audience, but also the animators on this show, who btw are the only ones that want this show to be good because there is a lot of effort on the animation and it shows. Mindy Kaling dropped the ball on this, and I don't think she deserves to helm any ips from this day forward, Velma in the show is the most unlikeable character in all of fiction."
1.0,"Jan 17, 2023","It is amazing to think of all the talented people who worked on this show, and for so long, and somehow during that whole time not a single one of them said ""Hey, this is terrible and we should probably stop.""

Nothing works. The jokes aren't funny, the story isn't interesting, the characters are bizarrely unsympathetic. It's mean-spirited, snarky, and outright racist in parts. Why didn't anybody stop this?

I want to say this would have worked better as its own IP, which Mindy Kaling cleary wanted it to be. It probably wouldn't have, but at least then it wouldn't have made Scooby Doo suck.

Why?"
1.0,"Jan 16, 2023","There are better stuff to watch, but this show isn't worth the hype. Velma Dinkley doesn't even sound like Velma Dinkley imo she sounds way more Daphne than Velma.

Seriously speaking the show itself just fails, like they had idea but I personally think the idea that HBO had just fell off and thus creating this to be extremely bad. Not just that it just fails in every way to try and be funny, there's nothing really funny about this show. Shaggy doesn't sound like Shaggy anymore as well as Daphne doesn't sound like Daphne.

In short if you want to watch something better I think you're better off with the original Scooby Doo."
1.0,"Jan 18, 2023","I went in with an open mind. I was hoping for something similar to mystery incorporated. I was met with millennial humor, cringey dialogue, self inserts, and horrible writing.

I feel sorry for the other voice actors, the artists, and everyone else who worked on this project. Mindy really ruined what could have been a very interesting show.

It's worth a hate watch, it's absurd, yet it's not it's so bad it's good. It's just bad. A bastardisation of an iconic classic that is Scooby-Doo. I wonder what the next creators will do to save the IP because I'm sure this will not be the last of the Mystery Hunting Crew and their great Dane.

Let's let this series die with 1 season."
1.0,"Jan 22, 2023","What can be said at this point other than what's already been said? Yeah, it is bad. Don't watch it. This show spams ""modern comedy"" so hard that any film or show in the next 5 years will remind people of this show. That is not a good thing.

One big issue is that it can't choose a tone. It jumps around in tone constantly. The jokes are delivered in the exact same way as the dialogue related to the plot so the viewers aren't sure if something is to be taken seriously or not. The entire cast speaks in the same cadence so it sounds like one person speaking out of every characters' mouths. Because of this, the show gets stale within a few minutes."
1.0,"Jan 16, 2023","I like the idea of a modern, adult take on a classic kids show. I liked the idea of introducing diversity in the cast. The problem is that the show just isn't very good. The dialogue is poorly written, and it seems like they believe that random and funny are the same thing. There are no set ups for the jokes, they just do a random unexpected act and assume that we're all gonna laugh. It's so over-the-top with meta-commentary that it gets completely lost. And it does seem like the criticisms that the writers despised the source material is probably pretty accurate. The live action version seemed like it understood how to do winking jokes much better and this show just seems like it was written by Hollywood TV writers for Hollywood TV writers."
10.0,"Jan 21, 2023","I feel like this show only used the Scooby Doo branding to try to get viewers. Had it used their own characters instead I think it may have done better. Using the Scooby brand many will have certain expectations that we've had for over 50 years. I miss the classic who did it and while I'm fine with it being serious crimes and more adult I don't want to have one criminal for the entire series, I am still holding on to hope that maybe this case will be solved and there will be another during the season but I know those odds are extremely slim. Maybe someday there will be a real adult Scooby Doo cartoon or if there already is can someone point me in that direction."
1.0,"Jan 21, 2023","First of all, this is about Velma, and from her POV.... So if you don't get it, then ya shouldn't watch it.

It's a great satire, and guess most Gen z people wouldn't understand. It's funny, relatable, and just good entertainment. AND just about everything in it, we all have thought about at some point in our lives. The people who voice the characters are on point and Mindy is the perfect Velma, Sykes is a bonus, she's funny as hell.

It goes to the extent of how ridiculous our society is now and how it looks like it's going. The style of the show is also a great add to the show as well. I hope they keep the show going."
1.0,"Jan 27, 2023","Came into this show trying to be unbiased from media backlash. After watching I find the backlash to be well warranted. Extremely few actual jokes with everything else consisting of explanations on ""this thing bad"" or ""you are a pathetic loser"". It just seems like the writing was based off a twitter comment section but if the comment section wasn't funny. The actually story itself keeps branching off in a load of multiple paths. There is nothing of substance here and the jokes struggle to land every time. I barely had a nose exhale through every episode so far it's like watching white noise on a screen. Yes I'm coming at this a bit harsh but this show was one of the hardest things I've ever watched even after trying to give it a fair chance."
1.0,"Jan 17, 2023","It's way worse than you can imagine. It's not even remotely fun to try to ""hate-watch."" They got rid of critical characters and attacked and jabbed at every type of audience for the show. They got rid of shaggy and Scooby and replaced it with an anti-drug ""Norville,"" who says he hates drugs and also says, ""let's assume they're all high."" to a bunch of high schoolers. Trying to convert characters just ruins the show and mocks the original show fans. If I could give it zero stars, I would be more than happy to. This dumpster fire really shows why it's tied as the lowest rated show on IMDB. And I hope it somehow gets lower than that and set the record as lowest rated show on here."
1.0,"Jan 21, 2023","This is one of the most trash shows that has ever came about in recent years. No it's not due to race no one would mind a adult take on scooby do but that's the thing no scooby. It would have been way better to change it to a completely different ""gang"" if you don't have Scooby. Also we all know some 50-60 year old writer that ""knows what's hip"" having Velma twerk awkwardly is bottom tear comedy. This will be nothing but a small stain to the Scooby doo show's history and will definitely be a failure. Terrible writing, dumb plots, and all around just seems so lazy. Hell you could have made Scooby a cat but that's why it works it has a character for the comic relief."
2.0,"Jan 16, 2023","Apart from some really nice looking animation, this is a complete dumpster fire. Perhaps some of the worst writing I've seen in a major animation show in a while. I'm actually really shocked WB allowed these writers to butcher such an iconic IP of theirs. There is a fine line between having fun with the original while poking fun, and committing complete character assassination. I think the 21 jump street remake is a good example of how to do that. You need to respect what made the original what it was, but also laugh about the plot holes, goofiness, etc. Velma is simply just hateful. There is no love for scooby-doo in this show."
1.0,"Jan 17, 2023","Wednesday succeeds because she is true to the character and the overall Addams Family. While tou see her being a teenager with angst and fighting with her parents, true to the Ricci or TVor animated versions of Wednesday, she is very loyal to her family. Even coming through when they are threatened or bullied. Velma fails by only using some Scooby-Doo Doo names and ignoring the endearing character traits that people love. The Scooby-Doo gang dont seem to like each other or to be remotely likable individually. Why woyld they band together to solve mysteries? What a waste of time and money, not to mention opportunity. I'll skip this one and just watch Wednesday again."
1.0,"Jan 16, 2023","I'm not the biggest Scooby-Doo fan but I love Mindy Kaling. I don't want to take a guess at why or how this show was made as some reviewers seem to think they know.

Seems like it's trying to hop onto the adult cartoon bandwagon with the likes of South Park, Family Guy, Big Mouth, Archer, and F is for Family but it's not working.

Scoob has been a kids show but I think that most kids grow out of it at some point. I certainly don't know any adults who genuinely yearn for a Scooby reboot, or a Scooby ""for them."" And frankly, the humour isn't clever enough for adults to latch onto. I love a cheap laugh as much as the next guy, but even the aforementioned shows appear on the surface to be cheap, they are clever if you pay attention. There's nothing clever about Velma.

Given the content, this show is definitely not for children. It doesn't rekindle nostalgia for adults. So, I guess I just don't know who this is for."
1.0,"Jan 29, 2023","I honestly couldn't believe the very low reviews so I decided to give it a shot after watching an episode of ""The Last of US"" and YES, it's the spin on Velma but this is complete garbage. I would rather watch the 80's version every day of the week. Who actually asked for this and who actually financed this? I would just like to know who actually signed off on this at HBO because I feel like there are much better Animation shows that really don't get a chance because of the big name voices behind the characters but it's whatever, watch at your own risk because a few episodes was enough to completely turn me away."
10.0,"Jan 17, 2023","I was curious about the hate for this show. I heard about the 1 star and the 10 star reviews. I thought 'I'll go in with an open mind'. Well turns out if you open your mind too much your brain can fall out.

Afterwards I needed to take some pain medication and contemplate my life decisions.

Jokes are unfunny and often cringy. It was hard to watch. It was even harder to show any emotion relating to laughter.

This is suppose to be an origin story for Velma and some of the other gang during their early years. I don't see how these self centred borderline psychopathic kids turn out to be the cheery mystery solvers and not perverted, murdering adults."
1.0,"Jan 16, 2023","Velma is a dark, edgy and convoluted reimagining of the beloved Scooby-Doo franchise. The characters are unrecognizable, with Daphne as crass, Fred as a douchebag, and Shaggy as a bore. Velma, played by Mindy Kaling, comes across as a self-insert fanfic character who is the coolest, smartest, and funniest person in the room. The show is full of heavy-handed and juvenile humor, and the sexual situations are random and out of place. The hate and contempt for the source material is palpable, and the show fails to deliver any laughs. HBO and Mindy Kaling owe everyone an apology for this abomination of a series."
1.0,"Jan 22, 2023","Okay, so like I said in my headline, let's all be honest here. It's wasn't the race swapping, it wasn't the more raunchy humor (if done right, raunchy humor is great!) it's not even the fact that Scooby-Doo! Isn't in it. It's the fact they went and made all the characters so unlikeable, and make them talk to the audience like we're all morons who don't understand jokes!

We all hate it because it feels like characters assassination. It feels like the creators hate everything Scooby-Doo. There is no love here, if they actually cared about these timelines characters, they wouldn't portray them as such awful people. No respect, no love and if you have anything of that for these characters, don't waste your time.

Go watch mystery incorporated instead!

Or Inside Job. A raunchy, mystery show that genuinely loves its characters.

Thank you for coming to my TedTalk."
1.0,"Jan 16, 2023","The show likes to call out people who look good but are apparently horrible, even though that describes the show pretty well. The animation actually top notch but the writing is desperate to insult everyone who is or might be watching. The show and characters are so mean spirited that it forgets that your actually supposed to have any justification or wit when doing it and you still have to make your characters likable to some extent. I feel like I'm forgetting something, oh yeah this show is based an a long lasting cartoon called Scooby Doo; but honestly you could change the characters names and no one would be able to tell. I guarantee that if this wasn't a Scooby Doo show then people wouldn't get angry or care that much, they'd just say ""this sucks"" and go watch Rick and Morty."
2.0,"Jan 21, 2023","If you're looking for a Scooby-Doo spin-off there don't watch this!! I am all for the racially diverse cast, but the problem is these characters are nothing like any Scooby-Doo character ever. They just look like them & act like completely different people. Velma played my Mindy Kaling is not Velma is Mindy playing herself in every comedy she's ever tried to act in. The other characters make me sick to my stomach & are offensive to be called Scooby-Doo characters! Please avoid this & honestly it is one of the worst spin-offs or even shows I have ever watched. Hopefully this show doesn't last too long!"
1.0,"Jan 16, 2023","I couldn't believe the reviews about how bad this show was until I watched it.

Who cares about changing the race of a character? This show can't stop talking about race. It's absurd and barely watchable.

Also, it's not funny. I had my teenage son watch an episode and he couldn't believe how unfunny the jokes were.

I don't suppose this is the worst show I've ever seen but it's certainly the worst show I've ever seen with so many people that I consider funny being involved in it.

If you took the least funny person you could find and told them to write the funniest show in the world, this is what they would come up with."
2.0,"Jan 21, 2023","The show only borrows characters' names from scooby-doo. Had been waiting for it ever since it was first announced. Had I known they would make this...I would have never waited for it. Only watched this show since it was a scooby-doo spin-off. Being aimed at adult audiences doesn't mean that it necessarily had to had violence, nudity and hypersexualizing everything. If you are a SCOOBY DOO fan don't watch it to ruin your beautiful childhood memories. If they continue to make such content they will never be able to reach the standard of anime in even next 100 years. Instead of taking a modern take please try to appease those who have been with this franchise since the beginning."
1.0,"Jan 16, 2023","This reminds me of Bird Girl, which I loved because it was like the Venture Brothers, which of course is a spoof on the Johnny Quest type shows. I like the aesthetic of the animation and the quirky writing. Vocal cast is great too.

Is this Scooby Do? No...but it isn't called Scooby Do it's called Velma. A reimagined modern take on a classic character. I think even if this was Scooby Do people would be griping.

I feel like the hate is coming from the demographic who always yells that shows need to come up with their own ideas (which this show does) but then when that something different happens all they really wanted was a rehashing of the original.

If you don't like Mindy Kaling then yea you won't like this. I don't think it would matter if it were more true to the source material or not.

So if you're someone who's tired of the reboots of original stuff and want a slanted spin on a classic I think you will like this show. And as always just remember there's more important things to get upset about in the world than a cartoon. :)"
2.0,"Jan 20, 2023","First off i would like to say the artists drawing the cartoon are pretty good. Thats really the only good thing i can say about this show. The atrocious attempt at comedy falls like a titanium sabot from orbit destroying any thoughts of laughing. Mainly seems to be used not as comedy but to put down the others in the show. It features lots of animated nudity, now keep in mind velma is 15, and daphne is 16. That means its an adult show about kids. Fred seems to be a mentally challenged rich guy with a small penis, shaggy seems to be an incel, velma is the typical know it all that is mean and condescending, daphne is a mean and sells drugs.

To sum it up, Velma is the mirror universe of scooby doo. Watching this show is as fun as shutting the car door on your hand."
10.0,"Feb 12, 2023","This is easily one of the worst shows I've ever watched. I can't believe ANYONE thought that this was a great idea. A more adult spin on Scooby-Doo could have been interesting, but this is just trash. The jokes are unfunny, the characters are insufferable, the storyline is boring and every little thing gets spelled out for you, there's no room for interpretation. It didn't have to be anything deep, but for an adult show, it sure treats it's audience like little children. I'll only give credit to the animators, because the hallucination scenes especially look pretty good. But that's it. I love animated shows, so this hurts my heart to see. At this point, I actually hope this was all just one giant joke of the creators."
1.0,"Mar 4, 2023","I tried, God knows I tried to watch the first and second episode but it was truly the worse! I used to dislike Mindy's acting but now I officially detest her acting. Velma is just Monday, she has transformed this amazing character into one of her! All of her shows are just her. She is messing it up for the audience, I wish she could stop being so self centered- perhaps that would have helped this Velma. Just plain bad!!! Please stop messing a classic show! I an a true Scooby fan and this show is not worth one bit. I thought the second episode would be better but it just kept getting worse. Truly torture."
1.0,"Feb 5, 2023","This could easily be in the top 5 worst TV shows I have seen in my entire life - and I used to work at a Blockbuster. It's such a bad take on the Mystery Gang that I am shocked and appalled it somehow made it past how ever many hands to get approved and animated. I shudder to think of the tone deaf methods of Mindy Kaling having such a huge part in the show. This isn't even the first time that she couldn't help but infect a perfectly good premise with too much of her own thoughts and views. The show is far from funny, painfully forced at every turn, and overall comes off like your drunk friend acting ""cool"" at a crappy frat party. Like holy hell, this show is like Twitter wrote a show that got filtered though Tik Tok."
1.0,"Jan 21, 2023","I apologize, but do the writers know how to tell a good story? It's like someone is trying to cry out their issues by insulting white men or beautiful girls, or simply white girls.

Everything about the show feels forced. To be honest I like how each character now has different race, it feels fresh.

Velma doesn't even sound that smart, the writers needed to make some character mention it once in a while to try and make a point.

The only thing now, which MIGHT save the show, is if Velma realizes how insulting her attitude is and change. I suspect that that will be the case in the end, so they can form the gang.

Currently, the only likable character is Norville(""Shaggy"" Rogers). He seems cool and down to earth.

The story has potential, but REALLY tune it down on the insults, it doesn't suit Velma(or any character who you might want the audience to like)."
1.0,"Jan 21, 2023","This show is hilarious! It is laced with dark humor and the visuals are enthralling. The scenes where Velma hallucinates are so enjoyable to watch, and completely captivating.

Now, there are a lot of negative reviews saying that the show completely ruins the Scooby gang, and many people are upset that Scooby himself isn't in it - personally the changes don't bother me, and I'm a diehard Scooby fan. People fail to realize that this is satire, an adult version of Scooby-Doo. This is made for those that adored and grew up with the original shows and movies but are now old enough to enjoy raunchier humour.

To be completely honest, I'm just happy that they are finally focusing on the characters that rarely got any love when I was younger - Daphne and Fred. And their personalities are so over the top in this one that they don't disappear into the background.

Overall, I'll definitely be watching the rest of Season 1, and can't wait for a Season 2!"
1.0,"Jan 26, 2023","It's a pretty great concept! It'd be a lovely show if it wasn't just taking what would be great original characters and making them have recognizable faces. Not only that, but they took out one of the main characters-- Scooby Doo. He was pretty much the main point of the original series, and without him, it just feels like a different show. It would have absolutely been better off using original characters instead of ones that have been around a while.

Another thing that really gets me is how they handle panic attacks. Mental health is already stereotyped and mishandled in media, and this is just another slap in the face-- Literally.

Note: Do not shake, slap, yell at, or kiss people when they're having a panic attack."
1.0,"May 4, 2023","This show is so bad, a terrible skin suit of ""Scooby Doo"" show. Ruins the legacy, the worst version we will only remember by how bad this show is.

Make them all insufferable and so unlikable your rooting for the killer. Why would you sexualize a children's cartoon character?! Make Fred a pathetic moron? Shaggy isn't shaggy without Scooby. Daphne isn't a rude or nasty person. This show is a hollow shell in disguise of a self serving fanfiction where the title character is based on herself rather than the character she's always been. What a waste of time, money, and opportunity to make a likeable more mature show. The only way WB/Discovery can salvage this is to cut ties with Mindy, and erase the show like it never happened. Then make a new show perhaps asking fans what direction the show should go, a mature show can work. But not by crapping on the source material and alienating Scooby fans of multiple generations."
1.0,"Feb 20, 2023","I don't get why they would ruin the Hanna-Barbera era Scooby Doo characters. As a 90s kid that loved Scooby Doo on Cartoon Network this show was just super sad. These Hollywood exacts can't come up with a new idea so they just remix old ones.

Scooby Doo was not a dog Fred just sucked No shaggy technically

I don't get how anybody would love this show. I'm down for representation but this was not what the world needed. I felt like Mindy character was really self hating. I couldn't watch more than three episodes. They just kept getting sadder and sadder as I kept watching. This just shows how bad things are at discovery."

Kaling has distorted this series into a Kelly Kapur jumbalaya without the wit of The Office. There is literally nothing redeeming about any of the characters and Velma has been transformed into a hateful, mean spirited wretch. There is literally nothing compelling about her character's development. In addition, the show take's relentless potshots at all of the white men in the show. It is a reduction of hate-filled vitriol whose constant self referential attempts at humor constantly batters you to the point that there is no suspension of disbelief and therefore nothing entertaining. There is virtually nothing of the Scooby Doo series left here. Spare yourself and don't waste your time on Velma."
10.0,"Jan 16, 2023","I find myself as one of the many college students nowadays who grew up on a golden age of Scooby-Doo content. While there may not have been as much awareness of the bounty that was the 2000's decade at that time amongst fans of these properties, seeing how the Mystery Inc Gang has been continually butchered and mishandled throughout the late 2010's and early 2020's has been like watching something I loved be mistreated repeatedly with no end in sight.

There have been small victories in the relatively recent past, I think ""Mystery Incorporated"" did some things right when trying to translate some of the cartoons known from the ""What's New Scooby Doo?"" era into a more mature light. Just like all of the other more recent installments, however, it fell short in my eyes in one key way. That would be the character arcs, most of which still felt like hollow and simplified caricatures of beloved characters that have stood the test of time due to their flexible personalities and interesting overlaps when it comes to relatability:

Shaggy's ""hippie stoner"" vibe has held very true despite its original relevance and popularity perhaps being less obviously present in modern social circles; we no longer have a pressing movement the size of the anti-war and free love protests of the 60s and 70s to exemplify this demographic.

Velma's quaint nerdiness that can sometimes leak into forcefulness and leadership is certainly more nuanced, and the role of her fluctuating sexualization helps with the complex perception she has maintained. I know both of these first two characters represent significant figureheads amongst many neuro-divergent or LGBTQ people, as their quirkiness and individualized eccentricities are easy to draw to.

Fred and Daphne were always a show of the times for me. In the original---that being the classic ""Scooby-Doo, Where are You?""---there are clear tensions of the patriarchal standards a relationship was often televised as: Daphne would almost always curtail to any request or demand, and her role was often limited to a damsel in distress for Fred's ""white knight"" character to come save. Sometimes he would even cut her off or mock her in moments of genuinely uncomfortable disrespect. Fast-forward to the aforementioned ""What's New Scooby-Doo?"" and there is a notable shift to fleshing out Daphne as an individual (I alwahs think of the lock-picking talent she shows repeatedly thoughout the show) and allowing Fred to be a more quirky version of the stereotypical jock---though it is worth noting he was actually MORE likeable in this role, as his goofiness and slight airheadedness were both vulnerabilities that showed him as a fallable but gentle soul. This point is as good as any to now bring the train back around to 2023's ""Velma.""

Fred is now a genuinely despicable human being. His motivations are snobbish and removed from any sense of self-awareness, and while the latter was shown to be potentially funny or endearing, that was only in the explicit context where the harm that would come from his mild idiocy would fall on himself. He would not be consistently verbally or physically harming others due to his self-centrism. After just the first episode, the figure presented as the leader of the iconic teenage team is already arguably irredeemable. I heard this trainwreck got approved for a second season somehow...long sigh and face palm...I guess maybe write into that season that he cures cancer. That might be a start.

Onto Daphne...oh boy. Where empowerment was clearly an actual direction taken and committed to with the 2000s and even the 2010s additions to the Scooby catalog, we have now taken a skull-shattering half-backflip in the direction of shamelessly sexualizing and objectifying a high-school diva which they can do to lengths that would be literally illegal if filmed live-action with minors. Now this sometimes works as humor in shows such as ""Family Guy,"" where there is a clear raunchy edge that works due to the clear absurdity of the plots that take all sense of reality out of a situation, yet it still is often uncomfortable and the joke is meant as just that: IT'S UNCOMFORTABLE. Instead this show will literally be mocking its audience for ""liking"" the naked children shown in its first episode, and even if there was the self-awareness present to find the humorous tone of ""Family Guy,"" those two projects have vastly different audiences in a lot of respects. That shock value and gross-out humor was never what people watched ""Scooby-Doo"" for. And yes, the popular girl and sexualization motifs are all there are for Daphne in this show. You'll find all the complexity of unused printer paper. Perhaps less depth. But at least she's got two moms and is racially recast as Asian. So this mess of a portrayal can also offend/embarass those two minorities who honestly don't gain any representation or respect from this.

Shaggy hurts in this show for a lot of reasons. I always attached most with him growing up, being a goofy gangly nero-divergent geek with a bottomless stomach. After some thought on the decision to portray Shaggy...sorry ""Norville""...as Black, I think there was potential there to do something interesting. Even the ""simp"" tendencies that the show decides to throw on him make some sense, especially considering how he acted in ""Mystery Incorporated"" and how well that show was generally received. The biggest issues here are in the execution of these two bold interpretations, where neither feel like developed or relevant pieces of his character. I feel like the switch in racial identity is difficult to justify in a mature take on Scooby, one where Shaggy's extracurricular proclivities and possible vices would seem to benefit from being put center-stage. This doesn't seem to be the sort of narrative you would want to throw on a character of any minority, since making a non-white character the non-sober loses of a group has some yucky optics in my opinion. But, if done well, that could include some interesting commentary. This writing team did not have the wherewithal to be trusted with something of this complexity, however, and so instead the running gag becomes sort of skirting around the issue of Shaggy and marijuana. Why? This choice baffles me in a similar way to when they brought Evan Peters in as Quicksilver for a gag in ""WandaVision,"" and has a similar effect: really enraging the fan base supposedly being satisfied by such ""fan service."" Real ""fan service"" doesn't have to enrage their base. Look at 2022's ""The Batman."" Plenty of Easter Eggs and callbacks without imposing on or belittling the fans. I definitely find Shaggy the least offensive in this show, but possibly the most painful because of just how much potential I see in his characterization.

Okay, the meat of this P. O. S. Sandwich. Velma Dinkley herself. Oh gracious. It is hard to overstate just how unlikable of a protagonist she is. The earlier connection to ""Family Guy"" feels prescient once more, since, similarly to Peter Griffin, Velma seems completely unable to go a single minute without marginilizing, trivializing, or generalizing an often random-feeling subset of people in a back-handed attempt at a one-liner. If I had the technical skills, I would genuinely want to go back through and stitch together all of the attempted jokes made by this character with an inserted laugh track, just to highlight how it is seriously funnier to point out and mock how un-funny these jokes are then to hear them unedited. The arrogance and self-aggrandizing is on par with Fred and Daphne, both of whom are comically self-centric to the point where even a bottom-tier Disney Channel sitcom couldn't make villains out of them without asking them to dial it back. There is literally no likeable aspect of Velma. She treats those who we see are her friends and family with equal disdain and disregard as the fries she eats from the garbage. Also, what is meant to be empowering or interesting about taking a sophisticated detective that quietly lead a mildly mature team through danger and making her out to be a repulsive dweeb. The absolute most generous comparison I can make is to Meilin at the beginning of Pixar's ""Turning Red,"" but the huge difference to make clear is how much of this behavior can be seen as endearing from a girl meant to be in middle school. The lead of a show taking place amongst high schoolers meant to have an audience of adults is not at all the place for the naivety and general immaturity/bratiness Velma displays. There is a cockiness and self-righteousness that makes her one of the least likeable protagonists I've ever seen. I would, no lie, prefer Meh from ""The Emoji Movie."" It's that bad.

I know this part has already been harped on, but I need to add it, since this would be his spot on the list. Where. The. Fudge. Is. Scooby? Seriously, there has never been a successful attempt to spinoff the mystery gang without the group altogether, though for some reason I cannot seem to fathom studios continue to try. The statement I read related to concerns over a talking dog not being ""adult"" enough for this show. I would argue ""Family Guy"" is miles more mature...which is sad...and has a raunchy talking dog that works fine. ""Rick and Morty"" have a talking cat, along with many other hilariously outrageous examples of anthropomorphism. There is no reasonable excuse for excluding Scooby from at least a background role, and his absence affects much of the product but most specifically damages Shaggy and his social dynamics.

So the characters we love are all complete garbage. More rotten than dead fish washed up a week ago on a humid beach. Despite this, it does get worse. I'm already out of space from my ranting, so please, as a favor to me, do not watch this show. We deserve better than this as Scooby fans, and it's time studios started recognizing that."
1.0,"Jan 27, 2023","So I went into this show without expectations, I didn't put any biased opinions of previous iterations of the characters. This show is fresh as it deals with the fuel for these teens finding mysteries. I love the in depth backstory of all characters. A little dramatic at times but still very natural and entertaining. This is like Scooby Doo meets Rick and Morty. The one thing that I do hope to see is a cameo of Scooby at least. What I look for is if the show can hold my interest and I did not pick up my phone at all. I think people don't like the drastic changes tho bring this show to a Adult Comedy. Understand this is a fresh take."
1.0,"Jan 18, 2023","The show ruins everything you loved about the original characters. It would probably score a bit higher if all the names were switched for original characters, but even ignoring the source IP there is still very little to like about the characters or the awful attempt at humor. There is a gross amount of body shaming, misandry, and mindless jabs that the show just expects us to like, but all it does is make the show that much harder to watch. A more ""adult"" scooby doo show has already been done and it's great, there was no reason for this one to exist.

Also Mindy Kaling irl is a real piece of work, don't support her."
1.0,"Jan 19, 2023","This show is up there with Slippin' Jimmy and Santa Inc. As one of the greatest pieces of animated media to ever be produced. The scriptwriting is genius and subtle, the characters feel realistic and lovable, the jokes are funny and never just consist of one of the Scooby Doo characters saying something offensive, gross, self aware or rude.

For real though, stay away from this show unless you really want something to hate-watch. The animation looks bland, all characters (especially Velma herself) are extremely unlikable and have nothing in common with the characters from the original Scooby Doo, the show is full of what I think is supposed to be satire of racial stereotypes however the writers completely forgot about the satire part and just wrote in offensive stereotypes in the show. It's a real shame that this is the introduction we get to a reimagined Scooby Doo where the characters have different ethnicities and sexualities. The Scooby Doo gang have always been a diverse cast of characters so letting that diversity show in things like skin color or sexuality is not a bad idea, it's just beyond horribly executed. I think this is the worst animated show I have ever seen in my entire life, and I watched both Santa Inc and Slippin Jimmy."
1.0,"Mar 10, 2023","This is not a show that was made in good faith. On the contrary, it was written specifically to attract attention through how much it would offend and outrage people, even those with no investment or passing care for the Scooby-Doo franchise. The race changes, the labeling of offensive dialogue and completely unfounded and shocking scenes as ""comedy"", the near-complete reversals of character behavior...all of it is a transparent experiment in the concept of ""there is no bad publicity.""

The selected clips for trailers, the show-runners' vocal support of their own dramatic changes, the amount of money spent, the marketing, the attachment to what was originally such an innocent brand-all-of it is specifically created to farm controversy. It's a cynical, self-aware cash-grab by some of the most soulless people in the business.

Do. Not. Watch."
4.0,"Feb 19, 2023","Loud, crass, obnoxious, brutally unfunny. This is what happens when you try pandering dark humor to everyone, no one is laughing. I have been a fan of Scooby Doo all my life and it's so sad to see these characters I love get butchered by hack screenwriters. The members of Mystery Inc have turned into a shadow of their former selves, with more in common to Big Mouth characters than their original archetypes. Each one is a stereotype; worse of all is Velma who has become irredeemably cruel.

The writing was lazy and uninspired. The acting is wooden and unconvincing. The overall plot was unoriginal. The new mystery is brainless-who cares where her mother went? Who is the brain snatcher? I don't care! The show is simply a rehash of old sitcoms clashed with FOX adult animated shows without a laugh track. It felt like it was going through the motions of corporate committee written jokes. Perhaps the only passable thing is the synth soundtrack. I would not recommend Velma to anyone.

It's not surprise that this was the biggest premiere of any HBO Max animated series: because everyone hates it."
3.0,"Jan 21, 2023","I can give 10 reasons why this load of trash shouldn't exist in the first place! It's an overall abomination to the whole Scooby-Doo franchise. Speaking of the character why bother calling it a Scooby-Doo series if the TITLE CHARACTER isn't even in it. Also the redesigns look trash, the worst offender would be Shaggy (or as they call him in the series ""Norville""). And some of the concept doesn't really make sense, like how and why does sexual situations have to do with Scooby-Doo, I know this is supposed to be an adult series but damn isn't that confusing. I did not even laugh once in every episode I've watched so far! If you want a better mature Scooby-Doo series, I suggest you watch Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated it's way better than what ever THIS is supposed to be?

Overall I would give this a 1/10, but there's only one thing I like about this series. Not wasting my time for a next episode, because I'm not watching this again."
1.0,"Feb 27, 2023","This ranks up (or rather down) with shows like Another Life and movies like Liquid Sky.

The creator is extremely angry and bitter, and blames other people for his (or this case her) problems, and has made a show about the people (s)he despises.

The show is filled with nothing more than caricatures and self-congratulatory back-patting. It's pretty clear that we're supposed to hate everyone in the show except the main character, because they're all so miserable to her. However, the main character is even nastier and more unpleasant as the other characters, but the author isn't self aware enough to realize it."
1.0,"Jan 16, 2023","Trash show. Of course trying to change a character that's been the same for years into this (new age) character is honestly disappointing, as the other original characters are very unlikeable. So much potential wasted and it feels like this was just done to try and make you hate what they've done to the characters. It doesn't make any sense, instead of ruining original series that people grew up on and trying to make the characters more of this era, just do something new next time instead of destroying original ideas like everything else that's coming up on television. The only value this show has is being a prime example of what NOT TO DO for future creators/writers."
10.0,"Jan 17, 2023","Who in their right mind thought this was a good idea? This whole idea should've been trashed! For the higher ups to green light this is baffling. That ""Mindy"" getting away with this, is what's wrong with today! Trying to destroy what was good from our childhoods. Someone needed loved more as a child! Well they said my review was too short. Velma pole dancing for her father was disgusting! This is not how women act! If this is what goes on in her head she needs to be evaluated. Seriously and everyone who finds this funny is disgusting and not to be trusted! Stand up America! How many bad reviews does it take to get this stopped?"
2.0,"Mar 5, 2023","First, I'd like to point out that I've watched literally every episode of every scooby-doo ever made. It's always playing in our house. Our family loves all the scooby-doo series (minus Scrappy, because. Well you know.)

This version is hilarious, smart, provocative, and the animation style and color is amazing.

I love they brought Frank Welker on as Mr. Jones (I was initially v upset he wasn't Fred, until I heard his voice. Clever as Fred is depicted as being ""a late bloomer"".)

The innuendoes of the catch phrases, the satire on Velma's sexuality and overt sexuality in pilot episodes, the general call-out of typecasting and tropes in film and tv. The writing is amazing.

The sheer volume of poor reviews on this show says more about reviewers than the show itself. This show is testing the boundaries of race and gender and sexuality. That's the point of it. It's Velma.

I can always get a little bored with things that are too irreverent or ""zany"". But that being said, I think Mindy is spot in with this one.

If you didn't enjoy this show, other than not enjoying animated series, it because it's over your head, anyway."
1.0,"Jan 21, 2023","There has been a lot of valid criticism over the humor, pacing and dialogue. At the end of the day not one of the characters are likable. I suspect the villain will be the most enjoyable character once he is revealed. This major issue prevents any other positive interaction. If an unlikable character does say something funny it will land flat because the audience can't form a connection with the character. Bad writers will make bad decisions and this show has lot of bad decisions. Exactly how would you make a ""team"" when half of the jokes are at Fred's expense? With the main protagonist dumping on everyone there is no cohesion. It's painful to watch and I have better things to do with my time."
1.0,"Mar 15, 2023","Hbo max has failed again at making a semi decent adult animated show. The poor writing and forced jokes are horrible, but the worst part about this show is the self insert of Mindy kailing as Velma. Stop taking well known characters and ruining them, to be frank this show shouldn't of ever been a Scooby-Doo doo show. And honestly we need more creativity as a society. We need to make new characters and stop changing the old ones. And we need new diverse characters and you would think in 2023 we would know that by now. Also one last thing hbo cut so many animated TV shows for this crap! AND THERE MAKING A SEASON 2? Lord what has gone wrong with this world."
1.0,"Mar 16, 2023","Scooby-Doo was a staple of my childhood viewing. It was never my favourite as I found the episodes to be a bit repetitive however it was good humoured and a decent cartoon. Now onto Velma, I'll leave it spoiler-free, I have literally no clue how this got made. It's objectively a terrible show, it lacks humour, is mean-spirited and all this would have been obvious from the initial scripts.

Why on earth did they go into full production and invest further money with such obviously bad material? It beggars believe. The new management at Warner seemed to have realised that a lot of stinkers were in production and killed them dead, though some series like Raised by Wolves didn't deserve to be killed but I understand the ratings weren't there. This series, I can only assume was already in the can and therefore no cost to release except the reputational damage. Rumours are that this might get a second season, if so, everyone in management needs fired."
1.0,"Jan 27, 2023","Watched this with the wife and so so bored. Also is this really meant to be a comedy? Neither of us laughed once. If you changed the names nobody would even be able to tell its meant to be scooby doo and how is it possible to make EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER so damn unlikeable?

I mean if thats what the shows creators aimed for when they made the show then i guess they at least achieved something with this mess. Only watched episode one as i would rather be dragged naked on my front across broken glass than watch another episode of this rubbish. Also rumours are season 2 is getting greenlit? If thats true there is something very wrong with this world."
3.0,"Jan 13, 2023","So we have a Scooby Doo show for adults, but without Scooby Doo himself. That sounds a bit odd, but any idea can work depending on the execution. Unfortunately, the execution here is completely garbage. Let me get my one positive out of the way, and that's with the animation. It's bright, colorful, and is really fluid. Visually, this show looks amazing. Everything else is bad, and that's for one reasons. Almost all the characters are unlikable. The titular Velma is a cynical, spiteful, hypocritical jerk who thinks she's smarter than everyone else and expects her to bow to her. I wouldn't mind this so much if she were properly called out for this behavior, but every time she is, she either ignores it or is forced to become better because the plot demands her to. Daphne and Fred are also pretty horrible. Daphne can be spoiled and vain in other incarnations, but she's not supposed to be this uptight mean girl who treats people like dirt. Fred is a privileged, entitled man child who can't take care of himself and only remembers girls if they're hot. Any attempts to give them depth, like Daphne wanting to find her biological parents or Fred trying to be mature, are also pretty forced. Norville/Shaggy is the least bad out of all of them since he actually has a moral compass. However, he doesn't have much in the way of depth and it's obvious that the writers want to drug jokes with him. Everyone else in the supporting cast is either too unlikable or too one note to get a proper reaction out of me. Even if this show improves later on, it can't escape the tainted reputation of those early episodes. I'm glad Scooby Doo wasn't put in this series. At least he won't be subjected to the awful writing that everyone else is going through. I like some of the more divisive Scooby Doo shows like Be Cool Scooby Doo, but this is a show that's not worth your time."
1.0,"Jan 12, 2023","I think that they pitched the whole idea without even thinking about doing it with the Scooby-Doo gang... then after a while someone said "" let's transform this idea in a whole new Scooby-Doo series without Scooby the lovable dog and the team we know people love...""

Let's be honest, this series could standout on its own it if wasn't for the ""brilliant"" idea of including the SD gang, the story is trying so hard to feel young and different, but falls into a vague attempt to change things on TV.

Just by watching the first episode you understand that maybe... just maybe... this was a horrible idea."
1.0,"Jan 12, 2023","Is the worst thing I've ever seen. It's not Scooby-Doo. The adaptation of the characters is terrible. Velma is sucks and unbearable. The script is horrible and appeals to ridiculous narratives of drugs, nudity and narcissism of the main character. The jokes aren't funny at all. They tried to transform scooby-doo in Rick and Morty or Euphoria, bur the result is something exaggerated and awful. They removed the original essence of the characters. I can't even watch more than three epsodes because it's really bad and sad. Fortunately they didn't put the dog (Scooby-doo) so they can't ruin one more character."
9.0,"Jan 17, 2023","Couldn't even finish the first episode, it was so cringy and unentertaining. I have always enjoyed adult animation (family guy, Archer, Rick and morty) but Velma offered nothing remotely close to being funny. The deceitful part about this show is that it is tagged as comedy!

Mindy could have done more with this series if she learned how to write a funny joke and follow up with some kind of story line that is entertaining and coherent. Velma's writes/producers and cast should be fired and apologize to the original creators of Scooby-Doo for completely destroying a legend of a show. The Scooby-Doo movies were not the best, but they were above and beyond this movie in every aspect.

I dont understand why they didn't stick closer to the original story line. This show is pure garbage."
1.0,"Mar 5, 2023","I truly have no clue why this show is receiving so much hate.

A reimagined Scooby Doo origin story - so exciting! After watching the first 5 minutes, I realized I had no clue what I was in for. OMG, it became a dream come true and I am all in on this roller-coaster ride!

The show rocks! All these Scooby purists hating on the show have forgotten why Scooby snacks existed. Seriously, one of the most famous kids shows ever is about seeing ghosts while always always hungry...hmmm, I wonder what could cause that?

This show unleashes all the adult themed innuendo of the original, and delivers on all the rumors and ""what if"" scenarios that have always made the gang's relationship a mystery. I love how this show cooks up every taboo rumor and serves them up as a main entree.

Please oh please let there be another season or 5. I want to see how far the rabbit hole goes!

1.0,"Jan 24, 2023","Originally, I was excited for Velma. I've loved Scooby Doo for a long time so I was interested in a SD series that was more mature.

Velma is not that.

It's mean spirited, unfunny, gross and all around, offers the audience nothing. Every single character in this is an asshole. We also have a lot of nudity for zero reason. There was only one funny moment in the entire episode. The worst part is Velma herself. They took a character that was loveable and made her completely unlikeable. I couldn't wait for the episode to end!

Don't watch this, please. I am begging you. Just watch other good Scooby Doo stuff."
1.0,"Jan 14, 2023","This has nothing to do with the original series and just used the names of the characters and that there are ""mysteries"" in it. If they just made this its own standalone show it would have been at least a 2/10 star show. The writing is still terrible and the ""comedy"" is just super racial stereotypes with cartoon nudity. Not that those don't have their place in adult cartoons ie. Drawn together is a great example of what this show could have been instead of trashing an old loved series and falling flat to most audience members.

The amount of hate spewed from this show towards all genders and races is absurd I am not sure who hurt the writer in their life but it looks like everyone. Id only recommend this show to someone just to make them suffer. Mature doesn't mean just sex/nudity, hate, gore it can go so much deeper just not here."

They insulte every race they can think off, the insult men and women, they insulte other shows much better then this one and they insult their audience. It's honestly a bit impressive. The only thing good about it is the animation. So basically just look at the poster art, and you'll have seen all that's good about Velma. I have enjoyed the stuff Mindy Kaling has created in the past, but this show is just created with such a hatred for the world and the animation genre in itselt, that it is just painfull to watch."

I gave this a fair try even though I have seen the audience reactions. I have no clue how and why this was greenlit. The attempt of implementing humor into this show is one of the biggest fails I have seen in a while. This is so far off anything likable ... the one extra star is added only because I like the visuals a bit.

The animation is so good though, it's quite a waste to put this sort of animation on this terrible show. Overall, it's horrible and I wouldnt be surprised if it turns out that this isn't supposed to be a Scooby-Doo show and it's some sort of cheap high-school drama that wouldn't sell on its own so they slapped the Scooby-Doo branding on it."
1.0,"Jan 19, 2023",They really thought this was a good idea turning every character unlikeable. There is no point in doing a reboot if you can't even understand that characters you are grabbing. There is a way to show more adult humor in animations as shown by shows like Harley Quinn however what they failed to understand is that you still pull from the character inspiration. Instead of drawing on each character's inspiration and personalities Velma took a vague description and corrupted it either through over sexualization or basic stereotypes. A show completely under minding the original goal of diversifying characters and instead turning them into unlikeable stereotypes.

I believe all of the people who gave 1 stars that show are right about at some points points but its not the worst show guys. You're just exaggerating.

The tone was very cringy, the jokes about stereotyping quickly become disturbing, almost hateful in an annoying way.

The strategy of mocking old show and pointing out the flaws could have worked if there were elements that connects us to the original show, but instead almost everything that we like about the Scooby Doo show was talked down upon. Not in a ""paying respects"" way. But in a ""bully"" way.

There is a ""tease"" from love and there is a downright hate.

1.0,"Jan 23, 2023","My first encounter with Mindy Kaling was as Kelly Kapoor in The Office, an always-funny, on-the-mark comedy that proved that even the mundanities of life can have a sense of humor about them. When she wasn't working in front of the camera, she was tirelessly working behind the scenes, writing and producing some of the show's highest moments and most entertaining episodes. In short, Mindy Kaling created a reputation for herself as a genuinely funny comedian... and, really, what more could you ask for? Gender and ethnicity don't matter to me when it comes to comedy; all that matters is the same basic question we ought to ask of every up-and-coming wannabe comedian: are you funny? And Mindy proved, during her time on The Office, that she was not only funny, but she was funny in fresh ways, and she was able to hit every mark and make some truly laugh-out-loud jokes.

Admittedly, I haven't followed much of Mindy's career outside The Office. It's my favorite TV show, after all -- not to mention one of the only sitcoms I can watch on repeat every day for the rest of my life. But hearing that Mindy had done a spinoff series of Scooby-Doo, a property I've grown to love throughout my childhood years and beyond (although more as a guilty pleasure these days), I was pretty intrigued. We have someone who is genuinely funny and has the full potential to truly breathe some fresh life into these characters in a portrayal unlike anything we've ever seen before.

And, to her credit, that's exactly what we got: something unlike anything else we've ever seen. But uniqueness alone does not a good show make. Remember, Yoko Ono is ""unique"" in her own right, but I highly doubt you're going to be streaming any of her records after reading this review.

Where do I even start to talk about Velma? It's the second massively disappointing project done with the Scooby-Doo property in the 2020s (with Scoob being a close second place). ""Velma"" showcases the creative ramblings of an out of touch comedian, someone who thinks she knows what the general public is going to find funny but ultimately misses the mark at every step along the way in her journey. The characters are so wildly inconsistent with any of the other entries in this massive, decade-spanning franchise that the very act of calling them by the names of beloved Scooby-Doo characters feels like blasphemy. The show is a parody, but the ultimate parody the show commits is parody against its own source material, which is never something you want to be doing. Velma is a show spun off from the Scooby-Doo media machine, yet it actively mocks the very material without which it would not exist, insulting the viewer for being -- or having been -- a fan of the source material along the way. Considering it was greenlit by Warner Bros., it's rather ironic that the company that nurtured this IP for so long is now actively allowing others to come in and mock their own cash cow. And yet, they're not only funding and enabling this... they're greenlighting a second season of this nonsense.

Profanity is totally fine in a comedy show for adults, however it feels rather tacky and distasteful to take an IP that was, first and foremost, made for kids and turn it into something that would be unwatchable by its original demographic. Further still, it's such a massive departure from everything that made the characters so endearing that, had the original creators of the franchise been here to witness this, they would've likely left feeling deeply disappointed and disrespected.

Most of the attempts at ""humor"" in this show are based solely on the cringe-factor. Much like The Office, this show seems to try to thrive on the ""I-can't-believe-they-actually-said-that"" comedy trope which, while pulled off in a genius way in The Office with the likes of Steve Carell, Rainn Wilson, John Krasinski, B. J. Novak, Jenna Fischer and, of course, Mindy Kaling, falls completely flat in Velma. Every attempt for a ""fourth wall break"" feel forced and unnatural, every attempt to show awareness that this IS, in fact, a show, caused my eyes to roll so hard they almost rolled completely out of their sockets. The scripts are weak and juvenile, the humor is not funny, the mystery is not engaging, the jokes (with very few exceptions) don't work, the characters are one-dimensional with no real development as the season progressed... from start to finish, this show was a disappointment.

This show reeks of a stale writing room, a large group of ""yes-men"" who think they're making some of the most evolved and relevant jokes that have ever been committed to screen... and people either too sycophantic or intimidated to speak their mind and say it's stupid. Nobody watching this show is laughing, except out of pity alone, except for the select few people sitting in that writer's room.

Perhaps the best question would be ""why watch it, then?"" Like a glorious trainwreck that one is victim to, unable to turn away despite wanting to do nothing but that very thing, we keep watching in the hopes that it would get better, holding on to the wish that this show would, somewhere along the way, manage to redeem itself. But it didn't.

And the fact that Warner Bros. Has officially greenlit a second season of this show (which, I think is safe to say, next to nobody is asking for) just goes to show how out of touch they've become with the very people who financially support and enable them to continue making content for all of us. If your content falls flat, it's time to rejuvenate it and find a better formula that will work financially and critically. You can't have one without the other. So, please, WB, give us an animated series in the Scooby-Doo universe. I even implore you to explore some territory that hasn't already been covered. But please keep Mindy Kaling as far away from it as you possibly can. She's not a good fit for this IP."
1.0,"Feb 12, 2023","I have no idea why this is branded as a Scooby-Doo-related show; it has nothing in common with the franchise. The characters don't bear any resemblance to their previous incarnations.

This is a generic, modern, ""edgy"" teen/adult animated show shoe-horned into the Scooby-Doo name. The plot is barely coherent and the dialogue is largely vapid. It's apparently a comedy but there are no laughs involved. It's just not fun.

If you're easily amused and extremely bored, it may be worth your time. If you're a fan of the franchise, you'll probably want to give it a miss. If you're a fan of good television you might also want to give it a miss."
2.0,"Jan 30, 2023","The problem here is that they tried to make a Scooby Doo show without Scooby Doo. He is the part of the show that makes it so unique and fun and they got rid of him. Also, I am not sure why they decided to rework the characters so drastically, the reason Scooby Doo has always been so successful is the characters are likable, but in the show it just feels like a whole new cast, trying to make a spinoff on a show that doesn't need it. Bring back old what's new Scooby Doo and make the people happy, give them what they want. Also RIP to shaggy we remember the OG shaggy and he will not be forgotten."
1.0,"Jan 22, 2023","I love ScoobyDoo I grew up with it and watched every version and I love Mindys other work so si much. I was excited and hopeful for the show.

How did this happen? Why name it Velma when you erase the magic of it. I don't care for the change of ethnicity but the characters are just wrong. It feels like just wanting to be edgy and thinking what? That couse it is animated the story and feel does not matter so much?

Where is the dog? Why are the characters so mean, cruel? Where is the mystery it was predictable?

This is agressive to people who love the original and if you love SchoobyDoo just don't watch it.

We don't need edgy in everything. Sometimes wholesome is better."
1.0,"Jan 23, 2023","You know it's so bad when you have to make an account to rate and review the show. My good lord almighty, sitting through this show was equivalent to sitting through a comedy show of 7th grade boys try to make jokes. To put it short, I'd rather bash my head through a wall.

Honestly, all the mystery inc characters were ruined. Might as well not know who they are anymore. I personally remember when Fred was a nice, happy, good hearted man, and I liked that Fred. I remember when daphne was actually a good friend. I remember when Velma was smart. Honestly, I want that back.

TLDR; if you want a show with these characters to watch, go watch Mystery Inc. It's better, I promise."
1.0,"Jan 16, 2023","This show is atrocious, unfunny didn't laugh once. I don't get why they completely changed the characters so much. If they were gonna change them that much they should've just made new characters at that point.

How can it be a scooby doo show without scooby in it. It's so insulting to the scooby doo/ mystery gang franchise. Completely butchers everything that's already been established in the franchise.

It's worse than big mouth with the sexualization. And that show is notorious for being awful, but to me it's more enjoyable to watch than this garbage. One of the worst adult animated shows I've ever seen.

The fact that hbo plans to make another season is absolutely insane. They are out of there minds."
1.0,"Jan 20, 2023","This show is adult comedy, not a silly comedy. I think it is everything an adult cartoon should be with the scooby doo mystery too. I grew up loving scooby doo so to have an adult comedy scooby is great.

I did not laugh the entire episodes, which I'm assuming some people want. You laugh at the inappropriate jokes and try to figure out who the bad people are... just like regular Scooby.

However, I will note that Velma's 'demons' are a bit much in terms of how frequently they appear. But otherwise idk why everyone is hating on this. It's an entertaining show with a twist of nostalgia that brings you back to 'solving mysteries'."
1.0,"Jan 16, 2023","Don't know who green lit this at HBO but someone should be held accountable for this dumpster fire that was set on thier shift. Velma takes the original show of Scooby Doo and just decides to forget about all the years of history of the show itself. The characters are incomplete and Velma herself went from a soft spoken helpful type to a spiteful and uncaring and cringe worthy character. Fred is moron constantly assaulted with insults and racism. Daphne is treated like bimbo and hated as well, I barely got past the first episode before I had to stop. Biggest question is where is Scooby. I'm thinking its better that he wasn't included because who knows what horrors would of befell him. Someone at HBO please put an end to this atrocity and cancel the show. Mindy has done for Scooby Doo what most poorly adapted series done for their source material, leave it utterly forgettable or totally irrelevant."
8.0,"Jan 26, 2023","Heard people say it was bad, I thought it was be funny bad. It wasn't it was just straight terrible, the only piece of television that really deserves a one star rating, I don't know who made the jokes for this series an ai?

A confusing part was....there was no scooby? How can you make a series set in the scooby-doo universe with no scooby? Before the series even came out people knew it would be terrible due to the unneeded character changes, shaggy name changed? Shaggy is iconic how could you possibly change his name??.

Anyhow please watch at your own distain by the end you may want to yank your own eyes out, I certainly did. Trash."
1.0,"Jan 26, 2023","I grew up watching Scooby Doo, it was never my favourite show, but Scooby is an iconic character.

Fred, Daphne and Velma were kind of forgettable over time. Making a show for adults about a character most people don't care about is odd.

Then we get the actual Velma show, where Velma is a thoroughly unlikable and entitled character as are almost all of the other main characters. What has happened to Fred and where is Shaggy? Perhaps there will be some character development and Velma will help turn Fred into a normal well rounded person???

The show has no writing skill, is not funny and mainly makes jokes at the expense of what could be its audience.

If I want an adult gross out cartoon there is Big Mouth, if I want a thrilling mystery any scandi noir. There is virtually nothing interesting about this cartoon.

Even if this was relabelled something like 'Mindy mysteries' and delinked from Scooby it would still be absolutely terrible."
1.0,"Jan 24, 2023","Honestly... there was some potential that I didn't expect given the deluge of awful reviews, which makes the show even worse IMO. There are some aspects of the show that were better in the series than as described in reviews.

However: Everything, and I mean *everything* the show wants to touch on is smashed into your face like a WWE promo. Every aspect of the show is turned up to 15/10 and can only serve to alienate everyone. Maybe that was the point? Make everyone hate it so they all watch at least one or two episodes to see why they hate it?

Characters seem consumed by social commentary, instead of being a specific character who makes social commentary on occasion. Diversity should just exist in shows, if it's a centerpiece of every character and every interaction... well it's just camouflage for poor writing. I could forgive some aspects of the writing, but for god's sake why make Fred the most stupid possible version of himself? (Insert scream here) Why on earth did anyone, and I mean any person on this earth, think it was a good idea to have Velma's dad conduct a nude (more screaming) photoshoot with his girlfriend, who is **naked and pregnant** and then because that's not graphic enough (even more screaming) let's just have the baby reach their hand through her belly and end with a baby face protruding from her swollen abdomen.

In summary, totally unrelated to Scooby Doo, did have some potential but defecated all over that potential with an insane amount of disgusting scenes and ludicrously offensive characters."
1.0,"Jan 18, 2023","This show is an absolute train wreck. The jokes are cringeworthy and not at all funny. The pop culture references are poorly executed and feel forced. The show's main character of Velma, one of the main characters from the classic cartoon series Scooby-Doo, but it was a complete departure from the original character we all know and love. The Velma character was portrayed as a shallow and superficial person who was obsessed with social media and trends, completely missing the mark on the original character's intelligence and wit.

The performances by the actors were also lacking. The cast appeared to be phoning it in, and it was clear that they were not invested in the material. This made it even harder to connect with the characters and their stories.

Overall, this show was a complete disappointment. The jokes were not funny, the characters were poorly developed, and the production values were subpar. I cannot recommend this show to anyone and I would advise people to stay away from it. The show not only failed to meet the expectations of the audience but also failed to stick to the original Velma character, which is a major disappointment. The show is a complete waste of time."
1.0,"Feb 19, 2023","From the very beginning, it was clear that this series had taken a completely different direction from the original story.

It's a spin-off, but it doesn't feel like it. And it's not only the story, but also the characters that are affected. Some of the core characters were portrayed in a way that felt completely out of character, and ultimately damaged their integrity. I was particularly disappointed.

I would have much rather if the series focus on the original story and characters that we already love, rather than trying to create a completely new story. And I must say I'm grateful that there is no ""Scoob"" here, if he is here, I can't imagine how he will be destroyed in this series."
1.0,"Jan 17, 2023","So bad. Totally changed Velma, bad stories, dumb character alterations. I'm not sure who this was made for but it wasn't anyone who actually liked Scooby Doo ever. The live action depiction of her was so good and this is not anywhere close. If they extend this series beyond the existing episodes it would be a waste of time and money. Some things are great the way they are and do not ever need to be changed. Velma was one of those type of characters. I'm not even sure someone would like this show if they had never heard of scooby doo before. Misters Hannah and Barbera would be very unhappy. Much like i was watching this show."
3.0,"May 12, 2024","I wanted to like it. I really did.

Scooby Doo was my favorite cartoon as a kid, I have probably seen every version of the series. Highlights for me include 13 Ghosts of Scooby Doo, the original series, Zombie Island and Mystery Incorporated. I liked the 2 live action movies as well.

Unfortunately, this chaotic new series falls flat on its face. The humor is trying to be dark and edgy (Rick and Morty-ish vibes) but tries way too hard and comes across as clueless, aimless, out of touch with reality (which normally is fine for fiction...I don't even know how to describe it) and ill-thought-out. Some ""jokes"" from the first episode were absolutely not funny to any living human. It is not possible.

Honestly I was interested to see a series with a more diverse Mystery Incorporated but they have changed the personalities of these characters more than the color of their skin. It doesn't make sense.

No one wants you to radically change characters core personalities to the point they become new characters.

At that point make a new original series with original characters

I've always liked Velma and was down to see a story that focused on her primarily, but this new ""Velma"" is not ""Velma"". It is an entirely different character who has some Velma tropes. Besides that she is a rude, selfish, arrogant, know it all B-word who is somehow more confident in her younger years?? It doesn't make sense and isn't the Velma I've seen over and over. No one asked for these characters to have entirely new personalities. It's so weird.

And I like Mindy Kahling! I've seen her in some stuff where I thought she was really funny. Not to mention I LOVE Constance Wu, she is amazing.

Yet, I feel that their talent is being wasted on this dispassionate money grab. I can't imagine these actresses reading their scripts and being like ""Yeah! People are going to love this!"" ??????????

It's really too bad because I've been waiting for a darker, more mature take on the Scooby gang for years. From the trailer, I thought ""Maybe Velma could be it"". No.

If HBO was smart they would have adapted the highly acclaimed ""SCOOBY APOCALYPSE"" graphic novels from a few years ago instead of this mess of a show. I know that would have been a bigger success and resonated with audiences far better than ""Velma"". No question.

No one that made this series could have been an actual Scooby Doo fan. They don't know what actual Scooby fans want in a darker, more mature series.

I can definitely say this was one of the biggest disappointments I've ever had in a series."
1.0,"Jan 18, 2023","Honestly I enjoyed it way more than I thought I would.

There are some major flaws, but it's not the hellspawn everyone's saying it is.

There were some good jokes, and I like the direction some of the characters went.

The art style is very cute and pleasing to the eye, and the plot itself has me hooked. I'm definitely gonna stay tuned. I'd recommend it, but maybe just for casual watching.

When you go in, don't expect the moon and stars, just expect a fun new approach with the gang we've grown to love.

Again, the flaws stick out like a sore thumb, but if you can put that behind you, then by all means, enjoy it! I know I did :-)"
1.0,"Jan 20, 2023","I tried watching this show and was instantly bored. But it's probably not as bad as it's being made out to be. It's something I could have on in the background while multi-tasking/doing other things. I would be be bored beyond belief if I had to actually sit and watch it and pay full attention. Having said that, it seems to have the same snarky, obnoxious, humor that young people like these days. Actually, to me it was virtually identical to the sort of vibe I got from 'Little Demon', another show I found insufferable, but no better than this show. I think it's just become trendy to trash this show, even though it seems to have been tailor made to its supposed demographic."
9.0,"Jan 23, 2023","When I first heard there was going to be a Velma tv series, I got excited. I thought we were going to see the mystery gang back together and scooby doo, but mainly focus on Velma. Well, I could barely even watch the first episode. The jokes and meta humor is horrible, not funny in the slightest. When I saw they were introducing diversity, I didn't mind, even though I love the original characters. I was excited to see how a more diverse group could enhance the group's friendship and maybe help them bond through some social issues. But how they did it in this series is just wrong, they had very disrespectful and racist remarks. I mean they barely focused on the mystery aspect, just all the crappy ""jokes"" they shoved in the the show. Plus they ruined Fred, like absolutely ruined him. And Velma is extremely arrogant. She is supposed to be extremely smart yes, but she isn't arrogant and rude. And where is scooby doo?! I cannot fathom how much this show causes me pain."
1.0,"Jan 22, 2023","Velma is the next pathetic self insert of Mindy Kaling and the show is extremely unfunny on its own, but that's not all.

The characters are nothing like their original selves, to what degree, you ask? ""Velma"", who is supposed to be the bright and knowledgable one, asked Shaggy, the lazy stoner - or Norville, because his nickname is apparently gone - for help with her homework.

The regular group dynamic has changed completely. Velma's character is another ""witty"", rude self insert of Mindy, as I mentioned previously, Shaggy suddenly became smart and the only thing Kaling seems to care about is the size of Fred's penis (which the characters laugh about MULTIPLE times).

TLDR: Velma is an extremely unlikable self insert of Mindy Kaling and the (terrible) show has nothing to do with the original characters."
1.0,"Jan 17, 2023","This show is awful. It completely changes everything about scooby doo, and it is extremely sexist. It depicts men in a weak way, to promote women empowerment, which is ok but this show completely overdoes it. The plot is very poorly written and the show is very sloppy. The dialogue between the characters is not incredible and the story isn't written that well. It does not feel anything like what the old Scooby-Doo used to be. It is an entirely worse version than the original Scooby-Doo. The show makes Velma seem very different and incredibly annoying, to the point where I feel like the other characters don't even like her."
1.0,"Jan 18, 2023","This show has decimated my childhood. The writing is horrible as well as the forced change of all the characters. Velma is a self-insert, Norville is a boring original character, Fred has been sexualized, sexually assaulted, and infantilized, and Daphne is just a horrible person. The fact that there are sexually charged scenes and sexual jokes in a high school setting should be a red flag, overall it's incredibly unfunny. The mystery crew is a disgrace and none of the characters work together well enough to be friends. Many of us are just very disappointed in this horrible adaptation of their story. To see such a well-loved show be strategically picked apart is tragic. This is a hate crime against the original creators of Scooby Doo."
1.0,"Jan 21, 2023","This show is so so far away from even the recent Scooby Doo related or adjacent shows that it shouldn't have even been marketed as being one. All the characters are plain annoying, the plot goes from 0 to 100 real fast (pacing issues) and, worst of all, it's just plain old boring and uninteresting.

It might've stood a chance if it were a brand new IP and not so fundamentally tied down by the established mythos of the Scoob world. I mean, you have to use the locale and the identifiable names of individuals. If these constraints were not in place, it might've been better. MIGHT.

But in it's current state, avoid this. Avoid it like the plague."
1.0,"Jan 21, 2023","It's not perfect but it's really cleverly written and it's for all of us Gen-X'ers who grew up with Scooby-Doo and are now adults. It's Not a kids show. Each season is its own mystery and they've set it up as a bit of an origin story. It's quite good - we especially enjoy how they tell really great sub stories - it definitely draws you in! (Kind of reminds me of a Rose or Sophia story from Golden Girls except more in depth). There's a ton of reference to more evolved ways of looking at the world - tolerance etc and educates on humanity today. It definitely pokes at it though, which is awesome.

Sit back, relax, stop thinking it's another awful Scooby-Doo movie or reboot series. It's not. It's new and once you stop comparing you can make a call if you like it or not. If you like Simpsons, Family Guy, Bobs Burgers, etc you'll like the humour. It's dialled up to adult level. And parents, take a listen. Maybe you'll gain some insight, through context you can understand, about the world your teenagers are living in."

I hate to sound like I'm overly invested here, but why do this to an iconic children's cartoon? The show is gross, vulgar, crass, stupid ... enter similar description here. And of course, devoid of humor. The jokes are forced, obvious, and lowest-common-denominator in nature. In fact, they are insulting. There is no nuance or irony. No winks or nudges. Just sledgehammer stupidity. It truly felt like something some overgrown kids would do in an effort to create something that would insult as many people as possible. Please, just don't."

It is not funny and it is racism, but not like south park where they are making fun of the idea it is just actually racism.

Only thing I can say that is it positive is from the animation and artwork of the show. Visuals are actually pretty good to look at, but the writing make me upset. Voice actors are good at voices too, but they have scripts that are not good at all. :/"

That, or they do it from a satirical point of view to push their opinions on a certain cultural topic. This show has more in common with modern Family Guy than anything else, and even that is miles more preferable. Such a shame really. Oh well.."
10.0,"Jan 21, 2023","Thanks god Scooby Doo isn't in the series. This series is not meant for anyone who has ever liked Scooby Doo, at best it's meant for people who hate the Scooby Doo franchise and wish to see it dragged through a pile of cow manure, if that's even a target demographic?

The writing comes off as though it was done by a bottom tier comedian who only ever goes for the vulgar shock humor. Were they expecting people to laugh because ""haha omg I can't believe she just said that!"" every 5 seconds? Velma tries to be meta or topical with just about every line and it just comes off as annoying, unfunny, and sigh worthy.

The mystery element feels like a burden to the writers, they were probably obligated to have mystery elements in there given it's Scooby Doo but they clearly don't care about making it good or interesting. Shaggy goes to find out what Fred remembers at one point only for Fred to shrug it off that he doesn't pay attention to women or minorities? Something like that, but the thread stopped there and that was apparently our mystery quota for the episode.

I have to hope that everyone on the crew spoke up throughout production about how terrible everything is only for the director to ignore their collective pleas. I refuse to believe anyone working on this thought it was good or even remotely watchable, especially anyone born in the last 50 years that's seen at least one episode of any Scooby Doo series before.

Go watch Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated instead, it's also on HBO Max and is so much more mature and entertaining than this pile of cow manure. Maybe that's the point of Velma? To remind us how many good Scooby Doo series are out there for us to revisit?"

The story is garbage the second episode does not even acknowledge the first ones cliff hanger.

Even if you ignore the fact that this is a scooby doo show these ""new"" characters are unoriginal trash. I assume that that is the joke? I think? This show is beyond comprehension in just how bad it is. I feel like the only reason this was made is because the director worked with. Mindy Kaling in his previous show Champions.

The plots and jokes in this series are really offensive, racist, and sexist! They made jokes about Mexicans, Indi, and Asian. The plots also make no sense at all.

It could've used a whole bunch of work and I think instead of watching this u could be watching a bunch of better things out there.

1.0,"Jan 20, 2023","I've been a Scooby Doo fan for years and I've seen many iteration of the characters. That said, these are some of the most unrecognizable and unlikable versions I've ever seen. They made Daphne rude, Shaggy well kempt, and Velma less smart and more mean. I don't want to hear her give some sort of cheap shot at minorities every few minutes. This is one of those shows thats edgy for the sake of being edgy because they think that's what young adults want to see. I also want to be clear that changing the race of some characters has nothing to do with why this show is bad. The only character I have a slight issue with their design is Shaggy, he looks to tidy and organized, no where near... Shaggy(?) enough. If they reworked every characters personality, then it would be ok. Especially Velma, she acts as if someone tried to imitate Daria, but ended up being a bltch who just takes pot-shots any chance she gets. And for the love of god, there's a reason she's the brains of the group, let her actually be intelligent, she cheated off Shaggy's work for christs sake. I'm done now, just fix their awful personalities, that's all."
1.0,"Jan 16, 2023","This reboot could have been okay, but it really comes across like they hired a bunch of guys to write about Velma and for most of the first ep it's a straight guys opinion on how lesbians act...maybe they were trying to be high brow and overplay it to make fun of it like they eluded too, but it missed the mark.

This reads more like an alt universe title of some fan boy that had the hots for Velma and it could very well lead into a cartoon PornHub title if they wanted it too.

The characterizations are also so far off from the originals that people grew up and loved that you might as well have just created an entirely new concept show based on this and not related it to the original cartoon at all. Freddy = dumb rich joke, Daphne - somewhat evil, maybe bisexual, girl lead, Shaggy - in love with Velma?

Odd choices guys, but at least you took the swing you just completely missed the ball."
9.0,"Jan 16, 2023","It is deeply concerning and utterly reprehensible that the creators of this so-called ""children's TV show"" have seen fit to include explicit and inappropriate content. This betrayal of the trust of parents and children alike is a gross violation of the responsibility that comes with producing programming for young audiences. The show's humor and themes are not only inappropriate but also offensive and could be potentially harmful to the children who are watching. The complete lack of regard for the well-being and innocence of children is nothing short of shameful. This TV show should be taken off the air immediately and the creators should be held accountable for their actions."
1.0,"Jan 21, 2023","Yup, they just tried to remake Venture Brothers, but make it all about ""edgy"" racial and sexual orientation commentary. Guess what - Venture Brothers already had that commentary. It also satirized a bunch of other stuff, which is why no one part felt overdone. Hell, Venture Brothers also satirized Scooby Doo, and did it way better in a few scenes than Velma does in the three whole episodes I could bring myself to watch! Most of these writers and actors can be hit-and-miss; Mindy Kaling vacillates between awesome and weak quite a bit in my opinion. But wasting the excellent Glenn Howerton on that terrible Fred character is so bad, it doesn't even sound like him."
1.0,"Jan 21, 2023","I really wanted this to be good... I've been looking forward to a new scoobymystery type show. It has no character development. Absolutely no draw to continue watching... abysmal at best. Do not waste your time watching this show. I think the developers fell very short on whatever theme they were trying to portray. If there was ever a scooby-doo type show to skip, this is it. There are many other varieties of mystery shows to enjoy. This is not one of them. The characters are dull, and the plot is lackluster to say the best. I think I would rather watch paint dry on a brick wall than ever have to see this again."
1.0,"Jan 21, 2023","I don't think this show is a 1/10 like many people think, but i definitely see why it's getting this much hate.

First of all, what is the point? The idea is that this show is supposed to be for adults only, but it makes fun of adults who watch animation. So it isn't for adults, it isn't for kids, not even for Scooby-Doo fans. Who is this for?

About the cartoon itself, I don't think i need to tell you all the bad things about it because you're probably sick of hearing It. What i'll do is tell you that there is light in this mess. The animators went all out on specific scenes which should get more credit, I thought Norville was actually fine and not someone that i want to hate forever, the actual plot is kinda intriguing, however the show does not dig it enough to make it stand out.

Don't get me wrong, i'm not defending this Cartoon. It was really bad and all other reviews say most of what I think, but the point is that there's still good things and passionate animators, but it's too bad they got such a tragic project to put their talent into."
1.0,"Jan 16, 2023","I liked this show a lot I've seen the backlash on TikTok and stuff so I decided to watch it myself and found it pretty I will take off a couple points because of the demasculating of hetro men in the show Fred is shamed to be late bloomer and SA and shamed for not having s3x. The animation was good and was funny at most parts I requested that you watch it first before rating because lots of people just see TikToks and just take that persons point of view instead of making your own opinions about the show. In all this show was honestly pretty good and hope that you watch it before making a decision about. Thanks for reading if you did have a good day, night, or afternoon."
1.0,"Jan 17, 2023","Wow. I cant even begin to express how bland and utterly disappointing this show it. (Not that I had high hopes for Mindy) From boring or generally awkward writing and interactions, to poor taste choices (such as a badly written panic attack, strange situations between Norville and Velma- or worse, Norville and ""Scoobi"") this show is a total dumpster fire. Not Worth hate watching even! Only upside is the designs themselves arent God awful. They aren't fantastic but not awful. Sad that some of the representation we needed was wasted on this to primarily be used as a joke or for shock value. The animation done with the designs also isnt all that pleasant to watch."
1.0,"Jan 19, 2023","This is the perfect formula to ruin the happy memories of Scooby Doo!! I mean! What where they thinking!!!

I understand wanting to change the narrative and wanting to change things but this is definitely not the way to do it! I grew up watching Scooby and grew up loving those characters! This is totally irreverent and disrespectful of what was originally created! Scooby is one of those cartoons that remain through time. Every movie or series maintains the original background.. that you just can't change!! This was awful!! I really hope they go back to what has always worked. This is not the way to change it. It's ok if from time to time they do a lego movie.. it's kind of fun. But for me and I bet for a lot of viewers, the same Scooby from the begging still works perfectly!"
1.0,"Jan 18, 2023","Throughout episodes 1-4, I haven't even laughed once. Not even a smile. Not even a chuckle. There are literally 5 of the same basic, recycled jokes used over and over again. The most repetitive ones being about Fred's junk, and the other one being ""well usually in romantic comedies...this happens...but this isn't a romantic comedy...so it WONT ahahaha"".

I was a fan of Mindy Kaling's other TV show, ""never have I ever"" that is on Netflix. However, this just doesn't even come close to that at all...whatsoever. This feels like Mindy is making ""Velma"" all about herself, while having Norville simp all over her.

The animation style is cool, the bright vibrant colors does make it seem very modern. Other than that, there's not much to like."

The plot looks cool but they are so boring. I watched it and fell sleep. I think you try to be Rick and Malty too much, make it sound boring. The kids can't even watch it and it not that fun enough for adults either! If you will have another season, please at least make it more interesting and stop biting other fans, at least orginal scooby do was more fun and kids can watch it and more interesting misteory, less annoying and easy to watch.

10.0,"Feb 22, 2023",This should be a zero no one should watch this series the writing is bad and all that characters are different where Scooby and Shaggy? It's so bad and makes sexist and racist jokes and talks about sex a lot like come on this was supposed to be the scooby doo we all know revamped and when they were going to make the gang during high school. Missed opportunity and I am dissapointed. What happened to our family friendly Scooby doo we rememeber and all loved in the good old days and now we get this crap. Would not recommend. I would stick with the original it's the safer path. Should be cancelled.
2.0,"Jan 27, 2023","I couldn't Eve even finish the show. Idk why the creators even remotely tried to say this is scooby doo? It's not. They should have just created their own dumpster fire and called it something else, but to taint scooby doos name is not it. This show s u x. Not funny, over dramatic, and they are like bully-ish and mean so even more not funny. I could go on and on and on about the little things but honestly everyone should just see for themselves how much of a dumpster fire it is, rate it as it should, so another season isn't made. What a waste of my time, what a waste of a show, and what a bad name for scooby doo.

Shame on the creators."
1.0,"Jan 20, 2023","Everyone's saying that the show is bad obviously it is looking at it and comparing it to the past universe is of Scooby Doo, which I think personally, the show should have its own story, which is why it does. The show starts with a whole different story a whole different line. The characters are completely different. It's challenging the views of what the show had before which was you know race is a thing that in this generation, everybody seems to try to make a part of the show so you know they try to change everyone's views on what a character can actually do it. I think Velma being African-American is amazing because it shows that she is an amazing investigator on her own without having to be a white person to prove to everyone that she is capable doing her own thing and she has her own intelligent so she can rely on. Which I love that they changed the races of the characters and their stories."
1.0,"Jan 19, 2023","The only thing that is good about it is the animation. Most of the jokes are lame and immature. The show feels like it is trying too hard to be edgy. The characters are really unlikeable. The only adult thing about this show it the cursing and sex jokes. The sad thing is, I had hoped it would be good. The first poster I saw gave me a bit of hope but I ended up getting disappointed. I don't know what is more disappointing. The fact that this show is awful or that it could have been good. There are so many ways that could make this show somewhat tolerable. Even adding scooby may have helped it out."
1.0,"Jan 17, 2023","1.its a different show with a Scooby-Doo skin on it. You take the characters change them to not be Scooby-Doo inspired then you get the same show with a lot of Scooby-Doo references.

2. Why not just make a new show instead of banking that Scooby-Doo references will make due and that swearing is going to make it funnier because a Scooby-Doo person said it.

3. Fred fight fought a demon but here.. how the mighty have fallen.

4. No Scooby-Doo just a stupid teaser that was not even a person or a living thing.

5. Velma is not the worst thing Scooby-Doo could of been better if you made a adult Scooby-Doo instead of a show wearing fan favorite characters clothes and names just to hit that one demographic."
1.0,"Jan 17, 2023","The show itself could have been a thing about Scooby-Doo in another universe or something. Even then it would be bad but it also wouldn't have the storm of Scooby-Doo fans (such as myself)taking a dump on this show. Firstly, the writing sucks. It's trying to so hard to be funny, quirky, and relatable but it is not. And the constant reminder of everyone's ethnicity when they are trying to not make you see color is redundant. Secondly, the characters are unbearable. You've probably heard this one before but they are nothing like how they should be. Velma is annoying. Daphne is mean all of a sudden. Fred is a whiny baby. And Norville is just a loser. I could go on but I have other things to do. Don't waste your time on this show."
1.0,"Jan 19, 2023","I applaud the show for diversity and inclusion. All types of people are represented. The show also takes a more adult turn in violence, language etc. But the characters, performances and plot remain at the cartoon level, So if you are looking for a better representation of LGBTQ+A1& you will find it here, but not much more. In terms of would I let children watch the show, they will gain the diversity from this show but I doubt they will be entertained. Maybe it will help garner support for activists and causes, but in terms of entertainment, I don't think so. So again, it hits all Ps and Qs for justice, but not much more."
1.0,"Jan 22, 2023","The main problem with this show are the characters! None of them are likable, in anyway. And, Velma is the worst. As a woman, watching this annoying, self proclaiming feminist, teenage detective awkwardly walking into ridiculous situations, I cringed through most of the episodes. Velma has the most backstory and depth out of all the characters, but none of it really explains her behavior. All the other characters are vapid. And, where are the funny lines? It's supposed to be adult comedy! I rolled my eyes a few times, but I didn't laugh once. The writers need to focus more on the actual story and less on Velma's pointless antics.

There are a couple of decent mystery buried beneath all the crap. That's what kept me watching and hoping that the show would improve. But, it seems like the plot moves too slowly with each episode, because the writers were to busy trying to amp up Velma's character into this super sleuth feminist.......always trying to teach the audience a lesson about how society treats women. This show is for adults. We don't need to learn these lessons. The writers need to decide who their audience is: teen girls who need to learn these lessons or adults who've already had experience. They can't mix the raunchy stuff with the life lessons. It's annoying to the audience; it doesn't work. My advice: hire new writers and make it a truly adult show."
1.0,"Jan 17, 2023",This show is actual dog water. There is no way any producer in their right mind thought this would be a good idea. The show was created for people who relate more to Velma than they do the rest of the original cast. The only problem with that is Velma has zero sense of humor zero character or personality to work with. This show completely undermines the beauty of the classic kids show scooby doo. It tries to be an edgy comedy but comedy is definitely the wrong word for it. I get third wall brakes are in but that doesn't mean every show needs to backbone on that concept... if I could sum of the show and one word it would be... cringe. 0 stars.
10.0,"Jan 21, 2023","This is one of the worst things I have ever watched. Why these people got to completely defile a much loved cartoon by millions of peoples. These people could not create something new, so they did what they do best and destroyed something that was great.

Velma"" is the worst animated TV series that I have seen in my entire life. The iconic character from the ""Scooby-Doo"" franchise has been made so cringy that makes it physically ill to the stomach. The show offers the ultimate worst take on the all the beloved character.

The writing of the show is also garbage, offering nothing of a gripping storyline that keeps the viewers engaged throughout. The characters must have been developed by a malfunctioning AI, and the dialogue is just pure cringe, making fun of the audience.

The best part of this is there is no Scooby-Doo. At least the beloved dog has been spared from the embarrassment and humiliation.

Overall, ""Velma"" is a never-watch for anyone who is sane."
1.0,"Jan 27, 2023","Everyone is hating on this show because they want it to be something it's not. Its pretty funny, and it made me and my girlfriend laugh a bunch throughout the first two episodes. The animation is great, and the adult theming of the show makes it a very different take on Scooby-Doo that I liked getting to experience. Mindy does a good job as velma and Glenn Howerton is great as Fred. The way they wrote Shaggy had us dying too. The only thing thats bummed me out so far is the lack of an actual Scooby-Doo, but its just starting so who knows, maybe he'll show up. Give it a chance, don't just read the reviews. I liked it."
2.0,"Feb 12, 2023","May be a rush to judgment after only watching two episodes, but ' Velma ' isn't worth the cost. The problem isn't that the original kids show we grew up with has been reinvented. It's that it doesn't know what it's supposed to be reinvented into in the first place.

Velma is the only one on the show with any character at all. Daphne is the mean girl whom is the antagonist. Fred is a spoiled rich white kid struggling with masculinity. There is no Shaggy. Now it's Norville. An irrelevant character struggling with being irrelevant. No Scooby Do ( at least not yet ) . Apparently the iconic talking dog is a waste of production time. There is a mystery to be solved, but it doesn't have to be. Dead body, move on. The jokes are funny, but seem out of place in every scene.

Was expecting ' CSI ' meets ' Archer '. Instead got ' Southpark ' meets ' 90210 ' . It's not a prequel about how the Scooby Doo gang got together. It's about watching absurdity ensue for a whole season, while we wait until Velma and Daphne are done pretending losing their virginity to each other is going to be a challenge."

And to boot if you hate the source material so much then why dont you create your own characters the nice thing about the scooby gang was that they each played there role and each had there own weaknesses the other covered.

Maybe into a different line of work.."
1.0,"Jan 21, 2023","It's the origin story of Velma Dinkley (Mindy Kaling) before she helps form Mystery Incorporated. It's the rundown Crystal Cove High. Velma hates everybody. Her mother is mysteriously missing and she has a phobia about solving mysteries. Her former friend Daphne got hot and dumped her. Self-obsessed Fred barely remembers her. Popular girl Brenda is brutally murdered and Velma is immediately the prime suspect. Norville ""Shaggy"" Rogers is her only friend.

This is one referencing joke after another. It seems to be trying to take down modern popular youth culture, and the Scooby-Doo gang itself. I don't think this show likes these characters or generally anybody. It's a constant stream of digs and ugliness. This is going to bug real Scooby fans. I choose to see this as an alternate universe. They are the Bizarro Scooby gang. It becomes better after one makes peace with that premise. I am interested in the mystery and some of the sarcastic jokes are almost funny. The biggest problem is that Velma is a horrible friend. This is not a friendly group and she is the worst of them. I can take a lot of this, but I can't not liking these characters. I don't like this Velma. This alternate universe would be more appealing if this group is actually good friends and Velma is her nicer self. There is a piling on for this to be the worst show ever. This is bad, but I won't add on negative points to be a part of the bandwagon.

Edit: Wow! They are doing a second season. It could be courage, but I think that it's more a middle finger to all the haters. Maybe they will make Velma nice this time. Don't hold your breath."

But Fred was awful, the nudity is gross and weird, Sam Richardson makes no sense as shaggy, the jokes are cringe - ok I'm watching it right now and Velma was just listing off types of people and she goes ""a spicy-a meatball italian"".

If rumors are true that it was to be its own thing and not Scooby Doo related at all it might help. A little. Not a lot. Its still needlessly cynical, stupid, and poorly written.

Unless they come with some amazing completely unexpected twist this will go down as one of the worst adaptations/ interpretations of any popular series of all time. And just so people know i couldn't care less if they switch peoples race/gender/sexuality thats not even an issue. A fresh take on things can be interesting a lot of times. Unfortunately this is not the case here."
1.0,"Feb 12, 2023","Production is ok, script is mediocre, the overall impression is ""it tries to be one of that new adult cartoons of the new wave, but does not quite hit it"".

The characters are remade to appeal the audience in consonance with the internet jokes/stereotypes circulating about them for ages (stoner / white golden boy / white golden girl).

The ""childhood fans"" are furious due to vulgarity and all the changes, the newcoming adult audience does not quite get it due to humor being a bit dull and the script lacking, the teenage audience doesn't get it at all.

It doesn't have a lot of undeserved 10/10s to begin with, so I have no idea why there are thousands of undeserved 1/10s."
1.0,"Jan 16, 2023","Scooby-Doo is the second Hanna-Barbera creation that has been exploited too much and they decided to try to get more juice out of it with this series. Velma was made as an attempted prequel to how the gang was built when that had already been done in the third live action Scooby-Doo. This series aims to be a different origin story, but with creative decisions that instead of making it canonical, rather turn it into a reboot that takes place in a parallel reality. The franchise has varied in different ways in the franchise, but without straying from the original material. Even though the series Be Cool, Scooby-Doo! It was not well received, at least it was a parody that was not derived as much from the original material. Velma, on the other hand, is a different case whose only relationship with the franchise is its names, elements and references.

The hate towards the series is irrational, but ironically most of the negative reviews have a good reason why this series doesn't quite work. To begin with, what is acceptable is the animation and a couple of elements and references to the original series. The plot about Velma's investigation to solve the mystery of the murders and the disappearance of her mother showed enough potential for this series to be a good prequel. Also Daphne's desire to know what happened to her biological parents would have contributed a lot. In those aspects, the series could have worked as a good prequel, but the conflict lies in the creative decisions that were made. Velma makes the same mistake that Thundercats Roar made and that is clearly being a different series that only takes names and some elements from Scooby-Doo. Velma might have been more acceptable as an original series, but its sin is being part of the Scooby-Doo franchise. The adult humor and tone is something that could have made the series more interesting, but it doesn't show much of a change.

Velma has a design that does not work and is quite far from the original Velma, showing a rather prejudiced and self-centered personality. Daphne's change in her design is not that serious and here she has the elements of the typical popular girl. Daphne and Velma have a chemistry that could have been deepened more, but instead they both demonstrate a toxic attitude. Velma is the one who proves to be the most toxic. Fred has an acceptable design that at least respects the original Fred, but his personality is another matter. Here Fred is the typical rich and popular high school boy who only thinks about himself. Norville is clearly an original character, but many have seen him as a recreation of Shaggy. That's because Norville wears Shaggy's outfit, but it's clearly not him because it's an original character that was created to take his place. Only Norville's father looks like Shaggy. The relationship between the characters is quite conflictive without that air of teamwork that characterized the characters of the franchise.

Some dialogue and some adult jokes feel unnecessary. The series ends up self-parodying and doesn't take itself seriously. In fact, Velma is more of a series that makes fun of itself and its own characters. The protagonist even feels like a joke that does not seek to be taken seriously even though she seems that way. This series is very much in the style of Generation Z, but it is something that does not quite fit well with the Scooby-Doo franchise and would have been better as an original series unrelated to the franchise.

As a final conclusion, Velma did have the potential to be a good prequel, but they wasted the opportunity to present a fascinating origin story and resulted in a very mediocre series that is only funny because of how absurd it is. At least it had an interesting crime and mystery story behind it, but unfortunately there is no doubt that this series is the most inferior installment of the Scooby-Doo franchise. My rating for this series is a 5/10."
9.0,"Jan 17, 2023","Sometimes is hard to reimagine a childhood classic, but I think they are getting good at it here.

It keeps some nostalgic stuff as easter eggs but goes into a complete different direction. Reminds a humor from The Office or What We Do In The Shadows, not for everyone but if you like that, you'll enjoy this.

If you're watching this thinking it will be like watching Scooby Doo as a kid, you're in the wrong place. Keeping in mind it's a reimagination of a classic and not the same thing is the key to enjoy this.

We complain all the time about reboots and lack of boldness on trying new stuff, here they are trying and I think they deserve the chance."

Come on people can we be a bit smarter please?, characterization velma is now a snarky, preachy sarcastic wanna be that cant pick up on clues and dares to say she is the worlds greatest detective.

1.0,"Mar 1, 2023",I watched the whole series there was some funny parts and I took it as what it was supposed to be a funny take off on Scooby Doo and set in this day and age. You watch Sealab 2021 or Harvey Birdman I think that's what she thought she was doing mixed with the venture brothers meta humor. I think what I came away with is it was more a stand up routine that you would expect her to do on a stage quick rifts self deprecating yarns shots at her heritage being a woman. Being a woman of color. And near the end especially. All the villain's were white men and white men kept her from being all that. Making fun of straight white older men is such an easy shot now. But that's where she is and probably will always be and she will always blame straight white men because she didnt get what she thought she deserved.
1.0,"Feb 28, 2023","I'll be blunt. Everything everyone says is true. It's really that bad, and then some and then some more. That being said, people are just lying if they say there's *nothing* redeemable about this show. The animation alone is worth the three stars. It was fun, stylized, and dynamic, while also feeling familiar to cartoon network's brand (I know it's not a ""Cartoon Network "" show, but Hannah Barbera & Cartoon Network have been hand in hand for so long that, to me, it felt coherent visually). Any decent humor from this show comes from visual gags, a good amount of which were laugh out loud funny. The animators of Velma need credit for all of their insane work making Mindy Kaling's nast show leagues better than what it could've been. Imagine a world where Velma looks like another Family Guy ripoff? Or Rick and Morty? Things could have been worse. So don't say you don't have nothing this Thanksgiving. I gave you an idea. Anyways. I hope these artists can move on to better projects soon."
1.0,"Mar 2, 2023","Often times when someone tries to do a 'hot new take!' on an already existing IP by giving it a gritty or edgy spin, they fail to do their homework and realize that A; It's been done before and B; It wasn't hugely popular then either. I'm by no means saying nobody wants an Adult Scooby-Doo. What I am saying is that 'Edgy' walks a razor's edge between Adult/Gritty and middle-school syndrome. This... feels like the later.

The animation is very cool, the plot (two episodes out now) is serviceable, and the characters are interesting. The writing, however, is decidedly cringe. Sometimes entertaining... but cringe. It's one of those things where when it's good it's good, but when it's bad you'll be rolling your eyes or groaning. And this is more of a PSA for any aspiring writers, but if anyone tells your your characters need to give obvious exposition about every scenario as it happens then PLEASE slap them and keep writing what you were doing. There are no less than four lines of dialogue in each episode I could think of removing that would have made it more enjoyable if the characters hadn't been saying what was blatantly obvious. RESPECT. YOUR. AUDIENCE.

Now to get some of the obvious things out of the way. The first scene was high school girls showering. A fair amount of skin is shown but no genitalia. If that is enough to make you uncomfortable than skip past it as it doesn't really come up again after the first seven-ish minutes of the show, or skip the show entirely if it's something you aren't comfortable with. If awkwardly fumbled 'dialogue' on tropes and race swapping that reads more like the writing team having a circle-jerk isn't your deal, skip the whole first half of the first episode. I will say it gets better, but the first ten-ish minutes is a one-two punch of this.

Now onto what I thought was good. While the writing does a bit to muddy the waters, the overall plot of the show is solid and characters react in fairly realistic ways to their problems as weird teenagers would. There are a handful of bait-and-switch moments in the show that serve the plot well and keep you invested, though I will say I think these happen a bit too fast and could have been played out a bit better. I enjoy the added danger of Velma having these sort of super-ptsd moments about mysteries that (according to her at least) could kill her! It adds to the stakes of the characters and makes the audience feel just a bit more invested in the thrill of the narrative.

I will admit to some bias having started watching the show only AFTER reading so many negative reviews online. That said, if you do your research on who is making the show not much of it is very surprising and is more or less what I would have expected. Don't go into this expecting Scooby-Doo because it's not. That said... I'm not sure what it's SUPPOSED to be yet. An origin story for sure, but it feels like the show is trying to do a few too many things and they all just sit on top of each other. If you can get past the Cringe dialogue, the half-hearted attempts to appeal to nostalgia (check out the backgrounds in each scene and you'll see throwbacks to previous shows), and the complete recharacterization of the Mystery Gang... then you can still have a decent time.

Final Verdict; Not everyone will like the show. It was designed to create controversy and get people talking about it (There is no such thing as Bad Publicity after all) and by being upset you're doing exactly what the creators told HBO it would do when it was greenlit. If you want the show to die, stop talking about it or cancel your subscription to HBO. Personally, I'll hold out and see where it goes because I am basically immune to cringe. I think disliking the show is a valid opinion to have and at the end of the day do what you will with your time and money."
1.0,"Jan 16, 2023","While I did not enjoy watching this show. I thought the premise was an interesting and possibly engaging one. Many once popular children's shows have seen their statuses fall. As their former audiences reach adulthood and they fail to engage newer generations of viewers. This could have been a springboard for other shows/franchises to take a similar route. Unfortunately, I thought the show was rather boring. I watched the first two episodes and can't really remember a thing about them. They weren't really funny, and the plots/mysteries weren't interesting enough for me to engage me. How disappointing."
1.0,"Jan 21, 2023","Like others have said it's an ok series so far. The series looks like it's supposed to be a parody of the Riverdale modernisation/faux turning classic property into an edgy type of show and a satire on modern reboots as a whole. It's too bad it doesn't really lean into that aspect and basically turns into long winded observational comedy instead as a more straight up parody would have been a better idea for this kind of show and Scooby Doo would be an ideal property to do it with. The problem is other than a few scooby doo references here and there it doesn't really lean on the source material at all.

It's humour is pretty on the nose and it spends a lot of time explaining why something should or shouldn't work in either the genre or in scooby doo which in my opinion are the worst jokes in the series. They should trust their audience more and let the jokes do their work. Christine Wu and Glenn Howerton kill it as their respective characters and deliver a funny performance though even they can't make the medicore writing pop anymore than they have to. Mindy Kaling delivers the worste performance among the main cast which is understandable since she isn't a voice actor. She is trying but her timing just feels off and her deliveries don't really work. Sam Robinson does a fine job, but he hasn't really had that many time to deliver anything other than a decent performance.

All in all the series should have taken better advantage of the genre and trust their jokes a little more it's mediocre so far but interesting enough to keep watching."
1.0,"Jan 17, 2023","As is often the case with controversial releases, the new animated series ""Velma"" has been the subject of blatant and unobjective review-bombing, so I suggest you take the current 1.3 out of 10 user-average with more than a few grains of salt. It's definitely not a 1.3 out of 10 show. But at the same time, I also have to admit that sadly... it ain't great, either.

Mindy Kaling leads an excellent voice-cast in this adult-oriented reimagining of the Scooby-Doo franchise that sees our favorite characters as younger, modern teens. Now, I'm sure the concept alone will repulse certain people, but I actually was pretty into it. I thought the idea had a certain charm, and the concept of a Scooby-Doo reboot aimed at older audiences is fun. (I still wish we could see James Gunn's original vision for the live-action film.)

Unfortunately in execution, the series is thus-far all over the place. There's far too much reliance on tired sex-gags and weird visual jokes that come out of nowhere. (A sequence involving a baby kicking in a pregnant woman's stomach being a prime example of a joke that just doesn't work.) And the non-stop fourth-wall breaking meta-humor can become quite aggravating at times. Meta-humor is something you have to nail, or else it comes across as shallow. You can't just have the characters make the same ""If this was a TV show, this is the part where XXX!"" joke every two minutes and expect audiences to laugh every time.

Additionally, even as a proud liberal who firmly believes that diversity and representation is very important... this show goes about it in the worst way possible. It just clumsily beats you over the head with it, then tries to cover for its sloppiness with more meta-humor. There's absolutely no problem with Velma being Indian American in this show, but rather than leave well-enough alone, it's treated as some sort-of grandiose reveal, and they actually have a character give a fourth-wall speech about how it's totally okay. Which just kind of makes it feel... icky.

That being said, there are some good things here, and if the show does move forward with a second season, I'm hoping it can improve. The cast does very well with what they have to work with, and the voices fit perfectly. Character designs are typically solid and the animation is decent. (Some lip-synching issues notwithstanding.) And I even think the central storyline has some promise.

But as it stands now, ""Velma"" is dragged down by its flaws. Will it improve in the future? Who knows. All I know is that at this point in time, after two episodes, I can only give it a slightly below average 4 out of 10. Not the worst thing ever, and some people might enjoy it. But very mediocre."
1.0,"Mar 3, 2023","I was suspicious of an adult show because I love Scooby Doo, and I was worried that people wouldn't let their kids watch regular scooby doo if there was an adult version. Overall, it's very crass and sexualized. The R-rating is not what bothers me- it's the blatant disregard for the original characters.

My husband and I decided to watch as if it was not associated with Scooby Doo whatsoever, and we actually enjoyed it. It's crazy and over the top humor, which we like. However, I don't want to give more than 3 stars because it is so different than the original.

I hope that this show doesn't turn new families off of scooby for their kids. If the names were different, no one would know it's supposed to be the scooby gang."
9.0,"Jan 24, 2023","First of, I'm a fan of the original Scooby-Doo series, as well as many previous Scooby-Doo incarnations before this one. With that said, I LOVE THIS SHOW! I think it's brilliant. The humor is spot on, very funny. Sharp and edgy jokes. The style of the comedy kind of reminds me of ""Duckman: Private Dick and Family Man"". The story continue in every episode threw the whole season, which I like. And the story is good. It has a lot of Scooby-Doo and Hanna-Barbera references threw the show, and I big sucker for stuff like that. It has a really fresh and creative take on the Scooby-Doo franchise. So mad props for that, for being brave and not afraid to change it up. It's also a origin story of the Scooby-gang, where we get to see how they all get together. I highly recommend this show for anyone who like nostalgic stuff but with a new take on it, and people who like comedy that is sharp and edgy in the same way as shows and movies like ""The Simpsons"", ""Duckman: Private Dick and Family Man"", and ""Family Guy"" and ""Fat Pizza"". It's must see TV in my book! Crossing my fingers for many new seasons of this funny, funny show."
1.0,"Jan 16, 2023","While I understand the reasons why this show is so hated, but after going into it with a completely neutral outlook (trying not to think of Mindy Kaling's self-insertion, not being swayed by the opinions of people I respect, etc), it's really not that bad. A bit below neutral, in my opinion. But I can't put 4.5 out of 10 on this site. The problem with the show is they try so hard to be self aware, and it makes it so that they are totally not self aware at all. I did get a couple laughs out of this, and it's entertaining enough to finish this season. I may or may not watch season 2 because the show is not so great as to keep me gripped to see more. I am interested in the mystery. I am only four episodes in, and I plan to finish it within a day or two. So, these are pluses in my book. Like I said, I understand why people really dislike the show, but I don't think it's just terrible as people are claiming it to be. I don't think it should be green lighted into season 2, but because of all the hate watching, it's doing numbers, so we probably will get another season. If we do, I'm hoping the writers become a little bit more self aware than they are now. I hope they understand the formula they are working with is not appealing to the masses. This show has created a history where conservatives and liberals can come together and say the show sucks. That's another positive, I guess?"
1.0,"Jun 12, 2023","Velma is the latest Scooby doo show (without Scooby), that takes a highly different approach, and while there are things in this show that can feel too over the top and comedy that falls flat, Velma succeeds quite a bit in having a fun tone, and some genuinely decent moments.

The good in this show I'll start with is the humor, yes not all of it lands, but that's kinda expected from comedy shows. Velma has a lot of funny moments. Some so over the top and dumb that I actually had a laugh out of me. Mindy Kaling as Velma is actually pretty good for the most part, as is the other cast who also give solid performances. The animation is clean, and I like the tone of the show. I like that it is more adult and it does succeed for the most part.

Now this is far from a perfect show. Some of the comedy can be too much. It feels like it's reaching far out of its own grasp. There's far too much satire that can get old after a while. The show also feels like it isn't sure what it wants to be. The tone like I said I like, but it also tries too hard to actual be creepy, and it does fail at it. Some side plots feel rather unnecessary, and some of the character changes feel weird.

Overall Velma is flawed, and doesn't quit know what it wants to be yet, but it's not that bad. It's fun, funny, and does have potential. As of right now, I actually don't mind it."
1.0,"Jan 18, 2023","I don't absolutely hate it as much as most people, I was disappointed when I first started watching ""Velma"". I had expected and wanted it to be a good, more adult version of Scooby-Doo but no it isn't anything like that. So once I began thinking of it as a completely separate thing I found it was ok. Some episodes are definitely much better than others but altogether I like it enough to continue watching it, some bits are funny in my opinion. I gave 5/10 stars because yes, I like it enough to watch it but it straying so far away from ""Scooby-Doo"" has me still wishing they hadn't and that they had it at least somewhat like the original but just more grown-up."
1.0,"Jan 22, 2023","The writing team deserves a huge round of applause.

Every single one of them is clearly trying their hardest to give this their absolute best. You can really feel their effort in every single line.

Mindy Kaling's personality shines brightly through the characters and the story line. Every bit of Scooby-ness that we grew up with is now just pre-Kaling. She has made the Scooby-verse unapologetically her own and all I can say is, Kaling is now cannon, deal with it.

Unfortunately, despite their laudable efforts, the story and characters consistently fall flat. I am absolutely certain that every one of their moms feel incredibly proud of them right now. But for the rest of us, it's just an awkward Kaling-fest."
1.0,"Jan 20, 2023","...which presumably sums up the meeting in which this show got a green light.

I'm halfway through episode 1 and so far it is playing EXACTLY like someone watched Harley Quinn and thought, I could apply this formula to any cartoon from my childhood. Honestly, the Scooby-Doo format has already been mined for so much comedy as it is. The movies self-parodied, Adult Swim has had multiple shows that poked fun at the standard tropes, Jay and Silent Bob got the gang high, so on and so on.

The sad thing is, the cast is crammed full of people who have made legitimately good comedy. Everything that might work in this show has already been done way better somewhere else."
1.0,"Jan 18, 2023","I gotta say the animation is indeed, good when it is not trying to mimick the popular adult animation style popularised by Big Mouth and trying to do its own thing. It's just a shame that the animators had to use their talent on something like this. It could have been so much better but instead it feels like a lame parody made on youtube that is supposed to be a bizarre take on the source material rather than a sincere adaption of it. Given how hate-watching has given this show so much clout, it is bound to get at least a season more and it's a shame HBO max is using their resources on this and cancelling shows like Final Space.

3/5 for the animation.

0/5 for everything else."
1.0,"Jan 17, 2023","I think this is actually one of the best animated ""Scooby doo"" shows that is out there right now. I have been watching Scooby doo all my life and I always wanted a origin story of the whole gang before they were friends. I also love how they made it is a tv-ma show they have never made a Tv-ma Scooby do before and they did a really good job at making a violnt show to. I would like it to have more swearing and a bit more blood but they made a good balence of blood and swearing for now. I really hope they do make a season 2. If they do make a season 2 I hope the gang gets together and solves mystery's with the violence that is in this show."
1.0,"Jan 16, 2023","Velma (2023) does not deserve the extreme backlash it has gotten from the online community, much less deserve it simply because it is perceived as ""woke."" It being ""woke"" is not the issue, but I will get to it in a moment. But before that, I want to concentrate my efforts over some of the positives that the show has.

Firstly, the animation, when compared to all the other adult-oriented comedy animated series, it doesn't attempt to be a Family Guy or Rick and Morty clone in either its visual or writing style. The animation is decently pleasant to look at, with the style especially being unique and cute, which isn't a thing that I could remark for most adult animation released nowadays. I also believe the voice acting for the most part is competent, nobody really having anything too bad going for them. The way the characters are portrayed is decent enough, nothing too bad as many internet reviewers would let you to believe.

However, let's get to the real and fundamental flaw of the show, which is its humor. Not its sense of humor and its topics, but simply the way it's executed. To me, at least, it feels less like it has a joke or a punching commentary on sexism, particularly when it comes to tropes on TV, but rather statements that aren't delivered in a funny way, me only being able to nod along awkwardly and tell myself ""yeah, I guess Velma is right about this one trope"", and the comedic timing itself is practically non-existent. This results in a really hard to watch show for both those who agree with the creator's political leanings and especially for those who do not agree, its way of delivering the humor unfortunately perfectly feeding into anti-""woke"" crusades. (Now, this isn't the fault of the show creators individually, I cannot blame them).

Overall, I believe there was some genuine effort put into it and it doesn't feel like yet another Family Guy or Rick and Morty clone, and the humor comes from a good place, but its delivery is less humorous as it is reading off of a dictionary for ""sexist tropes on TV"" in a slightly snarky way. And it could've been better."
8.0,"Jan 19, 2023","I have only casually watched the Mystery Inc./Scooby Doo franchise so I'm not super invested in the franchise but even I know that this show is so far removed from the source material that's it's kinda ridiculous. This might have worked if the creators just incorporated this story and it's characters into an original series instead of trying to bait the audience by using the characters an existing one. The show brings nothing new to the table. The dialogue is forgettable, the characters are hollow tropes and the animation style is- well actually the animation is pretty good. It's not unwatchable, it's just something to watch if you have nothing better to do."
1.0,"Jan 19, 2023","So I'd been watching this, as well as Scooby Doo Mystery Inc which is also a more modern (way less dark/""controversial"") than this show. But I decided to check them out side by side fairly. Mystery Inc updates SD but no race swapping or tv ma content, it's a lot more like the original for sure. Scooby-Doo is still in it, basically just newer SD. This show has A lot of content that feels like it's not really scooby doo. But after like 3~4 episodes I don't think it's anything that terrible or even unfunny. It's not a gore fest, it's not strictly cringe jokes, I can watch this show and enjoy it. I think if this just wasn't part of the scooby franchise, it would be like an amped up ""Clone High"" (underrated adult cartoon from the 2000s). IMO just the ""transformation"" pisses people off. So far though, I have not found anything truly offensive. Maybe in later episodes, which I will check out.. no reason to not even try this show. Check it out for yourself."
1.0,"Jan 18, 2023","Obviously, with no scoob this show automatically can't be as good as hoped. With that separation, you cannot go into this show or continue past episode 1 without at least being open minded to the new concept. I hated the 1st episode at first because I had NO IDEA. Once you realize it's more like an adult swim slapstick kind of thing, it's much easier on the emotions and actually pretty enjoyable on some ""late night chill"" type.

Other than that, people are WAY TOO tightly wrapped. Blow some smoke, loosen up and remember what having a sense of humor is. The gung-ho stuff for old show is wild.

With that said, this show is still mediocre at best. It has very cool animation, and there are funny moments, but there is def something missing. That's probably scooby. 5-6 at best."
1.0,"Jan 21, 2023","It seems to me that the benefit of using a preexisting IP for a new series would be the fanbase, but ""Velma"" seems to hold contempt for its own IP, the fans of the original shows, and the spirit of whimsical mystery that Scooby Doo had is almost all of its incarnations. I feel bad for the voice actors and artists, who all did their best, but ultimately a show's quality comes down to its writing and execution, and between jokes that either don't land or are downright insulting (why mock adults who watch cartoons in an adult cartoon), and characters who are terrible to each other... this is bad."
1.0,"Feb 12, 2023","It gives a new take and is a bit more inclusive with stuff. And I find it childish and demeaning to compare someone's work and effort to the og Scooby Doo shows. Because the title is Velma, it's about her and everyone's changes they're going through. Not just a bunch of teenagers and a dog solving mysteries and unmasking weirdos. But about them finding more about themselves and finding out about a serial murderer. So I think anyone who compares it to the OG Scooby gang just have a limited and superficial response to the show. I grew up and watched Scooby Doo, but never compared it to it, because it's not it. It's Velma, and needs to be seen as that. Not seen as a ""SCOOBY DOO REMAKE"". It's not a remake it more of just a reuse of a place and characters, but with a different story and plot. It's for fun and giggles. Not for comparing or to bring the old gang back. But to make something new out of them. So I like it, and won't be changing my view on it. And honestly believe people should be more open minded. It's not like how they ruined teen titans and made teen titan go, that right there is a real monstrosity."
1.0,"Jan 18, 2023","Whilst not resembling Scooby doo of old (Even going so far as to remove the iconic dog as a whole) Velma isn't as bad as people are saying.

Velma has some pretty great art direction, feeling like a blend between the Cal arts style best known for shows like ""Steven Universe"" and ""Gravity Falls"" and the art style of ""Family Guy"".

Velma's comedy isn't what I'd call welcoming to new comers. Definitely feeling rough around the edges for people who aren't used to it, but I can thankfully say that it grows on you. The meta-humor present in the first episode quickly falls to the back burner there on out (Which is where I think it should stay) in favor of more traditional jokes that rely on character interactions, well written dialogue, or using the animated format to deliver the punch line.

The story is far from perfect, being the weakest part of this show in my opinion. The over-arching mystery seems to take a back burner in favor of more small scale story that are loosely connected through an over arching story.

I think the characters take time to come into their own. With personalities far from their traditional depiction, the cast can be hard to enjoy, but thankfully they become more enjoyable to watch on screen around episode 3.

In conclusion I don't think Velma is deserving of a 1 star or to be dubbed as ""The worst show ever"" a phrase that's been used by a lot of frustrated fans of the franchise. I do however, think that this show is far from perfect, but can still provide some decent entertainment for casual enjoys of the Scooby-doo franchise."
1.0,"Feb 19, 2023","So, I've watched the first two episodes and I'm going to say something blasphemous: it's not that terrible.

Don't get me wrong, it's not good, but it has that stupid 'adult swim' style humor that was popular a decade or two ago. The blatant changes in the characters helps to send the signal that these are not the characters you're accustmed to, but this cartoon universe's stupid alternative. It's the 'Scary Movie' version of Scooby Doo.

I think the mistake was in how the show somehow got marketed as a serious Scooby Doo spinoff instead of the intentionally dumb spoof that it is.

This is not the type of show that is meant to be disected under a microscope to see how it violates canon - the fact that it so violently steers away from the canon material is part of the joke.

Thankfully, I knew this was going to be awful, going in, so it softened the blow and allows me to judge it differently."
1.0,"Jan 21, 2023","Velma (2023) is a series that my daughter and I finished watching on HBOMAX this past week. The storyline follows Velma and her friends in High School before they were friends. Velma's mom has gone missing and she's on a mission to find her even though everyone assumes her mom was murdered and is long gone. When a new killer emerges that decapitates people and takes their brains people are even less likely to help her. Can Velma thwart these obstacles and discover what really happened to her mom?

This series was created by Charlie Grandy (The Office) and contains the voices of Mindy Kaling (The Office), Glenn Howerton (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia), Sam Richardson (We're the Millers), Constance Wu (Crazy Rich Asians) and Wanda Sykes (Monster-in-Law).

This series got off to a great start with solid animation, fresh depiction of the characters, some worthwhile gore and even a splash of nudity here and there. I also enjoyed the various references to the old series, especially the Captain Caveman sequence, which made me smile. Unfortunately, the comedic content gets more bland over time, the love stories didn't work for me and there needed to be more cool murders.

Overall, this was very average despite having all of the ingredients to be so much better. I would score this a 5/10 but still recommend seeing it once.

------------------------

My daughter and I just finished Velma Season 2 (2024) on MAX. The storyline picks up where Season 1 left off: Fred is adjusting to losing his mom, Velma is adjusting to her mom being back, and Velma and Daphne are in a relationship. Meanwhile, there seems to be some brain switching going on around town, which appears to be a scientific experiment called Project Scooby.

This series was created by Charlie Grandy, a writer for The Daily Show, The Office, and Saturday Night Live. It also features the voices of Mindy Kaling (The Office), Glenn Howerton (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia), Sam Richardson (We're the Millers), and Constance Wu (Crazy Rich Asians).

I would say this season is about the same as the first in most ways. The animation is solid and entertaining. I'm one of the few who doesn't mind the changes they made to the characters, but these changes always make me wonder why they decided to keep it Scooby-Doo related instead of making it its own series. I preferred the monster elements of Season 1 over the science fiction brain-swapping plot of Season 2. The introduction of Scrappy was a huge miss, and they could have picked a better voice for his character. There were some elements of the ending reveal I liked and some I disliked.

In conclusion, Velma Season 2 is as hit-or-miss as Season 1. I would score this a 5/10 and only recommend it with appropriate expectations."
1.0,"Jan 17, 2023","I've heard all the awful things about this show, but out of boredom and a recent subscription to Max, I decided to give it a go. After four episodes, that was more than enough. If they wanted to do a parody of Scooby Doo and the gang, okay, sure, but they should have distanced themselves a little further. They try to be close to the original IP, while also being far from it. They should have changed a few more names and distanced itself from Scooby Doo even more and it might have been better. Honestly, I don't think it can be saved. It wasn't funny, it wasn't interesting, just a plain bore. There is no way I could force myself to watch the rest of the episodes. I don't mind adult animations and I've watched some bad ones, but this one was definitely one of the worst. It certainly should not be linked to a beloved children's classic, it's no wonder they didn't want Scooby Doo himself anywhere near this. I can't imagine who all sat around a table and thought this was a good idea for not only one season, but two. I was frankly surprised by some of the names in the cast list, how they didn't mind their names being on this piece of work."

I've been a fan of scooby doo since I was a child and this should still be given the credit it deserves.

Clearly it's not meant to be your average Scooby Doo so just don't go in expecting that. It's a different story so you can't compare it to the old ones.

No problems with the way they filled in the characters ethnic background; they never had much strong identity that way in the original, so it feels more like learning more about old characters rather than them being replaced. The humor comes mostly from satire of other tv shows; I would like to see more character-based humor that is funny without knowing the cliches of other shows. It does not deserve the hate campaign that the internet dregs have laid on it. If you are a fan of Scooby Doo, you will love the show.

And no, it does not have Scooby in it except for easter eggs and brief references, but that is because of legal copyright issues only. Scooby would have stolen the show from Velma for sure, in any event, if he was there."

3.0,"Jan 18, 2023","This show is hilarious. It's not a documentary. It's an over-the-top comedy. Relax. The first episode was a little slow, but it got some solid laughs in. The original is a show about four pothead kids driving around and solving mysteries with a talking dog. This new version is basically one characters self-involved take of what happens. It's an origin story as told by the most overlooked character. Only fools would expect it to be identical to the original. All the hate-hype about this seems like it's coming from people who didn't appreciate or even understand the original. Mysteries= check, drugs= check, Free love= check... It's the same show with less innuendo."
8.0,"Feb 24, 2023","I really liked it.

Please continue producing more of it.

Verry nicely produced, providing another story line and point off view.

An easy going. Something nice to calm and just watch.

May not fit all the ages but for adults is suitable.

Suitable for adults that used to watch Scooby doo and now they grow up.

Wish we had more series of that type.

I don't think any one should get offended by it. It's ok not to like it, but if you don't like it just don't watch.

For those who haven't watched it yet I suggest to try.

Can wait to see how the story line will develop, until now I enjoy it a lot."
1.0,"Feb 12, 2023","Best show ive seen in a while. Scooby doo is always so great, I actually liked it. Personally interested in it. The characters are a little weird but not that hard to swallow.

The fact that I couldn't wait the next day to be finally be able to see the next episode means something to me. I just went into it not expecting too much and it's enjoyable. As long as you don't treat it too seriously. I did laugh at a few jokes as well, and I'm very picky with my comedy.

Also, I gotta give credit on the hallucination parts. They really were scary. But most of all? This show made me interested enough to find out what happened to Velma's mom. I wish they release the new episode soon already."
1.0,"Jan 17, 2023","Don't get me wrong... the first episode deserves the bad reviews. To rate the show solely on the first episode seems super unfair though. It gets better. It's just a shame people didn't continue to give it a chance because it really really improved. Episode 1 was trash, episode 2 is just eh but episode three and four are great. I haaatteedd the first episode but I'm excited to see the rest of it. I'm definitely glad I continued to give it a chance. Really wishing IMDB required you to specify how many episodes you watched when you posted your review. No way these bad reviews made it to episode 4."
2.0,"Jan 19, 2023","It's Scooby Doo universe but not as you know it. It's Velma and the gang with Scooby probably coming sometime soon. I found it to be fun and easy to enjoy. Honestly this a lot of fun to be had if you let it wash over you, remember your Scooby Doo, but don't keep it sacred. It's meta in the vibe of something like robot chicken and seems to be targeted fairly squarely at anyone who was a teen in the early oughts. The jokes come fast and sometimes with full offense meant. I wish they'd released the whole season at once so the vitriol couldn't grow in the space between episodes. Sadly they didn't. Hopefully there's enough people who quietly enjoyed it who aren't the the ones casually review bombing a show that wasn't made for them."
1.0,"Jan 21, 2023","This comes in right after the 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo as the best Mystery Inc story! Fun writing and great casting make this a home run! I grew up watching every Scooby-Doo series over and over, this show makes good on every story that was ever hinted at in yhe original few series. It's like the writers knew all of the fan theories we grew up with and made sure to give them real substance! I'm so glad this got made, makes me want to go back and rewatch all of the other Scooby-Doo shows just to regain enough context to enjoy this version even more on subsequent viewings! Just like The Last of Us HBO manages to really nail another adaptation!"
2.0,"Jan 18, 2023","I'm an old straight white guy and I loved this. It was most importantly a great show, but also was able to be informative about social, economical, sexist/racist, and societal topics and even point out some of the disparities in the way people view them, i.e. Just as there is nothing wrong with a woman who doesn't sexualize themselves, there is also nothing wrong with those women who do want to be attractive sexual women. I really found it enjoyable. It was the rare show that was able to wrap societal issues into a truly entertaining, funny and enjoyable journey. Kudos to Mindy and her team! I hope they make more!"
1.0,"Jan 16, 2023","I thought it was different. It was nice seeming a different take on scooby doo. I grew up loving the OG show and all movies. This is just a retelling. People need to chill. Every story has been told and retold in various ways and from different perspectives. I find it hilarious and hope there's a second season to come. If you're looking for the original, watch the original. I live how diverse it is and how much it calls out not just on the world but ourselves. Velma is slapped with the cold hard truth many times. It's refreshing.mindy Kaling always does a great job with mixing reality and humor."
1.0,"Jan 19, 2023","It was a very interesting I honestly cannot explain why some people thought it was a bad TV show cause I mean it was actually way better than Scooby Doo just like what the title says and I can't wait for season two to come out. I'm guessing that season two might introduce Scooby Doo. But the creators of this TV show nailed it and this show does not deserve any of the bad reviews. I'm guessing the people that gave this TV show bad reviews were parents for their younger kids or basically kids reading this TV show and saying it was not good. I don't really write reviews for TV shows, but this review has to be written because all the hate it was getting."
1.0,"Feb 25, 2023","Some people really don't have a true sense of humour. Thought is was a refreshing spin on the mystery inc gang.it's definitely a show for a more mature audience.

I hope that this show continues on for a few seasons as I am enjoying the characters in the show.

If people want a more mainstream story line there are alternatives for you out there as there are so many iterations of scooby and the gang that are enjoyable. Leave this one for the adults to continue enjoying for a few seasons.

HBO max shows are created to be a bit more edgy than mainstream watered down cable shows.

I like how each episodes continue into the next.

Fun watch for me."
10.0,"Jan 26, 2023","This show definetely wasn't like the any of the reviewers opinions. It tackled really important topics and was a lot of fun to watch. Velma was a good character and all the other characters were written carefully and not just filler characters. I've enjoyed all parts of the show and I watched it in one sitting. The relationships between characters were explained very well and quickly which was a great feeling. It generally was a great vibe and a great feeling I can't believe people made so many negative comments about this show, it was unexpectedly positive. This show definitely deserves a second season and I can't wait to watch it. I recommend this show to everyone."
1.0,"Jan 30, 2023","Not sure why these other reviews are low but this is a great comedy. I laughed so much during the first episode. I guess a lot of people can't accept changes to characters on shows that they no longer watch lol. I l'm watching the show from the perspective that it's an alternative universe, and again it's great comedy. Velma character is hilarious l, Daphne is a character of what you'd expect in this day and age. Fred as well is what you would expect as a certain stereotype. Newville as well hilarious. This show has a great cast put together. The voice actors that they selected are just right. I will continue to watch."
2.0,"Jan 15, 2023","A funny and new way to enjoy the characters I grew up watching. As an adult now, it made me laugh. The characters seem more releastic to what high school really feels like. I love that Velma has deep flaws and feels guilt over past, but a character that I can connect with and understand. I also love the representation in the show, including the LGBTQ+ representation. I really hope there will be more episodes, despite all the negative reviews this show is receiving. I think people are so connected to the old show that it clouds their judgement, and look for an excuse to hate just because the characters are ""different"" from the past."
1.0,"Jan 20, 2023","Everyone rating it bad are just followers who want to hate it because it's trending to hate it. I loved it. It's not supposed to be just like Scooby Doo, it's Velma. And I loved the character details. It was funny, suspenseful, definite jaw dropping moments. It was everything I needed in an adult cartoon and very much hit everything that we as adults have went through since we watched it as kids. She still had to solve a mystery, I loved that it kept me on my toes and I couldn't guess what would fallen, very LGBTQIA friendly, loved Shaggy's re-image, her father's story is hilarious to me (typical men), definitely hoping it sticks around."
2.0,"Jan 19, 2023","Finally something from scooby doo franchise which make me laugh and interesting enough to hold me on my seat.

Is not boring and its funny enough for someone like me who is 34, its kinda remind me archer style.

Definitely not cup of tea of everyone but style and characters are very nice and eye catching.people keep asking for same old school animations which is not funny and boring in many ways.

Lets have fun with with this new show and hopefully they continue to make this show and expand the franchise like this, scooby doo needed something refreshing like Velam and hopefully people are ready to accept it this way..."
1.0,"Jan 20, 2023","I watched it and it was really funny and well made. I think the reason for the low rating is largely because of people not liking the diversity in the show. Them switching a few races isn't a big deal at all, it makes no difference. Just to be clear, this show is not replacing the regular scooby doo, that seems to be a big theme. People think that this is a ""disgrace"" to the original franchise because of the humor. It's not even that inappropriate and this is obviously not for kids to watch anyway. This is a separate show from scooby doo just like all the other little movies scooby doo makes. It's made for the generations that grew up on scooby doo cartoons and it's a fun version. Mindy Kaling is amazing in it as usual."
1.0,"Feb 17, 2023","Brilliant voice acting cast! Don't take it seriously, I can see a fun mystery ahead! Love how different it is from the usual. Very much worth watching!!!! I will definitely keep watching to see how the story develops. Haters going to hate but if you like out the box adult cartoons like The Venture Bros or Harley Quinn, you will enjoy this for sure. The animation style is perfect too. Just the right amount of suspense, thrill, and sass! Take the time and watch it for yourself before you judge it from what other people are saying. This show was meant for adults not children, so adults please enjoy!!!"
1.0,"Mar 11, 2023","I do understand where the controversy is but not to this degree. The reason for that is because it is a satire.

The whole entire show is a satire of the characters, tv shows in general and everything about it. At times it's a little choppy with the satire but I still think it was really great!! I know mine is an unpopular opinion and I'm shocked. I had to write papers and research satire for my humanities class, this show is a perfect example of what a satire is.

They mock the characters by drastically expressing their personalities and how they were written originally. News flash Fred was always mansplaining and white privilege, Daphne's always been more vain and vapid. Velma's always been a know-it-all. They just take it to a whole new level in this show. I like the way they took it. I think it brought more depth to it from an adult POV. It is not a kids show. It is not trying to be Scooby doo at all. It took an adult satirical view through the lenses of teens! I'm excited to see where they take this. The characters are immature in many ways but most teens are both mature and immature. I also think they took a very neurodivergent approach to this show and as someone with such I understood, followed and everything made sense to my brain."
1.0,"Jan 31, 2023","Going into this show, l had no idea that this was going to be such a raunchy, adult take on Velma's origin story. For me it was a splendid surprise! I cant wait to tell my friends about how warped and demented this show truly is. The voice actors are all massive talents. The writing isnt amazing but then again the writing was never a strong suit in the scooby doo franchise anyway. All the haters need to slow their rolls and realize there is far worse content out there. Basically 90% of Netflix is just a sad graveyard of programming. HBO continues to work extremely hard in order to give us all quality entertainment."
8.0,"Jan 18, 2023","This has nothing to do with the original series. It's not a reboot nor a remake, it's just a way to see the origin of the team in a more realistic parallel universe. Do not expect anything like the original cartoon but still, enjoy the new storyline.

It is definitely something super different but since (some of) us, fans of the original have grown, I think we can enjoy this.

Super disruptive and different. Reminds me of a cartoon like family guy, cartoon shows not meant for children.

If you have an open mind and don't expect the original monster chasing scenes you will Loved it.

I think most hate comes from the expectations."
3.0,"Jan 21, 2023",I never watched original Scooby-Do tv-series or the films. Therefore I watched Velma with fresh eyes. And I liked it. So far at least. It represents my vision of world. A global village that acknowledge there are variery of people and it's alright. I liked how Velma is sarcastic and all that. Other characters didn't felt that much different from each other. Probably because I don't have decades of history with the chatacters. But they did good as sidekicks. Velma can't beat The Simpsons nor Star Trek Lower Decks but is my bronze medallist in American animation. I look forward to see rest of the season.
1.0,"Feb 12, 2023","Velma is brilliantly unapologetic in her pursuit of solving mysteries. I love how she never hesitates to speak her mind and prove she's always right...although sometimes she is not.

I also enjoy the character changes to Daphne, Fred, and Norvile. They add a fascinating layer of complexity and unpredictability to the story, making it even more engaging and enjoyable!

Let's not forget about inclusion; a positive step forward. Including diverse characters is awesome. It reflects real life and makes the show more relatable and enjoyable for everyone. It's all about celebrating different backgrounds and making sure everyone feels seen and included.

Don't be haters and embrace the new story!"
4.0,"Jan 22, 2023","I see people are disgruntled because it's not the G rated Scooby-Doo we all grew up with. That's why it's funny! Reminds me of sitting around with friends and saying ""Scooby-Doo would be way more interesting if Daphne was a drug dealer."" It is not that far from other adult geared cartoons that are streaming these days but apparently nobody is allowed to mock Scooby-Doo without being subject to ridicule. Didn't realize it was off limits! I say ""hear! Hear! Continue on with the debauchery!""

There are enough versions of Scooby-Doo that cater to kids where we can have one delightfully crass spin-off to make the original fans have a laugh."
3.0,"Jan 30, 2023","Velma is getting a lot of hate out there right now. Yes, there are definitely comparisons to be drawn to Harley Quinn, but that is not necessarily a bad thing.

This is one of the cases where critics blindly follow each other and do not give an honest opinion as it would go against the grain of what the critic fraternity is saying.

It is raw, it is funny, it is uncensored, it tackles valid issues while being zany. Existing characters who are now portrayed by someone of a different ethnicity always upsets people, but sometimes, like in this case, the change works and makes sense in the context.

Love it."
1.0,"Jan 22, 2023","This is definitely entertaining which is what I came for. It's a little ridiculous at times but It's a cartoon. I enjoy it being over the top. The show is fun and funny. A modern and edgy spin to a classic show. It's for the kids who grew up watching Scooby Doo who are now adults so to watch the show through a different lens is so fun!

As one review questioned ""is this for adults or kids?"" It is extremely obvious it is not for kids.. Seriously?

But if you're ever not sure be sure to check what it is rated. This adult show is full of sexual situations, drugs, cursing, and a bit of gore.

All star line up!"
5.0,"May 13, 2024","Loved it like I love Human Resources and Bigmouth. The fast pace, familiar style of the Mystery team is a really funny take on this classic.

I've watched both of the episodes that have been posted twice now and can't wait for the next ones!

The other reviews seem to be very hung up on animation that includes adult themes, like the shower scene. But if you've ever been a fan of scooby (any of the series or movies) then you have to know it's always been adult themed (except the one with scrappy and the team as tiny little kids).

I really enjoyed this update, the animation is well done and if you're having an issue with the ""dubbing"" of the voice actors, perhaps you need better WiFi as on my stream, there were no issues.

I'm looking forward to how Velma cracks the case and also finds her mother."
5.0,"Jan 22, 2023","I almost skipped watching this after reading the negative commentary online. So glad I went ahead and watched it! This show is very entertaining, I enjoyed it. I'm just a little annoyed they didn't release the entire season. If so I would've definitely binge watched it. I was happy they didn't include scooby. All of that ruh roh talk made me head hurt. I live for an edgy and slightly inappropriately funny cartoon. Will most definitely be tuning in to continue watching and supporting. Mindy is truly talented, I enjoy her work and hope others can see what a gem she is. The cast as a whole is amazing!"
5.0,"Jan 22, 2023","I honestly don't get why people hate the new Velma show, I know Scooby-Doo isn't in it, but that's only because this show is about Velma not Scooby-Doo, the plot is really interesting, the only part I don't like is the stripper part in season 1 episode 6 Lol, and the jokes are dull, but the characters are interesting, Everyone says they hate the Velma character because she is mean spirited, but that is also one of the points of this show was to change the characters up, like what did yall expect? To keep them the same and make an adult show? Nah, they can't do that, to make an adaptation you have to change the characters ways up a little but,

Plot: 10/10 Comedy: 6/10 Acting: 8/10 Characters: 10/10."
9.0,"Jan 21, 2023","I recently had the pleasure of watching the animated series ""Velma,"" and I must say it exceeded all my expectations. As a long-time fan of mystery-solving animated shows, this modern take on Velma Dinkley from the classic Scooby-Doo franchise brought a fresh and delightful perspective to the table.

One of the standout features of the series is the character development of Velma herself. In this iteration, Velma is not just the brains of the operation but also a fully fleshed-out character with her own quirks, challenges, and triumphs. The writing dives deep into Velma's background, giving viewers a more nuanced understanding of her motivations and struggles, making her an even more relatable and lovable character.

The animation style is both vibrant and engaging, with a perfect balance of nostalgia for longtime fans and a contemporary flair that appeals to new audiences. The creators have successfully blended the iconic elements of Scooby-Doo with a modern aesthetic, creating a visually appealing world that enhances the overall viewing experience.

What truly sets ""Velma"" apart is its emphasis on friendship and teamwork. While solving mysteries is at the core of the show, the series also explores the dynamics between the characters and the strength of their friendships. Velma's relationships with Scooby, Shaggy, Daphne, and Fred are given significant attention, adding a heartwarming layer to the narrative. The writers have managed to strike a perfect balance between humor, mystery, and heartfelt moments, creating a show that is both entertaining and emotionally resonant.

Moreover, the series introduces a diverse and inclusive cast of characters, reflecting the evolving landscape of animated shows. This inclusivity adds depth to the storytelling, making ""Velma"" not only enjoyable but also socially relevant.

In conclusion, ""Velma"" is a must-watch animated series that successfully revitalizes a beloved character and franchise. With its engaging storytelling, well-developed characters, and a perfect blend of nostalgia and modernity, this show is a delightful addition to the world of animated mysteries. Whether you're a longtime Scooby-Doo fan or a newcomer to the genre, ""Velma"" offers a captivating and enjoyable viewing experience for audiences of all ages.."
1.0,"Mar 1, 2023","This is not a kid's show: it's an adult comedy.

Velma is an absolute riot, soaked in twisted chaos, blood, and other bodily fluids.

It's meta, coarse commentary.

It succeeds by hyperbolizing heavy themes placed on young adults today with maximum throttle. LGBTQ+ representation abound, exaggerated stereotypes, filthy innuendo, and more!

Absolutely a black comedy. Dark and cutthroat. The creators took a show we all grew up watching and then said ""what if in 2020s"" to every aspect.

Season 1 was a binge worthy masterpiece, season 2 had a weak plot but was commendable for trying to add SCOBI and the Hex sisters into the mix.

I think the low star reviews on this are from people that saw an animated adaption and assumed it would be anything like the base material with a TV-MA rating.

I hope this show find the right people, I found it this week on HBO and now I need more!"
5.0,"Jan 13, 2023","I'm surprised at the cacophony of poor reviews of this show-most of which seem to be due to their indignation about the show focusing on Velma and not the team as a whole. I love that Velma is also a brown lesbian girl voiced by Mindy Kaling. The comedy is great, the use of more adult language in an animated show is hilarious, and Velma is overly dramatic which is fun. I'm excited to continue watching more episodes.

Wanda Sykes voicing a detective was also a pleasant surprise, also because she's a lesbian in a series with a lesbian protagonist. Sometimes these newer shows based on older ones seem to push forced tropes but it comes off as contrived. This one doesn't do that."
3.0,"Feb 6, 2023","""Velma"" is a show that I made me want two more seasons after watching the first episode. Some may think that this is just one of many desperate reboots, but this is no reboot. Reboots are attempts to replicate a classic with a modern spin, while ""Velma"" is a reimagining. Multiverse storytelling is very popular today, because it's an opportunity to break the rules and reshape the narrative. You can ask the question, ""What if the mystery gang had minorities in the group? What does that look like? What if they were all separated by class?""

Adult cartoons have been paving a new way for written comedy. For me, this show checks all of my boxes for what makes a humorous adult cartoon. Modern references that aren't too specific, subtle homages to the cultural brand (in this case Scooby Doo), brutally honest remarks that deconstruct societal norms, and it makes fun of itself.

Who knew that all Scooby Doo needed to make a come back was remove the dog and make the humans self conscious teens."
4.0,"Jan 26, 2023","The charming part of the show is how it makes you look at them as real persons , also glenn is a brilliant voice actor and nice match for fred!

Not it only makes sense to watch these characters interfere with each other in sexual ways but also it deliverse future oppertunities to make scooby doo characters appear in way more favourable personalities , i think wb boys got tired of makeing old fashioned scooby doo movies that end the same so they did this adaption or better say non-adaption to the scoob doo franchise .

So give it a try after watching enough rick and morty cause this show has same DNA as what ricks got."
3.0,"Mar 23, 2023","If you're a new viewer just know this is an R-rated/adult cartoon (not for the kiddos) centered around Velma. First off, I love the G-rated 80s, 90s and 2000 version of Scooby-Doo shows/movies. But this show is not for that crowd and far from a G-rating. The show reminds me of Sausage Party, a cartoon for adults. Not all adults will appreciate this adult cartoon because it seems that Scooby-Doo fans are sooo used to the G-rated Scooby-Doo shows/movies and this show is on a completely different level and made for adults. Imagine if someone made an adult cartoon for Charlie Brown and the type of backlash it would get, which is what's happening here with this show. This show is perfect for me because I love the characters from Scooby-Doo, I'm fine with seeing the characters in a different light and I love adult cartoons."
5.0,"Jan 12, 2023","Loved this and am shocked at the negative reviews here. I suspect the haters are just people who wanted more weed jokes about Shaggy...There are a ton of jokes about Shaggy's character not smoking pot, while literally every other character uses or sells some drugs. There is witty swipes at wealth, race, cops, misogyny, lawyers, Asian snacks, and the original Scooby DooTM gang. The writing is super quick and there are no wasted lines or scenes. I will definitely be watching again. I hate the release schedule, so if you are an impatient watcher or just want to binge it all you should wait until the entire season is released because I'm already jonzen for more episodes."
4.0,"Jan 22, 2023",This is a good show if liked Mystery Inc or other scooby shows with actual danger and creepiness and serialization. The art direction is also strong with some sequences being quite stunning for a scooby doo show. Just be aware that the characters are meant to be less likable at the start because they're all in bad places in their lives at the start of the series but they grow and change as it goes on and become better people. Don't be like the people who write it off for doing something new and different with scooby doo or who dislike the changes to the characters races. The humor is also good by scooby doo standards (which is usually a little corny). Give it a chance and you won't be disappointed 🙂
3.0,"Feb 9, 2023",Listen.. this show is everything.. this take on the Scooby-Doo characters are really entertaining.. Don't listen to the haters if you go in watching something just to trash it your going to be disappointed.. go in with an open mind and try and connect the dots with the old and the new.. it's fresh funny and the ultimate hybrid. I love a show that reimagines a classic and out there own spin on it.. FYI this is not a child's show this is an adult humor rated show. HBO max please renew the show trust and believe you have a hit.. also to the haters of the show know this a view is still a view and thank you for the support..
10.0,"Jan 29, 2023","Preface: I'm a big scooby doo fan. Have been since I was a kid and that still rings true. I will still take the time to watch the new content as it comes out now and then.

When I sat down to watch this show I expected what I had heard in the reviews: complete trash.

I was gearing myself up to be disappointed at a failed attempt of a scooby-doo origin story remake. But after the first episode I realised that this isn't a Scooby Doo origin story like they have been done before. This is a whole new show.

This show isn't supposed to be canon to the Scooby Doo universe, it's separate. Just like how Fifty Shades isn't canon to Twilight: Inspiration was taken and new things were made. Yeah they use the same names and the who-done-it formula, but everything else is new: animation, characters, horror-element, adult focused. If these things are things you don't like then fine, don't watch the show. But if you were to change the setting of this show, and still have the same plot, would it be receiving all of the backlash it has done?

The first big complaint I see is about the characters changing and, yeah, they have changed, but they've changed constantly over the past 55 years in every WB incarnation! Prime example is think about how original Daphne has gone from a basic girl template with barely any character to Sarah M Geller's martial artist or Zombie Island's reporter or A Pup's sceptic or Be Cool's whacky comic or What's New's fashionista. All they have done in *this* show is push all the characters that bit further to develop something new and original.

I would even say that the changes made bring up a whole 'WHAT IF' situation, something that was highly acclaimed when done by Marvel. And I think the plot is a BRILLIANT exploration of 'what if' scenarios for the characters from Scooby Doo.

People have made reviews about re-hashed material and this show taking their 'childhood show' and copying badly (something that is everywhere now with Disney remakes and superhero formulas etc etc.). But this is a show taking inspiration from a basic idea - kids in a mystery gang - and making something much more different than WB has ever done. And yeah, all of WB scooby content *is* just copying the same idea two guys first came up with in 1969. Not a bad thing but not untrue.

To address the missing dog. The dog is not included for a reason.

Imagine if this show changed everybody's beloved pooch to fit into the genre they were trying to create. Changing the dog to suit the adult genre just isn't possible and would create a weird uncanny valley effect as people try to separate the new imagining of the character with the symbol of the childhood show they remember. Reviewers say it themselves: Scooby is the key character. But he is the key character of a children's show, not an adult one. Again, something that this show has deviated from and, in my opinion to savour our views of the iconic character that it written with the entire purpose to appease children, rightly so in this first season. (otherwise we might've had a Sausage Party children's screenings situation all over again).

Reality check: yeah there is some absolute cringe in here. The few 2 episodes aren't the best, which is where my '3-episode rule before I stop watching' came in handy. But before the story picked up it was a bit of carnage trying to establish the tone of the shown. Plus, I can't defend the choices of the writers to add in highly forced political commentary one-liners or other cringe lines that just aren't funny. Yes, they need to have a check on that before season 2 comes out. I spent the few seconds they were said in each episode zoning out and pretending I didn't hear them.

But if you look past them, then underneath you have a complex story with intriguing twists and good pacing, fleshed-out characters with built (or building) backstories, and a mystery that can hook you in. I was wanting to watch the next episode just to figure out who-done-it(tm) and that's the sign of a great show.

I feel that I have to boost my rating just to outset those who have clearly judged this work too harshly. Or those that, very clearly, have not watched the series at all but still deem it necessary to have their judgement heard. I don't make reviews on anything, but the more I have written about this show the more I have actually grown to like it. I'm actually looking forward to season 2. I like the premise, I like the character's and their interactions with each other, and I even like the call-backs to OG scooby that they do drop in there.

This is it's own show and I'm looking forward to see where the story goes in season 2."
5.0,"Oct 27, 2023","Firstly, I'm a huge fan of Scooby Doo and all the various adaptions and entries in their universe. More so the different series and not so much the animated movies.

I really don't understand all the negative reviews. Yes, this show is very different from any of the previous Scooby Doo entries, however if you give it a chance, it is extremely clever and very funny at times. You need to forget any pre conceptions you may have and watch this work with an open mind.

I have to say I'm a fan and really hope they do a second season. Although due to the poor ratings, this seems very unlikely. 😒

Ps this show is definitely not for children."
3.0,"Jan 15, 2023","All I have to say is a majority of the people saying the show is bad are apart of the older generation that grew up watching the original scooby doo and are comparing the show to those old classic cartoons and that's why they aren't able to fully form an opinion or even enjoy the show. I myself, a genz born '05, too thought it would be yet another scoobydoo remake but with a focus on Velma but that turned out not to be the case. But even still I was able to put all that aside and really enjoy the show for what is is because in reality it's not a scoobydoo spinoff in honesty it's just a show that is loosely based on scoobydoo but targeted at old people, maybe teens+, instead of children like the older scoobydoo animations. And I know this will just get tons of down votes soley based on the fact that I enjoyed the show but please actually watch it for yourself and don't let these old people with their negative reviews change your mind about watching it."
5.0,"Oct 9, 2024","As some one who grew up watching Scooby every day as kid I adore this show! I am so happy to see the characters that are way more relatable than the 1970s era ones. The mystery is always a plus, and while I hope this show plot improves (as most do) i really do enjoy seeing the creation of the new gang and that they're not just re-doing the same old thing with the same old tone. Don't get me wrong, the OG shows made me fall in love with scooby doo but seeing a fresh perspective on characters I love is really great! Season 1 is more of an introduction to the new Scoob universe, Season 2 was more of the formation of friendship between our lovable gang, hoping that Season 3 will be the start of Mystery Solving (as we got a taste of in the special!! The huddle in the woods gave me flashbacks!!)!"
2.0,"Mar 4, 2023","I think, if you take as a motto before watching any form of art or creativity a simple ""watch not what you're expecting to be shown, but was is actually shown"". I think that it's the shame that a lot of negative emotions are driven from the place of nostalgic despair. It's not a continuation of original, it's a new perspective, new take on something pretty generic, if we're honest. It's not Shakespeare, it's Scooby-Doo, I loved it as a kid, but there is no big plot, there are not even much of a character work in the previous takes on thus universe. 'Velma' is something new, fresh, funny and pretty brave in its fun craziness and cheesiness at some points. Love it. I think if you love animated series of Harley Queen, you would definitely enjoy Velma, only if you're watching it being blank for new experience."
5.0,"Feb 6, 2023","I never leave reviews but I can't believe how hated the show is. I literally just made an account to leave a positive review..

If watching with the mindset to compare to any ol scooby doo. Then don't. Watch it as it's own individual show..

I'm a 30 year old man, I enjoyed it. I thought it was funny. I feel like people reviews are just based on episode 1. Instead of jumping on the hate train and only giving 1 episode a shot. If you go to watch it ignore the hate and ignore and perception of any old scooby doo and take it as it's own and give it ALL a shot.

Sorry about my lack of review structure but again I never leave reviews lol. It's a good show. 👍🏾"
2.0,"Jan 17, 2023","I watched the first two episodes last night and found myself enjoying it quite a bit. Sure, it's not perfect. It thinks it's a bit smarter and funnier of a show than it is, but at the same time what it is is still wildly entertaining. I'd consider this to be the inevitable Riverdale of this franchise. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, if you're looking for something that's a bit out there and wild.

I think people are hating on the characters' characterization a bit too much. Velma's characterization a bit too much. She's judgmental and a bit ""not like other girls"" at the moment, yes, but the show seems to be aware of this. During the second episode, you watch her start to unwork the biases she holds about others as a result of feeling socially alienated. Is she perfect at it yet? No, but that's what a season-wide arc is for. I suspect that the vapid Fred, anti-drug Shaggy, and uncertain Daphne will also get development as they assemble into the crew that we recognize more familiarly.

Don't go in expecting Shakespeare, but if you're looking for a crass, sharp, funny time, I would recommend this show."
4.0,"Jan 21, 2023","Velma is basically what if our bespectacled mystery solving genius were more like '90s style Daria - rocking combat boots, a thigh high mini, a judgy attitude towards everyone and a teenager figuring stuff out, while still being super smart.

Basically, in this version, Velma is just a snarky teenage girl.

When I was a kid watching Scooby-Doo, I always wished the writers flushed out the relationships between Velma and Shaggy and Daphne and Fred. But now that this writing crew is spending more time on feelings, I wish they had spent more time on the ongoing mystery.

If you are a child of the '90s and loved Daria and thought she reflected you, then you will love this, especially if you are a kid of color."
3.0,"Jan 12, 2023","The title of the show ""Velma"" created preconceived expectations due to ""Scooby-Doo"" being a favorite show in my childhood. Now as an adult, I find different things entertaining. In a strange way, it's still kinda child appropriate... In the sense that the animation is innocent... yet the words may push a bit... It requires brain compute to understand. The first episode did break the third-wall... which I find annoying... after the intro it backed off it a bit.

It's for adults who grew up with Scooby-Doo and would enjoy an adult spin on the show.

It wasn't what I expected... But I was entertained and enjoyed it and am hoping for more!"
10.0,"Jan 18, 2023","Couldn't stop laughing thru the first 2 episodes, this is pure brilliance and MK's best work to date. It's crass and witty and moves so fast you'll miss a joke if you blink. Characters are new perspectives on what we always knew to be true about these characters. The chemistry between them is perfect and hilarious.

Sure, I loved scooby doo as a kid, but I love this ADULT comedy even more and don't know where all this fake hate is coming from. I literally made an IMDb account to post my first review for this great show because it's score should be much much higher.

Bravo to modern & mature comedy!"
1.0,"Jan 23, 2023","This show is for adults who have a dark sense of humor. This is not a remake of the classic Scooby Doo. This show is not for anyone who expects the same old story and same old characters and this is why I like it.

I didn't know what to expect when I first started watching the series. I didn't watch any previews and I am glad that I gave it a shot. I recommend it to anyone who likes dark comedy.

I liked the characters and their background stories. I like the drawings and the colors used. I don't like watching trailers because in my opinion, some times they give too much of the story away and I lose interest. I am on season two now and looking forward to many more."
