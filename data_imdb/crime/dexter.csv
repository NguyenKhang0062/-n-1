1,10.0,14 November 2020,"Thanks to the quarantine, I watched series that I never imagined I would ever see, one of these series Dexter, which I heard had a bad ending, so I decided not to watch it, what a nonsense I missed myself watching one of the best series ever. Dexter has eight seasons and a renewed new season to fix the poor ending and everyone's excited about it. All seasons are excellent, from the first to the seventh, with the exception of the last. You evaluate each season as follows. First 9.7 Second 9.6 Third 8.7 Fourth 9.9 Fifth 9.0 The sixth 8.9 Seventh 9.0 The ex Final season 7.0 Waiting for the new season","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
2,10.0,30 October 2006,"Dexter is the show I have been waiting for my whole television watching life! The complex and damaged characters, the twisted plot line and Dexter's foster dad grooming him, educating him, to make him the perfect avenger,its all so intoxicating! I am breathlessly anticipating the next episode. This show is not only well acted, with each and every main character holding my full attention, but written with such deep intensity that I find it absolutely irresistible! I really find it difficult to wait and see more of how Dex was traumatized as a child, more of Harry's lessons, more of the growing relationship with Rita, more of the ice truck killer, more forensics...More of this great show period. Kudos to all involved...this show will surely be a huge hit!","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
3,10.0,1 October 2006,"I read Lindsay's excellent books - Darkly Dreaming Dexter and Dearly Devoted Dexter - some time ago, and when I heard that there was to be a series based on the books, I was extremely excited. So much so, in fact, that I feared disappointment merely because my standards were so high.

Thankfully, ""Dexter"" absolutely delivers. The show maintains the uncomfortable atmosphere of the novels with better fidelity than one could ever have expected, and Dexter (played by Hall) is all there.

The visual elements from the show are stunning, to say the least. Disturbing, certainly, but more than that - fascinating. Watching the show, it's impossible to keep from finding a certain agreement in oneself for Dexter. He's a monster, and yet it's completely possible to identify with him.

10 out of 10. This one has a permanent spot on my DVR.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
4,10.0,29 August 2023,"Dexter is absolutely, without a doubt, one of the best shows ever created! It follows Miami PD blood splatter expert Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall) as he both solves murders and commits them too. He only murders bad people who've gotten away from the law. Being a blood expert he's able to outmaneuver the police at every turn. It's a thrilling, one of a kind TV show that will keep you at the edge of your seat throughout the entire series. Michael C. Hall is perfect as Dexter and the rest of the supporting cast is just as fantastic! Yes, the ending was terrible but like Game of Thrones, Lost (or any other show with a bad final episode), a few bad episodes at the end doesn't spoil what an overall great show it was and that's what Dexter is...a GREAT show.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
5,10.0,26 October 2020,Dexter is easily one of my favorite tv shows of all-time and one of the few shows I can watch all the way through several times over without getting bored. It's hard for me to put into words how much I love this show. The only thing that's not good about it is the ending. The ending was pretty bad but that still doesn't take away from how good the show is overall. You should watch this show for Michael C. Hall's performance as Dexter alone. He's amazing in this. If you haven't seen this incredible show yet just make sure you give yourself enough time because you're going to want to binge watch it as fast as you can. Once you start watching you won't be able to stop.,"October 1, 2006 (United States)"
6,10.0,1 October 2006,"Absolutely brilliant. True to Jeff Lindsay's books. The visual contrast between the darkness of Dexter's secret life and and the gloss of Miami adds an almost surreal quality. Character development is right on the money, bringing out the background slowly so one can see the development of Dexter's sociopath personality and his confusion of human behavior compared to his own. Dexter is an actor in his own life; his relationships between co-workers and his personal life are well shown in the video media. The fact that he is a blood splatter expert This is a dark work, but set in the bizarre world of life in Miami is almost believable. Developers of this series should also look to Andrew Vachss's books.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
7,10.0,22 October 2006,"Dexter, a forensics expert at day, serial killer with a touch of vigilantism at night. Dexter is creating a believable and very detailed portrait of a, lets say troubled, sociopath. One of the parts about the show I like best is the emotions that normal people exhibit, thus forcing Dexter to mimic them. Good laugh when the emotions Dexter fake get real, and he is scared out of his mind, like in the relationship with his ""girlfriend"" Rita, mother of two and victim of her abusive ex-boyfriend. Also liked the acting of Jennifer Carpenter as Dexter's sister Debra, adds a nice touch colour to the show, without drifting into clichés.

Thrilling story, many details, and one of the best opening sequences ever.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
8,10.0,28 April 2010,"This is going to be my first ever review on IMDb, there is not a day when I do not visit IMDb to check the reviews about movies or TV series that I watch, I watch lots of movies and series.

For the first time in my life it happened to me that I could not sleep after watching a series. I have seen prison break, heroes and a lot other. Prison break and heroes first season was awesome. They inspired me so much that I got some tattoo's done on my body. However both these series cut loose as soon they go to the next season. Heroes was big disappointment but DEXTER.. OMG series after series it starts to make me so curious about the next episode.. damn the season 4. I just could not sleep the whole night after watching it. I spent my weekend watching the episodes back to back.

To start with Dexter (Michael C. Hall) his darkness was off the edge he played the role so well that sometimes I wonder if he is the same in his real life but then I found that Debra Morgan (Jennifer Carpenter) is his real wife who is playing his sister in this series. Damn Debra is one character who is so confused and mostly been controlled by the people around her, she always end up doing something wrong but always gets credit for the good things too.

I love the part when you get to know what is going on in Dexters mind when he thinks about something or when someone is talking to him also the part when he talks to his dead father Harry. (he just thinks what his dad would say in that situation). All the episodes/characters and all the seasons are written and played so well that you can hardly find any flaw in it.

My favorite characters are Dexter (Quite obvious), Rita and Vince Masuka damn Vince is so funny, he just utter one word in his entire episode and comes out to be damn funny.

I just cant wait for the Season 5 and I am sure whosoever watched dexter feels the same way just like I did.

(Apologizes in case my first review has some mistakes and offends somebody's feelings)","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
9,7.0,27 October 2006,"Between Dexter and Weeds, Showtime has a corner on the original new shows market. Not only are both of these shows completely original and innovative, but they are REALLY good.

Dexter, in particular, should not be reviewed by anyone who hasn't seen more than three episodes. I almost feel as if the first episode in the series is a tad-bit melodramatic (note Dexter screaming in the face of his first victim) just to pull in viewers that otherwise need something more visceral than a great screenplay.

By two more episodes the viewer should be absolutely intoxicated by the complexity of the character Dexter and the acting of Michael C. Hall. His own co-stars admit to being almost ""scared"" by how well Hall absorbs his character. Personally, I think that without Hall's mastery of Dexter there would be nothing to watch. Don't get me wrong, the plot of this show is extremely intriguing (and original, to be redundant), but the excitement lies purely in the way Dexter/Hall responds to A) his girlfriend, B) blood, and C) other serial killers.

I think that it is very reasonable to chuckle at Dexter's attempts to ""fit in"" social situations and I believe the writers of this show planned on it. What I am still stuck on, however, is whether or not to cheer Dexter on in his methodology (serial killing serial killers). This had better be the first of many seasons, so spread the word...

...Edit: I watched this series finale last night and come back to this review (which I wrote after the conclusion of Season 1) with my hat in hand to say: ""I'm kind of sorry for the hype.""

If my review was the impetus for your 'Dexter' obsession (I, too, was obsessed) then I owe you an apology for the way it all ended. Sure, sure, I couldn't have known how poorly written the resolution of this once-magnificent series would be. But, you see, I shouted praises for this show from roof-tops...telling every friend who would engage me in discussion about pop-culture that they NEEDED TO WATCH DEXTER, it's the greatest drama on television!

Alas, I will not leave any spoilers here and if you've come along the journey with me then you will undoubtedly watch how it all ends, but I write this edit in vain so that you, internet friend, cannot say that I didn't warn you: 'Dexter' leaves me wanting a real ending.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

11,7.0,13 April 2021,"Hard to believe that Showtime would let a piece of gold turn into a turd after four seasons, but they did. Seasons 1-4 are as good as any show I've ever seen, a solid 10, would recommend to anyone and beg them to watch. Holds up wonderfully even in 2021. Seasons 5,6,7 were not good, but had some good moments. Season 8 is as bad as you will find anywhere. Honestly think it was written by sixth graders, I was begging for it to be over - how the actors could put up with the idiocy is beyond me, but I guess they were being paid plenty by then. If you love the first four seasons, watch the next three and enjoy the characters, then read the spoilers to see how season 8 ends. It will truly leave a bad taste in your mouth if you watch the last season.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
12,5.0,9 September 2013,"What started out to be a phenomenal series, Is not ending well :(. I crack up weekly at everyone's reviews but never got irritated enough to post my own. Well 8yrs later the day has come this is by far the worst season.... OK sure it has a few highs but far more lows. I love Dex but he is turning into a whiny b**** which defeats the purpose of his original purpose. :/ So there's my rant I wont even get into the others or else I might as well right a report.Wtf is this 10 line crap I see one liners all the time????So they want us to write a whole report. Well this is my 1st review which is obvious at this point lol.So you want 10 lines here is your 10 lines.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
13,10.0,14 October 2013,"Having watched Dexter right to the bitter end I have to say I won't miss it at all. What was a better than average series, stylishly directed with a great cast was forgiven for being a bit repetitive. It should have ended 3 seasons ago, this last season was pathetic, it was as though the writers had been sacked, some new ones brought in and told to keep it ""ticking over"" and told to end it all in the last 2 episodes. for a show built on secrets very few were revealed, this went out with a pathetic whimper. The penultimate series built to a real dramatic high that promised so much for the final series, instead of keeping this up and pushing the characters to new extremes it was as if they were all too tired to be bothered, every character acted as if they were ready for a retirement home.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
14,10.0,11 December 2020,"This is undoubtedly, the best ever TV Series I've watched. So addictive, thrilling and entertaining. No boredom, super-fast and it'll glued you to the screen just from the 1st minutes of the 1st episode.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
15,8.0,13 November 2006,"Although I am not a regular proponent of serial television shows, the eclectic, in-depth storyline and character development in Dexter are far beyond what I expected from Showtime or any network other than HBO. Dexter is a unique insight into the mind of a serial killer protected by his occupation as well as the lessons derived from his father's teachings. By having a resounding premise of catching a notorious serial killer while trying to conceal his own identity, Dexter enters each week with a new sociological dilemma as well as a new criminal to dispatch. What is best about Dexter is his own personal facade of trying to be normal. While other characters in the show are obviously dysfunctional, the audience are privileged to see the flaws of Dexter while people within his own world cannot. Darkly humorous, well-paced, and morbidly addictive Dexter is the best show of 2006, without a doubt.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
16,10.0,20 July 2023,"In the realm of cinematography and scriptwriting, it is advised to limit character narration allowing actions, conversations, and scenes to speak for themselves. However, if there exists an exception, and it goes by the name, Dexter!

From the start, I found myself captivated by Dexter's character - a dark, introverted individual. The strength of character development was evident, bolstered by impeccable casting and an engaging, crime-filled storyline.

Seasons 1 and 2 stood out exceptionally, earning a commendable rating of 9/10. However, the show's quality began to wane afterward. The introduction of new characters and excessive drama weighed down what was once a classic series. Despite my love for the character, I sensed a gradual decline in its charm, including that of Debra.

The writing and direction were solid, yet Dexter himself stood as the towering centerpiece as his portrayal of dark humor remained a standout aspect. His narration throughout the episodes was a unique perspective where we learnt how he perceived things, people, and crime; it was utterly captivating.

I recommend this series, but I urge viewers to approach it at their own pace and choose the number of seasons to indulge in. However, I must stress that the first two seasons are a must-watch and should not be missed.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
17,10.0,27 September 2006,"HBO Actors, HBO Directors, HBO Writers, and Showtime's willingness to take risks that HBO might not see as profitable these days (Carnivale + Deadwood R.I.P.) make for a killer combination in ""Dexter,"" the new Sho Comedy/Drama about a Serial Killer Killing Serial Killer (you read right). In my opinion, Showtime has always had a hard time producing an original series that's truly original and good, so it's incredibly refreshing to see the network pull such a ""Hail Mary"" move and come out on top. ""Dexter"" is, without spoiling anything, an excellent vehicle for Michael C. Hall, and explores the inner monologue of a Serial Killer in a way that has never been approached before without seeming too predictable or hokey. Watch it and you will not be disappointed. You'll even want to watch the next episode, which says a lot considering the network. I just hope they don't screw it up.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
18,10.0,14 October 2020,New season 2021 confirmed. They say its limited. Let's pray otherwise. I'm so excited!!!,"October 1, 2006 (United States)"
19,7.0,27 December 2020,"Over the past couple of years I have gone through some of TV's most followed series of recent years (Breaking Bad, Lost, Fargo, etc.). I've LOVED it: the great storylines, character progression, scenes that make your jaw literally drop. That being said, the TV series Dexter is my favorite, and it's not close. Never have I been so emotionally attached to something on the television. My mind literally correlates memories and relationships made during that time to where I was at in the series at the time. I finished the show in 4 months, and let me tell ya, it was on my mind the entire time, throughout the entirety of the day. I loathed daily responsibilities that took away Dexter's screen time (very unhealthy looking back, not that I could help it). One year after finishing the show, Dexter still crosses mind on a regular basis (one example: me writing this review at nearly 3am in the morning lol). And oh my am I looking forward to the reboot next fall!

One request: please please please do not be turned off by all of the negative reviews about its ""tragic"" ending!! Everyone wanted their own perfect ending (impossible), but what the producers put together is perfectly on brand with the 8-season storyline that precedes it. I have to believe true Dexter fans understand this!","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

21,7.0,25 October 2006,"Dexter is hilarious; it is easily the best new show on TV! Dark, dry humor crops up in the most unexpected places, and the settings and dialogue are laced with CSI's pseudo-scientific appeal. While the show may appear to treat standard morality as irreverent, it is actually an excellent study of humanity at its best -- and worse.

The character of Dexter, a disassociated, psychopathic serial killer, is somewhat reminiscent of Data, the android in the Star Trek series. Dexter is devoid of normal, human emotion, and has to learn behaviors by rote. Seeing the world through his eyes enables us to closely examine what is ""right"" and what is ""wrong."" We have to pause and wonder about our own perception of reality.

Overall, the show is a side-splitting outlet for the vigilante/serial killer/dysfunctional being in all of us. Well done!","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

25,9.0,13 September 2020,"I'm here in 2020 to remind everyone to watch Dexter at least once in their lives. There are very few shows I circle back to once I've experienced the conclusion, but I still cannot get enough of Dexter. Every time through I experience another ""oh damn"" moment that I didn't catch the first time around. This keeps me in constant fascination of how brilliantly woven and expertly portrayed this story is. The writing is superb and you will never get ahead of the twists and turns.

Did you ever think you'd have empathy for a serial killer? Me either...

Watch it. Trust me.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
26,10.0,23 October 2006,"After four episodes, I'm ready to proclaim this the best show currently on TV, one that may someday rank with the likes of _The Sopranos_ and the first season of _Twin Peaks_ as a contender for the second best TV show ever (after the incomparable _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_; one of the show's producers and writers is former Buffy writer Drew Z. Greenberg, and the cast includes Buffy / Angel mainstay Julie Benz).

Dexter is a sociopath, someone with no human feelings and hence no natural, inner moral compass, and he has an unquenchable blood lust that drives him to kill. But he had the great grace to have been the adopted child of a police officer, who (as we see in terrific flashbacks) successfully instilled in him a complete moral code, which he adheres to on a strictly intellectual level. This is an utterly brilliant concept (which I assume derives from the novels it's based on), one that allows the writers to explore the nature of moral behavior and of what it means to be human (Dexter is, in a sense, an alien).

Another thing the show is doing brilliantly is moving at different speeds in parallel. There is a primary apparent season-long story arc (concerning a cat-and-mouse game between Dexter and a serial killer), and a a secondary arc involving Dexter's sister's police career. The first handful of episodes include a very powerful completed arc concerning one of Dexter's police colleagues and a local crime lord, while two of the four episodes so far have also included a self-contained story spliced among (and playing off) the ongoing ones. I've seen the future of TV season structuring, and this is it.

While the writing isn't quite up to the brilliance of the best of _House_, it's been excellent. The cast and production are terrific. The only reason you wouldn't want to watch this utterly brilliant show is the frequent use of extremely graphic images: there have probably been more severed body parts shown in these first four episodes than in the first four episodes of every other TV show on the air combined. If you can stomach that, tune it for a mesmerizing look at what makes us human -- or inhuman.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

His does it so well, it completely let you forget that he played the role of David in Six Feet Under (my favorite of all time-series!). And all the characters in the five seasons are really wonderful, but I especially liked Julia Stiles. She's playing her part very nice!! Lithgow in season 4 does his part only as he can do and it works fine for me! Can't wait 'till he returns! (he must return!!) Here in Holland ""Dexter"" airs on a non-commercial canal en mostly about 23.00 h. at night. Nobody in Holland heard of this series, unless they watch in online or on DVD. And that's a pity...

But i do think that the characters in this TV show were pretty good yet we see a lot of death in their development and i think that these deaths make more suspense but i don't think that all the characters that died in this TV show (important characters) is necessary because the ending came with a death of a really important character and thats one of the reasons that makes this ending one of the worst.

36,9.0,16 June 2009,"I recently bought Season 1 of Dexter in an attempt to finally find a show worthy of replacing The Sopranos as my number one TV drama obsession. Boy, did I find it. Despite taking a few episodes to really get going, Dexter unfolds superbly, bringing its many plot twists together to form a tightly woven package with highly skilled performances and excellent writing.

The central performance of Michael C. Hall is always riveting, as this compelling actor enables us to understand, and even sympathize with, his many predicaments. His attempts to juggle his carefully-constructed, idyllic domestic life with his code-driven nightly stalkings and executions form the central interest of this enthralling series. This is one of the great many reasons why The Sopranos was so impressive; watching Tony struggle with the demands of fulfilling his dual familial role of father and mob boss was the essence of the series, and from this, other strands were allowed to develop. Dexter also has this quality, one of many qualities, it must be added.

The writing, as has been mentioned, is razor-sharp. The characters are rich and alive with personality, and as the first series develops so too do the character arcs. Lieutenant LaGuerta and Dexter's sister Deborah, in particular, are well-rounded, multi-dimensional creations, and they are played to perfection by Lauren Velez and Jennifer Carpenter, respectively. There is a palpable sense of tension and excitement as the walls begin to close in on Dexter, and this reaches boiling point in Season 2. The plot is never less than intriguing, and careful and intelligent use of flashbacks allow us to gradually learn more and more about the monster(?) that is Dexter. The editing and camera-work keep a good pace to proceedings, and the lighting is always excellent, especially in the disturbing night scenes.

The impressive opening sequence is particularly noteworthy in its use of extreme close-ups that show a man doing seemingly normal, everyday tasks to put himself together, but if one looks beyond these mundanities a much darker picture will be revealed. The music is eerily effective here, and maintains a high level of quality throughout - always tense, and evocative of the given situation.

So: uniformly excellent acting, sharp dialogue, well-developed characters, intelligent plotting, creative and absorbing camera-work, and a deliciously dark humour make Dexter one of the best shows on TV right now, and further proof that the last 10 years has been the golden age for dramatic television.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

The second Season started off good too, but at the end of this Season Dexter should have been caught by the Police/FBI for all the mistakes he made and traces he left. This is where Dexter died for me. But because of its success in the beginning the saga of dexter continued and there came another aspect into the series, the commercialization. Suddenly the relations of the characters became ever more important, just as in any other sitcom and Dexter's kills ever more sloppier. His mistakes mainly kept the story alive and it became really easy to foresee the main plots of Dexter's story because what ever he could do wrong he did. The original Dexter acting according to his codex/logics was gone. What started off so great ended in a mediocre series.

49,6.0,4 June 2019,"Dexter Morgan isn't like other serial killers; when he was young his stepfather, a Miami homicide detective, realised something was wrong with him and instilled a moral code into him. If he is to kill he must only kill those who deserve to die; specifically killers who have managed to evade the legal punishment. When he isn't killing killers he works as a blood splatter analyst for Miami Metro police's homicide department. Over the course of eight seasons a variety of killers threaten the people of Miami... typically one main serial killer per series plus several minor killers Dexter needs to deal with. He is also in a relationship with the mother of two children from a previous abusive relationship and has a step sister, Debra, who is an officer in the same police department.

Dexter is obviously the most important character but Debra comes a close second. There are also the other members of the homicide department, and his step father... the latter might seem a little odd as he died before the series started. He doesn't only appear in flashbacks but frequently Dexter converses with him; as though in an inner monologue with his conscience.

I really enjoyed this series; normally when working through a box set I'd take a break between seasons but here I watched it straight through. Dexter is a great central character; given what he does we should hate him but Michael C Hall does a great job making him sympathetic... of course it helps that his victims are worse than him. Jennifer Carpenter is equally good as his foul-mouthed sister; a more emotional character who provides a great balance to Dexter. The other key characters are all good and nicely varied; Rita, the girlfriend with an abusive ex; Lt. Maria LaGuerta, the boss who plays office politics; Vince Masuka, the hilariously perverted pathologist and Sgt Doakes, an officer who thinks there is something wrong with Dexter, to mention just a few. Given the subject matter it is hardly surprising that it is often very bloody and violent. There is also strong language, mostly from Debra, that might offend some viewers. The story plays out really well with elements that feature in just one episode; season long plot strands and character development that takes place over all eight seasons. There are quite a few twists and some real surprises. Overall I'd say this won't be for everybody but if you enjoy crime drama which is gripping and at times darkly funny this is a must see.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
50,9.0,30 August 2020,"Been on my radar for more than a decade. Jus finished watching all the 96 episodes in 30 days on Amazon Prime. It ain't a record but the addiction with the character Dexter made it possible for me n the other factor is the lockdown.

The character Dexter is a lovely manipulator wher he acts accordingly to the situation. A true psychopath.

This series will make u ask q whether the character is truly living a double life of that of a serial killer n that of a family man working for the Miami homicide department as a forensic expert.

Although some of the scenes r far fetched, the series is very intriguing n captivating n that is only cos of the character Dexter played very well by Michael C Hall.

Many fans were upset at the finale episode but i think the conclusion is fair. The finale stayed with me for days. It is surrealistic n poignant. It may haunt fans of Dexter Morgan.

The ethereal guitar music, the double life of Dexter, the dark humor, the camaraderie between the siblings n the talking of Dexter with his dead father is amazingly done.

The dark humor is hilarious. Ther were times that during murder scenes i was laughing n my wife was kinda wtf.

E.g. A serial killer known as Tooth Fairy labels Dexter a sick mother*ucker.

Also when Dexter praises the same killer regarding his act near a cop's/attorney's house n the reply of the killer is hilarious.

The showdown between Dexter and Ray (horned helmet aka the Minotaur killer) is full of tension. The way Ray chases his victims in his maze before either brutally beating them or maiming them with an axe is terrifying.

The finale episode of the 4th season came as a shock. Cudnt believe my eyes. Thot mayb it is jus a dream.

Check out Christina Cox as the villainous cop, one helluva hot babe.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

Dexter is one of the most complex and well-constructed characters in Hollywood. It's a shame that the show ends up getting repetitive, but it's still good, there are some things that I find very forced (like when Deb falls in love with him)

54,10.0,26 September 2013,"What a series, great series, July arrived and we all sat down to watch season 8.

At the beginning of season 8 I was hopeful, mixed emotions for characters such as Zach Hamilton and Evelyn Vogel, but overall I was enjoying it, then this finale was scheduled, so I watched it.

First of all I would like to say sorry to the people who have watched and waited for every single Dexter episode and season, as in they watched the first ever episode on its release date. Unlike me, I got the season packs and just watched from season 1 to 7. Anyway, I can only imagine what it is like to finish your 8 years of love for this series, with this finale, You would kind of feel it was a little bit wasted after all those great episodes.

The thing is with the finale is, I kind of wanted to feel sad, I couldn't because the ending was so, so, so rushed. I remember a series by the name of ""Last Resort"" Huge potential, looked great, but the final episode was rushed.

When you enjoy the majority of the previous seasons of Dexter, you kind of feel the writers are perfectly capable of doing it again for the last season. I understand that there was a change in writers for this season compared the earlier ones, The older writers must be sitting on there stacks of cash laughing down at the below par season 8. Thing is with series' its a marathon, not a sprint.

Right now there's not much we can do other than move onto the other series', however I kind of hope they just remake season 8. Someone suggested Dexter: Returns, which seemed silly but I could see a writer seeing that potential gap in the market and seizing it. I know for sure i'd watch it.

More about why season 8 was below par; The Hannah and Dexter combination was not working for me, I didn't see too much chemistry, I couldn't get myself to liking her other than the fact she's quite hot. When you look back at season 8 you can honestly say ""It's not like the previous ones"".

As much as I would love to blurt out all the spoilers and explain how horribly they are portrayed, I cant. Everyone who has completed the series knows what went wrong, and to the people who are trying to say it's actually good. No.

Goodbye Dexter.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

The strongest points of the Series are those that come from the book. But usually, the more it deviates from it, the worse the quality of the show becomes. The side characters and stories are really flat and cliché. There is not a woman in there that isn't a weak trope, you got some overemotional girl heavy on the father issues, a ""bitch"" coworker that has it in for the only other women in the department and later uses sex to get ahead in her job, a woman that completely falls apart because she thinks her husband is cheating, and has public breakdowns. Really the strongest female character in the show is a meek housewife that struggles to get over her past as victim to an abusive husband. The show is not a bad watch at all. First time i watched i was glued to the screen. But if you look past the really fascinating subject matter, and the great delivery of Micheal C. Hall, you come to realize that the show itself is very weak and that a different team of writers and a better director could have made a hell of a lot more with the ideas from the books.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

I felt strange that I rooted for Dexter's success and even wished i could be like him so not sure what that says about me LOL. The actor did a great job of being fake and showing what appeared like real struggles. I love the fake intro when he is on his boat and give ahoy out to the other captain, its soooooo..Dexter. The Batista character is awesome and a a guy you would want and enjoy as your friend and coworker. However the real brilliance of the show for me was that actress that played Deb Morgan. I looked forward to seeing her and it felt like I was a school boy and I had a crush on her. I was so intrigued every time her face showed up on my flat screen, maybe I was even giddy..I truly wish I had a girlfriend like her. I am not big on cussing and using offending words, but if she was my girl I wouldn't want her to change one bit and she made the Deb Morgan lexicon seem like true grit.

74,9.0,24 February 2014,"When I saw season 1 of Dexter I thought that it was the best show ever created. I do still believe that season 1 was a masterpiece. I also loved season 2 (my husband didn't) and season 3. After season 3 it started to flail. I kept watching, hoping that it would get back whatever magic it had those first few seasons. My husband loved season 5 though I did not like it. The last season was one of the worst. I felt that through the years Deb just kept getting whinier and whinier. I never loved her but I felt that her character had some depth (the insecure, unlucky in love, foulmouthed, tough female cop) in the beginning. By season 6 I was just sick of seeing her on screen. I don't want to spoil anything in case you've been living under a rock and have never seen Dexter, but I do understand that she went through some things and those things had a profound impact on her. Even so I hate what they did to her character. After season 3 I would watch each season and hope that the next season would be better...but it never was.

77,8.0,3 April 2021,"I'm waiting for this moment, literally. I think this'd help you decide whether to watch it or not.

This is one of the best and the most conflicting shows I've ever watched. One of a kind. I mean, how I got attached to the characters and their lives. To say the least, I've delayed watching Dexter deliberately so that I can be on it longer.

Essentially, Dexter is about a person who got so much disturbed by his mother's death that he starts finding comfort in killing people. As much as the sight and smell of blood nauseates us, Dexter loves it. Dexter lives for it.

The best part is that he operates on a code taught by his father when he learnt that Dexter was turning into a serial killer. I'd better refrain from telling you that. It continues for the whole series and you got to know what it is by watching it. Michael Hall is just about the perfect fit for the creep character. The way he looks at others( like you're looking from above your glasses, I got addicted to it. Well, I tried to practice that glare. It's just so intimidating.

Another thing this series talks about is the sister-brother relationship between Dexter and Deb. They both work in Miami metro, both quite studious in their jobs the most ambivalent in their minds. At a time, I wondered if Debra is the most conflicting character ever. But then comes into the picture,Dexter. Apart from the fact that Jennifer and Michael were a couple, nothing of that sort appears on the screen except at some part when Debra feels pulled towards him. That's where the ugliest stuff unravels, though.

The spirit uplifter guy is Masuka, though. He too would have his stuff to deal with. I mean, every character is portrayed with utmost splendor.

You gotta watch it, if you wanna find out how smart serial killers carry themselves in the society ""without getting caught"" "" Tonight is the night""","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

82,10.0,27 September 2006,"While I admit that I do have the average morbid fascination, and have the same attraction to Hannibal Lecter as everyone else, I actually found myself chuckling at some of Dexter's situations and emotions much to my dismay. I found the first episode to be promising. It shows the same anti-heroic essence that Showtime is famous for however there is a hint of Hollywood drivel about it as well.

Michael C. Hall does an excellent job at being likable. He has no other expectations to fill now. In one episode he proved he can take a character from boringly evil to someone I'd invite over to watch the Sunday game.

Julie Benz provided a chillingly accurate portrayal of Dexter's scarred and fragile girlfriend as well. One would almost expect to see her on Oprah in fact.

Along with the actors, proper credit must be given to the writers as well. These two characters, along with Dexter's adoptive father, are incredibly well created and nurtured to the point that I was willing to cheer them through their respective faults. On the other hand, the writers should be flogged for the remaining characters. In order to build sympathy with Dexter, he has been surrounded by THE most annoying people possible. For example, while I have absolutely no desire to commit any crimes outside of tax evasion, if Dexter doesn't kill his whiny, gutless, how-the-f***-did-she-become-a-cop sister, I will.

With that in mind, the promise of the recurring bad-guy killer (Dexter is the good-guy killer) will keep me tuned in as this show desperately needs a third point of interest.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

Everything seemed perfect.

After watching the last and eighth season crash and burn (the series had become ridiculous at least 3 seasons before) I have to review my grade. But do not be fooled! If the last seasons sucked, imagine how good the first ones were to average an 8. You should at least see the first season.

84,10.0,4 November 2018,"I did not mark this as containing spoilers, because I am not talking about any particular episode or plotline or character, other than Dexter. But I do mention general situations found in the show.

All these people giving the show a 10 are extremely generous. Dexter never encounters a lock he can't pick in seconds. There never seem to be alarm systems or video systems and he does a lot of things in daylight, yet his activities often go completely unnoticed. One of my favorite episodes in terms of ridiculous writing is one where he leaves a crime scene saying he's going straight back to the lab to do some work related to a death that the police are very, very interested in, but actually goes somewhere else for a long period of time. The detectives go back to their offices - the ones Dexter shares - soon after Dexter leaves, but not a single detective ever asks where Dexter is. That one was totally unbelievable. As the seasons go on, his ability to move around unencumbered by the requirements of his job just grows and grows.

I'd say give this show a chance. It's not without its own (hey, let's face it - warped) attraction. Just know that sometimes you have to completely suspend your understanding of reality.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
85,10.0,13 August 2007,"The other user reviewing this show - have we really been watching the same thing? Dexter was (highly) recommended to me by a friend, who described the it as a show about a serial killer who targets serial killers. A novel concept for a TV show, I thought. I'm always on the lookout for something new and interesting, a series which I can follow.

What my friend failed to mention is that, by day, the protagonist is a blood spatter analyst/expert, hence the show is centred around forensic science and police investigation - a very not-so novel concept for a TV show.

A lot of the dialogue is clunky and unrealistic, and also causes some of the acting to be less than convincing.

102,10.0,27 November 2007,"I became aware of the 'Dexter' TV series after I had read the first two books (I am currently half way through the third) and viewed the first series with some anticipation. Although they had stuck to the basic story, I feel that the writers have missed the point. The books are all about Dexter and his thoughts. Nothing else matters very much. The other characters such as his sister, work colleagues, etc. are largely irrelevant and very minor supporting players. However, the writers have given them personalities, lives, and screen time. Again, the story is about Dexter and he should be on the screen most of the time. No-one else matters. There were even extra characters created, tentative relationships formed and situations manufactured without Dexter input. Apart from that series one was quite well done. Series two, however is simply deteriorating into soap opera. Who cares about the life of his irritating sister? She is a terrible detective, making assumptions and jumping to conclusions. Then we have Dexter's attendance at 'meetings' to deal with an addiction that no-one asks about. Neither his girl friend or her mother or sponsor Leila actually ask what he is addicted to! Perhaps he is addicted to attending meetings? Bizarre. So much of the second series is contrived. It is irritating that most of the things which are happening in the current series did not happen in the books. It's no longer all about Dexter but about the lives of the supporting players  whom I have said are largely irrelevant. To illustrate how far the writers are 'off the plot', I have added a few SPOILERS (below)- from the books, not the TV series. If you don't want to know what happens in the books, stop reading here.

SPOILERS  but are they? Will the writers stick to the books?

Dexter's body stash is not found, there is no FBI involvement, Doakes is no longer a threat as he no longer has hands, feet or tongue (courtesy of the killer in book 2), Sergeant Deborah knows all about Dexter's compulsions and Leila simply doesn't exist. Dexter is about to marry Rita and one of her children (Cody) seems to be carrying a 'Dark Passenger' just like Dexter. And best of all... Dexter is being hunted by a mysterious stranger with a more powerful 'Dark Passenger'. I sincerely hope that the writers rethink their strategy and stick to the books. There is more than enough horror in them to attract an audience.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

104,9.0,25 December 2009,"The show is about a serial killer, who is gunning only for other killers. It's based on the Dexter books by Jeff Lindsay, but only loosely. The first season is fairly close to the first Dexter book, but after season one it derails into something quite different.

One thing you have to realize about the show is, that while the story revolves around Dexter's extracurricular activities, he is only barely the main character. The show tries to diversify by showing the lives of the other characters as well. Considering these characters are everyday cops working in the homicide department of the Miami police force, they had to spice up their lives a tiny bit. The result is basically a soap opera with lot's of romance, angst, about 10 times as extreme as anything you're bound to see in real life. Dexter's life is also spiced up, as if that was necessary, as the show tries to humanize him over the course of the series. My personal preference is for inhuman Dexter.

Of course, pretty much everything you see on TV is like that these days. Unrealistic relationships, and attempts to throw every single movie cliché into one show are hardly a strange concept. So, coupled with the originality of the premise, this is in fact one of the best shows out there, right now. I personally enjoyed it very much, but I recommend anyone to record the show before you watch it, so you can skip through the all the boring parts.

Also if you're like me and you watch this show mostly for the Dexter character, you might want to try out the books. The books are in fact so different from the series, you can read them and watch the series without noticing much overlap.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

In my opinion it's up on the same level as breaking bad entertainment wise and yet nobody I know has watched it! Michael C. Hall is really good and nails his role of creating drama but also comedy at the same time flawlessly, often when you aren't expecting, it making it more funny. The supporting cast is also brilliant with characters that are never going to make you bored at any point. The premise of Dexter sounds not very creative and almost not worthwile, but its they way the idea is portrayed and the cast that seperate it from other similar crime shows. Overall I believe Dexter is severely underated and more people need to add it to their watchlist with there being 8 seasons to keep you going with none of those seasons dropping below a ""good"" standard, bar the ending maybe.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

They know you tune in for the blood lust, not the comedy or the justice. If it was about good old fashioned vigilantism they wouldn't include the scenes of Dexter enjoying his killings.

It says a lot about modern America that this show exists. The parallels to ancient Rome just keep coming.

Try to imagine this show with a non-sociopathic ""hero"" and you'll see that you'd not enjoy it nearly as much. And that says a lot about YOU.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
116,10.0,22 March 2014,"Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall) is a blood splatter expert for the Miami P.D., and a serial killer. He is forever traumatized when his mother was killed in his presence. He is rescue by police officer Harry Morgan (James Remar) who adopted him. When he showed signs of psychopathy, Harry teaches him a system whereby he would investigate and kill only criminals. He is close to his sister police Detective Debra Morgan (Jennifer Carpenter) but she doesn't know his secret.

Dexter is my favorite serial killer good guy. Come to think of it, I don't know if there are too many other serial killer good guys. I love his matter of factness, his inability to connect emotionally, and even his inner voice monologue. The first few seasons are beyond anything before it. After awhile, it does get tiring to have people constantly just miss Dexter. But the love for Dexter never dies.... at least it never gets wrap in cellophane, cut up into pieces, put into garbage bags, and dumped into the harbor.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
117,7.0,20 January 2010,"Dexter combines the elements of what makes a show interesting and well-produced, but there's another element that lifts it up another notch into real greatness. It could be said that it's an original concept, of a blood-splatter expert in the forensics team of a Homicide squad spending his spare time killing people (albeit those who go by his ""code"" as Dexter has, given to him by his step-father, hero-cop Harry). But there's even more of an edge to it that is unexpected. Part of this comes from the actor Michael C. Hall, who steals almost any scene he's in without even trying (or rather Dexter isn't trying, he just 'blends in' as always acting bright and outgoing and personable, which he really isn't).

Another comes from the narration, which comes in sometimes while a conversation is going on with other people, like the other cops, in a room where Dexter drops in his humorous but deadpan two-cents, or just goes off on the truth of the matter for him: why he has to get away from something, what Harry's code means and changes or what he meant to Dexter as the series goes on. And aside from the strong supporting cast all around, from Julie Benz as the strong-willed but loving girlfriend of Dexter, Jennifer Carpenter as Dexter's spunky step-sister (it takes a little while for Carpenter to grow on you, but she does after a while), it's just a series of strong narratives. Dexter is like a superhero- see an episode in season two for a more literal translation of this as ""The Dark Defender""- a man of the night ala Batman and a scientist like Bruce Banner, who just has to try to hold inside his truly evil urges.

The arcs of the characters, not just Dexter but everyone, is fantastic and laid out in such a way that we can't really totally expect what will come, and so it's got some terrific suspense going for it too (re: Lila in season two, holy crap that gets good, but Jimmy Smitts in season 3 and especially John Lithgow get their moments in the spotlight too). It's a spin on the unexpected, lead by a protagonist who is somehow relatable, through his work ethic and dilemma of responsibility to his code and to those he loves, while also a total psycho. It's daring, fun, and chock-full of suspense and mystery, like good crack.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

Well, in the midst of an awful 2020 we did get some great news. Dexter was coming back! Maybe it's only a limited run, maybe there will be more. All I care about it the fact that they have a chance to correct their mistakes.

The first 6-7 seasons of Dexter is some of the best television you will ever see.

The show is full with surprises and unexpected twists, you never know what will happen next, or how it will happen. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. And to spice it up, throw in a couple of a dark humor here and there, and you got yourself one of the best TV shows ever.

Dexter is a brilliant character, portrayed beautifully by Michael Hall. It's not easy to like a serial killer, it's even immoral; but he has this sort of attraction that you can't dodge. You'll immediately fall in love with the character as he is one of a kind.

Debra is perfect for a secondary role, she's somewhat the complete opposite of Dexter, and her outgoing, not-afraid-to-say anything personality makes her character shine.

Dexter is one of those classic ""American-American"" TV shows that celebrates serial killers and the knife/gun wielding American hero. It is a propaganda piece that has unfortunately been accepted by some intelligent people as well.

I confess I watched only the first season but even giving time for a whole season to this crappy show meant I just had too much time in my hands. But it was more than enough for me to asses it as a very pseudo- intellectual show that only deserves brickbats. The plot is very unpleasant and stupid at the same time, the story moves slowly and one feels no attraction to any of the characters. Dexter is just...there. The writers try so hard to make his love interest Rita come across as the tortured poor woman that it just looks pathetic. And the other characters are just STUPID. On that note, a dialogue that comes to mind for me is Dexter saying ""If I had a heart, it would be breaking right now."" PUKE-WORTHY. Talk about lack of subtlety.

137,7.0,18 June 2014,"TV shows get better and better. And weirder and more complex too. There are a lot of great TV shows out there and Dexter is one of them. It's tough to say or compare this with something else. I started watching this right after I finished with ""The Shield"". Let's say the mind set on a couple of things weren't that different. Both have a lead character in common, who is not really a hero ... and that is putting it mildly.

Coming into this, I only knew that the actor (Michael C. Hall), whom I knew from Six Feet Under (another great show) was in this and he was ridding the world of bad people, while working for the police. Now that sounds simpler than it actually is and this is not your typical story. I also knew that Jennifer Carpenter was in this, though I had no idea what role she was playing. And I can tell you that is the best thing that can happen, if you are able to go into a show like this, with as little information as possible.

Obviously if you're still out to get information you will find it, there are enough people who like to share/spoil with the world what is happening. I'll tell you that this show is not for children (although apparently they did work on alternate versions, concerning the swearing as Ms. Carpenter confirmed on Talk Shows). But nudity and blood is not just thrown in without reason. Like the Sopranos, just because it could get away with showing certain things, it didn't just bathe in them.

The show that feels real, while being surreal (Dexters ""father"" to name but one factor being one of the surreal parts, his voice in his head, actually being what he things at that moment and not a voice over from the future, which is a common trait in TV/movies), is written and acted in a great fashion. It may have a few moments where it seems to copy itself (Doakes/Quinn analogy comes to mind, names that you'll recognize once you've watched the movie), but never really does. The dialog and the acting is on a level that never makes you question that this was written, instead it feels natural.

If you haven't hopped on the train yet, you should get on it as soon as possible. Not every show has a cliffhanger, but when there is one, it is one that will almost drive you crazy. Something that cannot be said about the show in general, because it is that good","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

142,10.0,20 February 2023,"One of the strengths of Dexter is the character development of the protagonist. Dexter is a complex character, and the show does an excellent job of exploring his psyche and motivations. His inner turmoil, as he struggles with his dark impulses and the need to hide his true self from others, is one of the show's most compelling aspects.

The supporting characters in the show are also well-developed, particularly Dexter's sister, Debra Morgan, who is also a detective in the Miami Metro Police Department. Her arc throughout the series is particularly interesting, as she comes to terms with the reality of her brother's true nature.

Another strength of the show is the way it balances dark subject matter with moments of levity. The show can be quite violent and graphic at times, but it also has a dark sense of humour that helps to lighten the mood.

However, there are some drawbacks to the show as well. Some of the storylines and plot twists feel contrived and implausible. Additionally, the later seasons of the show feel somewhat repetitive, with the same basic formula repeated over and over again.

Overall, I would give Dexter a 7 out of 10 rating. While the show has some weaknesses, it is a well-crafted and engaging series that is worth watching for fans of the crime drama genre. The show's excellent character development, dark humour, and intriguing premise make it a compelling watch, even if it can sometimes feel repetitive or far-fetched.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

A glorified serial killer is exactly the type of thing you want to see on television. I have personally never been a fan of the belief the TV, movies, music, video games, or comic books influence the forms of entertainment that they enjoy. I enjoy a fair amount of violence in my entertainment, I enjoy sensationalism, & most of all, I enjoy a good antihero, especially one that attempts to moralize the horrible things he is doing. I find it entertaining, & ""Dexter"" delivers on all counts.

You tune in & you get to escape into the life of a serial killer who is, at least, partly convinced that he is doing the right thing. And on top of the escapism the show can be pretty witty from time to time.

I'll stand by the 10 on the basis that it's a violent TV show about a serial killer that is sort of convinced they are the good guys. It's not at all realistic, the police station is clean & very well funded, it's not real life. But you don't watch TV shows to see a realistic depiction of life.

We aren't serial killers, gun totting Federal Marshals, fake psychic detectives, over sexed cops, alien obsessed FBI agents, or OCD former police officers. There is a reason why they make shows like ""Dexter,"" it's simple, our lives are boring & the better our lives are the more boring they are.

Don't be offended by ""Dexter"". Don't be that PC guy that makes PC look bad.

As someone who grew up during the beginning of the great shows of HBO like OZ, Sopranos, The Wire, i gotta say that showtime kicked HBO butt with Dexter, i mean, it isn't better than Sopranos, but more morbid.

The show has a different story in all the seasons, much like The Wire, but in my opinion it should have less episodes, like 8 per season instead of 12, it becomes a little boring, and has a lot of nonsense that goes against character, but all is compensated by the way they beautifully present the story, and the acting is just top notch, Michael C. Hall and Jennifer Carpenter really gave it all on their characters, the way Jennifer represents Debra is oscar worthy, what an actress, should have more credit.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
150,5.0,17 May 2021,"TL DR: Brilliant development. Brilliant humor. Brilliant acting. If you are a fan of serial killer series, and you are a fan of a very well done drama, this series is for you. There is absolutely no series like this one.

And just to be clear, Dexter is indeed a psychopath and a serial killer, but he is not like Hannibal, a creepy evil man that always needs to be locked away. Dexter constantly controls his urges to kill to fit in society. Dexter is cold-blooded, calculating and very introverted (which, if you are too, you will identify so much!), has a good moral code of justice, killing other ""bad"" serial killers, and day by day just tries to live like a normal guy, with his normal job.

The first episode is a masterpiece. Watch the first episode and you will get a good taste of Dexter. Season 1, 2 and 4 are masterpieces that need to be watched for serial killer fans.

-------

""I'm not lazy review"":

I gave this series a chance in quarantine. I just can't believe I missed such a wonderful series. It became my favorite series of all time

The series has a kind of dark and brilliant humor / irony that is constant in almost all conversations between the characters. Mainly because of Dexter's actions, almost everything has another ""side"" to the story, and it's brilliant because it keeps you in constant distress in almost every scene, because you know how things really went, and you're constantly scared of people finding out everything. And best of all, Dexter finds a really smart solution to almost all of his problems (many of which he created unintentionally). All of this with Dexter maintaining the appearance of a totally normal man with a normal family.

Although not a comedy series, the jokes and the humor in general are amazing. I really enjoyed it. Nothing ""teenager"" or something like that. Real adult and mature stuff (on a Breaking Bad intensity level, extreme violent people, adult workplaces, etc., if you would ask me).

The story has several developments. Both the main development and the main character are just incredibly done.

Another nice point of the story is that the things that happen are quite unpredictable, and nothing too ""forced"" just because it needs to happen. Everything that happens tends to be realistic and not something that would be impossible to happen (of course, the things that happened would be difficult and mostly impossible to happen in real life, but for a fictional series, what happens is quite acceptable). Almost everything has a purpose, and no character is undervalued. Many characters die, but with a well-justified reason (90% with a good justification, at least in my view). You will like almost everyone, and stop liking or start liking some of them after a while. Really good characters.

I believe that the 1, 2 and 4 seasons are masterpieces, it's amazing how far things have come. The other seasons are little bit worse, but there's no show with 8 seasons where every one of them is perfect, and you will definitely be hooked by then.

Please, just watch it. I beg you.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

Michael C. Hall

love this series though normally I don't like bloody shows. It puts you on edge for most part. It started strong, but it seems they run out of ideas on some episodes. All characters were great though on some parts Debra gave me headache.... I feel like they pushed the character too hard on the love part that the character was annoying sometimes.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
154,8.0,26 January 2020,"This shows potential was incredible. Season 1-4 was phenomenal (a clear 10/10), but then it went down more and more and the series finale ended in a disaster. Such a dissapointment... :'(","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
155,10.0,2 October 2008,"So far the only interesting aspect of this show is the fact that this guy is a well trained sociopath though the fact that it's overstressed through his inner monologue, flashbacks and knee-jerk reaction to ""real"" emotion i'm probably going to get tired of that. The Latin American co-worker is overplayed and kills me when he says something in Spanish and then hurriedly repeats it in English. I live in LA. I know what spanglish is. This is extremely lame. I will say the girlfriend relationship is quasi interesting but it seems to be screaming at you that they'll attempt sex and then it will get weird. shocking. Like i said, the flash backs and inner monologue trash this show. When using a subject like a socially adapted psycho you really don't need to shove down my throat the fact that the guy is a weird-o. I get it. shell of a man...blah blah blah. what else.....hummm..... well i've got this disk one of the first season and they are two, maybe three episodes left and i just don't think it will be worth watching the rest. Does it get better?","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
156,10.0,9 June 2022,"Superb series, contains everything; crime, drama, dark humor, comedy, mystery, upheavals, etc. It does not disappoint in any way. The movie line always keeps you in suspense, always new materials. I recommend it, and if you are of the same opinion, there is a little surprise attached to this series, Books ""Darkly Dreaming Dexter"" and a mini series ""Dexter New Blood"". I hope they continue with New Blood.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

But the 3rd didn't work as good.

The last season I was like wtf. Like game of thrones.... So I recommend 2 first seasons and keep going till you decide not too.

I even imagined a season story where dexter would be visiting like Scotland or Ireland(is red hair lol) and would use is knowledge to track down an evil Priest. Then came season 4 with a religious killer ! Strange....","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
163,9.0,3 August 2024,"Season 4 of ""Dexter"" was both fun and nightmarish. It managed to strike an incredible balance between gallows humor and trauma. The series created its own unique, insulated world where we became invested in the hopes and dreams of the dysfunctional, vigilante murderer Dexter Morgan. This season revolved around Dexter's quest for a balanced home life while satisfying his inner bloodlust. Ultimately, it taught him a tragic lesson: there's no way to serve two masters. The finale left us with a mix of emotions, reflecting Dexter's evolution and the consequences of his choices. I love Dexter serie.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
164,10.0,7 May 2023,"I just finished binging 96 episodes of Dexter's from beginning to end and it gives me vibes of classics such as ""the wire"" or ""the sopranos"".

However, unlike those series, It surprisingly consistent across 8 years of shooting and you would be hard press to know this is now almost 20 years old.

It's also very consistent in the writing department. The first season is an adaptation of the book while the subsequent ones introduce the villain of the year, usually a very high profile guest star.

Even the shooting angles are kept consistent across episodes and we are treated to a few cross-references and enough Easter eggs without it being gaudy.

Having ended in 2013, the show is mercifully free of any woke material, and for those of you tired of politics rammed into everything we watched these days, it is a very good choice.

Direction is good but nothing incredible and the writing is solid without being out there. We get the usual deus ex machina, and only 3x7 stands out as being particularly well written.

The show ends rather abruptly and you can tell midseason that they were given their marching orders as suddenly arcs are droppped, secondary characters disappear and the story takes a turn for behaviors that are out of character.

Overall, the budget does not match some of the more outlandish settings and you will quickly get used to some rather cheap sets, including oh hum ""airports"" and ""restaurants"".

Acting is on point but for a show about serial killers. It is surprisingly light on psychology and just repeats the same point over and over again which can get a little tiring.

However, it is extremely bingeable and again the absence of woke content suddenly gives it a new shine in 2023

7/10, solid television, would be a 5 or 6 usually but it's consistency saves it.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
165,8.0,15 June 2016,"It says a LOT about modern audiences that a show in which someone commits a slow BDSM murder on a crying human being in the opening five minutes of the first episode is one of the biggest hits in TV history.

I don't care what kind of excuses the show gives itself - this is about a man who methodically hunts people down and the climax is him slaughtering that individual in a creative, brutal manner.

Wake up call to people who enjoy this series: you are a closet sadist and/or masochist. You need to open up to yourself about these hidden feelings.

Addition: This is not what a psychopath (APD) is like. I have spent time with psychopaths before, even shared a house with one for three years, and they are absolutely NOT like this. Dexter is the Hollywood interpretation of antisocial personality disorder, not the real deal.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
166,10.0,8 February 2022,"The only problem with this series is that the Deb is endlessly horny. It was pretty useless to watch their ridiculous relationships. Dexter is a classic for me.

168,10.0,6 October 2020,"I enjoyed this series, like a lot!

It is a very unique show. The feeling of survival and never ending criminals lurking, and dexter as the main character, it is super fun, seriously.

It had very good seasons as well as some neutral ones. Overall, quality had its stability, the sense of the show continued. And I mean even the 6th and 7th season perhaps.

However, my kind of generous rooting for the show cannot let 8th season be another valuable season. The theme of the show and moments it sure provided early on, 8th season didn't introduce any excitement whatsoever. It was a dull, uncared repetition which I am sure everyone realized. Imagine how worse it would feel if Evelyn Vogel was not portrayed by that wonderful lady!

I just realized maybe there should be a story behind this 8th season ridiculousness... anyways...

Despite, especially the uniqueness of the show and of course well execution of it, will always make this show in the 'one level behind top tiers' for me.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

The series is really great in this aspect, Dexter may be the best serial killer series ever (there aren't many options anyway). If I didn't really think that the story got worse towards the end, it would have been rated 10 in my eyes. But still, the character of Dexter is unique in my eyes, I have never seen a character like him before. Additionally the bond of love with his sister reminded me once again how much I love my sister, but in the way it should be ofc :))","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

Because it's difficult to understand Dexter and to have empathy for him at first. Then, each season is great with great new characters and a great casting. I must say, one of the best thing in Dexter is the casting and the performance of all actors. The story writting is also great. My advice, don't stop at the first episodes, try at least 2 seasons.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

173,10.0,14 October 2021,"A very captivating series, the script is super clever and well built, and I liked it terribly, the actors are well chosen especially Michael C. Hall who plays great For a long time I wanted to look at the Dexter, but being too long I never started it. Thanks to quarantine I saw the best series, in my opinion.....","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
174,10.0,28 September 2021,"First, full disclosure. I don't think Dexter is a 'monster.' I have no moral dilemmas with his character. I like what Dexter does. He's a trash man. He provides a very valuable service to society.

I hadn't watched Dexter since it first aired, but I wanted to rewatch the series preparatory to a new and final season that was announced, especially after Season 8 was such an unmitigated disaster. I hope the new limited series, Dexter: New Blood, coming in November, can give Dexter the appropriate send-off it deserves.

The absolute highlight of the series continues to be the perfectly written and note-perfect delivery of the narration by Michael C. Hall as 'Dexter.' They are so wry and dry, almost British.

Also, it remains a great mystery as to where Dexter's money comes from. He has a great boat. Bought his apartment, then the one next door and broke through. Employs a full-time Nanny. Has a go-bag with 10's, if not 100's, of thousands in cash in multiple currencies and several passports. All this on a salary of about 50K.

As is becoming a popular theme with popular streaming series', most of them run too long. There are so few 'The Soprano's' that had perfect runs and brilliant endings. Even 'Breaking Bad' ran one season too long, with the Season 4 ending, with Walter White saying to Skyler: ""I won!"" Being perfect. So did 'Boardwalk Empire' with a terrible final season. So too, Dexter should have ended after Season 4. Season 6 was the worst, closely followed by Season 8.

Lazy, Hollywood writing: Dexter coping to be a drug addict for an entire season. Deb being promoted from patrolman to Lieutenant-absurd. Dexter toying with 'Trinity' passing up repeated opportunities to kill him.

Michael C. Hall is just outstanding in the title role. He has a very tough job to stay within the lines. In less skilled hands, 'Dexter' could have become unlikeable and then the show would fail. Conversely, he could have become over-the -top camp and then we wouldn't have taken his 'dark passenger' seriously. Hall captures the multi-faceted aspects of Dexter's character, and then delivers the brilliant narration of 'Dexter's' inner monologue. His interactions with 'Harry' are also a highlight.

Jennifer Carpenter inhabits the character of (Deb) and delivers humor and pathos. But, upon second watching, I found her (Deb) original charms to be tedious and annoying. Her insatiable neediness, wearing. Her rude, profane manner, tiring. In addition, Deb is one of these people who are always upset when someone close is withholding info. ""Tell me. Tell me. I need to know."" Then, when they find out, they cannot handle it and blame the messenger. She is a bad interviewer because of the fact that she cannot shut up. She talks when she should listen. She has no poker face. She is an emotional wreck who has no business being a homicide investigator. I found her annoying in the extreme as her insatiable neediness, combined with absolutely no filter on her motor mouth, wore thin on this viewing. As well as her raging promiscuity and her hopeless taste in men.

James Remar is note-perfect as Dexter's deceased father, although he is overused in some episodes.

Julie Benz, is not my cuppa, but worse her manipulative, passive-aggressive character was even more annoying than her acting. I was glad when she was out.

David Zayas is an absolute standout as Sgt. Angel Batista, character-wise solid gold. He's the best policeman and the best person on the force. He also has some of the best dead-pan lines, beautifully delivered.

C. S. Lee's 'Masuka' is a delightfully, creepy, comedic foil and tension breaker.

How did Desmond Harrington wrangle a 'Guest Starring' credit? Not a fan of the actor, nor the character.

I was surprised to see that I changed my view of LaGuerta. I really disliked her in my original viewing, but this time around I found myself wondering why I had done so. She is perfectly played by Luna Lauren Velez.

The guest stints: Ray Stevenson was my favorite, followed by John Lithgow and Jimmy Smits.

Glad Deborah is dead she was so annoying! Can't wait for the new plot but I'll admit will be missing most of the original cast.

But otherwise this show is just perfect. And the protagonist, Dexter Morgan- a serial killing psychopathic anti hero, is surprisingly the fictional character that I can most relate with.

Seasons 1-5 and Season 7 are among the best things ever created for television. It has everything- humour, family drama, brilliant acting, excellent writing, haunting soundtrack and a wonderful cast. There are many thrilling moments in every episode and they usually end on a cliffhanger. Dexter is a good choice for binge-watch.

Even those who haven't watched Dexter might be familiar with the premise since it's one of the widely discussed shows. Dexter Morgan is a unique character in entire fiction played amazingly well by Michael C Hall. He also delivered probably the best voice over narration in tv show history. All other cast have acted so well such that I can't imagine them in any other roles. Deb, Batista, Masuka, LaGuerta, Lundy, Doakes, Trinity killer, ice truck killer.. damn, the show had too many strong characters.

I highly recommend this show to anyone who is looking for a good crime thriller series. Perhaps you want to skip the finale and just wait for season 9 to release.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

Then I got that empty feeling when you finally finish a box set so I searched for suggestions for similar box sets to watch and was not disappointed with Dexter!

Compelling, edgy, nervy, clever and definitely one of the most suspenseful watches I've seen!

One of those watches where you don't want to turn the tv off and go to bed. Literally keeping you up late at night watching more! Many great late nights watching this.

The dynamics with the cast, filming style and well coordinated flashbacks to let you into the mind of the character make this a must watch!!

Dexters sister is weird, not very smart and permanently angry. Her serial killer boyfriend was really weird too, and how we're supposed to believe she fell for him is just beyond me. His nemesis Sgt. Doakes is absolutely terrible - lousy acting and frankly the biggest stereotypical cliche of an angry black cop that I've ever seen. It's embarrassing! That character ruined it for me. His dialogue was so fake. The other characters are also very annoying . . . . the Asian forensic scientist who's basically a pervert who constantly makes lame sexual jokes, the cliche latino detective who has problems with his wife, Dexters girlfriend, Rita, who started out as this shy, sheepish, abused woman, and ended up being a tough, take no prisoners type . . . . . . . the list goes on and on.

Season 5

Season 5 is a little odd for me. This is another really good Dexter season, but again I feel like there was a lot of missed potential. This season we get introduced to Lumen, a rape victim, who becomes Dexter's partner somewhat like Miguel. There's actually a group of villains, the barrel girl gang, this season, but none of them are really developed except for the main villain, Jordan Chase, and even then he wasn't that developed. He was a pretty interesting villain, basically motivating people with their primal urges. I also like the watch gimmick, but apart from that, we just don't get enough of him. He did have a great scene with Dexter, where he breaks him down. I actually really hated Lumen's character at first. I mean when we first meet her, she escaped from the gang, after being raped and tortured, and she's a mess, who would do anything to survive, but they did a great job of developing her character. I actually really liked her near the end of the season. This season we also get even more development for Debra, and some great moments with Quinn, but also La Guerta really starts to become annoying. To give even more intensity to this season we get Stan Liddy who's another one of the characters who gets close to discovering Dexter, he was honestly really annoying, but in a good way. The only real complaint I have with this season, apart from what I've already mentioned, is how quickly Dexter gets over Season's 4 aftermath. I don't know, I just felt like he should've had more time to deal with it. Overall I think this is the middle section of Dexter's Seasons in terms of quality. A really solid season overall, with mostly above average episodes, but it never really teaches ""amazing"" level for me. 8.3/10

Season 6

Season 6 is one of the worst seasons of Dexter. I don't think it's bad necessarily, but it's just kinda okay. This season has Dexter learning about religion for some reason. I felt like it could've gone some interesting ways, but nothing really comes from it. I feel like this season as a whole is kind of a waste. I mean the entire season is basically build up to the last episode, with a big reveal, but that reveal could've easily been done last season. This season is just weird, but not in a good way. The villain just keeps going back and forth, and while he had potential, he was uninteresting. Most of this season was just not engaging. There were some really obvious and stupid reveals. the writers seemed to have gotten lazy, leaving a bunch of plot holes. There's this episode which should've easily been one of Dexter's best episode. It could've been an arc for the character even, but it's wasted in one episode, and brings up a bunch of plot holes, and really stupid things. Up until this season that was the worst episode in the series. It's just odd. Again I don't think this season is bad, I think it's just kinda okay. It does have some redeeming qualities. The finale was actually great, and the twist was fantastic. Also Quinn's and Batista's sub plot was entertaining for some reason. There was a new character, Brother Sam, he wasn't that important, but I liked him. It's just an okay season, with the finale saving it from really completely failing. 6.5/10

Season 7

Fortunately after one of Dexter's worst season we get one of Dexter's better seasons. Season 7 deals a lot with the repercussions of Season 6's finale. We get some seriously fantastic scenes with Jeniffer Carpenter, who plays Debra. This is when we really see her even more broken character. Dexter also has an interesting arc of actually feeling more and more. We get quite a few antagonists this season. We have Hannah McKay, Isaak Sirko, and La Guerta, with some other smaller villains. They were all surprisingly good. First I have to praise Ray Stevenson, who plays Isaak Sirko. Woah, he's another one of my favorite villains. He was so great. He's got the physical presence, and he's could probably kill Dexter with his bare hands, but he's also only doing this for love. He was one of my favorite Dexter villains. It just really disappoints me how early they got rid of him. He could've easily been the main villain of the season. This season also has a lot of missed opportunities. Last season we get introduced to Greene, who's another one of those characters who gets close to discovering Dexter's secret, and he had the potential to be a great villain, but he's wasted pretty early on. I do have to say this season also has some of the best side villains. Usually Dexter would have a weekly villain, but instead of having them for one episode, they use them for a few more, which really made these smaller villains much better. This season has a lot going on. Most of the characters have something to do which is great. It just feels like the writers really tried their hardest to give us one last great seasons before the completely ruin it in the final season. Once again this season had some really intense moments especially near the finale, when LaGuerta starts to suspect Dexter as the bay harbor butcher. I think she was built up really well, because she really becomes unlikeable in the last few seasons, and this makes her a great antagonist. The finale was another intense episode, and again Jeniffer Carpenter gives an amazing performance. This is probably the season with the most sub plots, and missed opportunities unfortunately, but it is one of my favorites nonetheless. I do have to say, while Dexter's arc is interesting, some things that happened with Hannah McKay really started to annoy me. Overall though this is one of my favorite seasons. There were a lot of missed opportunities unfortunately. It had so much more potential, but at the same it brought us a lot of great moments. Isaak Sirko is amazing, Debra is amazing. Most of the characters have something to do, which was a little bit of an issue in previous seasons. I just really enjoyed this season despite some disappointments. 8.6/10

Season 8

The final season, and unfortunately the worst. I think what really annoyed me is that it actually had a pretty good start. It introduced some new concepts, but they're all wasted. The big twists from the finale are resolved so easily. Characters have nothing to do Anymore. We have this weird sub plot with Masuka that doesn't go anywhere. The villain had a lot of potential, but he's forgotten for many episodes. Dexter has done a great job of not relying on filler, but this season is basically mostly filler. It's just so disappointing. Like Season 6 I don't think this is a bad season either. In fact despite all the complaints I just mentioned it does have a lot of redeeming qualities, but it's just so disappointing for the final season, and the finale is really stupid. I really liked this sub plot with a potential apprentice for Dexter, but it was wasted. Dr. Evelyn was a good addition to the cast, and I enjoyed a lot of the scenes with her, but she becomes a little dumb later on. I liked the sub plot with Elway and the private investigators. Dexter's cinematography has been mostly average, but this season suddenly gets some really good cinematography to be honest. Also the music has been solid for the entire series, but I think this season gets some of the better tracks. Unfortunately it keeps getting worse as the season continues, until it reaches its worst episode yet in the finale. Like the season overall I think the finale started off pretty well too. I wasn't liking the direction it was going, but I was willing to accept it. For most of the episodes I was thinking to myself ""this isn't as bad as everyone says"" but then it seriously becomes stupid. How could such a great show just fade away in such a lame way. It ruins the character development that Dexter has had, and it tries to make it feel like it's a genius ending, when it makes no sense, and is filled with plot holes. It's just bad and disappointing. 5.9/10

To sum my thoughts on the overall series. Dexter is a seriously great, and viciously entertaining show. It's just so good and I really recommend it. The start is definitely better than the end. It stumbles more on the second half of the show, but most of the cast is so great even the more disappointing seasons are still quite entertaining. I wish this series went on longer because there were still a lot of things they could've done. It really disappoints me how badly it ended, but I'm still glad I watched the entire show because it's truly great.

The average score of the seasons is about an 8/10, but I'd personally give the overall show an 8.5/10.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
205,8.0,8 December 2010,"I only made it through the first three episodes of the first season, so unless the show has gotten a whole lot better since then, which I doubt, I stand by my 1-star rating.

This show is kind of like what would happen if they decided to make American Psycho into a TV series, and hired the writers and of a cheesy sitcom, a director whose last project was a high school play, and actors who previously only worked in porn.

Okay, yes, Michael C. Hall is great in the show, but you know what he'd be even better in? A show with good writing and a decent supporting cast. I think the worst thing about the show has to be the voice-overs. They're just insulting. It's like they're saying, ""Don't worry audience. We know it hurts to think, so we've done all the thinking for you. You see, Dexter is very much aware that he's a very hollow, emotionless killer, but just in case you forget, we'll have him remind you about every 3 minutes or so.""

Although many believe otherwise, I think the ending was the best way they could have ended a show like this, and for that I give it 10/10.

But wow... this is a fantastic show on so many levels. Beautiful shots of Miami, a great cast (every single person), a light and sometimes comedic undertone and there was something else.... yes: a psychopathic serialkiller as the main lead. In 8 seasons, the show takes you on a very entertaining ride where Dexter is followed in his double life as a forensic analyst on one side and a killer on the other. Very well written, great suspense and each episode is a big hook to the next one.

I've recently seen the movie Joker and in this show, something similar is being done. You cannot help feeling sympathy for a killer. You get to know his background, you see people accepting what he is and does and somehow you understand the why and the how. In a lesser way, this is also done in Breaking Bad.

Are we arrived in an era where criminal and unlawful traits are glorified, or are these shows examples and oubursts of the darkness that is rooted in human history to reflect our shadowside, so we can heal?

I'm rooting for the latter and in the meanwhile I enjoy shows like these!","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
212,10.0,28 March 2019,"(This is part 1 of 2 of my Dexter Review. If you want to read the whole thing, check my IMDb profile for the other part.)

I finally watched Dexter after many people recommending it. I have to say I really loved it. I'm gonna go through each season and give it my thoughts without any big spoilers, and in the bottom give a rating for the season, and the overall rating of the show will be based on the averages of every season.

Season 1

Season 1 introduces us to our surprisingly lovable and charismatic serial killer. I was instantly drawn Michael C Hall's great performance as the psychopathic protagonist, Dexter Morgan. All of the cast was really good too, however I wish they gave the side characters a little more development. They're all really well written and acted. Debra Morgan, Dexter's sister, was actually one of the best characters in the series. At first I thought she was a superficial character, but we soon see how broken she is. All the characters have their distinct personality and function. Even the least developed character, Masuka, just brings some needed comedy to the series. I really like how we see the transformation of Dexter through flashbacks, and visions of his father, Harry, James Remar, who does a great job. The mystery of the identity of the ice truck killer is engaging. The identity was also pretty unpredictable in my opinion. I genuinely didn't see coming who it was. If I have any gripes with this season it would be that the villain could've maybe been a bit more developed, and had more of a distinct personality. I found his reveal a bit odd and even somewhat cliche. In fact like I mentioned earlier, most of the side characters aren't developed enough. I do love how focused the initial season of Dexter is, but we really don't know much of these side characters. Overall though this season was great. It gives us a feel for the dark, violent and even funny at times, but surprisingly well thought out series. A lot of sub plots are set up, and they all come together in the finale really well to set up the next season. This is one of Dexter's better seasons. 8.8/10

Season 2

Season 2 continues to improve after Dexter's first season, bringing us a genuinely exciting and even more intense season. We've been introduced to most of the main cast now, so we're able to just jump into the story. Instead of having a traditional villain, this season has Dexter as the bay harbor butcher, who's being investigated by the Miami Police Department, and FBI. I have to praise Erik King as James Doakes. He was seriously fantastic. He was set up last season as one of the only people to suspect Dexter, and he's still one of my favorite characters after 6 seasons. He brought some serious intensity to the show. I was on the edge of my seat multiple times with Dexter's and Doakes' interactions. They're also supported by another antagonist Lila. While she isn't one of Dexter's greatest villains, she was pretty solid, and she was genuinely annoying at times, which I'm sure was the intention. Also she brought together Dexter's family sub plots with Rita and the kids, which greatly improved from last season. They were basically introduced last season, but this season we really see that Dexter really starts to care about this family, and all the characters improve. There's also another character, Frank Lundy, who's another character who gets close to discovering Dexter's secret. He was another great addition to the show. I will admit that the season finale was a little disappointing. It all gets resolved a little too convenient. The sub plots, and arcs of the story and characters don't all culminate. Some of them end earlier. Also coming off of Doakes' storyline they had too much to live up to, but it was still a solid finale, and it excites you for the next season. I do wish this season was later on in the show. It could've easily been the final season, but because of it only being the second season it had to wrap up so simply. Overall this was just an improvement over the first season in almost every way. We got more development for the characters, one of the most intense episodes of Dexter ever, and just more of what I came to love from the first season. 9.1/10

Season 3

Unfortunately Season 3 of Dexter is one of Dexter's weaker season. Its solid nonetheless, but coming from the really great Seasons 1 and 2 they stumbled a bit with this season. This season we see Dexter kill someone by accident, and get introduced to Miguel Prada, who becomes his partner of sorts. I think Miguel Prado's interactions with Dexter were the highlight of this season. This new dynamic with the characters was fresh, and really interesting. However I feel like there was a lot of missed potential here. There was another villain, the skinner, but we barely see anything with him. He's by far the most underdeveloped villain. However it Miguel Prada was pretty great, even though if he could've been better. We also get introduced to Joey Quinn this season. He doesn't do much this season, but he becomes one of my favorite characters later on. We also get even more of Dexter's family, and we soon find out he's going to become a father. I wasn't really a fan of the family at first, but they keep improving, and I think the family sub plot really came together this season. This season doesn't really feel like it ever takes off though. It's a lot of back and forth, and while this back and forth is usually good, it just never really hits the levels of ""Amazing"" like Seasons 1 and 2. 8.1/10

Season 4

The best season (In my opinion). This season we get introduced to John Lithgow as The Trinity Killer... WOAH He was so great. My favorite villain in the entire series, and one of my favorite villains in any series. He brings Dexter's biggest twist, more intensity, and I was just left speechless by him. He was just amazing. I can't praise him enough. This is the best season of Dexter in my opinion. Definitely my favorite. This season really focuses more on Dexter's family, and how he balances both of his lives. We get to see the contrast between Dexter and Trinity even though they live 2 lives in a similar way. We get Dexter's Son. We get Lundy back, which was nice. We really get a feel of Debra's broken character. We just get Dexter's best villain, and we really get to see his struggles with his double life. I just can't praise this season enough, I just loved it. The only real complaint I have with this season, is some stupid things Dexter does near the middle of the season, but I think that also adds to the series on a whole. This is when we really see Dexter's mistakes, and their consequences. Also this has the biggest collection of ""Amazing"" episodes in any other season for me. I want to talk more about it, but I don't want to spoil it for anyone, I just absolutely loved this season. 9.4/10","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

The 8th season was a but strangr, but did not firget the direction of the main chracter that it had been built up to. It was odd and dissatisfying, but made sense for the character. The original plan for the ending would have been better, but Showtime had other plans, and that's just how show business works, baby! Anyway, I thought I'd let the world in on my ovjective rating system. It's entirely based on my subjective opinionc but stull had merit and can be utilized by other film buffs like me.

After that the show runner changed and it's goes from an epic series to a disgrace. The first four seasons are great, but the final 4 are nowhere near as good.

Now that is not a crime worthy of such a low rating, but the final episode, the ending is so bad it ruins everything that came before it, if there is any justice served, any person who had any hand creative input in the ending would never work in any form of any entertainment industry again.

219,7.0,3 October 2013,"Two reasons propelled me to write this review. One is the excitement to tell how great this show was, and the second is the disappointment to scream how the 8th season miserably failed and letdown the entire 7 seasons of great work.

Usually i don't like the serial killers but this show made me do that with its great direction, brilliant acting. I should say Micheal is absolutely magnificent. If you are in a state of deciding whether to watch or not I strongly recommend to watch. Don't decide by just watching the first episode you should see at least 3 episodes to really get in to the show.

I really liked the show, I would say on of the best show in the TV history if only they had stopped with the 7th season. The 8th season drastically altered my opinion on this show with its no excitement, worst writing, bad direction and worst story. In my opinion, season ratings are 1 --> 9/10 2 --> 10/10 3 --> 8/10 4 --> 10/10 5 --> 8/10 6 --> 6/10 7 --> 10/10 8 --> 0/10","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

221,8.0,19 October 2009,"First of all, I would like to note that I'm not really the guy who likes to write comments on TV-shows, movies or anything like that. I prefer to watch a particular movie or show and move on. However, I find my self writing this comment and while doing that I realize that it is only a show like Dexter, or these few that are equally of quality to this one.

To see Michal C. Hall return on the screen every episode is just something I'm totally looking out for. This is from the moment when I first watched the show. Now I'm going to be honest, I live in the Netherlands and so Showtime is not available here. One of our national networks told us that they have plans to broadcast Dexter this year starting with season one. I keep following Dexter on the net through the so inevitable but unfortunately called ""illegal"" ways. This I'm doing since the end of season two when my brother told me about the show. By that time, no one of my friends ever heard of this show. At the end of season three, we kind of where making appointments with my friends to specifically watch a particular episode of Dexter. Me myself most of the times am getting up at 4 am just to be first to download it when ever it is released. Then later on the day, have some good time with my friends enjoying this magnificent show. Even two of my girlfriends love the show, and these are not really the girls where you would expect it from. Embrace the effect of Dexter on my life, my friends their lives all our lives. Or like the tag line says, ""Takes life. Seriously"" It sure as hell took my life, seriously!

To go a little deeper on why I think it is such a great show has the following reasons. Personally I just like crime and police shows. As long as it is no where like CSI Miami, CSI NY or CSI season 258. That I don't like. I like a show to be original, a show with a sick twist even better. For instance, ""Californication"" in my opinion, Original, nice and has in a way that same sick twist like Dexter has. (alright both made by Showtime, true) If you like the show in a way I do then you might agree that after a few episodes you connect with Dexter in way like it is normal. Some regular guy from two blocks further who has a good job at where ever that maybe.

It is the possibility that it could be your friend, your neighbour or maybe a family member. Of course, this has all to do with the personal view you get from Dexter. Any other serial killer in any other show most of the times only share there motives for slaughtering there number of people. For instance, there are not many nice serial killers in the show ""Criminal Minds"".

So I guess it is his lovely wife Rita, played far beyond excellent by Julie Benz or his ""damaged-in-her-own-way"" sister Debra played by his real life wife, Jennifer Carpenter.

The smaller but surely not lesser roles like Vince Masuka, Angel Batista and his other colleagues which make the series so complete. It is that doing his all day routines with out really pulling attention of anyone in his surroundings of who he really is. The idea that it actually could be possible to kill bad people, slaughter them, enjoy it and still get away with it.

The series are original, one of a kind... ""A Showtime masterpiece""","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

Robert C Hall as Dexter is simply brilliant. I went back and saw the series '6 feet under' in which he plays a gay undertaker. In Dexter he has become an even better and more mature actor.

He is a serial killer who has had a conscience drilled into him by his much loved father. He is a lab tech with the police and on his off-time he is a vigilante. Not by choice, as he 'needs' to kill to maintain his sanity. It seems dark when I write it out like this, but its not, there is a lot of humor, family values, et all.

The production, direction and editing are superb.

The best part is the cast, everyone is perfect. :-)........................

225,10.0,16 June 2023,"I wrote individual reviews for each season of Dexter, but I thought I'd put something here too, to sum up my overall feelings about the series.

Dexter Morgan (Michael C Hall) is a serial killer, but one with a code embedded in him by his adopted father, to only take the lives of other killers. He maintains a normal life, working as a blood splatter specialist for Miami PD alongside his Police Officer sister Deb (Jennifer Carpenter) and even has a girlfriend Rita (Julie Benz) and the makings of a surrogate family. Miami though is plagued by a new serial killer, one who leaves exsanguinated body parts for the police to find but also one that seems to know Dexter's secrets.

Watching ""Dexter"" again, the first thing that struck me was how grainy the opening episodes and especially the pilot looked. I guess I'm just used to the high definition of today and take it for granted. Either my eyes became accustomed to it, or this didn't last though, and the visuals reached a higher standard as the series ran on. I like Michael C Hall as Dexter. He narrates the story in voiceover, in an often-deadpan style. He's very good at keeping Dexter's emotions skin deep, until the aspects that really affect him towards the end of the run. The rest of the cast is pretty solid, perhaps Erik King takes Sgt Doakes a little far at times, he gets so close to Dexter it feels like they should kiss rather than argue.

The finale often features on lists of the worst endings of all time, so when I actually saw it and it was just a bit meh, rather than categorically awful, was a bit of a relief. It feels a little like what it is, a gutless studio not allowing a character to reach their natural conclusion.

Overall, I feel like Dexter was a great character, in a show that occasionally wasn't worthy of him, that ran a little too long and stretched the incredulity of its audience just a little too much.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

234,9.0,26 January 2020,"Dexter was a very well made series, depicting a likable serial killer, murdering guilty criminals who escaped justice with fresh and intricate psychological twists.

CSI by day, vigilante by night, he had charisma, wit, knowledge and a twisted mind to accomplish his own sense of justice.

Viewers connected to him, liked him, but more often than not, not understanding him, as he had a deep introvert character, hiding well behind his unique world and not letting anyone in, but a few characters who matched him and were able to connect with him, as they were basically the same with dark secrets and sophisticated minds of their own.

As often happens with series going downhill in their last season, the same happened to Dexter; but bear in mind, that's not a reason, not to appreciate and love the show, with one the most memorable experiences and play by its beautiful and diamond-bright female actresses from season 2 (the brightest) up to the last one.

Put yourself in his shoes, connect with his mind and way of thinking and you will get yourself dark Bliss and an unforgettable ride.

235,10.0,24 July 2015,"I just finished binge-watching all 8 seasons of Dexter. The show is a unique look into a psychopath killer, Dexter, that was raised and groomed by a cop father to kill serial killers. He tries to balance his ""normal life"" (a facade, in the beginning) that the outside world sees, with his ""Dark Passenger"", the need to kill. Dexter provides the best character development of any series I have watched. Michael C. Hall as Dexter was perfect. Jennifer Carpenter as Debra, his cop sister, was perfect. Each episode/season was tense, dramatic and hilarious without being forced. There were times when it became redundant and predictable, but those feelings never lasted. Although the finale was on the lame side, it sat well with me now that I have had time to absorb it. If you want a different kind of show to watch, Dexter is it.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

So a 7 isn't as bad as some may think.

With that said, I would give the first few seasons a 9 or a 10. It is a fun thriller with a unique plot. The main character is a middle-aged white, anti-hero, like many other shows, except, the show does a really good job showing you that Dexter is not really a hero. He does what he does because he wants to, and only follows a strict code out of loyalty to his father.

Seasons 1-4 are nearly perfect, but seasons 5-8 are not too good. The ending is also really bad, that's why it gets what it gets.

The acting is good. The writing is decent. The plot is very interesting. The setting is average. The characters are good except for a few. It is very intense.

That bring said I would like to defend my 8 star review. I would give this show a 10 out of 10 thsts how much I enjoyed the show. I also loved that most of the sex and most of the murder scenes are left to the imagination. The only thing that I did not like was the character Debra and the harshness of her language. I get that she was supposed to have ""a potty mouth"". I get that is the way they wanted to present her. But you would think that as her character grew and was promoted in the police department she would show some restrain She sounded like a couple of middle school kids that never got the attention they desired. It was all too adolescents with no personal growth or self respect.

WE DO NOT WANT ONLY A MERE ONE EXTRA SEASON, WE WANT TEN (YES YOU READ WELL, TEN) EXTRA SEASONS OF DEXTER WITH MICHAEL HALL AND, IF POSSIBLE, MOST OF THE ACTORS FROM THE PREVIOUS DEXTER TV SHOW!!!!

I DO NOT LIKE TO WATCH MOVIES OR TV SHOWS WHERE THERE ARE CRIMES OR DEATHS. HOWEVER, IN THE CASE OF DEXTER, THAT WAS NOT AN ISSUE AT ALL, AS DEXTER IS IN FACT MR. JUSTICE!! Michael Hall is unbelievably good in his role as Dexter!!

One unique feature of this Dexter TV show is that you hear Dexter's thoughts and you know exactly what he is thinking when an action occurs!!

Why? It's very simple: Jennifer Carpenter as Debra Morgan. I never in my life saw a movie or series that was ruined by someone like this. I must say this woman is disgusting. The way she ""acts"" is far under the brilliant other characters. This woman can not - sorry to say - act. As an actress she is a failure. The way she talks, the way she acts made me stop watching Dexter. I'm sorry. I thought it will be one of my favorite series, but now I'm at a point that has no reason to watch it.

263,10.0,1 July 2013,"Dexter, A show that has been out for quite some time now. I decided to do a review now since the final season is upon us to get a good understanding as a whole about the show. You are probably wondering, Is Dexter a good show? Short hand answer, Yes.

1. The acting is good (Jennifer Carpenter is very good at portraying different emotions. All characters are believable except Dexter to a certain extent.) 2. The production is not Top notch but its still quite pretty to watch. 3. The storyline is good (Though I do have a problem with it, that I will explain later) and 4. Do a great job of showing the morbidity of serial killers while keeping it comical and not too depressing.

However, The one thing I can say about Dexter that made me give it a 7/10 was the fact that All the seasons didn't necessarily need to happen. I feel the people who watched Dexter, blindly loved the characters and story to see that the bigger picture was nothing but fodder to keep the show going on. I had a hard time getting pass season 3 cause of the rinse wash and repeat type of Episodes that they had. You could Probably even get away with watching seasons 1-5 and still have a perfect Idea of whats going on in the story. I feel 1-5 did nothing but show petty characters that came and left as the story went on that didn't even need to happen. Season 6-7 the story was considered ""not the best season"" from Dexter fan. However, season 6-7 is when the good stuff hits the fan and the Show really starts to snowball very fast. If you are a Big fan of story all together and love watching progression go right ahead, but if you want to cut the crap out and start when things actually start to happen. I would recommend watching it at season 6. For that I give Dexter a 7/10","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
264,9.0,14 July 2020,"When I turn blind eye to most of the last 2 seasons I rate this as great show, 8/10. Serial killer catching his colleagues is intriguing and nicely executed. Forensics expert by day, our favourite murderer by night. As we go along we slowly learn more and more about this peculiar individual, get inside his troubling mind and uncover the reasoning behind his actions. He seemingly perfectly balances his urges with his daylight cover life. Alas, noone is perfect and happy sunny life clashes with his nightly antics which results in dangerous outcomes at times. Dexter learns a few things along the way. Monsters on the table are added bonus. I laughed and giggled more than I anticipated. I also cried and you will too. First 4 seasons are great, but after that show becomes more and more dull. It burns out as everything meaningful was already more or less covered, save for 2 or 3 plot twists near the end. Plague of many shows these days, they don't stop while we're cheering and continue until we're angry and yelling. Even our cunning serial killer gets dumber each season. Personal order of seasons per likability: 1,4,2,3,6,5,7,8. I came for the crime investigations, stayed for the story and didn't regret it.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
265,9.0,18 May 2008,"Dexter was such a sleeper it that when I watched it, after hearing the buzz from the US, I expected it to be pretty OK, but nothing spectacular, especially since crime dramas (csi,24, etc.) aren't my favourite. As well as that I don't really like Lost and I've grown tired of heroes. But as soon as I heard the twisted monologues of Dexter, I knew this show was interesting to say the least. And not only that, I was really produced well, the plot was flawless and the acting amazing with superb comic timing from the cast when it's needed.

I must say, Dexter is the best show on TV at the moment along with Entourage and South Park. Just don't take it too seriously, and get engripped in the story. Brilliant, bring on season 2!","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

I have watched through season six, and my opinion has not changed (although, Debra's acting has improved somewhat). It is more of an assessment of the obvious than an opinion. But I keep watching. Why? I love the character (and actor) of Dexter. It is worth watching just for him. And since there is only about six to eight episodes per year (as opposed to Lost, for instance, which had 20-30 episodes a year), I am willing to waste that amount of time.

284,9.0,24 December 2014,"I started watching this show last year. The show was intriguing. A story about a serial killer who worked as a forensics expert was such an amazing plot line and seeing what sort of adventures Dexter got into was great. I was instantly hooked from season 1. However, unfortunately, the writing slowly disintegrated as the series continued. If you want to see the best of Dexter, I suggest watching up to season 4. After season 4, the writing gets poor, and the plot line becomes pretty terrible. I will say that season 4 is definitely the best season of the show, and has the best villain of the entire show, and quite possibly, one of the greatest television villains of all time. Season 1 was great because it was the origin of Dexter and introducing us to him. Season 2 was also really great as well. Seasons 3 and 5 were OK but I wasn't super fond of the villains. Season 6 was pretty bad. The writing was just awful, and you could tell that the writers didn't really care nearly as much as before. Season 7 was also quite terrible all culminating to the all too famous Dexter ending that made many fans angry. The ending provided absolutely no closure, and made no sense. It felt like the writers just gave up on the show and threw something together at the last minute. This was definitely disappointing.

As for acting, it was pretty good for the most part. However, I still think Deb is the most annoying TV character of all time. She was just so annoying and stupid so many times in the show. Laguerta was also really annoying and moronic as well. Other than those two, the acting was great all around. The sex scenes were also awesome. There were some real hotties on the show like Aimee Garcia and Yvonne Strahovski.

Overall, this was a decent show. However, up till season 4, this show was definitely a 9 stars. However, seasons 5-7 kinda lowered the rating, and made this show a 7.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
285,10.0,6 November 2021,"Might not be a popular opinion but I really don't like Debra as a character. Her attitude, her pouting whenever she doesn't get her way, the way she talks and her actions. Her judgements towards stuff she doesn't like or agree with. She's a whiny spoiled know it all. Her facial expressions when she's talking and smugness is what really gets me. But Jennifer Carpenter as an actress absolutely killed it, if an actor/actress can make someone feel as I do towards Deb than they did an outstanding job and couldn't have done any better. I literally cannot stand her. And with every watch is gets worse. She's so whiny, such a cry baby. Makes stupid Pouty faces like she's a child not getting there way. But mostly it's her stupid facial expressions.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
286,7.0,19 September 2021,"I was a late comer to this show but that's fine as I get to watch all seasons without having to wait bonus.

It has a different take on most crime dramas which makes a nice change and am sure like many viewers they warm to Dexter as a modern day vigilante as such whom kills bad evil people . I am currently on season 4 and have found the series very entertaining and addictive.

On season 5 and the show is beginning to slip. I find it hard to accept that Dexter starts as a very precise serial killer both in planning and excution and by season 5 he has become sloppy to the point of assisting a victim not only find and kill her abusers but he moves her in to the home that he lived in with his wife and family! That for me was unacceptable as Commonsense would tell you that is a dumb idea if you want to stay under a radar and not draw any unnecessary questions there were hints of this in season 4 when he befriends the trinity killers family which to me was so absurd given his job and the fact he made no attempt to disguise his appearance not what you would expect from the character that was portrayed from the first season.

All in all I would say the first 4 seasons good after that not as good. Have to mention this end of season 5 and Dexter is still wearing the same brown grandad shirt and combats that he has worn since season 1 surely wardrobe was not that strapped for cash that they could only provide one set of clothes for him? It's not like they are the regular black clothing you would expect if committing crimes to make you less obvious.

Season 7 and the wheels have definitely come off the bus Dexter has a killer on the table and just in act of what he does he changes his mind doesn't kill them but has sex with them instead I mean WTF and here we go again another killer love interest zzzzzzzzzzzzz it's been fun but all good things come to an end and this ended 2seasons ago for me.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

Dexter is devoted to getting good press and good reviews, not to getting good audience numbers or subscribers to Showtime.

In other words, it's pretentious, forced, silly and more than a little annoying for anyone not into trying to appear ""cool"" to their friends in the media.

Dexter is also failing miserably to build an audience, despite Showtime's repeated efforts at promoting it.

So much so, in fact, that I feared disappointment merely because my standards were so high.

Thankfully, ""Dexter"" absolutely delivers. The show maintains the uncomfortable atmosphere of the novels with better fidelity than one could ever have expected, and Dexter (played by Hall) is all there.

The visual elements from the show are stunning, to say the least. Disturbing, certainly, but more than that - fascinating. Watching the show, it's impossible to keep from finding a certain agreement in oneself for Dexter. He's a monster, and yet it's completely possible to identify with him.

The most beautiful thing about the show is that the narrator/protagonist is a anti-hero type character constantly justifying his horrible actions yet the viewer can see right through the intentions of a horrible mind.

Michael C Hall is on spot during the entire show's run, truly deserving the praise he receives. His exceptional acting, great narration is just about enough to follow this show.

Supporting cast is excellent and uplifts the entire show to a different level, especially John Lithgow(Trinity Killer). All supporting actors make a place in out mind.

But honestly, if you love Dexter...then you have your own demons. This story, this character...swings hard at the audience's vices. Are you an alcoholic? A junkie? Sex Addict? Perhaps you have a sociopathic need to collect stamps? Dexter is a parallel you... His actions and his reasoning are that of an addict.

Every step of the way, I fully understood him and his reasoning. I'm an addict. Booze, sex, video games, TV, movies, books, work, collecting, smoking, music...everything I've ever loved in my life - I've gone too far, too extreme...too much. ""Tonight's the night.""

I gave a very detailed review on the series finale, which could have been coupled into a series review, but I prefer to take a different approach here.

When delivering a series like Dexter, where the core fundamentals is/are the evolutionary process of the main character; someone (sic)escaping immense trauma; constantly running but always out of breath. Its an exercise in near impossibility.

Unless every viewer is completely jaded or living in denial themselves, this might be one of the great character studies of our time.

Comparible only to the brilliant work of Vince Gilligan with Walter White as the focal point. I've yet to see anyone come even remotely close to character development than that of Dexter Morgan. (Nobody will ever top Bryan Cranston as W. W., it just can't be done)

Showtime's series' often circulate around this very theme. Hank Moody, Jackie Peyton and just about every character on Shameless are good examples.

Hank Moody might be the closest. A guy who can't get out of his own way for being himself. Breaking the self-destructive pattern and to not relentlessly give in to your inhibitions can be affinitively relayed to that of Dexter Morgan.

The entire series of Dexter is his inability to change despite a willingness. A battle from within, a tense slow-slow-burn that never changes mood and plays out like a Nirvana song.

The characters take on a life of their own. In a show where the focal character seems devoid of life, there is so much of it going on around him; innevitably his humanity reaches beyond his bubble. The horrific fear of the unknkown and the potential beauty & anger that lies outside/within.

Erik King as Sgt. Doakes and Jennifer Carpenter as Debra Morgan are the two that really tie things in at the beginning. One loves Dexter, the other hates him. Yet they are partners and they together, are fantastic. Both on screen and as characters. There's an almost peace you find between them which is annoyingly comfortable (just great writing, in a nutshell)

There's a ceetain beauty that eclipses everything in a doom & gloom reality.

In a quick summary of the seasons (no spoilers here but I will reveal cast members)

Seasons 1 & 2 are pretty much, roll with the punches. Chaos. See what life is like from the other side. Jaime Murray gives us a solid juxtaposition with her potrayal of Lila, the batsht crazy companion.

Season 3, Jimmy Smits delivers a very strong and overbearing performance. I mean that in a good way. It shows us that contrast which is desperately needed; in order for us to truly value Dexter as a person.

Season 4 brings us a hauntingly fantastic performance from John Lithgow, and is hands down the best season of the series. Almost humanises the worst in the people. The exploration of mental health, a recurring theme in this series.

Season 5 just gets darker, which after the previous season you didn't think was possible. Even further character advancement, its like watching real life. Ironic since most reality tv is scripted. Tons of great guest stars in this one from Maria Doyle Kennedy, Johnny Lee Miller, Peter Weller & Julia Stiles are with us for just the right amount of time.

Season 6, speaking of mental health and people being with us for the right time. An entire cornucopia of guest stars in this season. From the enigmatic sincerity of MOS (Yasiin Bey, aka MosDef) Edward James Olmos and Colin Hanks amongst others.

This season is just dark... plain and simple. Dark.

Season 7 brings darkness in the light. It really advances where we are with Dexter and you truly have to review the previous 6 seasons to see who he is now from who he was, as this ties in greatly with...

Season 8, the... not so grand finale. I only say that because there was a spinoff series. The ending is mired in, not controversy, but tears. Tears from all the people crying and complaining about the ending. Which was beautifully done, but this is Dexter so you know, if you expect a happy ending from a show about a serial killer, you yourself might be a sociopath.

There are great performances all around and even returning characters that all play a hand in Dexters development. Some truly solid perfomances turned in by: Margot Martindale, Yvonne Strahovsky, Geoff Pierson & Keith Carradine.

There is a lot of emotion in this show which is constantly circulating around death and murder. They take you down the darkest roads and then show you the light, but the light is only light where darkness exists, and believe me, there is much of this series without light.

It is graphic and omits nothing. All I can say is don't expect anything. Don't expect the unexpected. The audacity of thinking that you can get inside the head of one Dexter Morgan, that's an exercise in futility.

Truly one of the great shows of our time. It'll get under your skin, for better or for worse. Undoubtedly you will be left feeling something in the end, and all the way through.

This is not your typical cop drama by a long shot. Matter of fact, the crime/police-procedural aspect takes a back seat to a much larger story.

Life.... of a serial killer.

Entertainment Value 8/10 Overall Rating 9/10

As the seasons go on towards the end, the editing does get a little sloppy. However, if you were a serial killer trying to break the habit, you would have a lot of push & pull, the hesitancy which is reflected in the writing. Make no mistake, this is no mistake.

Yes, it can be annoying, but if you really want to analyse everything this isn't the show for you. You'll also realise by the time you start complaining about that, you will have been a hypocrite for watching the show that long.

Trust me, save the complaints and just watch. There's a symphony of events and you come to realise you are the one viewing things from the mind of Dexter Morgan. Don't lose sight of that or you miss the point of the entire series.

Otherwise a fantastic watch and with a second viewing, a decade+ after the show ended, and it still holds up.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
292,8.0,22 June 2024,"I am glad I gave this show a chance. It is very suspenseful, calculated, and full of laughs and excitement. Dexter is likeable, although you want to hate him. Although I can not condone his behavior, I can understand his motives behind them. The more episodes I watch, the more hidden ""treasures"" I find. If you like suspenseful, thrilling, and exciting entertainment, then this is the show for you. The characters bring a level of humor and intrigue to this drama. After watching the first episode, I was hooked! You will not be disappointed if you give this show a chance. It has become one of my favorite dramas.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

294,10.0,14 October 2014,"If you have Netflix and you haven't watched Dexter, what are you waiting for? Dexter is my personal favorite television series to date (and yes, I have watched breaking bad). I watched Dexter on Netflix earlier this year and it only took me about three months to finish because of how awesome it is.

Don't worry, no spoilers here, just an abstract to get you hooked in case you don't know what the show is about. So basically Dexter Morgan is a blood spatter analyst for Miami Metro, but by night, his 'dark passenger' must be fed. To fulfill his needs he has to take lives. In order to do this while not ruining the lives of innocent families, he takes the lives of others who have killed.

If the premise alone isn't enough to excite you, I must also say, this show is very addicting. Once you finish season one you may not want to stop.

I highly advise every human being who does not think that a show with killing is satanic, to watch this show.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
295,8.0,29 June 2014,"I gotta start off by saying the first season of this show is one of the best first seasons I have ever seen in any show. Dexter starts off with a bang. I mean we all like the vigilante superheroes. And when that superhero is a nut like Dexter it makes it much better. So like I said that first season was awesome and the second season was not far behind. This show will get you hooked from the start no doubt. But like with most other reviewers have said it does go downhill. As the show progresses and the characters evolve Dexter turns more humanLike. His sister which at the beginning her character was great but after a few seasons her character ias eratic and goes all over the place I'm talking all over the board here. To make a long story short the beginning of the show is amazing, it will get you hooked no doubt about it. The problem is this show definitely goes downhill. Every next season is not as good as the one before and by the time you get to the last season you just want to finish to show off, you're t not even looking forward to the next episode you just want the show to end already and each episode is harder and harder to watch. It turns into a chore. My opinion is do not watch the season 1 or any of this show whatsoever. Just not worth it in the end. Great first season though. My opinion is you get stoned as hell and watch the first two seasons and then u should dump the show. Peace out fellow stoners...","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

First two seasons 8-9/10 Rest between 3 and 5","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
298,4.0,3 December 2012,"I usually go by IMDb ratings to pick what to watch. When something has a score of 9+, it tends to be really good. But this.. well, it isn't.

There is no suspense, no intrigue, no clever plot. Worst of all the main character is completely unbelievable as someone who at the same time is a sociopath that feels no emotions whatsoever, and yet only tries to do the ""right thing"" by killing ""bad guys"". It doesn't make a lot of sense and the constant and tiresome voice over acting tries to sell this as layered somehow, but it just doesn't work; its not a intriguing multi faceted character, its an obvious and transparent attempt by the script writers to make an empty emotionless sociopath somehow more ""likable"". Well, I didn't like him. And not because he is a sociopath killer, there are plenty of sociopath movie characters I did like.

The other characters are better described as caricatures.

Perhaps its unfair to judge this series after seeing all 5 seasons of ""the wire"", which did live up to its score; the concept of Dexter had promise; a serial killer leading a double life could have made for a very interesting series, but this is just boring.

Don't be fooled by the score. I know I was.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
299,9.0,11 May 2024,"My comfort tv series, which I love dearly and will always cherish in my heart. I can re-watch the whole tv series (with the last season) again and again with that never ceasing interest. Michael C. Hall is the perfect 'Dexter', I could not imagine him in a better way based on the book. Although there are differences in the plots, if we compare the series and the books, I could say that Jeff Lindsay has exposed to every possible plot option and ending. Moreover, Dexter is the narrator and Michael's voice fits perfectly for story telling and commentary, while you are able to see his point of view as well as the way he blends with the environment.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

Furthermore, they see all other living creature as lacking innocence, apparently. It disgusts me how it is OK to kill any non-human animal while it's an universal crime to kill an ""innocent"" (human, of course). Give me a break, and stick back all those twisted Christian values where they belong.

Apart from that the show is somehow predictable, it goes down after the trinity arc, it has lots of continuity errors and flaws in details (which is not good for a forensic show). It's also interesting to see how everybody's sense of security, except for Dexter, is so extremely crappy, and how he doesn't seem to find problematic to tail somebody clearly while everybody else does.

Anyway, still the show deviates from the majority of trashy and clichéd material the industry spits on us. Then, again, that might just be another trick to make the show look attractive, rather than being an inherent quality.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

314,10.0,5 August 2019,"How this show maintained an 8.7 rating throughout it's entirety is dumbfounding. Appalling really. It gets so bad in the later seasons it nearly ruins the brilliance the show initially held.

If you haven't watched Dexter, I'll give you a tip right now. Watch it, but STOP watching after season 2. This show is a classic example of corporate greed overtaking art in the worst possible way. The series should've been 2 seasons long. Even 1 season and this would go down as one of the greatest shows of all time.

The plot is excellent. A serial killer with a code, who hides in plain site. A brilliant vigilantly cleaning up the messes that the law can't touch. The twists and surprises and brilliance of how it all ties together in the first 2 seasons are masterful....then....someone let a grenade off and it all went to hell.

It's easy to get sucked into this show because it starts off brilliant and the character development is gripping, but I warn you, just stop after season 2. By the time it gets to season 7 & 8 it's a shell of what could've been and it's down right awful. I was watching a later episode and my girlfriend overhead some of the dialogue from the other room and asked if I was watching the CW. The story line gets absurd and the acting falls apart (who could blame the actors when they're given such drivel to work with).

The ending is atrociously predictable and lame. It's just sad that a show with such potential was thrown down the incinerator with such awful writing towards the end. As with many shows that go far too long, the ending fails miserably and will leave you wondering why you just spent hours and hours of your life hanging on to see the finale.

Supporting characters like Deb,Rita,Angel Batista and even comic relief characters like Masuka are all very well written.

Seasons 1-4 are some of the greatest television in history and 5 and 7 seasons are extremely underrated and superb too even the least critically acclaimed seasons like 6 and 8 while flawed still have solid writing and interesting twists the ending of Dexter show is poetic,deep,underrated and way better than New Blood ending in my opinion.

My favorite season is season two, the hunt for 'The Bay Harbor Butcher' is the absolute best.

The ending of this show is one of the saddest I have ever seen, I can understand the low rating of the last episode but I simply don't agree.

325,7.0,14 July 2024,"""Dexter,"" which aired from 2006 to 2013, is a groundbreaking series that deserves a solid 10/10 for its compelling storytelling, complex character development, and unique blend of crime thriller and dark comedy. While the series has an ending that left me feeling a bit disappointed, the journey leading up to it is nothing short of phenomenal.

One of the key strengths of ""Dexter"" is its intriguing premise. The show follows Dexter Morgan, played masterfully by Michael C. Hall, a forensic blood spatter analyst for the Miami Metro Police Department who leads a double life as a vigilante serial killer. This duality creates a fascinating dynamic as Dexter navigates his personal code of ethics, known as the ""Code of Harry,"" which dictates that he only kills those who are proven to be guilty of heinous crimes.

Michael C. Hall's performance is a cornerstone of the series' success. Hall brings a nuanced complexity to Dexter, capturing his internal struggle between his sociopathic tendencies and his desire to connect with those around him. The voice-over narrations, providing insight into Dexter's thoughts, are particularly effective in building a deep, empathetic understanding of his character. Hall's portrayal is both chilling and endearing, making Dexter one of the most compelling antiheroes in television history.

The supporting cast also contributes significantly to the show's appeal. Jennifer Carpenter as Debra Morgan, Dexter's foul-mouthed and fiercely loyal sister, delivers a standout performance. Her evolving relationship with Dexter, especially as she grapples with the truth about his dark side, adds emotional depth and tension to the series. Other notable performances include David Zayas as Angel Batista, C. S. Lee as Vince Masuka, and James Remar as Harry Morgan, Dexter's adoptive father.

""Dexter"" excels in its storytelling, with each season presenting a new antagonist that challenges Dexter's abilities and morals. The series' writing is sharp, weaving complex plots with dark humor and intense drama. Seasons like the fourth, featuring John Lithgow's chilling portrayal of the Trinity Killer, are particularly memorable for their gripping narrative and shocking twists.

The show's exploration of ethical and moral dilemmas is another highlight. Dexter's internal monologues and interactions often delve into themes of justice, morality, and the nature of humanity. These philosophical undertones elevate the series beyond a typical crime drama, offering viewers a deeper, thought-provoking experience.

Visually, ""Dexter"" is well-crafted, with its vibrant Miami setting providing a stark contrast to the dark and grisly nature of Dexter's nighttime activities. The use of color, lighting, and cinematography effectively sets the tone and atmosphere, enhancing the overall viewing experience.

However, the series finale left me feeling a bit disappointed. While somewhat believable given Dexter's character arc, it was not the satisfying conclusion I had hoped for. Despite this, the journey leading up to the finale is filled with intense, emotionally charged moments that make the series well worth watching.

In conclusion, ""Dexter"" is a standout series that combines strong performances, compelling storytelling, and a unique premise to create a truly engaging viewing experience. While the ending may leave some viewers wanting more, the show's overall impact and quality earn it a well-deserved 10/10. ""Dexter"" remains a seminal work in the crime thriller genre and a testament to the complexities of the human psyche.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

Amazon is airing the series now so I started watching again. Having watched most of the first season, I remember why I stopped in the first place. I liked the macabre aspects, the location, most of the characters and the acting is good but the sister ruins it. She has the emotional maturity of a12 year old. She has spent time in undercover vice and now she's a homicide detective and is less mature than Dexters' girlfriends' small children.

I could live with that if she was only in a couple scenes per episode, but she is in almost as many scenes as Dexter. Over the years I've heard various story elements and I think I'll watch a little longer to see the chaos inflicted on her. There are other flaws, the writers go out of their way to make two characters unlikeable, but are then magically rehabbed.

336,8.0,18 September 2011,"I want to stress that I have seen a lot of great shows; 24, House, The Simpsons etc. But I have never seen a show quite as brilliant as Dexter. It succeeds in every level, it's funny, has superb lead actors, great character development, very dramatic and the most ingenious story lines I've ever seen. I remember watching the first episode on the internet to see what it was like, and from the second he killed his first victim on the show I knew I was hooked. I watched the other 11 episodes of the first season religiously and I can say bar the first season of 24 I've never enjoyed a series of TV more. Dexter is going into it's sixth season and in my opinion the previous five have been superb, and the show has never lost it's dramatic pace or originality. so if you want a to watch something that will hook you with it's great story lines, amaze you by it's actors and amuse you with it's sharp wit, then without a doubt, this is the show for you.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

Breaking Bad, Better call Saul, Sopranos, Ripley... now these are masterpieces. How much would you rate these shows then? 20/10?

The initial plot is well found. But after season one it all doesn't really develop into something more and more original. Variations on the same theme all the following years.

There are a lot of suspension of disbelief situations. Where does he keep that load of transparent plastic and duct tape residue every time for instance?

A car that Dexter drives is seemingly landing on all four wheels but in the next shot is still tumbling. Bad editing.

I find it entertaining. But that is just all.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

349,10.0,15 August 2020,"As usual, you can never rely on positive reviews when trying to decide whether or not to watch a tv show. Review after review lauds this show as brilliant, groundbreaking, etc etc. I struggled with it immediately, finding the premise contrived to the point of being indigestible. Perhaps the books managed to fully develop the premise in a clever way that made it palatable, I don't know. But to basically say, with the use of Wonder Years-style voice-over and the odd flashback that this individual exhibited warning signs to his adoptive cop father by killing animals as a child, was then TRAINED by the father to channel his tendencies towards killing only ""bad"" people is a little half-arsed as far as telling a story goes. That ""origin"" story might have made for an interesting tv show, the path from child pet-killer to a serial killer trained to efficiently kill others of his kind, but this is not that story. This is your bog-standard soap opera recipe with the serial killer ""twist"" mixed in, just as Walking Dead is the same base recipe with a half-cup of zombie mix, add pouch and stir, voila, repeat season after season. As soon as I realised this, I pulled the plug. It didn't take long. I know that positive reviewers dismiss people like me for not giving shows a chance, but when the writing is so clearly on the wall so early on, I cannot justify wasting my time. The second time Dexter/psycho-Kevin Arnold prepped his little death table I sighed. I do not want to check in each episode and see him have his adventure, executing a bad person (he doesn't just kill serial killers, he kills drunk drivers too) while dealing with the day to day distractions of his personal relationships. There wasn't anything to keep me interested; if there had been some engaging dialogue or compelling actors to counter the formulaic episode structure, maybe I could've hung in for a third episode, but there was nothing. The lead actor was almost campy, it was distracting, and the actress playing his sister was comically bad. The other characters were the typical caricatures, angry black cop, colourful, fedora-sporting Hispanic cop, power-hungry female lieutenant, all very tired and uninspired. I noticed that this show lasted for 8 seasons, similar to Sons of Anarchy (same formula, different mix-pouch) yet another indicator that viewers need to be more discerning in what they will watch if the general standard of tv is going to improve.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
350,10.0,7 April 2018,Dexter is simply one of my favourite shows of all time. The combination of Serial Killer come vigilante come Police worker makes for some pretty interesting episodes.

351,10.0,4 February 2023,"Gore, Entertaining and a roller coaster of emotions are without a doubt the best way to describe the show. Everything from the cast, set locations and story are done so perfect that it's beautiful to see them merge into a wonderful example of a show done right. Surprisingly I couldn't believe I was rooting for Dexter because he's a cold hearted serial killer. In fact you start to feel like everyone else is a villain whilst he's a hero. Honestly it's a nice change to not want the good person to win. For me the show was peak television when season four hit. Everything in the previous seasons are taken and pumped up to deliver arguably the best season in any show.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

353,8.0,26 July 2017,"I can not give enough praise to this TV series. It is beautifully plotted, and executed even better.

Never have I seen a series whose music has been used so well. To depict lightness even while something horrific is happening on screen, to want to look away from the screen but being captivated by the horror and the music is sheer talent.

Highlights of the show would be the superb acting by the leads. At times, it is easy to forget Michael C. Hall is even acting. His presence on screen is so powerful, so commanding, it is hard to look away. Indeed, at times I even wondered at just how many roles Mr. Hall has to portray on screen. From playing the part of a bumbling redneck to a ruthless sharp witted killer, few actors have displayed such a finesse for the arts on screen. Jennifer Carpenter as the sister is one of the most foul mouthed loved characters to ever grace the screen. Many a time, the bad guys from this show are the crowd pleasers, right from Season 1.

This series gets a 9 on 10, the one point it missed is due to the last season. I still seem to be a bit undecided on how this series ended but nonetheless, as the series and its ending still continues to haunt me and the fact that it probably will for a long time, warrants the 9 on 10.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

Dexter needs to shut up and stop trying to be profound about his life like a 14 year-old angst-ridden poet. Let us learn about Dex by what happens on screen--not god-awful, campy voice overs.

368,4.0,13 October 2013,"Dexter started off well, loved the first season and ended up watching 90+ hrs in a week to complete the series. The Early Seasons were great but the later ones were just plan bad. Every seasons do have some great episodes but the overall flow of the series turned downhill by the end.

Dexter the protagonist as a serial killer/lab geek starts off perfectly- the awkward guy who find hard to fit in with others and try's to stay under the raider of others.I did enjoy his character development of wanting a family and still being the awkward guy. But in later seasons when he become's social and a smooth lier he looses his charm.

Debra was again perfect in the start- the clumsy girl leaning on her brother for solving her cases, did enjoy her character development where she become a smart detective but hated the part (season 6) where she starts helping her brother out...just doesn't add up.

Season 1- has great story and plot - the mind game with the ice truck serial killer and it's conclusion and meaning to Dexter want's you to come back for more. Dexter and the whole crew are excellent but i really enjoyed Rudy as the ice truck killer the most.

Season 2- builds up on the first with him being suspected and trying to balance romance and its fall back. Both the new characters Lila and Agent Lundy add to the production

Season 3- was a bit disappointment- Dexter taking student and wanting to be friends was very out of character for him but still had good plots and story. Migule didn't seem to add to the series at all.

Season 4- Great Plot. Introduction of trinity was great, Dexter trying to learn from him, be a family man and balancing both his nigh and day jobs with the unbelievable cool ending made it the second best season for me.

Season 5- Lumen and Dexter together and Debra at the end- didn't like it. Liked individuals episodes and how it played out but Dexter and Debra were so out of character.

Season 6- B-Grade Doom's Day Killer Travis was so bad. Debra at the end and her actions were just crap. Only think good about this season was Brother Sam and he was a small part of the season.

Season 7- I actually enjoyed the season for the love angles and romance it bought back into Dexter's life and Issak is so bloody cool but Debra and Captain LeGuerta part spoiled the end

Season 8- Worst season of the lot - The ending is Terrible

Overall the series is a fun watch and most of the episodes are made like masterpiece only when they started tweaking with the characters personalities things turned sour.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

Because, y'know, the narrative. Dexter would've been worthwhile if it had been a truly dark, semi-realistic exploration of psycho raised by a vengeful cop. Attempting to control his ""addiction"" by satisfying his urges on equally twisted freaks for the greater good, the moral paradox of evil means to justify righteous ends might have made a rich source of psychological tension. But the hacks running contemporary corporate media are incapable of such feats. Psychological depth, nuance and any semblance of realism are far beyond their limited capabilities. The episodes are quick, superficial travelogues through the greater Miami area showing night clubs and bikini girls etc. Little cut scenes thrown together as if they were produced by the bureau of tourism. The characters and plot are two-dimensional, pandering, predictable, and undeveloped. As a dark comedy it falls flat. As a serious psychological exploration of controlled insanity and the moral conflict of a man's psychotic lust for killing harnessed for the greater good of society, it doesn't even try.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

The first four seasons were fantastic, and after that, it definitely slipped in quality. Some of the guest stars, particularly the villains, are great actors and fit into the cast seamlessly.

Some episodes are brilliant and some, so so. After it became immediately popular, some of the stars that decided to join in on the dark fun, I loved, so be on the lookout for them.

It really makes you feel that you are involved in the story and waiting for a good final which means the bad serial killer killed in the hands of Dexter but the excitement never ends till the final episode. It always keeps you awake and submits something with surprise.

Michael C Hall fits the leading role perfectly and he qualifies Dexter character without doubt. One of the best thing in the series I love is the monologues of Dexter which is very deep and real.

""Dexter"" is realistic and fresh. In ""Dexter"" people talk how they normally do, there are swear words, there are crude jokes, there is lots of dark humour but there's also a great, dark plot which reveals dirty cops, serial killers, bad childhood memories... Dexter is no question, the most likable serial killer you will ever get a chance to meet, but as the serial goes there's nothing bad to say about it. Even though the Pilot is not shockingly good, the further into the story it grabs you stronger, by the end not letting you go to bed any time soon. The story is suspenseful, surprising, revealing more and more each episode, the acting is flawless, music adds to the climate. ""Dexter"" is an excellent choice of more adult TV series. You won't be disappointed!

edit - Second Season - The Bay Harbor Butcher Second season goes to the more psychological areas of Dexter's past, revealing more and more to the story about Harry and young Dexter, what caused him to be like this and why with every episode, being a little bit less suspenseful for the most of the season but really important to the good understanding of the story. Also - a complication in the relationship with Rita emerges and a hazard that Dexter's identity may be revealed to the whole world.

If you'r thinking that this will also turn out to be a usual obvious bore like the other criminal t.v. shows then you know nothing about this show.

The best thing about this show is that it binds the people and hook them to the seats.The way the cases are solved and executed by our favorite serial killer is simply awesome.Who has some killing or you can say moral codes of himself.Each season has big mastermind criminal cases and each episodes have their own big stories , i just don't want to spoil this show for you. Just watch first 4-5 episodes and then you are hooked.

Each character in this show is so precisely chosen and proper roles have been assigned.The story , the theme , the acting are so brilliantly done.Dexter is one of the most appreciated and chosen criminal t.v serial of all time.The cast and the production are just mind-blowing.

I usually am so selective in watching t.v series and believe me i just don't like any t.v series easily and specially the criminal ones but this one made me spellbound.

1. The first season is the show at it's best and could have just ended there and been a mini series. the main character is very well done a interesting enough to watch all the seasons For me each season got worse has it went on but not bad enough for me not to finish all the seasons.

2. The ending..... if you plan on watching this show DO NOT look up the ending on the show , i wouldn't to go as far as it being pointless to watch if you find out the end but it would take away from one of the shows reasons to watch throughout the series.

3. Anything non-main character ( filler storyline and other characters ) are just not great. They are just there because they have to be to make the show work and to fill time. I'm not saying all the supporting roles are just unwatchable either because of have or what they had to work with but overall it feel like the main character is a 10 out of 10 and supporting cast and later storylines are 5 out of 10.

I have watched the series twice and while knowing the ending does make less enjoyable anyone that likes to binge watch a variety of different genres it is a ""must watch"" for the first season alone. Each season has a main story that wraps up within it's season so watch the first season and you like it then keep going even if you know how it ends and just do what i do and skip the last season and make up my own.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
389,8.0,6 January 2010,"*Story/plot* As with every review i write, i do not like to spoil anything so i suggest read the plot here on IMDb. Long story short, a forensics blood analyst leads a double life. He is a serial killer as well.

*The series* I have the privilege to have seen all the 4 seasons thus far. It is a very impressive role Maikel is playing here. The way he acts, looks, narrates true-out the entire series. Keeps you involved the entire time and your begging for more with each episode that ends. Noticeable is the musical score for this particular series! Normally i do not care so much for soundtracks of series or movies but here excellent recognizable, eery ring to it all. It fits the entire series.

*Supporting roles* Now here the series looses point on! E.g: Erik king? Or Miss Carpenter (sister of Dexter, there in real life married couple BTW) There both the worst actors i have ever seen in the history of movie/series. Erik dozer is a Sergeant in the series and he is not convincing AT ALL with doing his part. I know many ppl love his acting, it is save to say those ppl do not have much movie/series background who find it that way.

Miss Carpenter is overacting allot, as she needs to be upset she already breaks down and cry. Instead of looking upset she looks sad ectra. Big flaws in the series if you ask me the main character Dexter steals the entire show. Who thinks different off course no problem with that, remind you I'm not talking about Erik king script here, but really how he express himself (typical B-actor) The script has nothing to do with that.

*Overall* DEXTER, is a wort to have series, the story is exciting and new. The main character is very convincing (oscar wort role he plays) It looses point for the BAD casting of the supporting roles in this series. This is simply a casting mistake that choose on a Sunday morning 2 cheap actors to make the series or something (sorry this is really how i feel) I have read the bulletin boards about this, there lots if children here that react to it when someone claims that the supporting roles are thin. Well the *beeps* are countless remind you dear ppl that most of the IMDb reviewers are pll that have a extensive knowledge on movies.

That does not mean you cannot have a opinion, but what i miss there is the argumentul value (to back up what the say) and cussing does not make you look more of a intellect either.

392,10.0,2 January 2020,"For years I heard nothing but how ""amazing"" Dexter was, and didn't get around to checking it out more recently. After finishing the series finale, I find myself baffled at the extreme levels of praise all these years. The show starts out good enough, as the first two seasons stood out from a lot of original series around at the time. However, like a lot of shows, it begins to buckle under its own success with each subsequent season.

After season 2, this show loses one of its most dynamic characters. Which is a shame, because practically all secondary characters in Dexter have the depth of a cardboard cutout and are generally annoying. Between these unlikable people and Dexter's angst ridden voiceovers that spoon feed you every single part of the plot, I found myself getting incredibly bored by the end of season 3.

Season 4 seemed to give promise in huge part to John Lithgow. Unfortunately every season after it drops significantly in quality, and begins to feel like 4 seasons of filler. Hearing Dexter's ""edgy"" pseudo-intellectual narration becomes more irritating as you witness him constantly making the same dumb decisions over and over again.

As reward for your dedication, you're treated to the worst series finale I've seen (even worse than True Blood). I think Michael C. Hall and Jennifer Carpenter do a good job portraying their characters (even if Carpenter's is intolerable until the last few seasons), but I will never understand how this show became so popular. The idea of Dexter is unique and I get its initial appeal at the time, but the writing and consistency in quality is deeply lacking.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
393,9.0,1 January 2015,This Show is awesome and excellent with a great story that has an excellent cast. I've seen all 8 seasons and my favorites were 2 and 4 because they had some pretty intense stuff but awesome things like the Trinity Killer and The Bay Harbor Butcher. This show started in 2006 and became one of my favorite shows with others like Breaking Bad and The Walking Dead. If you have not seen this show you will need to see it because it is a really intense and great show. One thing is if you want your kids to watch this show they need to be able to handle the language and violence. Also this show has Nudity and some sex scenes so you might want to close your kids eyes. But this is a great show and will be a fan of Dexter,"October 1, 2006 (United States)"
394,10.0,30 January 2023,"I would rate the Dexter series as a standout in the crime genre, with a few flaws that prevent it from being a true masterpiece. On the positive side, the show's unique premise and lead character are extremely compelling and keep the audience engaged. The writing is strong, with well-crafted story arcs and unpredictable twists. The acting is also top-notch, particularly Michael C. Hall in the lead role, who perfectly embodies the complex and morally conflicted character of Dexter.

However, the series is not without its negatives. While the earlier seasons maintain a high level of tension and excitement, later seasons can become formulaic and lack the same level of energy. Additionally, some character arcs and plot points can be inconsistent and unsatisfying, leaving a few loose ends that detract from the overall experience.

In conclusion, despite its faults, the Dexter series is an excellent and must-watch for fans of crime dramas and psychological thrillers, with a magnetic lead character and a thrilling storyline.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
395,7.0,10 September 2018,,"October 1, 2006 (United States)"
396,9.0,11 December 2022,"One of the most interesting aspects of Dexter is the fact that the main character is a serial killer. This makes for a unique and engaging plot, as viewers are both horrified by Dexter's actions and also strangely drawn to him. Despite being a killer, Dexter is portrayed as a likable and relatable character, which makes it easy for viewers to become invested in his story.

The show also explores the relationship between Dexter and his adoptive sister, Debra Morgan. Debra is a detective with the Miami Police Department. The dynamic between the two siblings is complex and constantly evolving, and the show does a great job of exploring the emotional toll that Dexter's secret has on their relationship.

In addition to its fascinating central character and well-developed relationships, Dexter also boasts an engaging plot. Each season follows a different storyline, with Dexter facing off against a new nemesis who poses a threat to both his personal and professional lives. These storylines are always thrilling and full of twists and turns, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats.

One of the most interesting aspects of Dexter is the way it explores the concept of morality. Throughout the series, Dexter grapples with the question of whether his actions are justified, and whether it is acceptable for him to kill people who are themselves murderers. This internal conflict adds a layer of depth to the character and makes for some thought-provoking moments throughout the show.

Another strength of Dexter is its strong supporting cast. In addition to Debra, the show features a number of other well-developed characters, including Dexter's girlfriend Rita and his police colleagues Angel and Vince. These characters provide a foil for Dexter and help to round out the world of the show.

Overall, Dexter is a fascinating and engaging television show that explores complex moral questions and features a captivating central character. Its well-developed plot and strong supporting cast make it a must-see for fans of crime dramas.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

And people in Miami SWEAT. They don't wear long-sleeves and they look SHINY when outside because of the humidity. Hair becomes frizzy. License plates are NOT on the front of cars (how could they not research this???). Everything about the show screamed California aside from the rare exterior shots they included of Miami.

I really enjoyed how you could see Dexter's mentality in a season, how it changes through out it and the fact that it is centered around him. However after an amazing ending to season 4, season 5 was completely boring and the only thing that kept me watching was how much I liked the first four. Then season 6, which I was looking forward to, started of well especially with Mos Def's character and the contrast to ""DDK"". However the writers had to many directions to take the show through and chose the wrong one, they lost interest in detail added too much mind-numbing talking and introduced the worst twist followed by the sickest crush I could ever imagine.

404,10.0,8 February 2023,"Loved Dexter. Michael C Hall- a lesser known actor back then, did an incredible job of playing a forensic technician who is actually a serial murderer himself - seeing himself as a vigilante with a ""code"" to kill. Something he feels is lacking in his own victims that he kills. It's a series that isn't for the faint hearted- the unnerving murder sequences could make you squirm.

Not all seasons are made equal. Certainly the last season or two lost my captivity compared to the originals. In saying this: it never stopped me watching and wanting to see where the story would go. I strongly recommend if you're a fan of anti-hero crime stories!","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
405,7.0,27 February 2024,"Some may argue the show went on too long. Some not. I thought the show was absolutely phenomenal. It's a very good take on a serial killer with trauma.

Reasoning: It's not like Dexters crazy, insane killing innocent. He's actually quite relatable and only goes after the bad ones. He's a vigilante. Batman who kills kind of. The show was most strong seasons 1-4 and that's a fact. But I enjoyed it the whole time. So many dark twists it has. He puts on a mask, fakes his personality around others. The villains in the show are also very dark and gritty but makes the show better. In the end Dexter is a great show I recommend it to anyone whose fans of shows like You, Barry, Hannibal.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

While it is a shame that such a good show must be relegated to a premium cable channel, it wouldn't be as good on basic cable. It is a show that needs to push the envelope a little and therefore must be on a network such as Showtime. The show is full of excellent actors and they each portray their respective characters in a way that makes the whole story very believable. A show like Dexter comes along once in a while, in the same vein as The Sopranos, where you subscribe to a premium channel just so you can watch this one show, it is that good (in my humble opinion).","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

After he has done the deed, he tries to cover it up and not leave any traces behind, not least because he works as a bloodstain analyst for the authorities.

I loved the story as well as the storytelling, and coupled with Michael C. Hall's acting, this series would easily have gotten a 10/10 from me - if the ending wasn't so incredibly bad.

412,10.0,12 June 2013,"There are some things that are just disturbing to watch. Whether it's a disturbing image like from news of a tragic event like a shooting or a video set up on YouTube like a recent serial killer did or a more fictional depiction of tragedy like the Saw films, Scream or a television depiction like Law & Order, Bones, or Jersey Shore. However there are some things which are hard to understand why exactly you're disturbed by them. For me that show is Dexter. You can always look at a show like this and say that what is disturbing about it is the graphic depictions of sex, language and death that are disturbing, and yes it can be tough to watch the way in which people are both killed by the main character and kill other people but often that's the least of what disturbs me.

What usually bothers me about the show is the way in which the characters evolve over time. Most disturbing of all is Dexter who struggles to deal with who he is versus how he was raised. Each season deals with the reality of his life as both a forensic blood spatter analyst and a serial killer. Living with such a contradiction alone would be difficult enough, but trying to relate to people without revealing this contradiction is even harder for him. He does manage to make some connections to people, though they are pretty basic at first over time they evolve and grow much like Dexter himself. The thing that disturbs me most about Dexter is how much people connect with the character. And not just in the sense of the insane ones who try to reenact or mirror his crimes.

My own connection is quite a strange one. I know what it's like to feel disconnected from the world and other people, trying to find a way to connect to people when you don't feel connected to anyone or anything. It's hard to care about others or have a conversation that you find meaningful when you don't care about what other people are saying. But you keep trying because you see the people around you talking and caring about each other and you want to understand what they feel like. You want to know so bad that you start to feel something just from that itself.

Ultimately, I think that's what Dexter is all about, a man trying to connect to others without really knowing how. He tries to connect with his girlfriend, his co-workers as well as his family and friends. Yet no matter how many times he fails he keeps trying, despite the fact that doing so is against his nature. The main reason he fails is because his natural instinct is to shy away from people and do his own thing. But he was taught to spend time with people and to at least appear like everyone else so that he can try to fit in. This creates a tragic battle within the main character that is often played out within the inner monologue/voice over of the episodes and seasons as a whole.

As the seasons progress, he learns how to manage between his nature and the way he was nurtured to embrace in life. Watching him try to live up to both perceptions of himself that he has while dealing with the people around him and keeping them from learning the truth can be both tragic and disturbing at the same time.

So is Dexter the ultimate nature versus nurture? I think it is.

The only thing that keeps one from turning it off is some hope that the premise will make the series exciting at some point. It doesn't. The acting is not very good, but then again they don't have much to work from. This is bad soap opera. In fact, soap opera is better.

With the premise, they could have done so much more. So much more excitement. So much more terror. But no. Lazy writing. North American shaite TV show, yet again. Just another example of how terrible most US writers of TV shows are. Thank God for Britain.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

421,9.0,1 March 2009,"I've watched the first two seasons and found my way to Dexter mainly by wanting to know what Michael C. Hall was doing after Six Feet Under. I am a little disappointed although his role fits and it's always a pleasure to see him act as Dexter.

What disappoints me though is the storyline. It has it's ups and downs and I image some viewers might find it really interesting but if you have seen thrillers and movies like American Psycho you will find this show rather boring. Dexter is the ""good guy"" who has to go through ""adventures"" and this is not really what you would expect from a guy who can't stop loving to kill people. I know those two extremes might sound interesting but after seeing the first episode you basically know everything about the character. Of course there are some flashbacks, some minor development but in the end Dexter stays the same.

I won't even get into the other characters who are just dragging the whole show down, especially Dexter's sisters (Jennifer Carpenter). She did a decent job in the remake ""Quarantine"" but only because she was a typical horror movie victim. You enjoy to see her scream and die but she won't in this show (and I have to say this: I was really happy when season 1 was over mainly because I would never have to hear her say the word ""ice-truck killer"" again)

Julia Benz is the only character I found interesting ever since Dexter said about her ""in her way she is as damaged as I am"". This is good stuff. Comparing his life to a mother of two children and seeing those two ""damaged"" people kinda fall in love. They could have made a whole series just about that storyline, instead they focus on the ""bossy Cuban bitch"", the ""suspicous black colleague"", the weird sister ""I love a 30year older man"" etc. all those story lines fail to be:

a)believable b)innovative c)relating to the main character (after all the show is called Dexter)

I don't want to tell people not to watch this show, after all it is sometimes entertaining and if you like to see something that goes well with your popcorn, go watch an episode or two. But it is nothing more than a show a housewife would watch while ironing her clothes. If you don't pay attention to most of the show, you'd still won't miss a lot. If you dislike that watch the Sopranos (if you haven't already) where you actually do have to pay attention if you don't want to miss out on all the entertainment.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

You can talk for a long time about the morality of this work, it seems to me that everything depends on our attitude to things - I personally am not against such a plot, but not in such a presentation. We are shown the life of the American Morgan Dexter, he works in the police, is engaged in the study of blood at crime scenes. He has a sister (not his own, but close in spirit), a girl - God's dandelion and the beautiful children of this very girl. And Morgan spends his spare time killing bad uncles and aunts. I wonder if the creators wanted to present Dexter as a hero or as a villain? Do we have the right to judge who deserves to die and who does not? Morgan definitely knows the answer to this question - yes. I finished watching, as I remember, until the third season, I simply could not master it anymore - it became boring.

If you like watching a show where we get the insights of how a killer works this is the show for you. Now here is the thing. This is my favorite show but shows like Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones are better shows overall and I am not going to lie about that. The acting by the side characters are good but not great it does get better as the show goes on like any other show and it does have some dumb things like all crime shows have but having the main character be a killer is where the show is different then any other show. Dexter and Deb his sister are the best parts of the show she kills her role as wanting to become a better detective to prove to herself and others that she is as good as her father was.

How on earth would a cop be accepting of a son who is a young Ted Bundy in the making? You wouldn't. No way would that happen. Uh uh, no way.

Michael C. Hall is an artist, he portrays this maniac so perfectly it's unbelievable, the character from the book just come to life and i will never get over it why he isn't winning every single award he's up for. The rest of the cast are up and down, most have them bring confident performances, others fail but i have never let that stop me enjoying this brilliant show which brings something new in every episode.

Also the fact that the seasons are so different and there is very little of the show repeating itself, i think that it is one of the pros of making a show after a book. Dexter is a show everyone should enjoy even if you aren't into serial killer shows because this show is so much more than just another slasher show and also i believe the fans of the book will not be disappointed with this show.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
432,10.0,27 September 2016,"All-in-all, Dexter is one of the best shows I've ever seen - it definitely makes my top three. It's not your average TV show, in fact it offers a lot more than most shows do. The viewer will find themselves strongly evoked; it's a very intriguing series for one. It has all the right characters (especially villains) and showcases all that are musts for shows of this very genre. It's a very well-written, carefully detailed series with a lot going on throughout. You won't get the same season twice, far from it actually. Every season, while connected of course, is different. Personally, my favorites are seasons 1 and 4. They're all great though. Every episode is fascinating and interesting to watch. It's an amusing show with so many awesome characters throughout, of course the main character, Dexer, is brilliant. Your entry into the mind of Dexter Morgan begins the minute you lay eyes on this fantastic, astounding masterpiece of a series.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

SO many on the cast list to mention but obviously the main character Dexter played by Micheal C Hall is just super and exceptional in his role as a friendly serial killer we all hate to love.

Dexter is a Blood Splatter Analyst for Miami police and as a young child witnessed the murder of his mother and this has turned his mind, made him what he is, made him hate the bad and punish using the code he's father taught him. Well its almost a perfect follow of that code as the odd mistake can and does happen. Dexter has a close relationship with his sister Debra played by Jennifer Carpenter. Both play their roles out and with other Miami Metro police officers as their friends the stories are great.

Dexter has a main killing code, to rid the world of murderers that have slipped the net of the justice system. sometimes Dexter has to change course, change his mind, abort and admit that he has got it wrong either with who he has just killed or who he should have killed, either way its a bloody end for most.

We move from season to season with a different subject but all around the introduction and goodbyes from each seedy character and its never boring. I found some of it so frustrating as i was half on the edge of my seat egging Dexter on to just finish the bad character off, and finally getting my just desserts as another one bit the dust.

i really wish it didn't have to end as it really was the best TV series i have watched, it has excitement, suspense, grit, anger, love, joy, mystery and fulfilment in the entire 8 seasons. i was never bored and loved each of the 96 episodes individually for different reasons. well acted, well worth the watch.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

Well i've been hooked ever since, not only is there fantastic acting esp between dexter and deb considering their personal lives the stories are always gripping and give that tension that is needed to keep an audience going. The characters are all great to watch and all have a role none of them are useless and leave you wondering what they are doing there.

Can say that i was so happy to be proved wrong that not all these shows are trash. The only complaint i held with the show was why they had to show so much sex in certain episodes it wasn't needed esp in some not as graphically, the show has merit in story it doesn't need trash like that, seems to be the way forward of TV though i guess.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

First off, let me just say what a pure joy it has been for me telling people the premise behind ""Dexter"" and watching their eyes widen, their jaw hang open and hear the words ""no way!"" come out of their mouth. Thank you Showtime.

Meet Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall, ""Six Feet Under""), a likable mild-mannered everyman who by day works as a blood-splatter expert with his foul-mouthed tomboy sister, Deborah (Jennifer Carpenter), in the Miami homicide division tracking down serial killers. By night, Dexter himself is a serial killer.

Having noticed Dexter's more psychotic urges as a teenager, his father, Harry (James Remar), instills in the boy a ""code"" that allows him to channel those urges into other criminals, murderers and rapists. In a transparent, but necessary, way to make the story easier to swallow, Dexter is made into a twisted vigilante cleaning up the scum of Miami.

""Dexter"" just may end up being one of the best shows of this decade. It is a triumph as a crowd-pleasing thrill ride and a smart bit of dramatic storytelling. It's dark, it's bloody, it's funny. It's a riveting nail-biter and it's a daring character study, taking us into the mind of one of TV's best anti-heroes the small screen has ever seen. It is a breakout hit for Showtime, a network I've long respected but whose solid output of great shows have tragically not caught the audience or notoriety of HBO. ""Dexter"" is on par with ""Dead Like Me"", ""The L Word"", ""Sleeper Cell"" and ""Penn & Teller: Bullsh!t"", but it has that something extra. It is the kind of water cooler TV that gets people excited. Having always waded in the kind of moral ambiguity that infuriates family watchdog groups but makes for compelling character drama, Showtime takes the idea of rooting for the bad guy up to a whole new level here. ""The Sopranos"" was a ground-breaker don't get me wrong, but ""Dexter"" is a hell of a lot more of an entertaining watch.

It is a triumph for Michael C. Hall as an actor. Having spent years suspecting there was something dark and sinister behind David Fischer's eyes, the transition to serial killer fits him like a glove. Hall was born to play Dexter Morgan. He captures Dexter's inner monologue in such a dryly funny way. A way that is hard not to like. And yet, without Hall changing a tick, the show is able to flip us in the head of another character and allow us to see how truly dangerous and psychotic Dexter could easily be. Hall makes something that would sound impossible on paper, fluid on the screen.

""Dexter"" is based on Jeff Lindsey's ""Dexter"" novel series, which I am not familiar enough with to say how accurate the translation is. But the show is a rich, intelligent and methodical piece of storytelling. The mysteries are unfolded over entire seasons, a style that got ""Veronica Mars"" quickly canned, but I've always preferred it to the self-contained ""CSI"" mysteries. The payoffs in this way, are so much sweeter and, without giving away anything, ""Dexter"" is filled with more than a few ""holy s--t!"" moments. It's such a rare pleasure to watch a show so full of potential get to live in to all of that potential.

The genius of the show goes back to it's deeply cut and uncommonly well-thought exploration of the titular character. Dexter isn't a growling, black-hat bad guy, but the show doesn't exactly let him off either. As envisioned by Lindsey and Showtime's developers, killing for Dexter is like an unavoidable sexual urge, or a drug addiction (a metaphor brought brilliantly to life in season two). Maybe because he was born that way or maybe because his earliest memory involves sitting in a pool of blood, in a cargo container, watching his mother being chainsawed to death.

When we first meet Dexter he is a man without emotions. He spends every waking moment trying to blend in to a sea of normal people. He fakes it. This involves pretending to be in a relationship with Rita (Julie Benz) and pretending to enjoy normal people things like sex or bowling. Soon Dexter's illusion starts to become reality. His world is challenged, first by an affection for Rita. Then the Ice Truck Killer, a maniac who drains his victims of their blood who Dexter develops a professional awe for. Season 2 tightens the screws even more. When his dumped bodies are quickly discovered, Dexter has to think quick to stay one step ahead of the police department he works in to keep from getting caught. In either case, the ending is satisfying, will not leave you hanging and makes me all the more excited to see what this show has up it's sleeve for future seasons.

This show is not to be missed. ""Dexter"" is not for the squeamish, not necessarily for the blood and guts (though there is plenty of that), as for the ideas that it puts in your head. The experience of getting inside the mind of a compulsive killer and feeling for him. Rooting for him. Is Dexter's vigilantism the right thing and the end justify the means? Can he be socialized and reformed or will the mask slip off? What gives us our humanity and is Dexter that much different than the most socialized and functional human being? The answer, in this case, is as clear as blood.

450,9.0,25 March 2015,"Miami, Florida. There are a lot of people doing very evil things. And when they slip through the cracks of the legal system, that's where our titular lead(C. Hall, subtle, meticulous), and his Code, comes in. He investigates them to ensure he doesn't off anyone innocent. Drugs them and wakes them back up in a secluded room. They, and the room, are taped down with plastic – no DNA evidence left behind. With photos, he ensures their victims will be the very last thing they see, before he bludgeons or stabs them. Up close and personal. Not the noise and distance of a gun, or the ""soft"", almost indirect way of poison. No, he wants to feel it. If there's an ironic or poetic way or place to take them out, he'll find it. And he saves a blood slide from each of them: a trophy. Dismembered and dumped off the Bay, no one knows about it. Murder. It's one heck of a way to make a living.

Of course, he wasn't always like this. Actually, OK, he totally was. But as awful as this side of him is, he does try to channel it so it might help. Of course, in my opinion, it's not ""terminate people who do wrong"" that solves problems with people's criminal behavior. It's social issues, making sure everyone can get by without resorting to crime: wages for poor people that allow them to thrive, education for everyone, etc. That would greatly limit how many criminals there would be, and then the police could focus all their energy on just them. This does explore whether it's justice or a need, revenge. And there's, of course, the element of it being a power fantasy.

Before landing the blow, he may have a short conversation with his target. After all, they share some similarities both have intentionally slaughtered other people, and more than once – except for some of the rapists and the like. How do they deal with this or that? What choices have they made, and were they happy before their current predicament? And the serial killers herein, the many different types of what this calls monsters(I feel that only actions can be terrible, people may have the option to either do them or not, no one is inherently wicked) are explored in great detail – this is, at its core, a psychological thriller.

Learning the craft took years, and a mentor. That's where his adoptive father Harry(Remar, the weight of such responsibility, coupled with the hope for the better) comes in. The hero cop crafted the ruleset that I've mentioned above. He died before this is set, living on in Dexter's mind, this shown via both actors interacting, which we realize is only what is imagined to be taking place. Every major decision is ""discussed"" with him, and he'll argue, show pride, express disappointment, etc. How long should we follow our parents' guidance? Where do we set the line, what is a healthy way of rebelling?

Thus, his stepsister, Debra(Carpenter, nervous in spite of competency), got the short end of the dad's attention-stick. It pushed her to join the force, and she now fights to get into Homicide, from Vice. One of the only women in a male-dominated field, she's masculine, and tries but fails to hide her insecurities, indecisiveness, and her deep emotions usually with an obscene, pun intended, amount of swearing, which can get awkward, and feel like they had a quota to fill. The two of them together is sweet, always looking out for each other. She's the closest he has to a human connection.

His girlfriend, Rita(Benz, scared, not pathetic) is scarred. Figuratively speaking. Her ex, who left her with two kids, that she takes great care of, is an abusive junkie. She isn't comfortable with intimacy, which is how he prefers it – he's wary of letting people in, thinking they won't want the real him. With just a little mishandling, she could have been very frustrating. If she had been continuously stuck in her pain, someone for others to help with no end in sight, that's not really something we want to see. And that's not what we got. She has stories of her own. As does almost every regular in this, many of them found in the department, some of whom will change rank over the years, their families strained by the job and the like. This is stock-full of dynamic, detailed characters and their interpersonal relationships, that grow and develop over time. Every performance is compelling.

This is tense, dramatic, addictive, binge-inducing and crazy fast-paced, a ton happens in a short space of time, without it being exhausting or feeling forced. This is almost always good, it's even better when its stuff that relates to the whole season(each of which is a chapter in the overall plot. 1 and 4 are amazing, 2 and 3 are great, 5-8 are good, but skippable. And the finale is only OK), and it's at its best when it's to the entire show. A lot is communicated in little time. Scenes ""turn"", someone loving turns out to be a psycho or vice versa. Still, this doesn't rely too heavily on fake-outs, twists or the like. The production values are high. This goes into what ""normal"" is, whether or not it's possible to have a fulfilling life while secretly engaging in destructive behavior, among other themes. Can it be controlled? Could anyone accept it? Can it remain hidden?

In addition to what I've already noted, there is a lot of brutal, bloody, disturbing and violent content in this. That makes sense given the nature of this. What does not always, and gets unpleasant, is the many prostitutes, strip clubs, and general nudity and sexualization, including of the deceased(!), and the many fridges full of girls, not treated as individuals, rather, there to get sympathy. I recommend this to anyone attracted by the subject matter. 8/10","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

453,10.0,29 September 2013,"This a (spoiler free) review of ""Dexter"" from episode number one to the 2013 series finale episode. I've officially watched Dexter from beginning to end and now here is my review for this great series throughout it's highs and lows. A brief intro about this show for those whom haven't seen it. Dexter is about the character named Dexter Morgan based off the novel ""Darkly Dreaming Dexter"" by Jeff Lindsay. Dexter is a forensic blood spatter analyst at Miami Metro where he works with his police-officer sister Debra Morgan. Dexter is a fun, likable guy that brings in donuts to work and is an easy going guy... at least in the day. During the night, Dexter becomes ""The Monster""; Dexter lives a secret life where he is a psychopath professional serial killer. Using his Miami Metro resources, Dexter fills his need to kill by hunting down those whom deserve to be killed; he finds and locates criminals whom have ""slipped through the cracks"", although from time to time others often enter his path. He takes people out where he then dismembers their bodies and dumps them in the ocean, often leaving no train of evidence due to the fact that he follows ""The Code"". The code, known as ""Harry's Code"", is a set of rules Dexter's adoptive father, Harry Morgan, created for Dexter to full fill his need to kill without being caught.

The premise of the show stays the same. Dexter typically has a need to kill at night. It's his life during the day where things change. He meets people, makes lovers, and even has children to take care of. With all of these complications in Dexter's life, it becomes difficult for him to satisfy ""The Dark Passenger"" as he likes to call it. This is where most of the drama of the show happens. Dexter is a great series because there is one big question that gets asked all the time; is it due-justice what Dexter does? Should he be allowed to kill these people who slip through the cracks? All in all, Dexter is a serial killer, but often fans are forced to be on his side when they see his inner psyche.

From season one to season eight, I have enjoyed nearly every episode. Sure, like all TV shows, there is a dud here and there. But all in all, Dexter is one of the best shows ever created on television. The deep, thought provoking storyline and great cast. It's just a solid TV series. Michael C. Hall is a legendary actor now, giving life to the character Dexter like no others could. Many people watched the show simply because of his performance. The supporting cast were excellent as well and most characters stuck around from beginning to end, giving the perfect blend of family members and comic-relief when needed. Lastly the set design, filmography, audio, and soundtrack were top-tier. This show gets a nice budget and was never too over-the-top.

I'll be honest. At first, I wasn't crazy about this show. When it first came out years ago, I was barely interested in it. But over time, I slowly started to pick up on this show. I eventually watched the show from beginning to end and watched the later seasons during the premiere every Sunday. Once I gave this show a good chance, I instantly got hooked. Dexter is a fantastic series and I am giving a perfect 10 out of 10. Many hardcore fans may disagree, but I think it's fair. Dexter has had it's highs and its lows like other shows. Some seasons and characters are more likable than others. But regardless of all this, Dexter is simply a masterpiece of this series and there is never a dull moment. And never have I watched a show that has given me nightmare's as much as Dexter has (which is a good thing)! Whether you are a fan of horror stories or not, I highly recommend checkout out Dexter. The only reason to not watch it is if you get disturbed from horror series/flicks, because this is an intense, dark TV show. Also, it's a bit morbid for the younger audience. But adults should totally give this show a shot. Thank you Showtime for delivering eight quality seasons of this wonderful TV series. It will forever be in my list of favorites.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

To take a novel like that, to resist the temptation of doing a 2h30 film in which would be impossible to achieve the psique intensity that Dexter transpires. This series, with great, great action, allows to see our inner sociopate, to understand the reasons for cruelty in a damaged world. It's definitely one of the best things I've ever seen, and I can wait until I get my hands on the novel.

Beware: sometimes it get gory: blood, lots of blood. Its not my wave, but it isn't gratuistious, and it can be easily overcome with some shut eyes.

You could argue that law should work more in favor of cops sometimes yes I understand that but I don't think this is the solution.

Dexter is about revenge and personal feelings and not justice. OK in season 2 for personal feelings goal is to kill someone in the witness protection program.

I felt the life that those actors and actress has in this TV series, it made me believe they are real.. because they had been chosen really good for their characteristic.

464,8.0,2 December 2012,"I never thought I would get hooked ""compulsively"" on this TV series about murders!! And yet Michael C. Hall as Dexter Morgan is simply amazing in his role, his acting.

What makes it so compelling is that you can hear the thoughts of Dexter and his internal thought processes, it is kind of compelling. He kills, yes, but only murderers who escaped the judicial system and therefore you quickly feel that Dexter is more Mr. Justice than Mr. Killer!! The stories of each season are extremely well-thought, planned.

I usually do not like to watch any TV series involving murders and yet, with this one, I am compelled to cheer Dexter as he tackles another monster who escaped the judicial system!! And strangely, I continuously laugh at Dexter's remarks and the situations where the entire Dexter police team is in.

That is the only TV series involving murders that I love watching!!

Michael C. Hall as Dexter Morgan was so good in his role that I WOULD NOT HAVE MINDED AT ALL WATCHING AT LEAST SIX MORE SEASONS of Dexter's adventures trying to get rid of all the monsters who were left roaming freely on earth despite the many monstrous crimes that they committed and for which they managed to escape the grips of Justice. I still have a very hard time understanding why the producers of this TV series Dexter did not try to capitalize on Dexter's success and make several more seasons. Well, it is not too late to create a new sequel TV series of Dexter that is exactly the same than previously with the same main actors, as it was so good.

Here are mostly TV series and a few movies that I highly recommend, as I watched them and enjoyed them a lot.

--------------------------------------------------------

There are a few classics in science-fiction TV series:

---Smallville

---Star Trek: Enterprise

---Babylon 5

---Earth: Final Conflict

---Battlestar Galactica

---Star Wars (6 movies so far and counting)

---Jupiter Ascending (a movie)

all deserving 15 out of 10 because they are all very special TV series for the quality of their stories and for the amazing actors that they have. Are these TV series perfect? No, as they sometimes have ""filler"" episodes that are not too great and they also sometimes have ""holes"", illogical elements in the main story or in the individual stories of particular episodes. Despite sometimes the presence of these very few shortcomings, these TV series are really unique and special in many ways that you will nevertheless enjoy them greatly.

Other TV series that are excellent but not necessarily science-fiction? Here is my list of other excellent TV series that you will appreciate a lot:

--A few more science-fiction:

---Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome (it is science-fiction)

---Caprica (it is science-fiction)

---Babylon 5: Thirdspace (it is science-fiction)

I have seen many other supposed great shows, and this is still the best one. I watched all five Seasons of Six Feet Under, four Seasons of The Wire, and the first Season of Oz; to this point, Dexter is my favorite. Not to say that those shows aren't good. They are very good, but Dexter is extraordinary.

All though the main character of the show (Dexter Morgan) is a sociopathic serial killer, you gain his trust and he gains your affection. Dexter is my favorite character on his show. It is literally the best show I have ever seen.

It has comedy, drama, thrill, mystery and it's very darkish - my taste. I'm kind a surprised actually that the show didn't win Emmy - actually, I was disappointed. I like Mad Man and follow series for a long time, but, honestly, the show is no where near Dexter. Acting is good, plot here and there, but it has nothing that Dexter owns or that Dexter needs to own. But, I guess, not all have the same opinion as I do.

Show is addicting from the first episode and it's kind a thrilling to actually enter killer mind, to see how he thinks and how he sees things. The show embarks you on the journey you'd never thought to have : it's thrilling to the last second of episode, humorous, not cheezy at all, without flaws in plot and above all : it's honest.

474,9.0,18 February 2008,"Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall) is a conundrum wrapped in contradiction. By day, he is a blood splatter expert working for the Miami police whose adoptive father, Harry (James Remar) was one of the cities finest and whose sister, Deborah (Jennifer Carpenter) is also a detective in the force. Dexter is also the dutifully understanding boyfriend of Rita (Julie Benz) and father-figure to her two children whose dad is a heroin addict wife-beater doing time. But come night time, Dexter is a serial killer. To his credit he only ever kills those who deserve it  'monsters' like himself. Dexter admits however, through insightful and often chilling voice-over, that he is most certainly no super-hero. He is a self-aware socio-path who does not dream, feel guilt, love and who has an insatiable urge to kill with precision. The only reason he kills those who deserve his brutality is because of his adoptive father, Harry (Remar) and a code that he was taught. Recognizing Dexter's impulses at an early age, Harry impressed upon his adoptive son the lessons of a hardened cop whose seen too much  the unfortunate truth that the 'system' to which he dedicated his life, didn't always work. Most of the time bad people got away with doing bad things, and sometimes there just isn't any justice in the world. Enter Dexter. Harry taught him to wear a mask for the world  a mask of normalcy to hide his true psychopathic tendencies which are only to be unleashed upon those the system wrongly lets free.

The first season of Dexter pivots around the Miami police department's search for a serial killer, nicknamed the 'ice-truck killer' for the way he transports mutilated and drained bodies, leaving them in unusual places around the city for the police to find. A warped present. Even more warped is that the mysterious killer appears to be speaking directly to Dexter. With each twisted crime scene a new stone upturns for Dexter as he finds himself a new 'play-friend'  someone who is just like he is, but who doesn't appear to hide his impulses from the world the same way Dexter does, as Harry taught him to.

'Dexter' is at once a 12-part crime thriller, with each new episode the puzzle of the ice-truck killer becomes more involved. But more than a tantalizing whodunnit, 'Dexter' is a gruesomely intriguing glimpse into the mind and everyday life of a socio-path masquerading as an average joe. The character of Dexter Morgan is following in the same footsteps as Tony Soprano (""The Sopranos""), and to a less commercially successful extent, Joss Whedon's Captain Mal (""Serenity""). Dexter can be classed in the same league as that mob boss and small-time space thief because like them, the character is not the classic 'good' guy. He is bad. Sure, he goes around giving just deserts to fellow serial killers, rapists, paedophiles and all other manner of pond scum  but he is still intrinsically 'bad'. And he even admits it  he enjoys torturing and killing these people, he does not do it because they deserve to die, there is no real justice to his killings  he just needs to kill and as Harry instructed him, if he's going to do it anyway, he may as well kill those who deserve to die. And that's why Dexter is the best sort of protagonist. Finding yourself rooting for Dex, being on his side is all together strange and unnerving  that as an audience you side with the serial killer. Its very odd. But these days audiences like their protagonists to be all about the shades of grey  the morally ambiguous are so much more interesting than those on the straight and narrow.

And adding to the appeal of Dexter is Michael C. Hall. No stranger to the quirky and successful television series, Hall comes from good stock having had main role on the successful 'Six Feet Under'. From morgue to murder, Hall is enthralling  altogether sinister, likable, intimidating and sometimes appearing heroic. Dexter is no easy characterization  he has two completely opposite sides to him, both of which have to be believable for the other to hold up for the audience  a family man and a frightening serial killer. Hall is the best kind of leading man  altogether likable yet chillingly intimidating.

Its pretty much a universally acknowledged fact that television is where the real talent lies these days. TV is taking more chances than the box-office ruled films being produced, and cable means that networks are able to expand their viewer-ship and create a little more outside the box than was previously allowed on commercial television for the masses, so to speak. 'Dexter' is a testament to that truth. A gutsy, confronting, sometimes unsettling but completely satisfying and intense show that should not be missed.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
475,7.0,18 December 2006,"The writing is very good. Michael C. Hall creates a brilliant character which is quite dark and a nice change from his Six Feet Under character.

The flashbacks make an interesting back story for the show.

Clearly this show can do more given the opportunity. The Lieutenent has an opening to get justice. Dexter's sister has a lot of needed therapy.

Then there's Dexter himself. I've never seen a character so simultaneously expressive and emotionless. His constant struggles with himself and his life are all beautifully played out on screen.

And we then discover that he also uses a pseudonym in order to commend certain products, that are necessary to his criminal actions : Dexter is also known as Patric Bateman ! And it's true that ""Dexter"" as a lot to share with the universe of Brett Easton Ellis, the author of ""American Psycho"". The character suffers from a total detachment from his emotions, that gives him the feeling to be an empty shell, to always have to pretend to be human, when his absence of humanity is hidden by a superficial social mask. That's maybe the greatest part of the show, to be the reflexion of such a monstrous characters' interiority. It's too bad that it too often takes the shape of a more conventional cop drama.

SEASON 1. Rules of Attractions.

The strange universe, all in perversion and detachment of Dexter is brilliantly introduced by the first episode. It began crudely by a violent murder, and the off-voice of the killer-narrator teaches us that he's also a blood expert, for the Miami Police department. Like a crazy vigilante, Dexter is a cop the day, and a murderer of serial-killer at night (sound stupid like that, but I assure it's a very mature show), and a monster (it's a metaphor, once again : it's an adult show) who tries to be a human the rest of the time (with his girlfriend or his sister). The character and the all bizarre atmosphere of Miami is really delectable in the first episodes, but those of the middle of the season become more and more conventional, by trying to develop the other cop's characters. Fortunatly, the last four episodes, more and more centered on ""The ice-truck-killer"" story, which defined the unity of the arc this first season tells, put dexter's personality and tortured past first again, and the all thing becomes passionating again. Let's hope that the second season stays as original and cynical as its main character.

I advise you to watch 4 seasons and then stop at what you saw so that you don't stay with the feeling that you wasted a huge amount of time. That sleeping situation when people can't stop in time.

What a disaster. I would give that season 1/10 stars. And to be honest, even though seasons 7 and 8 were broadly tolerable, the show never fully recovered from season 6.

I rewatched the entire show excluding season 6 a couple of times, and while I still enjoyed it, I started to realize how depressing this show actually was. Think about it, literally every single character on this show is miserable. And I'm not talking having a bad day, but All. The. Time.

Season one started with a ""brighter"" side of Dexter, who needs to find out about his past... or let's say the past finds him. The second edition went on with the dark side of Dexter (I liked it even better), who needs to find himself. So everything I've enjoyed the most about this show holds true to these two perfect seasons. So what I love about ""Dexter"" are the carefully written characters, which change and evolve slowly during the seasons. It is not a 08/15 set of characters and you can expect interesting social constellations. After all Dexter is not the only great character here !

And considering the third installment: I'm not happy with it. Decent it is... but not as great. A slow ticking story development (far from being as deep going and personal as before), missing the dynamic evolvement of it's antecessors. Except for Dexter most characters feel static, not as fascinating. In my point of view it would had been better to cut this season down to let's say four episodes. Take it as inciting incident to get something bigger started. Probably what comes next will be more interesting - after all I'm pretty sure season three will have strong consequences for the next one !

Dexter, in particular, should not be reviewed by anyone who hasn't seen more than three episodes. I almost feel as if the first episode in the series is a tad-bit melodramatic (note Dexter screaming in the face of his first victim) just to pull in viewers that otherwise need something more visceral than a great screenplay.

By two more episodes the viewer should be absolutely intoxicated by the complexity of the character Dexter and the acting of Michael C. Hall. His own co-stars admit to being almost ""scared"" by how well Hall absorbs his character. Personally, I think that without Hall's mastery of Dexter there would be nothing to watch. Don't get me wrong, the plot of this show is extremely intriguing (and original, to be redundant), but the excitement lies purely in the way Dexter/Hall responds to A) his girlfriend, B) blood, and C) other serial killers.

I think that it is very reasonable to chuckle at Dexter's attempts to ""fit in"" social situations and I believe the writers of this show planned on it. What I am still stuck on, however, is whether or not to cheer Dexter on in his methodology (serial killing serial killers).

The seasons after that, however, made me lose interest. They were just the same as season two but changing the bad guy and adding or removing a few things. Season 3 and 4, in my opinion, would be the most boring (and annoying). Dexter would just be jumping around EVERYWHERE, getting involved with EVERYTHING in seasons 3 and 4. Season 5, 6 and 7 were also the same. I would frequently join my dad every few episodes, he would watch the whole thing whereas I would jump in and out often. I would most of the time watch the first one or two episodes, then in the middle, then in the end. Hate me all you want, but it was just very boring. Season 8, however, I watched the whole thing. Introducing a new character (Dr. Vogel) which I loved very much made it more interesting. That is all I am going to say about the final season, and that the finale is a great and unexpected ending to the long-running series.

Because of how long the series is, the viewer would feel like there is a connection between themselves and Dexter and its cast. When Dexter ended, I now feel empty and I miss the show very much.

The best series I have ever seen.. Don't end show with disappointed season 8 we need more form dexter.. It's a hard accomplishment to get someone to actually love a serial killer. But Dexter is one of those few attempts that works. It's not forced upon you- the show doesn't shove the whole ""well this serial killer had a terrible childhood..."" in your face. And it doesn't need to in order to get you to love its main character. You just do.

Michael C. Hall can play any emotion he's handed. Jennifer Carpenter fits her character perfectly, as does everyone else in the cast.

Then there's the actual story lines. It's not cliché. It's actually scary and chilling. It keeps you guessing. It's one of those mysteries that is very difficult to solve, but it still keeps your interest.

'Dexter' can also be hilarious when it wants to be, depressing when it wants to be and especially thrilling when it wants to be. And it doesn't come across as trying too hard.. DEXTER series is masterpiece on TV it can't end like that.. Bring back DEXTER!!! A highly recommend one of the few good series on TV worth watching.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

However if you watch new blood as season 9 it sort of redeams It. Season 4 is one of my favourites along side season 2 and 6. Trinity was such a horrible villain and had the best arc for Dexter. You can see the decilne in quality after the original shownrunner left but it is not bad untill the second half of season 8. It's still a good show and I enjoyed watching but I don't see any rewatchabilty as it relies on the fear of charities deaths and finding out Dexters seascret.

Watching in the 2020s, however, it's impossible not to note how poorly the female characters are developed. Only a handful of scenes pass the Bechdel test (two women who speak to each other about something other than a man). It made it hard to get through some of the episodes, as the female leads were just passed around from one male character to the next.

Still, it's worth watching the first 2 seasons for their originality and dry humor. The rest of the seasons are entertaining but not groundbreaking. The reboot, Dexter: New Blood is also worth the watch.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

The first couple of seasons were pretty good but my issues are these:

1. There is not one normal woman in this series, IMHO. Every women is represented as an emotional train wreck just dying to find a man and do anything to please them. Even the women who should be above that because of their jobs.

2. Deb's character is the most ridiculous. Whining, crying, cursing. Not realistic.

3. Every ""cop"" in Dexter's precinct has some ridiculous personal issue that is unrealistic.

Other than the killing, I found this show pretty lame. IMHO.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

Dexter is a complicated character, but I never found a good reason to hate him and the performance of Michael C. Hall was truly outstanding. In this times where too many shows are produced in national TV, Netflix or Hulu; I'm just grateful to find an excellent show that can match and in some way overcome series like Game Of Thrones, Breaking Bad or True Detective.

Michael C. Hall is just an awesome actor in pretty much anything he does, and apparently so is Jennifer Carpenter big ups on a great casting choice.

Lets start with the mood of this show, unlike all the other stuff about serial killers the pace is nice and slow, they don't rush through the show leaving you with nothing to grasp onto in fact making it an hour long was by far the best decision made for this kind of show. As far as feel is concerned since this is actually a narration from the lead and entirely based on his view of the world you really get into it with him. He takes you inside the mind of someone who doesn't perceive killing as bad or good just as a means to an end. The acting is top notch by far, this is the only show I've seen where I can truly say it literally gets better with every episode even with this many seasons in.

The show is about a serial killer who works as a blood splatter expert which gives him virtually limitless access to the files of people who got away with murder and therefore by his standard need to be killed, but also it deals with him blending in and becoming a family and society oriented person since he seems to lack the basic understanding for human response and emotions and is in turn made to fake these emotions.

531,10.0,6 November 2013,"-Well, there are a lot of things to say about this show the first would be that is one of the best on TV show ever. Why? Michael C. Hall and cast performance, original storyline, well-direction and writing, messages that the episodes bring and black humor will answer that question. Thanks to Jeff Lindsay also. If I could review the show by percentages it would be: *Michael C. Hall's performance: 40% *Cast and crew performance: 30% *Storyline, direction, writing... : 30%

Of course Michael C. Hall's performance, he is without doubt the best actor on the best show on TV. I'm so disappointed that Michael C. Hall has NEVER WON AN EMMY!! Even in the fourth season that was after the second the best season and he deserved it at least in 2010. I would be so glad if Bryan Cranston would have lost that year and Michael C. Hall would took the Emmy and this year Bryan Cranston would have won instead of Jeff Daniels. Everyone is happy, ha ha. Anyways, it would be a hard prediction and hard to make it real but I would say that Michael C. Hall could be nominated again next year, don't know if for season 7 or 8, but would be great. Honestly, he has no possibilities at all to win next year because of the so so final season, but who knows?. Also Jennifer Carpenter, C.S. Lee, David Zayas, James Remar, Desmond Harrington, Lauren Velez, Julie Benz, Aimee Garcia, Geioff Pierson and the guest actors have all very well performance but Michael C. Hall is the piece of the puzzle that makes the whole series. I like all seasons honestly though sixth is not such a masterpiece season is not bad especially on the finale but the eighth season have lost little quality. Like I said about Michael C. Hall and his incredible number of Emmy wins I say the same for the show in the drama series category. It have lost against Mad Men and not one year or two, four!. Well that's the summary of what I think about this great show. I hope Michael C. Hall would be recognize for his work and I hope he make a new show/movie that would remark him, but nothing will remark him than his character Dexter Morgan, and yes, more than David Fisher.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

Dexter is a really interesting and likeable character which also applies to the rest of the cast such as Vince Masuka, Deborah Morgan, Quinn and Doaks.

Each season has a signature murderer which keeps each season fresh and entertaining to watch. Each season ends in a race to the murderer between Dexter and the Miami Metro which is always tense to watch.

Which was, to say the least, disappointing. It left me with a feeling of emptiness, like, is this it?

A lot of characters, as stated by some of the previous reviews, did not deserve to end this way. It just doesn't do the series justice.

It was surface level and certain developments/themes would just get dropped, despite them being the entirety of an arc for a character in the season.

Every season was repetitive in terms of plots and, as a thriller revolved around psychopaths, it fell short of Hannibal.

I feel as though compromises of character's character are often glossed over for the sake of plot and it feels a bit meh at times as a result.

541,10.0,3 July 2023,"After four episodes, I'm ready to proclaim this the best show currently on TV, one that may someday rank with the likes of _The Sopranos_ and the first season of _Twin Peaks_ as a contender for the second best TV show ever (after the incomparable _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_; one of the show's producers and writers is former Buffy writer Drew Z. Greenberg, and the cast includes Buffy / Angel mainstay Julie Benz).

Dexter is a sociopath, someone with no human feelings and hence no natural, inner moral compass, and he has an unquenchable blood lust that drives him to kill. But he had the great grace to have been the adopted child of a police officer, who (as we see in terrific flashbacks) successfully instilled in him a complete moral code, which he adheres to on a strictly intellectual level. This is an utterly brilliant concept (which I assume derives from the novels it's based on), one that allows the writers to explore the nature of moral behavior and of what it means to be human (Dexter is, in a sense, an alien).

Another thing the show is doing brilliantly is moving at different speeds in parallel. There is a primary apparent season-long story arc (concerning a cat-and-mouse game between Dexter and a serial killer), and a a secondary arc involving Dexter's sister's police career. The first handful of episodes include a very powerful completed arc concerning one of Dexter's police colleagues and a local crime lord, while two of the four episodes so far have also included a self-contained story spliced among (and playing off) the ongoing ones. I've seen the future of TV season structuring, and this is it.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

Once more time, Dexter is a different dimension of the human nature and i don't understand the term hilarious. I watch not a comedy, but a real movie. Dexter must continue!

The only thing that lets it down is the disgraceful ending of Season 8. Season 8 itself isnt bad but not great either. I wouldve been completely fine with it so long as the ending was good. Sadly the finale makes the whole season feel bad, even though its okay. They're not exagerrating when they say ""the worst finale on television"". I dont think that it matters in the end though due to how good the rest of the show is. I think I enjoyed it as much as breaking bad.

Wow what a concept. Dexter, the hero of the show who by day works for the police forensics dept and by night kills peeps in cold blood. Its not that the idea was thought of that surprises me, its that it made it to our screens! Oh and how lucky we are!

Firstly the characters are great, from the quirky foul mouthed babe of a sister to the varying and interesting police characters and of course, Dexter himself. It has a charm I've rarely seen of making you laugh at the most taboo of things. Its narrative is superbly comic and it has the great ability to catch you off guard with violence, humour and nudity. But none of this ever feels like it is being done just for effect. The story evolves seamlessly and justs gets better and better. I cant speak highly enough of this show.

All I can say is that it was the most addicting show I have ever seen. God I can't wait to watch the last season even though the reviews are average at best for the finale. I even shed tears on numerous occasions for certain characters, that's how attached I got to this series. In fact I felt like Dexter was apart of the family!!! Here is my breakdown. Season 1- Fantastic with the intro to Dexter. The Ice Truck Killer so riveting and intense. Love the ending.... Season 2- Better than the first, The Bay Harbour Butcher and Srg. Doakes. Lila a real Femme Fatal. Season 3- Slipped a bit here but nonetheless very entertaining. Didn't care much for Anton and the Skinner scenario. Season 4- WOW!!!!!! Not only the best season of Dexter but the best season of any TV show period!!!! The trinity Killer is the season and played with such amazing panache by John Lithgow. Trinity has redefined the serial killer moniker that was raised by Norman Bates and Hannibal Lecture....he is that good. The ending is the most chilling emotional moment I have ever experienced in TV/film. A masterpiece. Season 5- I loved this season which goes against the grain as most people didn't. What did you expect after the tumultuous denouement of Season 4. I feel if season 5 was anywhere else than after 4 people would've liked it more. All in all a fantastic season dealing with Dexter and fatherhood and healing. I loved lumen!!!! and the barrel girl gang for killers was chilling to the bone..... Season 6- Average at best. The doomsday Killer was doomed in my book right from the beginning. The least convincing antagonist in the series and by far the worst season of Dexter Season 7- What a comeback!!!! loved it all here. Hannah Mckay is Lila and Rita in one and Isaac is the most charismatic bad guy in the entire series. Loved the ending, almost as intense as the trinity finale.

When Dexter came to TV I was somehow not motivated much to see it, and after watching few episodes in time when 3rd season were on air I was not much impressed. But after my dear friend told me how this show good is, I started to watch from beginning. I get DVD's from first 2 seasons and wow.

Now, I am that guy who have all of it in my private library, and who watch it all over again. And naturally I become one of the many fans of this unusual TV show.

What hooked me in it is that weird idea of forensic specialist - serial killer. And that one who have moral qualities and do what most of us would do to them that law can't judge properly or that deceived the system. But not Dexter. he is a hero for us, yet it is pity he can't expose it.

But man how many of them he judged. And all that under the clean ritual under strict code. With that his jujitsu mastery, totally opposed to that nerd look and behave.

Well I saw the promo of new season and it is here, and as much it can be seen, this will be great ending of series. I mean I wish there will be more Dexter, as I never get enough of him but if the season 6 will be the last I hope it will be as we fans expect it to be.

Even all seasons are great, and have its storyline with great casts and guest stars, my personal favorite are season 2, Mostly because dexter were dealing with his own crimes and that intrigue about will they catch him.

Pros - Unique and amazing story line with tons of twists, hell of a cast and top notch production quality(Relative to that time).

Cons - Rushed ending, Plot holes, slowly degenerating to the end and too much relationships.

The last season getting a lot of hate from fans but honestly it is not as bad as they say. Relatively it is really a good season and not great but a good ending to the series. But I can imagine if I watched this on television patiently waiting, yeah I would be a little mad too. They must have gradually direct the story there using several episodes I guess.

And through out the series they skip a lot of small details without explaining much thus creating quite a bit of plot holes.

Great overall story arcs to each season & main storyline flow very well through the 8 seasons of this showtime great. It has a great cast & great writing & u don't have to sit through 5 episodes to know what's what, you'll either like it or won't, so after a few episodes you'll know whether your a Dexter fan. Sure some seasons are worse than others but it never gets to a point where its not enjoyable to watch.

Basically Dexter is a serial killer & we get to follow his life & how it affects him & those around him. It's tense & violent & funny & upsetting, all while being a drama. I know you think the whole serial killer thing has been done before but not like this. This is a stand alone series & has its own merits.

You invest a lot into dexter & the characters & you'll be glued to the tv if you binge watch this. I've rewatched the seasons I think about 4 times & I still enjoy watching it. Even after knowing what happens to who & when & why, my love for the show kept me entertained.

My personal order of my favourite seasons from best to worse is 4,2,1,7,3,5,8,6. Just because I picked some seasons lesser doesn't justify the whole season as there's great episodes in every season it's just my preference, however I highly recommend you start from the beginning as you'll enjoy the show that much more & you'll also miss out on characters & crucial plot twists if you jump seasons, therefore not understanding or appreciating the show to its full extent.

FUN FACT:Michael C Hall who plays Dexter & Jennifer Carpenter who plays Dexter sister Debra were married in real life & seperated during the show, ummm #awkardfilming It's a tremendous asset to them that you won't even notice & C Hall suffered a form of cancer through the show & kept filming with a wig.

So what are you waiting for ? If you haven't seen it jump aboard the dexter train.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
568,10.0,27 April 2014,"I have been a faithful fan of Dexter since its inception, agreeing completely with the notion that justice comes in a shade of gray rather than being black or white. Imagine my disappointment when the series ended on such a punishing tone for Dexter. It seems to me that the whole point of the show has been obliterated by one final episode. Nevertheless, I don't regret watching Dexter because it has given me a unique opportunity to see things from the perspective of a criminal and a murderer, instead of that of a officer of the law. I has surprised me like few TV shows have done before. The twists in the story line have always kept me glued to the screen. I believe that the wild success of the series originates from Dexter's frankness as in regards to what he is, a killer, and the way his acts prove he's actually capable of deeper emotions than most normal human beings. I recommend Dexter openly because it has revolutionized the 'small- screen' industry and it breaks barriers and floods the mind with new views on the human psyche.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
569,9.0,24 March 2014,"I'll keep this a little short. Dexter was my absolute favorite show.....until the end. I was so into it, that I would feel ill with anticipation and literally have to force myself to keep watching. THEN.....season 8 came and the plot careened out of control and the series started,(even more than before), to make little sense. They disrespected Batista, who was on the show for years and ultimately got little screen time, and many actors were brought in for a Hollywood incest fest. They also cheaply used the season as a cash-cow advertisement vehicle, BLATANTLY placing Pepsi into one of the shots. THAT'S one of the reasons how you know the show crapped out so bad. They also played dress-up too much in the season by wearing bright colors and saturated many of the scenes with red. Also, they zoomed onto characters too closely with the camera and forgot to involve a broader audience for the story. It was this aspect that truly made the story feel shallow and unrealistic, like a really crappy comic book with one or two people in each frame.

Yeah, the show went down when they tried to be too Hollywood and also, at the same time, went too meta, meaning that they tried to convey too much deep meaning on screen. If you're not careful in doing that, the show can easily lose viewers along the way.

Also, the plot just had too many holes and refused to circle back onto its own storyline by bringing up the past seasons and events. Not only did they refuse to close this gap by filming certain scenes, but the dialogue was also crappy and really, honestly, could have been better written by a monkey......with disabilities and no hands. It's like that South Park episode with the manatees in the tank randomly picking out words for a Family Guy episode by choosing a random ball. Horrendous. And offensive.

I don't want to really throw out the entire series, but I am in FULL agreement that Dexter was really meant to be a package-deal series. The story was so centered on Dexter that to let the series crap out in the end LITERALLY made the entire series lose value. I literally cannot watch Dexter anymore. It's like being punched in the gut while having your brain sucked out of your head, and a black hole start in your heart with your soul being vanquished forever to Satan by Jesus Christ. Which is to say, you'll wish you never watched it all to begin with. Remembering only hurts.

So, the stars? Dexter gave me some really, really good times, so I can't give it one star just because of the last season. However, the last season is a travesty to the series overall and blights the honorable name of Dexter Morgan. Just end the series on season four or five, and you'll be good.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

Dexter, now known as ""Jim Lindsay,"" has given up his killer ways in honor of Deb and all those he'd inadvertently hurt. He spends much of his alone time with a solemn, mostly-quiet phantom version of his late sister.

The Ghost of Deb: Jennifer Carpenter's Deb serves as Dexter's new ghost, his revived conscience. She's a source of warning and nagging but also moments of impact.

Deb's presence is both loving and haunting, echoing the show's past while adding depth to Dexter's internal struggle.

A New Dynamic: Dexter, like in Season 2, is unable to kill. The lack of temptation in this frozen town seems to be the key factor.

If I'm gonna invest time in a series that I didn't catch 10 years ago then I usually look for one that rates pretty high, usually more than 8. But it makes sense to view the ratings from individual seasons, maybe even each episode.

I watched seasons 1 thru 5 and thoroughly enjoyed them all.

Then season 6 just seemed to drag. The Doomsday Killer story arc was so boring. Biblical, formulaic nonsense that I gave up on and stopped watching after episode 3.

A year later and I gave it another go and, to be honest, the rest of season 6 didn't improve at all but then, the very last minute of episode 12 ended with a season cliff-hanger that was just too good not to watch season 7.

And I am so glad I did.... Season 7, best season ever.

The final season of the series, season 8 was back to tedious in parts, but wrapped up with a satisfying finale.

Overall a solid 7.5 from me.

Except for season 6 (5 out of 10) and season 7 (9 out of 10) But wait, there's more... I have just found out that after ending in 2013 there is now a 9th season just finished shooting.

588,1.0,1 March 2018,"Dexter is an amazing show, lets simply put it at that. Not only is the plot captivating, but the way the show builds brings intense drama and suspense to you on a silver platter. Based on the ""Dexter"" novels by Jeff Lindsay, The show stars a lot of big name stars, Michael C. Hall and Jennifer Carpenter (these two do an AMAZING job, by the way) being the two mains. The plot centers around a man named Dexter Morgan, a blood spatter analyst for the Miami Metro Police Department. He has a seemingly happy, normal life, with a pretty average social life outside of work. The only thing - He's a serial killer that targets other criminals - typically ones who escape the law. The show creates a sort of atmosphere of love and support for Dexter and what he does, even though it isn't all that legal. It's hard not to imagine him as your favorite character.

Another amazing thing about this show is that we're literally learning from the mind of Dexter. We can hear his thoughts, narrations, and everyday planning as if we were him. We are also able to pick up on subtle hints dropped by other characters that the audience may not have picked up, but Dexter did. This plus the phenomenal camera work make us feel like we're in his world, like we can feel the same emotions he's feeling when he panics and paces around the lab or in his home, or when he's angry and the camera deliberately shows him much larger than the opposing party.

The last thing I'll talk about is the scenery. Sunshiney Miami seems perfect for a dark contrast - a serial killer. The show gives off average crime show vibes with a dark twist, even though it's almost always sunny and vibrant where they are.

Dexter is a great show for people who are into crime shows, mysteries, and even comics. This show really has a little element of everything anyone could ever want in a show. Humor, mystery, and serial killers.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

602,9.0,18 February 2008,"Despite all the rave reviews, DEXTER proves to be quite a disappointing series, failing to delve into the mind of a serial killer in an in-depth, challenging and compelling manner. After a promising set-up, the series goes nowhere, relying on quirky one-liners and slick production values rather than strong writing which gets under the skin of some potentially disturbing characters and themes. Every character never gets past their initial set-up, providing no depth, and a growing sense of annoying repetition. Despite being based on a novel, the series' writers seem to forget that character depth propels the story, and I don't know whether or not it happens in the novel, but the series makes some fatal mistakes that make the story less interesting. Michael C Hall proves a dull lead, but given the routine writing, he can't be fully blamed. Having him occasionally look at the camera and smirk was a huge mistake. The only actor who rises above the material is James Remar, a genuine film actor who has presence and knows how to inhabit a character. The episodes vary in quality, and the best episodes are those directed by Michael Cuesta (who directed the under-rated films L.I.E and TWELVE AND HOLDING), who keeps a better balance between quirky comedy and the darker series DEXTER could have been. With most modern films/TV series, the story can only progress by people acting stupid, and unfortunately DEXTER suffers from this failing, which seems more irritating when characters seem smarter than Albert Einstein most of the time. DEXTER is fun, entertaining, and very, very slick. But when one sees what a dark, disturbing, blackly comic show it could have been, one feels rather short-changed. Given one of the show's very clunky in-jokes, one should just watch American PSYCHO. It offers a better, darker view of a serial killer (not to mention a far superior lead performance), where the black humour is cleverly handled, not just a way to make off-putting material more acceptable for a mainstream audience.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

Michael C Hall plays the lead role in a show which almost questions the morality of today's laws and justice. In summary a serial killer who kills killers.

The macabre nature of the show is not for all, nor is the vigilante style justice meted out to those who are deemed guilty by Dexter. Nonetheless, it's gripping and whether you believe in what he does is right or not doesn't detract from the story in each series.

However, there is a stark difference between the early episodes and those from series 6 onward. They appear to mature and grow darker... and the relatively light production style from early days feels more brooding and sinister to the point you start questioning your loyalties to Dexter.

Michael C Hall plays the character well and you find yourself almost cheering him on, wanting him to get away with it whilst wondering, 'how will this all end?'... And it's that thought which keeps you gripped...

If the thought of a serial killer killing killers sounds interesting, then you may well enjoy this.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
606,10.0,31 January 2016,"I just watched the final episode of this great series last night (31/01/2016), after having watched the 2nd last episode that afternoon. Later I'll briefly discuss the finale but without giving too much away.

""Dexter"" is the story of a a serial killer (i.e. Dexter Morgan) who works for...the Miami Police Department! Being a psychopath, he must try and fit in with society so as not to arouse suspicion in others. That being said, the series does have humour going for it, as Dexter often appears a fish out of water just trying to appear normal! Even though humour is a part of this series, there is quite a bit of gore in this show, especially in the final series.

If the prospect of watching a TV series about a serial killer doesn't sound like your cup of tea, I'd say that the concept is more involving than it sounds. Think of it like this...if you watch a nature documentary about gazelles and you see a lioness stalking it, you despise the predator. However, if you watch a nature documentary about lions and you're informed that there is a drought and the lion cubs will die soon without a meal, you root for the lioness' hunt. It's all about perspective and the story's point of view.

The TV series is based on at least one book in the series by Jeff Lindsay. ""Dexter""'s opening titles give a credit to the first in that series, ""Darkly dreaming Dexter"", although I'm not sure how many more are drawn on for the TV series. Without having read the books and having just now glanced at some of the Wikipedia entries for these books, it seems that there is a degree of divergence in the history of the character. I didn't know that there were so many books in this series but I am now interested in reading them, especially after the finale of the TV series. That being said, having looked at the Wikipedia entry for the last book, I'm not sure that I'd like the resolution to the character's story in the book either.

Anyway, back to the TV series. It's filled with flawed characters who you care for, even though some of them have done bad things.

Having started watching this series on commercial TV, I have to say that the first series struck me as being a bit wooden...my memory is foggy, so perhaps I had in mind things like the acting or script. It would have been a chore to have had to watch episodes back-to-back at that time. For some reason I bought series 5 on DVD...perhaps because I missed recording it on the TV or maybe it didn't have closed captions. I'd say that I missed the start of series 7 on TV or perhaps it had no closed captions, so I bought it on Blu-ray. Series 7 was the pinnacle of this show, in my opinion, and watched episodes back-to-back at times or one consecutive days. My experience is that I can only do that with quality television, not B shows (i.e. B grade).

The thing that made the 7th series the best was just the choices that Dexter had to make...choices that redefined him. Let's not forget the principle villain of that series either...the relationship which Dexter forged with him was unlike anything else in the series.

Now for the final episode: scriptwriters have a tough job when it comes to ending a series. It's not easy to get it right. I'm not sure that ""House"" nailed its finale. ""Weeds"" had a benign ending. ""Breaking bad"" had a logical finale which I had no problem with. I'm not sure that ""Dexter"" got it right. It is actually haunting me though, which all good dramatic art should do. There are a lot of ""What if...?"" questions in my mind...like there were for that terrific Australian movie ""Summerfield"", which I reviewed here and is well worth viewing for fans of Dexter. It would be fascinating to know what scenarios the scriptwriters had for the finale...a pity I can't ""choose your own adventure""!

Actually, that final series threw everything (including the kitchen sink) into the mix. Everything seemed a little rushed. The finale too, has a lot plates spinning in the air, so to speak. Dexter makes a series a choices. It doesn't seem to me that he made the right ones. He is not redeemed at the series, which would be nice. Or at least it's a very flawed sort of redemption. Perhaps this character's story is driven by an equivalent sort of logic as that for homosexual characters in popular culture many decades ago, i.e. a small number of possible outcomes. The choices that Dexter makes which has an impact on others seem poor ones, e.g. for Heather and Harrison.

Then there is that final shot in the finale...I wonder if that was the scenario that Dexter was striving to achieve just a few minutes earlier in the episode...was that his plan all along? Or was it an accident?

Finally, amongst the ""buzz"" TV series in recent years, I have to say that I've liked ""Dexter"" the best, of the ones that I've seen right through to the end. Liked it more than ""Breaking bad"". It was an interesting journey with him. I would have scored this 10/10 if it had ticked all the boxes that I was hoping for...something more approaching a Jane Austen ending than a Thomas Hardy (in a mood) ending.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

There were no tell-tale signs that the relationship changed between the off-camera couple around the 2nd season, which was great. The writers handled it very well. But then when they divorced around season 6, it seemed that (even though they claim it was amicable) you could tell on set. It was strange. Palpable even that Jennifer seemed a little scornful. All-in-all, great show, just little things caused me to give 8 stars. I read that MCH wasn't happy with his salary toward the end, too...so that could be why they wrapped it up so fast in season 8.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

I thought I'd be able to guess outcomes and then I'd be surprised by a result that came along. I'd recommend this to any fan of mystery or criminal investigation shows. Being a fan of the serial killer genre of movies, I was very skeptic of a show about a serial killer; again, the surprise came after only two episodes. I was hooked. Generally, I'm a fan of the 'regular' sitcoms: Desperate Housewives, Grey's Anatomy and the like and I'm sure the CSI shows can keep something going, but they deal with different crimes a lot. A show about a serial killer that works for the cops? Yeah, right... Curiosity proved to be quite ""on my side"" this time, though, as the show proved to be better than any I've seen in a long time. I like it better than Seinfeld and that's saying something for a guy with the Kramer painting in his living room. Just make sure you can handle the gore.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
629,9.0,14 December 2006,"Dexter is a rare find. I'm a little embarrassed to admit that I count the days until the next episode.

99% of the content on TV is mindless drek; clichéd re-workings of the same forgettable formula.

But, Dexter is in a class of its own.

Terrific acting, sharp and unforced dialogue, dark humour that, like Dexter himself, creeps up on you when you least expect it. It also creates a fine balance between the crime content and the character relationships. Flashback segments are segued naturally and utilized sparingly, unlike the TV show LOST which is crammed with annoying filler that seems more and more to be an attempt to distract viewers from the fact that the writers are writing their way out of a hole.

My jaw literally drops when I watch Dexter. What else can you say?","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
630,10.0,30 October 2006,"This is an excellent piece of work for Showtime. Michael C. Hall wonderfully portrays Dexter, the serial killer who only kills serial killers. As you might expect, the show challenges the viewer to decide whether or night they like Dexter's character. Furthermore, the sequential growth of his character from one episode to the next leaves you fascinated as to what his next move will be. Through and through the performances are solid and the quality of the cinematography and film style is especially captivating. I am generally not a fan of serial killer thrillers but this show is particularly well done because Dexter is different than any character I have ever seen. I understand that the show is based on a number of books and I inspired to read them only after seeing four episodes.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

Dexter does not kill at random, he seeks out other killers and seeks to server justice as he see fit... a very entertaining new television show...I highly recommend giving it a chance","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
632,10.0,16 July 2007,"Dexter Morgan works for the Miami Dade County Police Department as a blood spatter expert of the forensics department. He is currently dating Rita,a former victim of an abusive drug addict, has a sister who's just joined the homicide devision and a superior officer who enjoys busting his balls whenever the opportunity arises. Oh and he's a completely sociopathic serial killer.

But instead of quenching his thirst for murder on the innocent citizens of Miami, he carefully chooses gangsters, drug dealers, paedophiles, murderers. Individuals all of which Dexter feels have long outlived their purpose in the world because they are simply bad people.

I first became aware of this series after seeing posters advertising it in a local comic book store in my home town. now the idea of a forensics expert who's also a serial killer screams comic books origins and you'd be on the right track to assume that. It's based on a novel or rather a series of novels. I haven't read them myself but I've read several positive reviews.

Getting back to the series. It's nice to see television putting some effort into their programming these days. With the reality TV bug dieing, thankfully, a slow and painful death. Shows such as this, Heroes, Supernatural, Lost etc have proved that the writing seems to be getting better and much more entertaining.

Dexter is basically could the result of Brett Easton Ellis ever wrote an episode of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation in which Gil Grissom goes insane and starts killing off the bad guys or if The Punisher wasn't so wild about big guns. When the viewer watches Dexter they can't help him but find the guy somewhat likable. Given he's a complete sociopath and a killer we should be repelled by his actions but the fact that he only punishes those who deserve it, we are forced in some ways to support his ""fight"" against evil.

Dexter's emotional well being or lack there of, often feels conflicted whenever in the presence of his girlfriend Rita. As stated earlier she was a victim of an abusive husband and has zero interest in sexual intercourse. Something which, Dexter admits, is comfortable which. Yet he often finds himself having thoughts which he can't understand, could they be feelings? or something much more sinister? we don't know but this creates definitely the most complex and deep character driven relationships in the entire series.

The reviewer only wishes the other interactions between Dexter and the other characters were this fascinating. Another relationship which played out very well in the series was between Dexter and his adoptive father, backed up brilliantly by James Remar's wonderfully understated performance as a detective who's own emotional reserve has been burnt out by the justice system allowing the wrong people getting away with crimes they were so obviously guilty of. This is a state of mind which, for better or worse is instilled within Dexter.

What probably stands out most is the writing and of course the acting. Michael C. Hall, James Remar and Julie Benz are fantastic in this. It's outstanding to see their hard work hasn't gone un-noticed with Hall, Benz and Remar picking up awards for their tremendous effort on what has to be one of the best TV shows in this past decade.

I can't recommend this series enough. Fans of American Psycho will really enjoy this or people who enjoy TV that can be both engaging and entertaining at the same time. Please, watch at least one episode, I'm sure there'll be something in there that will get your attention and keep for the run of the series.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
633,10.0,5 December 2006,"The complexity of the character Dexter draws viewers into this crime drama. It is strange to find a serial killer so endearing and identifiable. Michael C. Hall does an amazing acting job, playing both the part of serial killer Dexter and acting normal Dexter. I applaud his performance. Dexter's relationships with the contrasting outside world create the story, particularly the relationships with his sister and girlfriend. He has problems opening up with his sister, his only surviving relative, as well as difficulty forming a romantic relationship with another woman, Rita. Comedy is what brings all the elements together to form a complete story and excellent series. It really brings the basis of morality into question - is it wrong to kill the bad guys?","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
634,10.0,19 March 2022,This show should've been over after the first season what only the guy on the first season could figure out Dexter was the killer everyone else is to stupid show sucks.,"October 1, 2006 (United States)"
635,5.0,18 November 2014,"Now, with all 8 seasons consecutively and within 3 months behind me, I am very pleased that I decided to watch them - in spite of my prior skepticism due to the background (although I like Death Wish movies, for example), less known actors and total duration (96 episodes!). Neither I have read the Dexter books. Anyways, its tense plot without major goofs/unrealities, pleasant acting and skilfully constructed past and present (with flashbacks) form a solid works where almost 5000 minutes of watching are worth it.

True, as I watched all this afterwards, there were less unknown moments for me as I could realize that e.g. Dexter would not get caught in Season 4 :), and characters played by more famous actors would last at least for the whole season... On the other hand, Dexter's nature, working place and operating methods are rather logical - it is not realistic when an ordinary geek becomes suddenly a vigilante and does not get caught for years, fooling the best minds in the police.

Well done, even better than Breaking Bad which has obtained more fame and praise. Of course, the topics concerned and related moral results do not often correspond to our daily customary ones... As for the course of events, I find later seasons even more interesting, with enhanced craziness and double-crossings.

Plus that Michael C. Hall and Jennifer Carpenter will be in my wishful watch list from now on.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
636,9.0,5 October 2011,"Dexter is, without a doubt, one of my favorite television shows currently on the air, in its sixth season and still going strong. It is a crime mystery told from the killer's point of view but, unlike any other dark show or movie of its kind, actually has the audience rooting for the macabre protagonist of the series, Dexter Morgan.

Set in the extravagant city of Miami, Dexter uses his job as a blood splatter analyst at the police department as a way to find info about his next victim. But Dexter has a code: he only kills those who are guilty of killing innocents, but who have, for one reason or another, slipped through the cracks of the justice system. Dark, dramatic, action-packed, and often morbidly humorous, this show is bound to please.

The acting and writing is top notch. Michael C. Hall's performance is phenomenal—he acts a demented serial killer who, in turn, has to act like an everyday joe in order to blend in with society. Dexter lacks things that most other people possess, like feelings, morals, and a sense of connection with other humans. Through his constant struggle to control his desire to murder, one episode of Dexter can show us, the audience, more about the dark side of human nature than most other television shows can do in a season.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
637,10.0,16 January 2010,"Dexter is definitely one of the best shows ever on American TV. Even with the basic idea being a bit ridiculous Dexter seems more sensible then most ""more realistic"" shows on TV. The show is well written, well acted and doesn't seem to lose any of it's charm as the seasons go by, which is quite rare. Every season seems to be as good as the last one, if not better but with enough changes to keep it interesting. Even though Dexter might have some characters that fit regular crime-show stereotypes (Doakes, Masuka etc), it also has characters that seem to fit no stereotype at all. Forgetting the obvious one, Dexter, there is Rita who starts off so hurt, lost (yet always good) and delicate but bit by bit becomes a strong independent mother and wife, a slightly unusual storyline for any cop-show. The absolute jewel of the show however is Debra. On the surface she might fit the profile of a foul-mouthed female cop but under the surface is so much more. One of the most brilliant, interesting, endearing and above all genuine characters I've ever seen on television. Thank you Jennifer Carpenter!","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
638,8.0,22 December 2006,"Usually, when you watch a cop drama/action/suspense show, you get the feeling that complexity consumes you. Well, this one is no different, but only in terms of what the complexity is. Usually, in regular cop dramas, you're looking for someone or something to answer all your questions, and in Dexter, that is also the case, but it's the way you find out that is truly masterful. The cat and mouse game is literally a game, and you just can't help but feel remorse for the good people and excitement and vigor for the bad people. I can't tell you how many times I waited to see a new crime scene or a new flashback or a new revelation, or just a funny comment by a witty character. This show hooks you and drags you around by your emotions. This is also a show you can watch over and over again and figure new things out and wonder what really was going on. 10 out of 10.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
639,9.0,15 December 2006,"I first gave this series a shot because of the interesting plot line (blood splatter expert for the Miami police dept by day, serial killer by night) and because I love Michael C Hall (aka Dexter). I'm glad I did because as the season has progressed, this show has become one of my favorites. Every Sunday I get excited because a new episode is going to air. This series is so original and has an excellent cast. No one else could play this character as well as Michael C Hall. At first, I wasn't sure how the creators were going to get the audience to sympathize with a serial killer. But they have done just that, making the audience root for Dexter because he kills only ones who are guilty of heinous crimes that haven't been caught. And because he's a complex character who just wishes to be normal and to know what happened to him to make him want to kill. He also takes excellent care of the ones who are a part of his strange life. There are many aspects to this show and plenty of story lines to follow. But the main storyline has centered around one main serial killer who is murdering a countless amount of women in a horrendous manner. The Miami police are trying to track him down (with help from Dexter). Somehow this serial killer knows of Dexter and of Dexter's secret (that he's also a serial killer). So, now this serial killer has become intertwined with Dexter's life. Will Dexter catch him in time or will it be too late?","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
640,10.0,5 December 2007,"The first time I saw ""Dexter"" I didn't know what hit me. There was not one show that even came close to it. Each episode was more thrilling than the next,full of bizarre twists and comic relief. Only the ending of this first season was a bit off in comparison to the previous episodes. But still as a whole this show was simply amazing. After being introduced to the first season of Dexter I never could have imagined that the second season even would surpass the first. This second season shows the aftermath of the previous season concerning the Ice Truck killer. Debs (Dexter's sister)is a mess. And Dexter has to pretend that he is a coke addict in order to account for his strange behavior that Rita (his girlfriend) has noticed. In the rehab clinic he meets his savior and his doom at the same time. A woman called Lila. To make matters even worse is that the police found the bodies Dexter dumped in the Bay Harbor. Soon it becomes apparent that ""The Bay harbor Butcher"" is even worse than ""The Ice Truck killer"". With the police on his tail he has to control his urges and watch his every move. From start to finish it is a joy to see what Dexter is up to and how he handles matters. And this time the mix of comedy and thrilling moments is just perfect. It is actually hard to admit. But even when you know that Dexter is a serious psycho killer you do care for the guy. That credit has to go the excellent Michael C. Hall in the first place. An then of course the clever writing. Without spoiling the plot I honestly can say that the conclusion of the second season is much better than the first and certainly more satisfying. It will make you ask for more. And it has not been confirmed yet,but I do hope Dexter will return for a third season. If there is one show that is entitled to than it is ""Dexter"". Since this show is becoming better by the minute!","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
641,9.0,18 March 2007,"Although the idea of the anti-hero is old as Homer, 'Dexter' brings something tangy and interesting to the table -- a creepy serial killer with, get this, a CODE of sorts. He does despicable things to despicable people, and while you can't really LIKE the guy, you begin to understand him. Chilling! Top notch cast -- I really like the fact that while Dexter's facade seems perfect, there are still those around him (and not necessarily those who've known him longest) who just don't buy it. Simultaneously conflicted and driven by his sick darkness, the main character has got to be one of the most repulsive to ever hit the small screen, and also one of the most engaging. Can't wait for season 2, now that one of the big mysteries of season 1 has come to some sort of conclusion. If Showtime messes it up and passes on a second season, I'd still buy the DVD of season 1, just to creep myself out with Dexter's unsettling world.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
642,9.0,21 June 2024,"Unfortunately, I can't understand the hype surrounding this series in any way. I really tried it and made it to the end of season 3, but then gave up because it just wasn't meant to be. :-P

The first thing that got on my nerves very quickly was Dexter's eternal head voice. He babbles incessantly and unfortunately he always spoils himself, so that any kind of tension is lost. Everything happens with an announcement and you can just watch him do it. That wouldn't be so bad in itself if it wasn't so boring. I'm still wondering why it should be rated 18? There are countless films/series in which it is much harder and that with FSK 16. Here you basically see tons of cling film and the pattern is always the same. Wrapped up, then a small slit in the cheek for the memory test and then it's just hinted that a chainsaw is used. That's okay for the first ten times, but then it's just boring.

Many people complain about Dexter's annoying sister, but what I found worse was his girlfriend, who was always whining. She really got on my nerves. No matter whether there was joy or sorrow, she was always equally tearful.

The humor (if there is any in the series) didn't hit me. The look is of course getting on in years and I wonder if I would have liked it better back then. Nevertheless, there are also series from that time that have ""aged"" less.

For me, it's a typical early evening series where everything is talked to death, everything is very drawn out and there's no suspense or surprises.

Too bad, but I gave it a try. - It wasn't meant to be. But the series has its community and that's fine. :-)","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
643,5.0,8 March 2007,"At the time of writing this,I have only watched half of this series which I believe has twelve episodes.It is very slickly made and I am pretty confident that it will prove to be very popular.

In basic terms,the story is almost vigilante in it's tone.Dexter kills people in a pretty brutal way but only 'bad' people.The morals of this may leave a sour taste in the most delicate of mouths,but it is done with it's tongue very firmly in it's cheek and there is no denying that this is a very well made and acted series.

Michael C Hall fits the leading role like a glove and clearly has a ball playing Dexter.His deadpan,emotionless performance is exactly what is called for.He makes the character likable even if you question his lust for gruesome murders.At the core of this series is the hunt for a serial killer that cuts up their victims without leaving a trace of blood.Dexter obviously admires them and believe me,you will stay with this series to find out who the killer is.

If you want to try something different,'Dexter' may well be up your street.I reckon that if you watch the first couple of episodes,you won't be able to stop yourself from watching.

As a postscript to this show,I have now watched season two and although it wasn't quite as high a standard as the first series it is still pretty good.A couple of problems I felt were that Dexter spends too much time not acting like Dexter and that the character of Lila wasn't acted too well.I have read some reviewers raving about her but this surprises me as I felt Jaime Murray was probably the weakest actress in the series.Overall though it is well worth a watch and I would give season one 9.3 and season two 8.2.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

I really enjoyed Dexter. The last episode I was all ""How is this going to end?"" and keep asking myself of how this thing is going to be ended in fifty minutes.

I'm not gonna spoil anything but Dexter is a really great show and I really wished there were more episodes in the first season and Michael Hall is a great actor and Dexter is a great character and the way he manages to make up great lies.

649,9.0,19 January 2007,"I barely watch much television at all because I find pretty much all the stuff that is on to be boring. I almost didn't even watch Dexter but there was nothing else to do; good thing too. This show has it all... suspense, a great plot, and many surprises throughout. Most shows and even movies are all too predictable. Dexter however, although sometimes predictable like all other shows and movies, did in fact fool me maybe once or twice which is certainly better than the amount of times any other show has... zero. The show doesn't just offer surprises, it also offers a new plot unlike any other show which is incredibly interesting. The first season is carried entirely by Michael C. Hall who plays Dexter Morgan with very little help of any other great acting except for perhaps Julie Benz who plays Rita Bennett. Dexter however plays a role not often played in shows or movies and acts brilliantly to portray an obvious separation and misunderstanding of the world because of his ""condition"" (not to spoil). His acting is bland, but much to the calling of the role, because he in fact sees the world in an indifferent light. But perhaps the blandness is the most intriguing part of his acting, because although many might say that it isn't acting I would beg to differ. Humans live off emotions and for an actor to act an emotion is pretty natural to say the least. But Dexter is instead presenting a sort of indifference, brilliant... for this is not an emotion many people possess on such a scale to so many issues. The narration is also very well done, narrated by Dexter himself in order to give the viewer a look inside his mind that none of his acquaintances see.

Many might think the show is too weird, perhaps that is why I believe it to be so interesting. But in order to shorten this comment, readers should just watch a few episodes for themselves and give more comments for others interested in this show.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
650,9.0,16 January 2022,"The first 8 seasons is where I'm leaving it - mentally. I watched this new blood season - and it ended in the most ridiculous manner. Everything he explains in the code - all the way until this joke of a last episode is nothing but a waste of time. Michael Hall - I'm sorry bud, but Urkel is still Urkel. You are a very talented actor and I'm sure you'll get more roles but I, among allot of others, will see you as Dexter. No matter what you play in - star in. You feel like killing off the character to give you a sense of a new life for yourself and call Dexters ending inevitable but that's nuts. The season that just played was great all the way until that finale. Build up and tease viewers to keep on watching for what exactly? Bringing back Batista and Debra - was for nothing - for only one last season when the storyline and our imagination as fans kept on floating about Dexters demise. He could have died in an accident- fell through ice on the lake, fell in a cave and rotted out his final days, car accident, the ideas are endless. But to write out and just make us painfully watch the main character do everything opposite of what he does by muscle memory is not just 'inevitable'. Him needing to break out of the jail when his alibis were weak but good enough for a continuation but to kill an innocent cop was not Dexters m.o. His girlfriend running up to Harrison at the end was redundant too. She was gone at a mass murders' layer to calling in 'everybody' to just happening to be walking up to the deer site is too far fetched - the entire last episode makes me want to throw my 8 seasons in the ocean in garbage bags. This new politically correct era is ruining tv as we once knew it. Once these writers and actors get on the same page as the typical viewer and the fans, they will keep people watching. Michael don't want to be a character after he literally built a career on that on screen person after 8 seasons you can't just teleport or time machine a do over on what you think should be the ending of that character.

655,8.0,8 February 2007,"This is a great show. None of the multiple ""out of the hat"" twists and turns of very convolute counterparts (Lost, 24, Heroes). You get the sense that the show The show has enough side-plots to keep you interested and a very consistent center line.

Some great acting from Michael C. Hall and cast.

The plot follows the story of a ""slightly more than most"" disturbed individual. He takes taking lives very seriously. Everything he goes through seems to happen to someone else but in a very vivid and compelling way. As he gets more detached you as a viewer get more taken into the show. None of that feeling you sometimes get when you watch something and you half expect someone to yell ""CUT!!!""

Moreover the show does not seem to have that annoying feature more and more shows have today: The ""lucky coincidence"" the ""providential factor"". Although you can tell that the main character is going to pull through, the show manages to transmit the tension off the screen.

As the show (the first season anyway) ended it left the viewer both with a feeling of closure and a feeling of excitement for the next installment. In that respect it is somewhat like 24, only less intricate and a lot more dramatic. At some point when watching a very long show you stop enjoying the show and start just wandering what the script will be like the next time around.

I recommend the show and hope that the writers have prepared a hole new treat for us this time around

Dexter without a doubt is a smart,dangerous, and charming character with no human motion. All his life his mentor/foster father taught him how fight his urge to kill by taking it on the bad people and how to fit in society by faking a smile or too. He even works for the Miami police department which is hilarious ,but also since he loves the sight of blood since dear Dexter works as a blood spatter to make him feel at home.

Dexter works in the morning, becomes a very neat monster at night hunting down his victims for his slide collection. Dexter is not a guy you want to mess with him unless you want to end up in his famous kill room filled with plastic walls and a slice to your cheek!

660,10.0,28 September 2015,"Many of my friends told me it is an amazing show, I never really checked it out until this weekend.

I forced myself to sit through the first 2 episodes - and there has been no turning back since.

The story line: Dexter is a Serial Killer. That's all you need to know for starters.

I've never seen so many people vouch for a serial killer. I think the ability to create such a character is an outrageous challenge, and the creators of this show have been able to do justice to that! The strength of the show has been its ability to create strong villains that make Dexter a necessary evil. I wish they would stick to that formula. Whenever they've failed to do that, there have been too many holes in the plot and some episodes leave me wondering how amateur the work has been.

I just completed 4 season back to back of this series. Good show, characterization and story line is solid. Michael C. Hall,James Remar, Julie Benz,John Lithgow lived their characters so far..Starting of 5th season has taken me into a shock.This is not digestible. I am writing this review only for story line S05E01..Killing such a beautiful character is very cruel and not acceptable. :( whoever thought this should be killed first. Julie Benz I Love You. You did a superb job.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
661,10.0,21 April 2013,"Maybe ""Sinister"" would have been a giveaway.

The acting and plotting are the highlights. Terrific casting and high writing standards - especially the dialogue - keep this going.

You do have to suspend considerable disbelief. For example, nobody locks their cars or homes, regardless of how scared they are; Dexter apparently never sleeps; is never missed even when he goes overseas; has the energy of ten men; is invisible when on the job; etc. This put me off at first and for a long time I avoided the show, thinking it was a poor derivative of the books.

But in fact it is very good on its own. The exceptional things outweigh all of the negatives and shortcuts, and I'm glad I gave it another chance. Recommended.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
662,10.0,27 June 2013,"DEX.. A forensic expert(Blood spatter Analyst) working for Miami Metro police and excellent at job, cracks any case in seconds by the blood pattern in the crime scene.He is also a serial killer which makes him best at the job.Knowing this about him, his dad gives him a code to kill people.(Killing the Bad people guilty of something they did).And Dex calls this part of him as the dark passenger.So it is all about how to balances his dark passenger with his regular life and pretends to be normal to others.

The best part about Dexter is it is consistently good for seven seasons. It is very tough to say my favorite episode because I love all of them and also the characters in it.Anyways something which flashes my mind right now is the last 5 secs of season 4 11th episode, when trinity comes into Miami metro finds Dex with his ID and says ""Hello, Dexter Morgan!!"".. OMG!! For a sec I was Dexter and scarred the s**t out of me...When I heard it season 8 is going to be the last one I feel like I am going to be the last one on earth and have nothing else to do...

At the end of each show it is difficult to not just move onto the next. Seeing the characters develop throughout the show and the interweaving of the the past keeps things moving along. I enjoy the introduction of new people (Lila, Lundy) to keep things fresh.

I can understand how some people would find the show offensive but when one considers the characters and the thought that has gone into the show it is a true study of the human mind and character. I'll be going out to get season 3 as soon as I can.

And I had to say this somewhere... Rita's character is the most stupid, annoying, superfluous I have seen quite in a while! Besides being a cute blonde, her contribution to the show is zero.

I thought season 5 was great and had a much needed emotional tie-in to the events of season 4. I wasn't too happy with the sudden way the season ended but, for the most part, I was happy with the season. Season 6 was kind of bad, but it had an interesting ending that at least ties in with the series as a whole. Season 7 however was fascinating to watch. I really enjoyed the season and the season finale is among the best in the series except for the season 4 finale. I only wish the show didn't mangle season 8 which is the final season of the show. So here is my opinion: Although the show had its ups and downs, it did not ""Jump the Shark"" until the final season when it went off the rails for no reason other than trying to be clever for no reason. It had plenty of stories to tell an yet it told none of them...or the least interesting of them.. So there it is. Show good. Ending bad.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

PREVIOUS REVIEW

Previously Scored 10/10

I was amazed by Dexter from the moment I cracked open the DVD first season, to the moment I stopped watching the last episode of season one. I'm not your typical viewer. I try to see things in their entirety,without commercial interruption. I have yet to see anything from season two, but I am waiting for upcoming seasons to hit DVD, with great anticipation!

Dexter Morgan is pretty motif-psychotic, and this series about him is absolutely brilliant, in the same exact way. I found it difficult not to be completely lured into his world, much like everyone slows down to witness the potential horrors of a morbid traffic accident. We can't help it. A voice inside us tells us to keep driving and ignore the potentially shocking images, but our bodies somehow take over and curiously force us to turn and witness it all, drink it all in and get a sense of what happened and in turn, what could happen to us if we don't stop and slow the pace a bit.

You can't compare Dexter to anything. It's unique and yet the writing is rooted in good fiction, stream of consciousness style, where pretty much anything can happen with the right connection and cadence, primping and puzzling.

Sadly because it's Showtime, they will end up cancelling this before it can reach its true potential. Rumor has it that a third season has been green-lit, but you can never be too sure, with ShowTime. I am still miffed about ""Dead Like Me"". You can therefore imagine, I am afraid to get too attached to Dexter. Three seasons is joyous! Four would be better, but this is the kind of series I would like to see not only make it to a seventh or eighth season, but the kind of series I would like to see taken to the big screen, much like the Star Trek franchise, only better written, conceptualized and executed.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

And what a hit. Suspense is unbearable, storyline credible, characters all interesting, all unique, major one Dexter is a complexe mixed up guy, like hollow inside, but always searching for how to be more then he is in others. He is the example how one guy can be so incomplete and at the same time so good on some things, not of course only on killing but Dexter is a very intelligent guy with a high capacity of survival. To love a drama series, we got to love its drama, and i just love it.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

everyone who worked on this show was good, from writing to editing and directing that what made it for me.

sad to see it end, but all good thing come to an end eventually hope they do not comeback and leave it as it is a very good show no need to reboot.

677,9.0,17 February 2024,"I think most people who rated this show so highly are influenced by the general premise of the show. But that theme is actually rarely used. The vigilante who disposes of people who deserve it rarely happens, at least in season 1. Most of the show is about a serial killer and an investigation that drags on and on. I'm getting tired of stories of serial killers who want people to solve riddles and leave clues and codes that can lead to them being found. That almost never happens. They have to make these investigations drag to last over 12 episodes. The True Detective first season was an example of a well made one. Some of Dexter is so exaggerated like the attitude of Doakes towards Dexter. It gets old. I also get tired of flashbacks. I think it's a lazy way to tell a story.

Some of it is just plain stupid just like how Dexter finds the killer who kidnapped his sister and turns his back so the killer can stick him with a needle and should have killed him, then he has a nice conversation with that killer after he wakes up. What?

My review is based on season 1 and I will update it if I can make it through a second season but I don't think so.

Review Update: Ok, after watching the second season I can safely say that contrary to most people who think season 1 of Dexter is a masterpiece, the second and third seasons are so much better than the first. I raised my rating from 4 to 8.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

Her inability to control her temper and string three words without dropping the F bomb became very old after the first couple of seasons and downright annoying into seasons 3 and on. They should have given a larger role to Batista and a minor role to Deb and my rating would have been a 10/10. Dexter himself was amazing and had me cheering for him as he executes vigilante justice on those who got away with horrible crimes. Just sad that most episodes were around the Deb character as from I can see from many other reviews, she was a major turn off for others as well, otherwise, a huge Dexter fan here!","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

Dexter is a really thought out character, which is probably the most interesting about the show, but it is a thrill as well to watch, good characters, well thought through plot that'll make you want to watch it as fast as possible, it did with me.

HOWEVER, it two flaws.

The first flaw: there is a main plot and then there are side plots as there are in some shows, some of the side plots are in my opinion unnecessary, and BORING to watch, they may have been put there to leave the user wanting more of the meat instead of the boring superfluous, side plots.

The second flaw: I'm only halfway through the show (middle of season 3) but in my opinion season 2 was WAY more exiting.

Despite the flaws, I really think this is some of the best I've watched.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

A task that Dexter accomplishes masterfully. Some serious Art Direction and Sfx, I would like to mention..

683,10.0,22 June 2008,"As others have noted, DEXTER has brilliant writing, directing, acting and design. What makes DEXTER transcend the books and other television shows is the way the stories function on many levels simultaneously. While pulling the viewer in with humor and plot twists, the stories also resonate with diverse facets of contemporary American culture: fascination/repulsion with violence; admiration of phony manipulators; questions about the appropriateness of revenge and the death penalty; and how to balance the teachings of parents with one's own sense of self. In addition, it is my hope that DEXTER may also bring about a heightened public awareness of psychopaths in real life--not the small percentage who are violent, but the others who manipulate and destroy lives. Researchers believe that 4% of people are psychopaths--that is 1 in 25. For insight into DEXTER and real-life psychopaths, check out ""The Sociopath Next Door"" and ""Snakes in Suits.""

684,8.0,31 May 2008,"its been 8 years since i gave up watching ANY TV program, especially those ever increasing ""shallow""( at best) serials that seemingly are being produced only to ""adjust"" and ""attract"" (promote in effect by themselves) the ever increasing ""commercial"" times. so it comes as no surprise that on HBO is pretty much the only remaining entertaining ""prime time"" television (not only, but most well known by general public).in this ""organization"" writers and directors are less exposed to the effects of marketing economic aspects, propagandistic plots of some sort or another, or social disruption of habits and ideas. and in ""dexter"" case this very last aspect mentioned above is very interesting ,since in effect, it deals with unusual behavior at best and ITS best...

well, i must first admit that the very first episode(or most of it) did not have much impact on my already high expectations.somehow i did not feel that Michael C. Hall would be the man for the job or able to pull it off with ""style"". but the following episodes achieved well the ""normalization"" of the atmosphere, which is critical in order so viewers can establish perceptions, sympathies and even personal relationships towards the protagonists. the secondary characters are not extremely well developed at start but the way they integrate and interact which each other is well done!.add on top of it the comic relief which intrigues just enough to keep going the ever increasing mental demand and attention required from the viewer.

to the the actors and characters now: Julie Benz as Rita Bennett is the only one of those that seems as a constant cliché, or provides the very FEW ""slow"" parts within the production(there is a whole and ONLY episode i did not like because of her).yet she is very critical to the plot as giving us that ""ordinary"" vibe so we, as viewers can relate and argue about what is going on or not, or should be happening.she will definitely be appealing to any soap-opra lovers or laid back ""conservative"" viewers.

Jennifer Carpenter as Debra Morgan is outstanding; there are parts where she is ""annoying"" at least, but her dialogs are quiet original,sometimes witty and sometimes comic, especially for what she represents; and without ever going into the ""unrealistic"" realm of a ""fictional"" characters; while she is quiet pretty(and tall), she is not beautiful( at least by the mainstream television ""standards"" this days,yucks, way too many pale blonds), which makes me appreciate her casting in making the character look as realistic as possible.her voice and tone provides quiet a few punch lines in themselves.)))

Erik King as Sergeant James Doakes is fabulous;a very ""conservtive"", stand up guy. i would argue that he is the most important plot character(in season two especially) towards feeding up the viewers interests and mental reasonings on the universal moral and ethical aspects of human beings, as generally being perceived as. his contrast to dexter Morgan is always so visible and yet very similar; his ideology is well defined and always ""pressed"" against the plot's central hero, creating an always evolving relation, for better or worse.

Lauren Vélez as Lt. Maria Laguerta (together with David Zayas as Angel Batista)brings the show's plot integration within its Miami location, and does very well at that, at least as the general perception goes of how this specific city is, at least on the silver screen. they both represent( and seemingly are) Cuban immigrants; the Spanish language and ""stereotypes"" are brought by them ""live"" everywhere in-between plot lines; with much ""gusto"" i might add, both from my own serious and/or funny perspectives. they also create the excellent ""normality"" vibe.

James Remar as Harry Morgan( Dexter's adoptive father) is ever present in almost all episodes providing the ideological plot traits and how that affects the main hero.reflections of the past that ever hunts everyone sometimes without even be aware of this fact. to me he is a bit of a ""standard"" character, somehow required but not quiet as often as he is.C.S. Lee as Vince Masuka is yet another co-worker of Dexter.he does have some comic parts or dialogs, but not central to plot much. quiet good acting but i feel he should have been developed a bit more; maybe in season three...Jaime Murray as Lila is intriguing(season 2 only). even her the character seems to be ""manipulated""(the only one as such i think) she provides some different types of ""tennsion"" and some wicked feminist traits to be reckoned with...

the characters at start are very much ""cliches"", but as the ""time"" goes by, each and every one of them develops special interests, and not ONLY because some plot twists; the plot was crafted especially well, and to me at least, there are no ""plot"" holes brought in, or left out, or out of script convenience, at least on the entertaining face value. unlike ""prison break""'s season 2 and 3 ""dexter"" does not emerge itself in predictability at any point and neither has ""forced"" suspense brought us.up to the very last episode in season 2 i kept ""learning"" something new that makes sense and increases tensions or suspense. also the serial has a great replay value, very unusual for a TV show; i am inclined to reason it based on excellent performances throw out and witty comic aspects one could miss the first time around( i am pretty sure i did or at least i think so).","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

Having said that i just have to see each episode of dexter as it airs,i am totally intoxicated with each episode, apart from the brilliant creative talent it is also because i was a massive fan of the HBO show OZ (which this show has several of the same cast members) and also because of the one and only Michael C. Hall. (also a dedicated fan of six feet under)

Our unsung hero of this story is Dexter who has the compulsion to kill people who have slipped through the cracks of justice, this is a unique story which i have not seen expressed in the television medium before and i applaud the creatures for been so brave and courageous in telling this dark and mysterious story.

686,8.0,20 December 2007,"The first season of Showtime's hit show Dexter, based on the novel Darkly Dreaming Dexter by Jeff Lindsay, was a huge success both with critics and DVD sales. It is by and far one of the most consistently excellent seasons of a show in recent memory (apart from Heroes). So how did season two of the show measure up? Surprisingly well, actually. The acting in Dexter is just phenomenal, with one of my favorites being Michael C. Hall of Six Feet Under fame. Also starring in the show are Julie Benz, Jennifer Carpenter, Lauren Velez, James Remar, and Erik King.

Unlike the first season of Dexter, season two doesn't go by the second book, Dearly Devoted Dexter, and instead relies completely on the creativity of the impressive writing team. While the story told in season one was all about self-discovery and the mystery of the Ice Truck Killer, season two begins with a shocking twist: all of Dexter's work is discovered dumped in the ocean, and the Bay Harbor Butcher is born. A huge case opens up even bigger than the Ice Truck Killer, and Dexter's secret is more threatened than ever as he meets a destructive young woman, Lila, and the annoying Sergeant Doakes remains constantly on his tail.

The acting, as always, remains a shocking surprise. Michael C. Hall is simply note-perfect as Dexter, and it just further goes to show how great of a character actor he truly is. He played a homosexual man working at a funeral home in his spectacular five year run on Six Feet Under, and in Dexter he plays almost the polar opposite; a serial killer who thinks he's emotionless, but starts becoming more and more human as the episodes progress. Julie Benz, who is best known for her role as Darla on both Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel, has mostly starred in some small indie movies, but she is given a lot more screen time and a lot more to work with here. Whereas the character of Rita is very bland and kind of boring on paper, Benz brings to her a sense of curiosity and discovery. It is practically required for her character to remain interesting so that she doesn't get outshined by the gorgeous and accent-heavy Jaime Murray. Playing the new character of Lila, Murray outshines most of the cast with her incredible charisma and great presence. Jennifer Carpenter is simply delectable as Dexter's sister, but Erik King as Sergeant Doakes is simply one big annoyance. While he is perfectly cast, there is just no way whatsoever that anyone could find this character likable.

Dexter's character gets very, very interesting this season as he goes on a journey of self-discovery and realizes that he might actually have a conscience after all. He goes through a rough patch with Rita and for the first time, he feels incredibly human. This is why Dexter is one of my favorite shows. It has so much depth and realism to it that it's hard not to grow attached to its deep characters and twisty plot lines. Season one was absolutely incredible, and season two, while it had a lot to live up to, was simply amazing. The finale was one of the best finales I've ever seen, and it leaves the viewer craving more. The season ends so perfectly, and even manages to close up some loose ends. Don't miss Dexter, one of TV's all-time greatest shows, when season two comes to DVD in 2008!","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

This is not because he likes blood; in fact Dexter doesn't really care too much for blood. What did I just say? You read that right. You read it all right. Just take a chance with the killer we have grown to love. Dexter is a riveting show that will make you squirm and keep you glued. Don't worry if you have already read the book because the writers of the series only based the show on the book. The book has many connections, but it was indeed done in a different way.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

694,8.0,13 October 2007,"Dexter is a great show for anyone looking for a show with some real substance. The basic premise of the show is that Dexter is a sociopath, and as one, doesn't feel any real human emotions, including regret and remorse. He was diagnosed in his early childhood by his policeman father, who then proceeded to teach dexter certain behavioral rules and patterns so that he may be able to function in normal society without getting caught. The father also picked up on the fact that dexter will have uncontrollable urges to kill, so he teaches him a moral code whereby he can only kill other 'bad' people. Thats basically it. The genius of the show is that its from the first person narrative, with dexter describing his thoughts and feelings as he moves along. He is constantly going back to his fathers code in situations that need him to make a decision simply because it is convenient to do so, and he does believe that doing so will allow him to survive longer. His questioning of his own motives, and his commentary on the pretend life he is living are well observed, and on simpler level allow the audience to empathize with him. Certainly we do not have urges to kill, but we can understand when dexter smiles or behaves in a friendly manner when he doesn't quite feel it. Dexter's questioning of his motivations isn't quite presented in a black and white way, and so we can see the times when we question ourselves in him. Being in first person, its interesting how the show manages to give insights into dexter's character that even dexter is unaware of to the audience. This really pushes the audience in a God like point of reference to Dexter, for at times we deduce as to his real motivations, or at least think we do, when dexter himself has no idea. but then there is always the chance that dexter has us, the audience fooled too. If you are looking for a smart character driven show, with some good acting, brilliant writing, with a morbid flavor, then you really cant go wrong with dexter. In fact if you want to start watching a new show, then you cant go wrong with dexter.

It's a bit dark and there is a bit of gore, after all he is a serial killer, but aside from that again good laughs and nail biting moments. I cannot really say enough good things about this show.

This show creates an very eerie and surreal atmosphere that few shows are able to pull off. The writing is top notch and unpredictable. The camera work is also quite good. All of these elements are put together to create a very very very good show that know one should miss unless you're squeamish or young because be warned it gets pretty gruesome.

Even though the commercial never showed any of the show, just Michael C. Hall, it intrigued me. I began looking up the shows premise and was hooked on it.

I began watching the first season online and was hooked by the first episode. This show is absolutely brilliant. If you haven't seen this show, or even heard of it, then I say take a chance on the wild side and get into the world of Dexter.

Nip/Tuck used to be my favorite show, but the 5th Season isn't cutting it for me. However, Dexter is cutting it for me in many ways. The first season was brilliant and the second season is even better. With each new episode I am literally on the edge of my seat. I highly recommend this show to anyone who likes Dramedies.

701,10.0,27 June 2007,"I used to watch ""Six Feet Under"" and I am still mourning its loss after HBO nixed it after five seasons. Then when I heard that Michael C. Hall was set to play the title role of ""Dexter"" I was intrigued: a forensic expert who is also a dangerous serial killer. WOW! I ordered Showtime on Demand, etc. and I am now hooked! One of the best shows on television besides Heroes, Lost, 24, and Weeds.

Michael C. Hall plays Dexter Morgan, a forensic and ""blood splatter"" expert for the Miami Police Department. By day he helps solves crimes and by night he stalks and kills individuals who are just as dangerous as he is or worse. Dexter was adopted by Harry Morgan (James Remar), a decorated police officer, who was the first and the only one to identify Dexter's sociopathic nature. Harry disciplines Dexter into succumbing into his urges by only going after those that are just as dangerous as he is, or those that have escaped justice rather than Dexter going after innocent people. In between solving crimes along side his adopted sister, Debra (Jennifer Carpenter, a total change from The Exorcism of Emily Rose), who is also a police detective and spending quiet evenings and weekends with his girlfriend, Rita (Julie Benz, who is rather lovely in this role and well suited), a single mother and victim of an abusive ex-husband, Dexter is also killing. Wonderful characters surround him: Sergeant Doakes (Erik King) is the only one in the whole series that senses that something is not right with Dexter at all; Lt. Maria Laguerta (Lauren Velez), who is obviously attracted to Dexter; Vince Masuka (C.S. Lee, who is hilarious!), Dexter's forensic sidekick; and of course Detective Angel Batista, (Andre Zayas). This show is so amazing and incredibly addicting; Smartly written and beautifully acted led by Michael C. Hall, who is without question an actor that is severely underrated and worthy of more attention; He is so daring in his choice of roles and does not ever fall into clichés. He presents Dexter as a character that we both are frightened, sympathize, and identify with. Michael C. Hall also reminds us through his performance and delivery that Dexter is not Batman; Dexter is a monster; The only difference that distinguishes Dexter from other serial killers is that he is disciplined. The pilot episode says it all when he kills a pedophilic killer: ""I have standards."" This performance is a total 180 from the departed gay funeral director, David Fisher, of ""Six Feet Under."" The cast is also exemplary: Jennifer Carpenter is strong as Dexter's ambitious sister; Julie Benz is lovely and vulnerable as Dexter's damaged girlfriend (they have really wonderful scenes together; he could be killing someone and he answers her phone call pleasantly like a real boyfriend would; James Remar is also excellent in flashbacks as Dexter's adopted father. Without question Showtime is about to put HBO out of the spotlight with this show and it's comedy ""Weeds"" and ""Sleeper Cell.""

So far so good. Then I watched the next episode. It was even better. And that's what kept happening. Each episode was better than the last. Although the plot in the series deviates greatly from the book it retained the sharp wit and dark humor. All performances are superb, especially Michael C. Hall. He hits Dexter's character so dead on, it scares me, and makes me feel guilty that I love him still. I highly recommend this series, but be warned, it is gory and very creepy, but in a good way. A guilty pleasure good kind of way.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

Every season is better than the last one, it never ceases to surprise me.

Michael C. Hall started a little shy in his role, but after a couple of seasons it was just impossible to separate him from his character. When i went to the cinema to watch GAMER (where he plays the bad guy), i could hear people shouting ""look, it's Dexter!"".

I think the writing is excellent and the show is much better than Michael C. Hall's previous efforts on Six Feet Under. I like all of the characters except for one, Dexter's sister. She is so crass and boorish that she loses almost all credibility. I also find the fact that every guy that meets her starts hitting on her is not believable since to me, she looks like a walking skeleton. She's an okay actress but not up to par with the others and certainly no sex symbol. Dexter's character is perfectly done, Batista seems like a flawed but inherently good guy. Vince is just a total boob but a brilliant one and La Guerta is also done very well. The one I really like is Rita who is totally engaging and believable. The guest stars have been consistently excellent and the cameo appearances by people like Max Gail and Adrienne Barbeau have added moments of enjoyment for those familiar with television history.

707,9.0,23 September 2013,"At first I was put off by the premise of having a television show where the protagonist is a serial killer. That sounded reprehensible. I mean, c'mon, are they trying to make serial killers look cool now? What is this world coming to? That's what I thought, but the show works because the whole dark serial-killer thing is compensated for by everything else in the show: the colorful, sunny, Miami setting, the relatively wholesome family values and themes about justice and protecting the innocent. The first few episodes put me off a bit with how gruesome and gory some shots were, but later the directors made a good decision to minimize that; For the most part the show doesn't dwell on the violence, and it happens tastefully off- camera.

I love this show, but Dexter is the least-convincing psychopath in the history of TV psychopaths. Throughout the series he behaves in a way that is far more reasonable, thoughtful, and considerate than most 'normal' people. True psychopaths are selfish and impulsive. Psychopaths are born, not made by traumatic childhood experience. Pyschopaths are supposed to be charismatic, impulsive, reckless, while Dexter is just kind of socially awkward in a way that is far more normal than he realizes. Psychopaths generally don't have an urge to kill, they just have no remorse or empathy about it. To a psychopath killing a person is like squashing a bug. In his inner monologue in multiple occasions he says/thinks nonsense along the lines of ""If I could love anyone, I'd love my sister Debrah."" or ""If I had feelings, I'd feel bad in this situation."" When obviously if he didn't have those feelings, those thoughts would very unlikely to occur to him. Given the tone and situations where he says that, he seems less like a psychopath and more like someone who has a warped view of themself and their feelings.

Dexter is not realistic, but the writers have successfully created a protagonist that is a symbol - exaggerated for story-telling purposes - a symbol of a regular person like you or me, who has demons to battle and struggle against every day. He's just a regular person who struggles with balancing work and family and a terrible addiction. This show explores the ultimate fear that is too common: The fear that if other people learn who we really are, they will all hate and shun us. Most people have more boring secrets: that they are an atheist, they are gay, they like to eat icecream straight out of the carton with potato chips late at night, but deep down inside in our inner dramas, it feels like we might as well be serial killer and so we can relate. But what really keeps you watching the show is you really want to see these bad guys caught one way or another, and you really don't feel bad when they end up on Dexter's table.

This show goes on for 8 whole seasons. It seems like everyone complains that the show jumped-the-shark after the first season, or the second season, or whatever. Personally, I enjoyed all the seasons. They tend to follow a formula, it's a good formula: Every season there is a Big Bad that Dexter and the police hunt down. Dexter always makes a new friend that gets his hopes up that he finally has someone he can confide in and have a rapport with. Throw in a love interest, some family drama, and some minor side-plots about his police coworkers. It's all good except sometimes the side-plots can seem rather pointless and tacked-on. And Dexter/Michael Hall has no chemistry with his love interests. I seriously expect him to come out of the closet now that the show is over. But overall the acting is amazing, there is never that feeling that I'm just watching a show with actors. It's not realistic per-se, but it's immersive.

It was only until season 8 that I really felt like the show was getting contrived and was outliving its worth. But first thing's first, the early seasons are by definition, classic good ol' Dexter. But season 4, with John Lithgow as the most excellent Big Bad of any season, is not to be missed. Over time as Dexter eventually confronts people like big-time mobsters and super-rich dudes, his whole socially- awkward insecure serial killer schtick starts looking kind of quaint in comparison. Then the show ended... I won't spoil it but I was a little surprised and slightly disappointed. The ending left some side-plots hanging. They introduce important new characters and then just forget about them. It wasn't bad, but the writers fumbled the ball there.

But despite my criticism, I love this show and would recommend it. It's smartly written, engaging and suspenseful, and has lots of heart for a show about a serial killer.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

Dexter has been the ruination of everyone he ever stayed with, and his sins have found him out! Nevermind the fact that every death in the show is the person's own fault, or is caused by Dexter having too much humanity or caring too much, and everyone he killed irrefutably deserved it. The Dexter in the show compared to the one in the books is a lobotomized and declawed cat. The one in the books is calm, collected, and crazy (and obsessed with alliteration... in the books he tortures his victims to death with a knife not just stab them, which the rapists and murderers still totally deserve). In the books he is trapped by only the most clever or absurd issues but in the show he stumbles from mistake to human mistake. Book dexter is a hero from a Greek tragedy running towards his destiny, an avenging angel stalking through the night of the knife, making wrong into right, something both more and less than human, filled with the presence of a dark god(literally), a wolf in sheeps clothing; vs. a ummm guy with a needle and hallucinations running headlong into his own demise through the idiotic choices of literally everyone (especially the people who made the show), and especially through his sister's hopeless inability to accept the fact the brother she knows and loves kills murderers. In the books she was mostly fine with it by the end of the first book she was sitting next to dexter at laguertas funeral and punching him in the sholder despite the fact that she new everything and brian moser had just gutted Laguerta in front of her like a fish.

At first I was a bit skeptic about the whole approach and didn't know what to expect. Before actually watching, I thought it would be placed as on old fashioned horror thing, which I dislike in general. A friend convinced me a few times to give it a try. When I began viewing the first chapter, I thought this would be a dramatic, long lasting series. However at the end of that chapter I was ready for more.

Don't think of Dexter as a CSI whatever approach! It's far more complex, in a good way! Nice storytelling, good acting, a thriller approach which keeps you at the point of your chair. There are some nice plots that don't turn out as some sort of cliché or unrealistic approach to keep things going, which are hard to find these days. When I gave it a spin, I never stopped and watched all episodes. Each season keeps getting better, which is very rare...

You can think of ""Dexter"" as a no-nonsense, realistic thriller series. In general it's very interesting to see how you can get involved and create sympathy with a character that actually is nor bad nor evil. Actually Dexter, could be your best friend or next door neighbor without knowing... Even now, after watching all chapters to date, I don't know whether I would really describe him as a ""bad man"". If you can get this kind of feeling for a ""murderer"", this show must be good!

Another amazing point is the conversations of dexter both with his girlfriend and the around. The inner voice is used tremendously. One of those is in the pilot he is saying when he is with his girlfriend. ""I am totally not interested in sex"". This makes you believe in it. Yes I say to myself. How can it be otherwise. Another conversation is when the girlfriend asks his job. ""Yes my job is blood"" and than the inner voice saying ""My life is blood"".

The music, pacing, writing, story, and character development is all done well. One thing it sorta reminds me of at times is a real life version of death note so if you like death note you will probably enjoy Dexter. However the show isn't perfect. Season 8 is pretty badly written towards the end and it leads to an ending that isn't as satisfying. It's not as bad as people make it out to be and surely isn't as bad as new blood's ending but there was potential for more or at least could have been built up better.

728,10.0,3 May 2019,"Friends loved this show with its narration, flashbacks, and hidden life at the police department. I watched of few Dexters and well ugh not good! The viewer is supposed to cheer for this sick guy who tortures other killers; it's like cheering a evil Nazi doctor kinda hard to swallow. Worse part is trying to like a character who has no empathy, or understanding of other humans. What we got is a nice guy version of American psycho. The premise is stupid, the guy is going garbage bag people and not stop killing duh hard to digest. If any one watched a show Dexter's evil compulsion know this is just not right. Dexter just drags, and self reflects in a boring, but strange way. 5 stars. Over rated.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

There is never a dull moment in the city of Miami with Dexter around! If you are looking for a jaw dropping, mind- perplexing, jaw-dropping series, Dexter is the perfect fit for you! Dexter is without a doubt the best T.V. series I have seen in a while. Despite Dexter's clear routine, which is apparent in the opening of the show, you never know what he's going to do next. Dexter is an exciting thriller that'll leave you wanting to watch non-stop yet also take a break because of the HEAT it brings in every single episode.

What I like: -Michael C. Hall portrays the character Dexter in such a way that brings depth to the mind of a sociopath. -The whole cast of Dexter did an exceptional job playing their characters. -The goriness of it all; blood, dismemberment, foul play!*how exciting!* -Dexter's transformation

The mix of his narrative and the cameras angles makes us feel like Dexter is always the victim,when he is not.It is incredible how we only discover important things when he does too.There is some kind of manipulation to make what he say and do sounds ""explainable"" and that makes this TV show amazing... Whenever you are watching you feel what Dexter can't feel,for example: Sad,sorry...The only thing that he feels is the need of Killing. It is a great TV show and I personally recommend it to everyone.It never gets boring or annoying,because the more you get to know the wolf,the more you stop seeing the sheep as a victim.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

He's a great guy that people seem to like but they don't suspect his dark side. That's because Dexter is a serial killer. But he doesn't kill just anybody. No he only goes after people that deserve it. He kills murderers, rapists and other people that he considers to be bad. And he gets his information on a lot of these people by working as a forensic blood spatter expert for the Miami police.

This is a series that started out really strong and that's due to good writing, good acting and the fact that you actually care about this man. He does evil but he only takes out the bad guys. However something happened in Season 4 which honestly killed the whole thing for me. It was the absolute best season this show had and part of that is due to John Lithgow being the big bad for that season. And it's not because he did a bad job at it. Quite the opposite. He was so good that every season after that just felt like a let down.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

Disclaimer: I only got through 3 seasons before giving up

The first season was compelling enough and focused more on the crimes. Unfortunately the following seasons spent more time on soap opera drama which makes the show very generic. The crime aspects which used to dominate the runtime takes a backseat to dating, family, friendships, bachelor parties, etc.. This changes the effort put into Dexter's crimes and the police work which all requires more and more suspension of any sense. There is a constant stream of humor through out that has it's moments but it tends to be more on the cheesy side which also alters the tone of the show.

If you are into a more intense and gripping dramas, this is likely going to leave you wanting.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

This show starts out great, with seasons 1-2 providing satisfying thrills and twists, drama and dark humor. Season 3 is a step down, but season 4 picks-up again and provides the show's climax.

Unfortunately, it's all downhill from there. From season 5 on wards, the plot becomes increasingly ridiculous, repetitive and badly-written. Characters become stupid and uninteresting, dialogues are unconvincing. Major plot events appear to happen by coincidences, and other developments are too incredible to happen, even within the show's wild premise.

He IS Dexter now no matter what else he does. The voice over is key as it helps you to step inside the mind of a serial killer and see where your own morals stand in comparison. Basically, Showtime not only invites you to root for an anti-hero, but one that is a serial killer (gotta love it). The show also has a very good original soundtrack (not the Spanish music) that really helps put your in the mood. Seasons 1-4 are a masterpiece! After that though, some of the writers left and the show started it's descent and got stale (just a side note: Dexter is still better than 90% of TV shows at it's worst). Then there's the ending... I understand what the writers were ""trying"" to do, but it's not the ending that Dexter or the fans deserved. If it wasn't for the unsavory ending this would be my favorite TV show ever (I have to go with Breaking Bad because it got better with time and literally went out with a bang... Many of them.). I REALLY hope that Dexter returns for season 9 (or a movie) to ""wrap"" things up with an ending that both Dexter and the fans deserve. Then, just maybe, this might be my favorite TV show of all time. Until then, Dexter will have to settle for being my favorite TV CHARACTER of all time.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

The way it makes you identify with Dexter will surprise you as it surprised me even if you are a totally normal person or an easily scared person like me. I belive most of the show is great. I would remove one or two seasons, and it's definitely not for anyone. Yet if you started see it you might couldn't stop.

I could not bear her actions she was just not pleasant. The only few characters who kept my interest was Doakes, Angle and lastly Brian who was the most favorite thing of this season.

Season 2 started off good, rare achievement to get a season to stand back up after a bummer. Obnoxious characters were improved, it started to feel less annoying and more practical. The storyline gotten more interesting. And I was engaged into the show.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

when i completed first 2 episodes, i was besought by the fact that how this ends. In three days i completed 1st season full.

Dexter is such a rare combination of crime entangled in ones life so deeply that the same crime becomes the reason for his survival. such beautifully carved out scenarios and life struggles. Its not just for the plot that the difference lies, its how livelike portrayal of the plot is with the delicate intricacies of the human psyche, that this show finds its biggest strength.

**HATS OFF**","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
777,8.0,19 October 2015,"Dexter is a show that, for the first season or so, blows you out of the water. The characterization done throughout this show into the mind of a vigilante sociopath is not only captivating, but tends to leave you with a thousand inferences rather than a thousand answers. You decide : is Dexter a hero or a villain?

However, we see a pattern of appearances that is so often portrayed throughout crime shows; of a crime scene almost every episode, and a large portion of overplayed Drama on a case-by-case basis. Though Dexter does break this cycle from time to time, I can't help feeling a bit disappointed in what the show could have been if more focused on the inner- workings and turmoil of Dexter himself; and his perception of various things throughout the series.

What sets Dexter apart from other shows is it's unique glimpse into the mind of a madman, who is distant yet relatable. Though the series has capitalized on this aspect, and the essence of psychological thriller that is increasingly ever-present; It seems to have quite a bit of wasted potential.

All-in-all Dexter is a Novel and Captivating show worthy of your time. Though it has it's shortcomings, and at times feels repetitious, it makes up for this in deep psychological profiling.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
778,10.0,17 November 2019,"""Dexter"" is the perfect example of how a TV show or movie can have some plot problems or an odd ending or some seasons that are weaker than others, yet still hold your attention simply because of the excellent characters and the darkly witty dialogue.

Because of how well-written Dexter Morgan and Deb and Doakes and all the others are in this series, it's easy to overlook the other flaws. Too many shows and movies either concentrate on plot and end up with flat characters just moving through the motions or concentrate on action and special effects to try to keep the viewer's attention.

But the problem is this: you can have great special effects and the most complex plot, but if your characters are poorly-developed, the show is going to be horrible. Yes, ""Dexter"" also has some great plot lines and plenty of action, too - but it mainly stands out from other shows because of the rich characterization. Dexter Morgan is a complicated person. The writers of this show managed to make a serial killer sympathetic, which is no easy achievement.

The other plus is that, while ""Dexter"" is dark, it also has a darkly humorous side. Humor is very valuable, even in drama. When I think of all my favorite shows, no matter how serious their subjects, they all have hints of humor in them. Shakespeare, who often put a jester in his darkest plays, knew the value of comedy - and its relation to tragedy. A lot of dramas take themselves too seriously (maybe in a vain attempt to be taken seriously by the viewer?) and come off as insincere and one-note.

""Dexter"" is up there with my favorite shows of all time. If you haven't seen it, it's worth watching.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

785,9.0,7 September 2012,"There are very few shows out there (of which I had heard good things and so purchased on DVD after missing the airings on TV), of which I have felt absolutely 'compelled' to watch the next episode immediately... even if it meant I was awake until 3am or 4am, and yet knew I had to be up early the next day! Occasional shows have kept my attention so well, that I happened to 'chain-watch' episodes in one sitting, until the whole series had finished, and I physically had no DVDs left to put in the machine! The ones that spring to mind so far are: Journeyman (although, guttingly, they only ever made the one series), Prison Break, Peep Show (British), Friends, King Of Queens, and without doubt, Dexter. So if you have never really given this show a proper look, then please do so. You may lose a few nights, all-in-one-go, to this show, and may have a few 'zombie' days at work... but you will be immensely rewarded with unique entertainment like you have never seen before. And I don't think they could have found a more suitable actor to play the part of Dexter the serial-killer. I guess for those of us who watched Michael C. Hall in 'Six Feet Under', we were kind of already familiar with seeing him in a 'dark humour' role, but to be honest, it is too far a stretch to describe this show as black-comedy, because, although there are a few comedic moments in the show, it is definitely a true drama in its substance. But for something that many people describe as a 'dark' drama, it is surprisingly light viewing. By that, I mean, that for a show which focuses mostly on a serial-killer, it is not that heavy-going in the way that it is not a total gore-fest! There is a lot more to the show than meets the eye. It is not all about killing and torture. There are obviously going to be a few quease-inducing moments if you are of that inclination, but surprisingly, the producers of the show have been able to prevent alienating a massive part of the viewing public by doing it all without you having to see graphic violence. And this element of the drama definitely does not define what it actually is in its substance. There are many characters in the show which also give decent airtime, and each one of these characters is deliciously complicated. So we not only see elements of these characters which we then want to see more of, but, we get drawn into the psychology behind the characters too, which is ultimately fascinating, especially when they all seem to be so emotionally flawed in different ways. But the most startling element of the show, is that you, as a viewer, may seem to start understanding the psychology behind the main character, and almost feel as if you can 'relate' to a serial-killer! One of the ways in which the producers of the show draw you into this strange turmoil of emotions, is by making the main character so god damn likable!!! Now you are getting an idea of the complicated roller-coaster of emotions you may experience while watching this clever show. You seem to be eternally wrestling with your own morals and wondering about what we, as a society, actually accept in real life as being morally 'right'. The whole 'twistedness' of the concept, and how this constantly reflects on you and your feelings towards it as you watch it, makes it compulsive viewing for me.

788,10.0,29 September 2012,"Six Feet Under's Michael C. Hall is still dealing with death, just in a different way. In this adaptation of Jeff Lindsay's novel ""Darkly Dreaming Dexter,"" Hall stars as a forensics pathologist who moonlights as a serial killer. (He's not all evil, though; he only murders bad guys.) The first season of Showtime's ""Dexter"" is some of the best television I have ever seen. It is extremely dark material, probably the darkest TV of all time. It tries to get into the head of a serial killer, and it succeeds. What is particularly disturbing is that the viewer comes to identify with Dexter, almost hoping he lives to kill for another day. Correct: this is not for the faint of heart. Each episode is like a movie, with deeply cinematic qualities. Gorgeous cinematography, interesting dialogue, and smashing editing. Dexter is played by Michael C. Hall, who became a star via that other premium-cable pioneer, ""Six Feet Under."" Hall is absolutely superb. This character gives him a gigantic stretch, and Hall grabs the bull by the horns with gusto. The supporting characters are almost as interesting as Dexter, especially Dexter's sister, played by Hall's real-life wife, Jennifer Carpenter. I cannot believe that Carpenter hasn't gotten more praise for her work here. She brings this young woman's insecurity and cockiness to life in ways that I think make television history.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

790,10.0,15 March 2022,"We watched a few seasons but super depressing. Everyone is bad or has bad intensions. Dexter is suppose to be pure because he kills bad guys. Lots of coincidences that were nonsense. Like Superman, he was always disappearing when the action took place. We tried to like it and got a few seasons in but it was too depressing for us. Sister was hot but a train wreck.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
791,10.0,5 September 2012,"The first time I heard about the show from a friend, he said ""Dude, this Dexter guy, he's a serial killer. You'll love him"" and the only response I could give at that time was ""Wait.. The Protagonist is a serial killer! How are they going to justify that?"" The question still hangs in between for me, but that is the intrigue of the show. The show challenges the moral definitions of today's world and shows it from a serial killer's point of view, of how unemotionally and scientifically he sees it and how rational he can make it seem. When a show makes you love a serial killer and hate his victims, there is seriously something to think about. The show is about a person who has surrendered to his inner serial killer and yet tries to fit in the society by observing and trying to behave like others do, and his constant struggle with his ""dark passenger"". Meanwhile the show stays true to its genre as Dexter plays part-detective to search for other killers and play his part in the society. He has the perfect front as the forensic blood work specialist of the police department.

But merely having an intriguing concept does not make a good show, you need to present that concept as well. Fortunately for us, we have Michael C. Hall playing the part who is an absolute delight to watch supported by actors like Jennifer Carpenter, James Remar and David Zayas. The visual effects and the technicality by which Dexter plays cop hooks you to the show. The show never gets old and neither does the character as he overcomes the different challenges in his complicated life.

No wonder the show is running successfully for nearly 7 long years now. It definitely makes it to the top of the list of my favorite TV shows.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

It is very complex and always keeps you on your toes. The plot is always changing and very exciting. People who watch Dexter don't just like Dexter they LOVE Dexter. We Dexter fans are loyal. You will never get bored while watching Dexter because it is not repetitive like some other shows on T.V. The cast is full of a bunch of amazing actor who genuinely convince you of their acting. It's definitely not for the faint of heart as Dexter is a blood spatter analysis as well as murderer. Not to mention the raunchy sex scenes which would not be good for younger children watching. All these things simply add the the thrill of watching the show. So, If you like a sexy keep- you-on-your-toes vigilantly murderer Dexter is for you - no joke.

It is a production that combines drama, comedy and detective themes very well. After the series ends, you will realize that something has changed in you. Maybe you will be able to overcome your fears. It's one of those productions that I wish had a sequel. Have a good time everyone.

In fact, from the very first episode you know who is who, what their job is, but what Dexter Morgan is? At first he's a mystery. Michael C. Hall (Six Feet Under, Kill Your Darling), Jennifer Carpenter (Quarantine, The Exorcism of Emily Rose), David Zayas (The Following, Bloodline), James Remar (Hawaii-5 O, Grey's Anatomy), C.S. Lee (The Stepford Wives, Chuck), Lauren Velez (Law & Order, How To Get Away with Murder), Desmond Harrington (Dragnet, The Dark Knight Rises), Julie Benz (Supernatural, Defiance, and Hawaii-5 O), and finally Keith Carradine (Criminal Minds, The Californians, NCIS, and Madam Secretary); the whole cast brought the whole book into a live-series 'Darkly Dreaming Dexter' by Jeff Lindsay.

The music, the ambiance, the plots, subplots, the Miami and California background; two cultures merging together, and the guest stars were excellently done by the HBO team. John Dahl, Steve Shill, Keith Gordon, Marcos Siega, Ernest R. Dickerson, Romeo Tirone, Michael Cuesta, Tony Goldwyn, S.J. Clarkson, Jeff Lindsay, James Manos Jr., Drew Greenberg, Daniel Cerone, and many other gifted crew members created something different.

Hopefully, someday the gifted crew members and the talented main cast members may come back; and give us closing episode(s) after the last events on the show, which aired on September 2013. I'm sure there's more to the story and I'm sure that Steve Shill, Jeff Lindsay, Clyde Phillips, and Melissa Greenberg won't disappoint.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

799,10.0,13 August 2024,"Following the misadventures of a boy genius and his annoying sister, Dexter (for the most part) is a bloody masterpiece.

Just the product of a hostile environment, Dexter is a mild mannered blood spatter analyst for Miami Metro Homicide, but in the dark he is a cold blooded murderer. Dexter doesn't want to eat ice cream or play Donkey Kong because tonight's the night for capturing serial killers, sampling their blood, butchering them into pieces, and disposing of them in Biscayne Bay.

The first trinity of seasons are captivating and enthralling, drawing the viewer into the world and mind of a sadistic (yet unintentionally hilarious) psychopath killer. However, it is the fourth season that stands apart as one of the greatest single seasons in the history of television.

Despite the epic beginning, Dexter fails to follow the same code for success throughout the remainder of the series. The thrilling story beats of the latter seasons are spattered with head scratching character arcs (especially for Deb Deb) that will rock you like a hurricane until you're sawing logs.

There is a charismatic aura to this monster that you can't help but feel intrigued and fascinated no matter how dangerous he is like a moth to a flame. Every character is vivid and lively and interesting and i don't know how else to describe it other than the word shiny. And the storyline is just brilliant and bloody fantastic.

I didn't start this series until this series was well into it's eight season. And i am glade to have waited it out till it's last otherwise i would not have survived the wait after the end of every season. Probably i would have become Dexter myself just to feel the same excitement as when i watch this show. I have already watched this series like 6 times over and over again.

And maybe you insist on it during the few first episodes as well. But by then you've caught on the dark comedy of this show and without caring much for the anti-hero, you follow it with a big grin on your face while sitting back, be it for the sake of the irony of the situation or the witty narration of Michael Hall.

After a few episodes however, you realize you're sitting on the edge of your seat. Lo and behold, you're there. Congratulations! It's frightening how you've started caring about this sweet serial killer with that soothing voice and witty narration.

Perhaps Dexter is a huge leap in neo-noir genre, since here the shadowy and dark persona only is carried through the narration, while we enjoy a colorful cinematography. And it works even better with this huge contrast between shadowy self and brilliant colors of the set.

I was pleasantly surprised with my purchase , rather having to stay up till late to enjoy , i got to enjoy it from the comfort of my bed. I think of anyone better than Micheal Hall who plays Dexter , his take on the ice cold serial killer makes him one of the most likable anti-heroes on TV what I really like about him is that there is probably one thing that we can see in there and relate to about him. The comedy is also funny and thats what makes it stand out and thusly makes you want to hook into it every week. Apart Micheal Hall the performances from everyone round are great it shows that the whole crew actually enjoy making the series. Dexter is another great show from the states and I am really looking forward to the next series.

Not a fan of the main actor at all, my first minus.

Hearing his thoughts, him talking most of the episodes, feels like a audio book and was getting on my nerves from the start. So I skipped half of the first episode and started the second, hoping the talking was just in the first to explain some things from his past and present, but unfortunately it continued. Why?

Some of his talking was also very ridiculous, like his explanation of perfect driving food - banana and pulled pork sandwich. Nothing smart about that.

At last, I can't find anything interesting in a crime solver/ serial killer. What does that tell you about the people around him?

the show is based around the main character Dexter, who just so happens to be a serial killer and the more you watch the more you realise his points of view (all be them very twisted) but you learn to love the character for who he is and not what he does. he becomes a lovable character even though his ideas on life are not quite what you may expect.

I have read the books, and I have to say that the show is far superior to the books. I do think that, after reading the books, it may be worthwhile to wait to read the book until after you see the show.

812,10.0,31 January 2008,"Dexter works for the police department as a blood splatter specialist by day...and by night, he's a serial killer. And the twist is that he only kills the bad guys. So that makes him a good guy, right? And that's the paradox with Dexter. He is at once likable, lovable, and funny. We're often in his head listening to his monotone and sarcastically witty comments. He knows he's a monster, but we also catch glimpses of his human side. However, the killing he does is graphically violent and disturbing. As much as you like him, you're repulsed by him.

The writing is top notch, and the acting by Michael C. Hall as Dexter is flawless. I originally wasn't interested in this show based on the violence, but I was totally sucked in after watching the first episode.

Dexter currently has two complete seasons and has been renewed for a 3rd season. The show is based on books by Jeff Lindsay. I read the first 3 books---they are good, but the show is actually better. Every episode has me on the edge of the couch. As much as I want Dexter to be all good, it's the dichotomy of good/evil that keeps me coming back for more.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

Together with Twin Peaks, Seinfeld and 24 it belongs in my top 4 television shows at all time. If you thought all serial killing was always wrong, think twice. I hope they continue with more seasons.

Friends of mine compare it to American Pshyco, I never got what others thought was so great about American Pshyco, sure it was an enjoyable movie but for me it was nothing more. Dexter on the other hand really hit the spot. Dexter manages to pull of what American Pshyco, in my mind, failed: convince me that one of my co-workers could be a serial killer, and it could even be the nice guy.

This show is smart, fun and I want more! I've seen the first and almost all of the second season. Is there a season three on it's way? I hope so.

816,5.0,28 August 2008,"Dexter is, to make a long story short, a likable guy who tries to live a normal life while killing killers with a similar urge to kill. Let's just say he takes out the trash. Every episode paints spot-on portraits of every one of the 5 or so main characters in situations unique to their lives, personalities and problems; as a result the show has the deepest character development I've ever seen. And even though Dexter is decidedly not an intentional comedy, Dexter's serial killer alter-ego juxtaposed with his job as blood spatter specialist at the Miami Police Department makes for some hilarious dark humor.

It certainly follows a storyline as far as I've gotten. So if you're thinking of just picking up a show in the middle of a season to check it out you won't get the full picture, even with Showtime's short but effective episode recaps at the beginning of each show. They serve mostly as reminders for those who haven't seen the last episode in a while. Grab the first two seasons on DVD wherever you can find them and you won't be sorry. As for content, there is nothing at all gratuitous: infrequent language and occasional bloody but not graphic violence.

The cops along with Dexter are on the trail of the ""Ice Truck Killer"" who seems to be playing with them---Dexter mostly. Why isn't revealed until episode 12 and I was hypnotized by the reasons why.

There'd be a lot to say about many freudian and jungian aspects of the character, how it eventually reflects us (as Flaubert said, ""Madame Bovary, c'est moi""), but I'll not deflower the story - it is great, although not unpredictable (but I wouldn't trade it for a bad deus ex machina : at least it does not try and play the audience for fools), and there are to this day two more Lindsay books to be adapted (the third coming up this summer). Let's hope they don't turn it into a money making soap (you noticed how every time series writers get short of ideas, the characters start dating one another in every direction ?).

Hall is a very convincing creepy-but-trying-to-pretend-that-he's-not serial killer).

I mentioned this above, but it deserves elaboration: the writing on the show is fantastic. The main reason that I rated it 10 out of 10 is because the story is so beautifully devised. The development of small stories surrounded by one large and complex story is reminiscent of comic books and makes for an interesting run of episodes.

On a more technical note, the direction and production of the show are phenomenal. The camera angles are intriguing, the score (particularly the swelling strings) is incredible, and the editing is tight. Most viewers are not aware of subtleties like that, and that is partially the goal of any good direction/production theme; but the devil really is in the details.

Overall, the show is fantastic. My sole complaint is that the episodes are only 50 minutes long.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

831,10.0,2 January 2007,"Dexter falls into the category of a great show, with a great plot, with a great cast. It is one of these dramas that crops up every couple of years, such as The Sopranos, Prison Break and stretching it to Lost.

Dexter is a blood specialist, but he is so much more than that. Dexter hides his real persona, his dark side and only one person has ever known his true identity, his father harry.

Dexter looks badly upon those who have committed murder but gotten away with their crimes, in his mind they must be punished, in the only way Dexter knows: revenge.

Hard to say anymore without giving away any spoilers so i will give you 2 words of advice to help you.

832,10.0,20 December 2006,"The past 2 seasons or so have seen excellent TV series one after another for the first time in decades, with hits such as Prison Break, Heroes, and lower rated but equally good if not better series such as Veronica Mars and Supernatural, among many more. Above all though Dexter stands tall, combining the perfect blend of crime/serial killer drama with dark comedy and off beat romance.

Dexter tells the story of Dexter Morgan, a forensic pathologist who moonlights as a serial killer hunting other killers--but make no mistake, Dexter is no vigilante. He lives by a closely followed set of rules set forth to him by his legendary cop foster father, who recognized his nature early on. The series follows him as he struggles to understand and cope with his feelings, or lack thereof, how he tries to fit in among normal people, and as he seeks to aid the police in murder investigations while simultaneously committing many himself.

More than anything else, the casting in the series is simply outstanding, as almost everyone agrees. Michael C. Hall is remarkable as the title character, and has flawlessly pulled off the role as I could imagine few would be able to. The supporting cast also fill their roles, both generic and niche alike, with such ability and nuance that you will love even the most dis-likable of the lot.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
833,9.0,17 June 2008,"WOW!! This show really is something, its is compelling, it is thrilling, it is darkly humorous, and to top it all off it is R-Rated. Dexter is a show I never thought would have been made because in essence it is everything I have ever wanted to see in a TV show, down to the last drop of blood. All of the main characters are more than multi-dimensional and you feel for every last one of them.

Dexter is in a whole league of his own, Michael C. Hall a relative nobody has proved himself to be one of the best lead actors working in television right now.

I am not going to say much more to promote this series but trust me just watch the first episode and you will be hooked.

I love this show and my hearts desire is that is go's on forever and never ends, I am devoted to this show and I love it with all my heart.

834,10.0,3 January 2007,"Very unique show. When I first heard the premise I rolled my eyes, thinking it was a hokey angle to have a serial killer that kills serial killers, but the idea has remarkable depth the way it is played out. I find Dexter to be a fascinating and likable character - not as hard to relate to as some would think. The cinematography is very slick and creative - often you are repulsed by a seemingly graphic image on the screen which turns out to be a common object such as a piece of fruit. And then something graphic by definition (such as blood) is shown in an artistic and attractive way.

The character of 'Harry' has to get my vote for most compassionate father of all time - the way he teaches Dexter to deal with his innate desire to kill is remarkable and believable. I also love the way Dexter takes care of his girlfriend's children and his girlfriend. The only thing I don't like much is the character of his sister, Deborah. I find it hard to take her seriously as a cop. Perhaps she will develop and I am definitely going to stick around to find out.

Why do i need to write ten lines about this...seriously, just watch the show. Its good, really good. Also, the actor playing Angel Batista (David Zayas) was awesome.

I always thought to myself what if Grissom ( CSI ) was a serial Killer now that would be nail-biting stuff. Well here it is and I was right. The acting is superb and Michael C Hall is very convincing as both Forensics Expert and as a Mass Murderer. He is as twisted as any of the guys he's out to catch but he's still a likable fellow.

I can't wait To watch the reboot. If there is one gripe I have it Is that the ending to the series This wasn't really Is satisfying But other wise great adaptation.

The only bad thing is it's on Showtime, so if you don't have cable you have to wait till it comes out on DVD. But it would be money well spent. The first season is over, which I am truly sad about. But not as sad as having to wait till next fall for season two. I'm not real crazy about Dexter's sister, Deborah. I know she is a good actress (The exorcism of Emily Rose), but there is something about her in this that I just don't like, she nerves me.

840,10.0,15 February 2007,"This show is different, very so!

This is a scenario I have often wondered about, when the good guys take the law into their own hands to the full extent and not in a heroic glamorous way, as they do in the Hollywood-movies. This show is about exactly that, a man that has no normal feelings or bonds to speak of towards other human beings what so ever, and slaughters the bad guys just as brutally, as they do their own victims. And each time he comes across a murder that has been done in a neat way or with an unusual method, he starts to admire the murderer. A bit sick, but when you keep in mind that his goal is to eventually catch the guy and dispose of him, despite the admiration, it sort of sits OK with you. And the fact that it's all done in a dark-humorous way just makes it even more enjoyable. For example, his boss is always making a pass at him and all he can think is:

""..I wish she would stop that, it's one of those human emotion-rituals I don't understand..""

The theme music is fabulous and the opening sequence is up there with the best I have ever seen (and I pay attention to the details attended to in the openings of shows and movies). I don't watch TV unless there is something of quality on. Dexter met that prerequisite with flying colours. I got half the city watching it and everyone I encouraged to watch it are as hooked as we are. We were devastated when it ended. I even named my new car Dexter.

I was actually pretty angry at people's reaction to the finale because I thought that was a very mature and appropriate ending to an amazing show, I think if you respect the actors and director enough you would agree. If you are looking for a show that you want to binge watch and fall in love with, put Dexter as No. 1 in your list. The cliffhanger on every episode makes it impossible for you to not watch the next episode.

There are plenty of thrills with great cinematography throughout. The visuals are artfully done and surreal. This is a must for those who don't mind the guilty pleasures of vigilantism. Lucky for us, this isn't the grade-school kind (see Stallone & co), but rather has full-bodied, multi-dimensional logic rooted in the character development for Dexter Morgan.

True, as the seasons progress, it will, as it always does, get a bit harder to find this series credible. No matter, though, with a great cast, along with its fine production and writing department, you will still find it to be highly entertaining, if a bit less poetic.

If you don't know this series, we follow the calm and down to earth homicide forensic and blood spatter analyst Dexter, he sets the name of the series and everything evolves around him and how he juggles doing his job and at the same time being a serial killer.

If you like this series, and I know you will :), it is strange that you actually find yourself rooting for this main character, but there is something very likable about him and the way he acts. He is a nerdy guy, with a special code, a strange characteristic and a skill set not many people can relate to, but it all works together and the people around him either likes him or think he is strange, and the viewers get the same information but we stick to the ""good"" deeds he does and hoping for him not to get caught.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
850,8.0,26 January 2013,"First off, I love the show. It's great series that's hardly been topped in television history. There are many great characters with varying depth and wonderful acting.

All the mush aside the series is also one of the most roller coaster series I've ever seen. I rate the series as an 8/10 and I've considered giving it a 9. If I were to rate each season though they range from 5-10. The first season was amazing. A 9 or 10. The second season may have even topped that. Then the third season comes along and it's like pulling teeth. I loved Jimmy Smits in NYPD Blue and I think he did a surprisingly great job in Sons of Anarchy. Watching him in Dexter however was horrendous. It wasn't Jimmy though. It wasn't bad acting or anything like that. It was just the way the whole season was laid out. I don't know the direction the creative team was going. To this day I never looked into whether there were changes in writing, producing, directing, etc. but the third season was so bad I stopped watching for almost 3 years. Getting back to Dexter 3 years later I was pleased to see the 4th & 5th season get back into the Dexter stride. While not as good as the first couple they were both solid. The 6th season was my favorite besides the original first two. The Brother Sam character (and the actor who portrayed him) as well as Colin Hanks and Edward James Olmos were terrific. The 7th season had series changing potential but to me it's been the worst since the 3rd season. It's a roller coaster series full of highs and lows. At times it'll give you exactly what you want and at other times make you mad all season.

For anyone who also reads the book series, I am a fan of both. As a fan of both I'll tell you that you have to treat the two as two separate entities. You have to treat it as dual dimensions or something of that nature if you want to get nerdy about it. Treat it like the multiple Spider-man movies. Two different takes of the same stories. The first part of the first season follows the book very closely. Then by the end of the season it goes into it's own direction. The second season is influenced by the book but only slightly. Beyond season two of the series there's only a few comparisons. Oddly the series was at it's best when it was influenced by the books but I enjoy the series more than the books altogether. I will say that I won't be completely satisfied unless the series takes advantage of the incredibly controversial 5th book (Dexter is Delicious) before the TV series ends. In my opinion Dexter is Delicious is the best of the books series.

8 of 10 - Not always on the same level but still overall it's one of the best.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
851,10.0,14 March 2014,"The mixture of great acting, great storytelling, a marvelous soundtrack makes Dexter one of the greatest modern TV-series. As addicting as the sopranos and breaking bad, dexter takes deep in the psych of a serial killer.

It's the mixture of the brutal, emotionless dexter and the way he interacts with the people among him (who seem to cherish him no matter what) that makes the series so addicting, mix some perfectly timed humor to it and what you get is one hell of a series.

Michael C. Hall plays tremendously. As no other he can change from a sweet loving brother into a brutal psychopath in only a matter of minutes. Having seeing him play in six feet under, it was quite clear that he is a great actor, nonetheless he surpasses himself.

Although there is a lot of commentary on the last seasons, I must say that even though they are not as good as the first four, they are without doubt still better than anything you'll ever see on TV nowadays.

I am definitely a huge fan. The suspense, the drama, and (at times) the comedy keep you on the edge of your seat. I'm so glad I discovered it. I speed watched it the 1st time around, all eight seasons in a matter of about a week. I couldn't stop. I tried to pace myself but just couldn't. I'm on my 2nd viewing.

Michael C Hall is outstanding in the role of Dexter. I can't think of a better actor that could have pulled it off. He makes the character believable. He makes you love Dexter. The way he grows Dexter throughout the series keeps it from being stagnate. I'd never heard of Michael before Dexter. I will definitely be looking for anything he's in from now on.

Unlike some series on TV Dexter isn't filled with episodes where nothing happens. SOMETHING ALWAYS HAPPENS. I am on series 3 and yet to find a boring episode. Generally if I watch a series I can maybe make it to series 2 and then find it too predictable and just dam right boring.

The only thing I would add is that this show, like Nip/Tuck before it, suffers from a Hollywood interpretation of South Florida that frequently bears little resemblance to the real thing. Whether it be California landscapes that bear little resemblance to South Florida or inaccurate cultural references, these constant errors detract from an otherwise perfect piece of work. In Dexter's case, the composition of the cast is a great example. Since Miami is 3/4 Hispanic, the cast is grossly non-representative. Moreover, the lack of Spanish is glaring by its omission. While the show throws in a handful of words in each show, the reality is that Spanish is the majority language in Miami with a healthy dose of Spanglish on the side. A day with no Spanish is impossible in Miami. The architecture is equally wrong (e.g., no new wood construction in Miami because of hurricanes and termites). Lastly, the frequent burritos and other Mexican food shown is completely out of place whereas ropa vieja and arroz con pollo are common. If they would have simply filmed full-time in Miami, this would have been the perfect 10/10 show.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

His point of view and objecting the principals of life is rare and brilliant. His strong personality, even when he makes a mistake, is admirable. He keeps a good balance between his social life and his dark hobbit. Anticipating the ending is totally impossible as he passed some turning points like religion, love, family's responsibilities, relatives etc that could change his life, but his dark passenger is going to lead. I wonder how it is going to end not turning a serial killer to a hero also not down grading a hero to a low level criminal.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

I love the ride that you take with the characters, especially with our main man Dexter, constantly having questions unanswered and constantly wanting to know and figure out what is going to happen next. I think what makes the show so engaging is the fact that we have this guy, Dexter, who we become so emotionally and heroically attached to, and we are given a sense and feeling that we want him to prevail and we don't want him to ever be caught or found out who he really is, yet at the same time we sometimes question and doubt the actions that Dexter takes. I believe we as the audience would also find so many similarities in Dexter and his everyday life and at the same time we ask ourselves why Dexter is the way he is, which is another factor as to why he becomes such a successful protagonist.

Overall this is a fantastic and thoroughly engaging and addictive TV show, that at times will leave you shocked, disgusted then at other times will leave you happy and relieved for our protagonist, among many other emotions.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

However, I've just watched the first three episodes and am keen to keep watching. For me, I think the appeal lies almost entirely in the character of Dexter himself and in his portrayal by Michael C. Hall.

""Dexter"" is really a play-within-a-play and Hall convinced me that I was watching somebody playing a part within the fictional world of the series. I really enjoyed his performance, as well as that of James Remar as Dexter's foster father. I was interested in the abnormal psychology and motivations of Dexter and of his opponent, the so-called ""Ice Truck Killer"".

The end of the first episode came up very quickly for me; I had been engrossed in the story and was left wanting more. The second episode left me undecided. Normally, I only include two episodes in my roadtest of any show, but in this case, ""Crocodile"" had done so much to erode my good impressions of the series that I decided to watch a third.

Yes, it could have been as good as breaking bad. Because in the end in breaking bad W.W.'s brother in law came to realize W.W. reality and how it ends was just unpredictable... but in dexter the finale was good but just not satisfying.

After jumping onto the Dexter bandwagon late I progressively continued to binge watch each episode beginning with the first season. When cable TV took a break after season three (couple of years) I started to develop a false sense of what the show was really like. I severely regret that and only now that I have picked up from where I left off have I realised that Dexter is a fantastic show.

It is one of those shows that comes along every once in a while, capturing a broad audience with it's new concept and excellent production. It is never too late to start watching this show and I swear you won't regret it. Now that I have just finished watching season 4 I find myself desperate for the next episode...luckily this time I only have to wait till tomorrow.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
870,8.0,22 January 2012,"If you're not watching Dexter, you're missing out on something special. I understand everyone has different preferences and that it won't in fact appeal to everyone, but it deserves a chance (it actually took me a few episodes to get into the story, so give it that much if you decide to do so). I would say that it is a wildly underrated show, but if you look at any outlet for fan-dom, you would see that people obsess over it (I'm bordering on that distinction myself). Considering that Dexter has won less than a third of the 109 awards for which it has been nominated as of January 2010, I can't help but wonder if the organizations dispensing these awards acknowledge quality as their true measure of excellence. If so, maybe I'm watching the wrong show! (This actually is a great feat - I just think it deserves more. Happily, most of the main characters have won at least one award.)

Dexter is a show about a forensic ""blood spatter guy"" - by day. It's no secret - he's a serial killer by night, but he only kills bad guys. He follows a code which both determines who he pursues and how to keep from getting caught. It is a show meant to tug at your moral heartstrings, but for me there is no question. Dexter is a hero. It's not all black and white. Amid the sea of gray, there is an even bigger sea of red tape. What's both alarming and enraging is that in most cases, this red tape is clear enough to see through meaning that most law officials who have to let a bad guy go because of a paperwork or evidence mishap know exactly what they're doing but can't do anything about it. These are the guys that Dexter takes care of Dexter is ""taking out the trash.""

Dexter is a rare gem - one that won't soon be matched for its uniqueness and pure entertainment value. There is genius in every aspect: casting, character development, setting and filming, MUSIC, the opening sequence, story lines and attention to detail, arresting plots that are both fearless and fear-inducing, and of course, the man who plays Dexter: Michael C. Hall. His portrayal is brilliant and has inspired me to want to see his other work in Six Feet Under. He started in theater, which is completely unsurprising due to his ""remarkably theatrical"" voice (as stated in an essay by Vladislav Tinchev) - which, by the way, is exceedingly valuable to the show.

Dexter is signed for at least two more seasons with no known plans to end there, for which I am grateful. Inevitably, the show will end someday though, and when it does, I hope Hall continues to darken our screens as he does so well. I'm fidgety knowing that I only have two more episodes to watch of season 5 (which I am watching for the first time because I wait for the DVD's) and then I will have to wait until August for season 6. But I'm happy to re-watch the first 5 (actually this is my second time through for the first four seasons), and there are also the 5 seasons of Six Feet Under, which I have never seen and is also a highly-praised show.

If I've persuaded you, enjoy!!!","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
871,9.0,16 February 2007,"This is my epitome for a thrilling series. In some form, it's a modernized and darker version of the famous book ""The Outsider"", which presents the audience with a character who has discarded emotional ties; or, to be fair, probably never had any to begin with. The series just sucks you right into a detailed plot line which is sharpened more for every episode, and I cannot get enough. The plot is dark and displays the mindset of sociopaths as the protagonist, Dexter, is one. Despite that, however, it's hard not to like Dexter's being, and due to the scattered fragments of his past we are shown, we gain an understanding of why he is that way, and empathize with him. Throughout the series we gain an understanding of his rich inner life, as we can hear his thoughts on things, which also makes for excellent comical comments. If you enjoy a plot describing a plausible reality hidden under society's idyllic facade, then Dexter is what you want. It's of a dark nature, but has fleshed out and fully developed characters (as well as actors) who play their role in the story well. I am at a loss for why this series has gotten so little attention, as it is a masterpiece, and I will be very disappointed if this series is ever abandoned.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

It's true that maybe we don't all have the urge to kill someone from time to time, but I think anyone who has ever experienced any kind of passion or weird childhood can understand him. It takes you on a roller-coaster of human emotions, moral laws, religion and the justice system.

He is definitely a superhero. He has his kill-outfit, kills by night, has a secret identity, childhood issues and he fights for justice. And that is probably one of the reasons people actually like him, even though his actions make this show the kind of thing your mother wouldn't want you to watch on TV.

Michael C. Hall's portrayal of Dexter is outstanding. Just hearing the monologues gives you the chills. Other characters are so-so. I especially didn't like the character of Rita Bennett and maybe it's good she's gone, because it has opened many new doors for Dexter's characterization.

The sixth season was OK, but not as good as the previous ones. Throughout the whole season the story progression was too slow and when it became a bit dull, they finished it off in the last 2-3 episodes. I just hope the writers will finish the story before they ruin it, if they're already out of ideas.

888,10.0,4 January 2009,"I applaud the creators of this show for daring to make a mass murderer a hero. They have taken an even bigger risk by wrapping each season up so neatly that even their fictional protagonist would be astounded. I just finished watching the complete second season on DVD and I am doubtful I could be more pleased with the balance of tension and satisfaction played-out in this show.

Unlike other shows with an ongoing story line, this one does not leave you on the hook waiting for next year. I don't know about season 3, which I expect is in progress, but the first two seasons kept me on the edge of my seat throughout, but didn't leave me hanging until next year. I really appreciate that. I will be a repeat customer.

As for the content, it is really tough to recommend this show. I usually skip the very disturbing opening sequence. When I force myself to endure it, I can recognize its brilliance. This show is so 'out of the box' which is a sad cliché I know, but that is the point. It takes a bizarre concept and fleshes it out so expertly that I cannot turn it off.

This show rarely drags, but it does annoy. I really feel that those that create this show are working hard to mess with the viewer and take us on unexpected twists and turns. Unexpected twists are essential to making the show really enjoyable to watch. But they also have characters like Deb and Rita that I think other viewers will agree, are extremely annoying. I suppose that without these characters, the show would be incomplete somehow.

I take the time to write this review because I think this show is truly extraordinary. It is not for everyone. The subject matter is very disturbing and makes the viewer have compassion for a mass murderer. What is up with that? It is exactly that conflict that makes this show unique. The writing and story lines actually make it good. They really pull it together after throwing out a web of questions and answering them satisfactorily.

I will patiently await for season 3 to come out on DVD and watch it start to finish in just a few days as I have done with seasons 1 and 2. I cannot imagine experiencing it any other way. It is intense and very well done.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

Hall (of the excellent ""Six Feet Under"" Show) could be so engaging, while killing the bad guys, while working for the good guys at the same time. I read reviews and thought there was no way they could pull this off. I was terrificly surprised and pleased at the same time. I am glad to see that a second season has already been filmed, but I will have a hard time imagining that it can be any better than the first. But being surprised the 1st time, will make me putty in its hands for the 2nd season, so here's hoping! I can't praise this enough, and it is great to see that Showtime has finally gotten the cojones to pick up their programing a-la-HBO, with some quality no holds barred shows. Most recently the absolutely terrific ""Weeds"" for example. (Haven't made up my mind about ""Californication"" yet) I'm actually surprised that this sort of show hasn't been explored before, but am glad that when it did come up, it had been done right. Recommended for anyone that gets tired of the same ol' (starting to get boring yet still pretty well written ""CSI's"" & ""Law & Orders."") for a little something more adult, and not constantly having to stop their scripts from being...well a little more real! Give this a try. I dare you not to get hooked on it. If you are looking for a ""this guy killed so & so, here's why, and here's how, and with what,"" that fits in 42 minutes, this show is not for you.

I always felt Hall's character in SFU was the the most difficult one to portray, and he did it brilliantly. It would have been very easy for that character to offend heterosexual viewers, myself among them. Quite the contrary, I found David to be highly likable and the sharpest mind within his family. He was overshadowed by Nate, but both roles were played equally strong and deserved considerable acclaim.

As far as I know, Hall followed up that series with his current starring role in ""Dexter"". How can someone watch a serial killer on TV and feel empathy towards him?! I do. And I doubt I'm the only one, since that's one of the foundations for the show really. We're supposed to feel that empathy towards him. And we're supposed to admire him for ridding the world of evil people that slip through the cracks of the legal system. Again, this is an extremely difficult role to play, and Hall is simply outstanding.

In fact, without Hall, the overall acting in this series would be noticeably poor. The lieutenant and Dexter's sister, for example, are in desperate need of acting classes.

Overall though, the series is definitely worth watching, the writing and directing is very good, the plot flow is excellent, and Hall is very magnetic as a leading actor (yes, even for a straight viewer) :)","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

The only problem I have with the show, is that I just don't think it's my thing, I've not found the show as addictive as I'd of liked to, I am prone to addiction to TV shows and I have to watch them all in a row, but with Dexter I'm happy to watch just one a day which I am slightly disappointed about, I like to have to force myself to stop watching.

He inhabits this role and makes you understand why he is the way he is. He narrates and stars in this show with lots of flashbacks to his childhood so over time you get to know the back story and what moves him to do what he does.

The only disappointment in this series for me was the first episode in season two. So for those watching it, I'd rather just skip that episode. Don't know, but it really disappointed, and didn't give the satisfaction that the other episodes so gladly gave.

The episodes give a lot of variety, both seeing Dexter evolve mentally, and the excitement always builds up to the end, and usually the episodes fade to the calm voice of Dexter Morgan as he gives you a phrase that will blow you away and make the hairs on your arms stand up and clap.

The series has proved to be one of the best ones I've ever had the joy to experience.

I really recommend Dexter to everyone, especially those of great interest in the thriller genre, and for those just waiting for a groundbreaking series. Its as addictive as heroin!

The voice over works really well & the flash backs to Dexters youth with his father are never overdone & always add to the story. I feel the success of this show is the way it takes you into Dexters head so you know what he is thinking especially when he thinks he is about to be found out.

Michael C. Hall is the undoubted star of the show as dominants from start to finish of each episode as everything resolved around him. After his performances in Six Feet Under this surely puts him in the A list of TV actors.

Hall is simply stunning, playing the complex protagonist/antagonist so well that it leaves me haunted and thirsty for more. His binary opposition alone leaves me wide-eyed in wonder at how a person could portray so many emotions so well. Even though it is about a serial killer (or, more precisely, several serial killers), there is not too much gore or blood, even given Dexter's profession. Dexter's world is constantly changing, and yet the viewer does not get bogged down with too much information, but instead aches for more of Dexter and his issues: his girlfriend, his step-father, and, perhaps most importantly, his past (among many other things).

Wow, this series really has great characters, not just Dexter himself, but also his annoying sister, the crime techs, the police men etc. The slow pace allows time to feel the characters. You instantly get caught identifying their characteristics, peculiarities and complexes.

The story is great, just amazingly great. Not the typical TV-series syndrome, when you feel the the authors just try to catch you to have to watch the next episode or to fill out the time. There is an original story every episode. It actually seems like the authors have so many great ideas, that they have to cut it down and only keep the best parts, only what is necessary.

The humor is morbid. There is plenty of excitement, awkward situations and urgent issues to solve.

The low key of the story and the personalities keeps it to seem probable. Not too fantastic, not too much unlikely events or stunts to pull off, not too strange characters etc.

Thriller? Definitely suspenseful. You know, I don't think that there's a label befitting a show like this. How about ""Dexter""? Yeah. That's the one. ""Dexter"" is the only way to classify this show, because there is truly nothing else like it on television.

Not since the middle seasons of ""The X-Files"" have I been so mesmerized by a television screen. I literally just spent 12 straight hours with nary a thought outside of: ""Holy crap! What's gonna happen next?!?"".

I first became a fan of this show when I started a subscription to Showtime two years ago. I saw all of the first season episodes ""On Demand"", and became curious when I read the plot summary. I hadn't heard anything about it at that point as I don't think it had quite taken off yet.

Needless to say, one episode in and I had an addiction. I finished the first season in two days and immediately proceeded to tell everyone within earshot about this wonderful new televised adventure. I still love the reaction when describing Dexter to someone who knows nothing about it. ""Wait, so the title character is a serial killer? And he's the good guy? The killer?!?"" And it's not so much that Dexter is a good guy, it's that you can't help but root for him. Go ahead and try. I dare you.

Dexter is truly one of the most unique shows I've ever seen and likewise one of the more interesting characters ever brought to life. Every episode has the viewer questioning Dexter's morals and whether or not he's justified in doing the things he's doing. Isn't that what great art is about? Making you ask questions?

I outlined the reasons that I connect with Dexter's character in a meaningful way, even though he's a serial killer. I see a lot of the same discussion of the artificial distance created between people that Virginia Wolff talks about in To the Lighthouse, and I find this meaning in a few Wilco songs. We all deal with this space that we use to protect each other from our dark secrets. I find it comforting that Dexter, a serial killer, is really only facing the same problems that everybody else does. I'd love to hear what you all think and if you like it, please digg it! Thanks.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
908,8.0,12 December 2008,"Dexter Morgan is a blood splatter analyst for the Miami Metro PD by day, and crusading vigilante serial killer by night. Many detective characters 'always get they're man' but this one gets him and then puts him in several garbage bags on the floor of the ocean. This may sound off-putting, however Dexter is more Bruce Wayne than Patrick Bateman, as all of his victims are other killers like himself. With snappy well written dialog, and brilliant heart pounding plot twists around every corner (delivered with a complete lack of fear by the writers) this show explores themes of love and family, good and evil, nature vs. nurture, and the nature of morality itself just to name a few. Don't be fooled, this is not a crime drama, this is a very very dark comedy masquerading as a crime drama. It is without a doubt the best show on TV right now, and they're are not enough adjectives in the English language to describe the depth and brilliance of Michael C. Hall's performance in the title role. If you have not witnessed it stop reading and start watching right now you will thank me and yourself!","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

There are some events that allow you to fill in with your imagination, and the direction and focus of the storyline feels like I'm in the movie theater. This show should be motivation for future TV shows. This show delves into a fresh and more interesting view of fighting crime and provides a sense of completion through instilling karma.

910,9.0,27 November 2007,"""Dexter"" is a show that gives the viewer a look into the life of Dexter Morgan, a blood-spatter analyst working for a local police department in Miami. However, Dexter has a rather interesting secret: He's a serial killer.

Dexter (played splendidly by Michael C. Hall of ""Six Feet Under"" fame) is a likable character with but one flaw: he has no emotions. Thus his ability to kill for the purpose of justice. Dexter only kills those whom he believes have escaped the justice of the Miami police. Child molesters, murderers and full-blown wackaloons, all fall under Dexter's infinite care and planning.

Ever aiding his foul-mouthed adoptive sister (played by a sexy Jennifer Carpenter) in her pursuit to be a detective to match their adoptive father in caliber, Dexter's adventures continue to twist the imagination.

(cliff hangers bug the hell out of me!) The whole premise of this series is a breath of fresh air compared to all the junk TV out there. It explores the dark side of human nature and morality, it tries to make you think and wonder about it, offering all the alternative view points.

Hall's portrayal of dexter is one of the best characters only second to house.(well, maybe not that great but is in the top 5) The show is executed brilliantly and with great dialogue. Each episode flows from one to the next. Lies, deceit, murder and emotions. Dexter as a character is so complex and well executed. The show shows a very human side to the character and all of the cast members put their own stamp on there respective characters. The show is very humanised and that is all credit to the writhing and the cast. There are no bad story lines and it feels real. A great show. Hoping for great things in the future of the show. Only flaw of the show is in its disguise of the ice truck killer. You can easily spot who he is as soon as the character is introduced and you see his face. from that moment on you know who he really is. P.S. If you don't see who the ice truck killer is than you need to have your head examined.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

My reaction when watching kept going from ""Whyyyy??!"" to ""I call bulls***!"" What the other people failed to mention was that the last season in and of itself was pretty bad, not just the last episode. So I'm knocking a point of for that. And now I going to pretend that last season never happened. So there.

Overall, Dexter, is of very high quality. Once it chucks the premise that Dexter only targets killers who have escaped justice out the window, it finds a formula that really works, where Dexter has to outsmart both the killer and his colleagues and it sticks to that, but still manages to keep it fresh most of the time. Each season comes with a longer arch and a main baddie and not all of them are equally brilliant, but when the big picture isn't working out you can take refuge in the details. Dexter is darkly funny and so painfully human in the way he observes everyone else, without really understanding them, but trying to mimic them anyway in order to fit, because everybody sometimes feels like everyone else are normal and they themselves are just faking it. The funny thing is of course that not everyone is secretly a serial killer. Dexter's internal commentator track contrasting what he says and does with what he's thinking made me laugh out loud at times. He is also brilliant at planning and at thinking on his feet when the planning goes south and it is thrilling to watch. His big tragedy is that he is so good, that when the consequences hit, they always hit the people next to him. Debra is a favourite of mine. Rude, loud-mouthed, but fiercely devoted to her brother and her job. But really, there are too many great and memorable side characters to count. And it's a joy to watch.

C.Hall has done an amazing job portraying Dexter Morgan, so has every cast in the show. Casting has been really good for each character along with its characterization. The initial few season are just mindbogglingly amazing , but as the season passes by , after the 5th it starts getting slow and the pace deteriorates. The seventh season was supposedly the bad one due to poor story line , but as one is used-to watching Dexter Morgan commit crimes might still end-up watching it as well and also it lead the viewers to the most waited finale season of the show.

Each episode has the viewer questioning morality and the criminal justice system in general. All I can say is, if you haven't checked out this show, please be warned that the first episode will instantly lead into a 12 hour binge. On my 18th birthday, my friend and I completed the first two seasons in 1 sitting (24 hours). Needless to say, I was instantly hooked.

959,8.0,29 September 2012,"Accepting people just the way they are has been a societal chestnut for quite some time—just ask Jesus...or Mr. Rogers—though many have yet to learn the lesson others understand: that it's wrong to judge someone for what's in their nature. But what if someone's nature includes a compulsion to commit terrible acts? Even if we can avoid judging them, surely we cannot accept them. They need help, and they have to learn to change their ways. The Showtime series Dexter challenges comfortable assumptions about human nature by positioning as its hero a compulsive serial killer. Deft writing allows Dexter to be an anti-hero for the new millennium.

Dexter Morgan (canny Michael C. Hall of Six Feet Under) had an extra cross to bear during puberty: the dawning awareness of a compulsive urge to kill. Luckily, Dexter's late foster father Harry (James Remar) was a cop with a sensitivity to his son's plight and the smarts to devise a plan of action. This plan—which Dexter has come to call ""the Code of Harry""—acknowledges that Dexter cannot stop himself from killing, but redirects the impulse to vigilante justice (and careful self- protection). In Harry's mind, Dexter can right the wrongs of the justice system, get the ones that got away. ""Killing must serve a purpose,"" Harry says. ""Otherwise it's just plain murder."" As a grown man, Dexter followed in his father's footsteps by joining the Miami Metro Police Department as a blood-spatter analyst, alongside his stepsister Debra (Jennifer Carpenter), a beat cop who dreams of becoming detective. Dexter's job puts him in a position to discover appropriate prey, and gives him the knowledge and wherewithal to avoid detection...as long as he follows Harry's precautionary code.

Based as it is on the novels of Jeff Lindsay (developed for television by James Manos Jr.), and with plot lines developed over short-form seasons, Dexter has a winningly novelistic narrative. Each of the first season's twelve episodes has a degree of self-containment, but there's also no doubt that the season is a continuous story that's carefully worked out to provide satisfactory resolution by season's end. Also, Dexter capitalizes on a technique that's all the rage on television these days: first-person narration, and no show does it better than Dexter. The hero confides in the audience all the thoughts he cannot say to anyone in his life: not Debra, with whom he's otherwise tight, and certainly not his steady girlfriend Rita Bennett (Julie Benz, in an expertly modulated sunny-sad turn).

In Season One, at least, Dexter claims to ""have no feelings at all,"" likening himself to the donut box at the end of his morning jaunt around the office: ""Just like me--empty inside."" Though it's clear the forensics tech gets off on artful splatters of blood and poetic justice, Dexter is well-liked by his colleagues, with the exception of Sergeant James Doakes (Erik King), a bulldog who smells Dexter's secret. The overarching story of Season One—apart from establishing Dexter's world— is the investigation of serial murderer The Ice Truck Killer, who Dexter admires as ""an artist."" As Dexter works the case, an intimate relationship develops between himself and the killer: one that's at first remote, but increasingly intimate and ultimately face to face, as Dexter learns a terrible secret that links himself to this shadow of Dexter's self-justified lifestyle. It's a thrilling enough story, but the character of Dexter is what's truly fascinating.

The action keeps you coming back for more almost every time. Each season tends to have mini- plots that get resolved by the end of the season, but enough of an intriguing overall story that keeps each season connected. The characters, especially the main ones, transform over time, so the character development is very good. It creates a bit of a good vs. evil conflict throughout the show. Unfortunately, it can't fight to be in the ranks of the best show ever largely due to how it ended. Without giving anything away, I personally was disappointed by the ending.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

Dexter does an excellent job of spreading out the slow, character development sections into the main story line without interrupting the suspenseful and important sections. The actual story and action are mixed together will in a combo that keeps your attention and has you excited to watch the next episode.

Their brother sister bonding is very nice. Every episode is interesting & thrilling. The way how the Dexter story ends in the 8th season final episode is very nice. It is unpredictable & unexpected.

His police woman sister and his co-worker doesn't knows about Dexter second life as a serial killer. Only his adopted father knows his secret.

It's a serial killer TV series. Why I love the series?. Yea he has compulsion to killing people, he is mentally ill. BUT his adopted father taught him to channel his dark side by only killing criminals and create strict code that he should never kill innocent people.

Beside his dark side.. He is smart, he can be a great brother for his sister, he is a good husband and father and he has great sense of humor. Not to forget that he is saving the lives of innocent people.

It's gripping, has great humour, and has thrown some serious surprises into the mix (I don't even want to give a hint as to when the surprises are as they are mind blowing, especially one in particular).

It's been great to see Dexter as a character develop over the 7 seasons (so far). The acting is brilliant from both M.C Hall and Jennifer Carpenter, and the surrounding cast also bring so much to the show.

As my title suggests, I would've given it a perfect 10 if it wasn't for a what I believe to be, weak season 5. It didn't have the same feel as the others before it, and in my opinion it was always going to struggle coming off the back of what I believe is the best season (4).

It's currently in it's 7th season and there is supposedly 1 more season after that. I hope it isn't dragged out too long like some shows and does end on it's 8th as I feel it won't be long before they can only go so far with the show and should end it strongly rather than wait until its ratings gradually fall leading to it being forced to end.

Every episode so far is just escalating and building up to what i feel will be a brilliant conclusion. I especially love Michael C. Hall and Jennifer Carpenter, they play out their roles especially well and the dynamic between them is amazing. If there was any flaws in the series itself they're really minor and not worth mentioning or nit picking about. This show is a delightful treat in the world of bland comedies and corny action flicks.

Dexter is a blood splatter analyst but he's also a serial killer. He only kills other serial killers, hard criminals and those who commit serious crimes. He won't kill people who are innocent civilians.

Throughout the story you find out more information about his family, his upbringing, his childhood etc and the plot thickens.

He was adopted as a child and got very close with his step sister who he keeps at arms length. She starts to get suspicious regarding dexter and his secrets.

I don't want to give too much away or give any spoilers but it's definitely worth a watch. It's a fast moving series with lots of twists. If you enjoy crime, suspense, plot twists and TV shows about serial killers this is definitely a binge worthy option.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

Of course none of this could be possible without an accomplished and magnificent actor Michael C. Hall. He really gives Dexter soul and mind of its own, and consequently it's sometimes very hard to distinguish where Michael ends and Dexter begins.

The creators of this series have found a mysterious and unique way of presenting us the protagonist (Dexter), because when watching Dexter you are actually cheering for a serial killer. And I absolutely love this. The fact that they've managed to do this is enough to establish a new movie-rating scale: 1 to Dexter. There are a lot of good series out there which all lack either quality acting, sophisticated story or ""enriched"" script. Well it's safe to say that Dexter has it all. You know how they say ""nothing is perfect"". Well they obviously haven't seen Dexter.

I think finding a bad side of Dexter is scientifically impossible. I mean believe me, I tried. If I really had to highlight the imperfections, it would be some of the co-stars of the series. Not all of them of course. But I think that some of the actors shouldn't be any near the set of Dexter. Although that's not such a problem because M.C.Hall fixes it every time.

SEASON 1: 10/10 A lot of people kept requesting me to watch this show. I was always skeptical to start because of the wavy pattern the show's quality seems to be portraying. But when I finally started it I was hooked. It was great to see Dexter having numurous storylines, storytelling methods and character development. My favorite part of this seasons was getting to know Dexter's origin and the villain. I have read a lot of reviews and this season's villain seems to be one of the best. Also the writing, pacing and acting were spot on. Great great great season and start of the series!

SEASON 2: 10/10 (yes, again) This season is quite different from season 1. The story is basically one long stretch of suspense with one burning question everyone has: ''Will Dexter be caught?"". I also liked the storyline between Lila and Dexter. A continuous wave of ups and down both with Lila and Rita. I really don't know what I can say more without spoiling a lot since I already kinda did by referencing the Lila hookup. A lot of fans would rate this a little ''worse'' than season 1, but I personlly think they're even. They took a risk with choosing this path and they did it without skipping a beat. Again, the writing, story and definitly acting were brilliant (especially from Doakes, Dex, Deb and Lila).

When I finally got around to watching it I was surprised how good it was and how the writers could actually make you root for a serial killer. The humour is one of the ways it softens the horror and the acting is first class. Using an entire series to tell one main story arc was also I think something of a first and it works well. Unfortunately the quality and believability begins to tail off after the 5th series and the hit you over the head anti Christian propaganda begins to become so obvious that it becomes a theme and is as boring as a fundamentalist atheist.

It's really interesting to see how he grew up and taught by his stepfather and how he hidden his emotion and personal matters from the world.

Season to season increases the tension, I saw this series less than a week for each chapter was more addictive than earlier and he could not stop.

Certainly there are bad reviews, I remember that was the reason writers strike that left the last part of the series and loose little crazy, but once you arrive you do not care, you're so involved Dexter the character you want to see how this story ends, and eye!

Although I have not read the books, the Storyline is impressive and continues to grow and deepen throughout all seasons. You just can't stop watching once you're started.

There where in the first Seasons I had the Excitement and really stayed home to watch. At the end I got the feeling I already knew and saw it all.

Don't get me wrong since I am in full understanding that Its really hard to make a series that actually maintain a certain ""you need to see the next episode"" feeling. But in my eyes after X Seasons there was not much outcome change.

1003,10.0,12 September 2012,"Michael C. Hall did unbelievable job in this bloody masterpiece. He delivered such an outstanding performance in every single aspect of acting art. The character development is realistic, and guess what, Dexter is still developing and evolving with time to adopt new variables in his life. He started alone with codes received from his foster father. We can see how he developed his understanding of this codes with time. we can see how he adopt a new character in his life like being a husband, father and partner.

The script is written gently in such a way you can't miss a second watching.Some people oppose the richness in voice over that may reduce the thrilling factor, but I see this as one of the most great move the director made.. Why? because Mr. Morgan is a man without feelings nor expressions (except what he is faking most of the time).. and the voice over is the perfect method to overcome this point in acting. The crew made a fantastic move in this issue.

The only thing that keep this series away from being the best is the younger sister... yeah it's Debra Morgan.. Why? I admit that I loved her in the first season, but then I had enough from the repeated cussing of the ""F Word"" she uses all the time. In addition there is no character development at all. She is in 30's and still behave like a teenager. She never learn from her mistake. Always nagging like a baby. and her track record with relationships is a disaster. She banged a mechanic, serial killer, gym trainer, her boss, CI and partner. She seems like she want to bang the whole world. No wonder if she start to bang her brother in season 7.Is vice officers always like that?... I wonder. She always connects emotionally with most of the cases she worked.

Instead of thrashing the series I started to enjoy it for what it was - with its ups and downs (a lot fewer cliffhangers). I wouldn't have let out any of the 8 seasons as each one of them had something integral, though some more than others, to contribute to the character of Dexter Morgan, and the 8th season summed up the whole series pretty well.

One criticism I have is that Deb, Dexter's sister, has been given dialogue so riddled with the F-word and variations of the F-word (even substituting it for a syllable in a multi-syllabic word) it really becomes a distraction. I haven't done a statistical analysis, what would be the point?, but the impression that I get is that she very rarely says anything, in any context, to anyone --irrespective of their official rank or importance -- . Yes, we understand she's a spunky, inquisitive detective who chafes at the rules and tries to find her own way to resolve mysteries without being bound by department protocol. But I've personally never encountered a person in real life who spoke the way she does and I've been through boot camp and have seen every Scorsese movie made. If you have children watching of an impressionable age I would think this could be a concern. And even if it isn't -- it's certainly a personal matter -- in my opinion this kind of dialogue shows an easy way out for the show's writers and adds nothing to enhance the complexity of Deb's character.

Otherwise a very worthy series. It wasn't as galvanizing for me as Breaking Bad, but certainly a success, especially given the gruesome subject matter.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

He seems to be different from others and he really is. When he tries to fake human emotions that part of Dexter is awesome. The story line of every season makes you addicted of this show. You will always want to see how he manage his normal or i should better say fake life and his real life(serial killer's life). The way he finds convicts by using his own set of rules which was given by his father to him is damn good. In the whole series Dexter's father(not biological) is not alive but he talk to him, this will make you an addictive of this show, at every point when he gets into some kind of dilemma and try to solve that.His dark life and changes in his fake life with every season make u more curious about this show.

Nonetheless, what I really love about this series is the fact that from the very first episode, its no secret, Dexter is a serial killer; however, he is portrayed in such a unique manner perhaps somewhat-passive and innocuous- that its impossible to fear him- the way one would typically fear a psychopath. Overall, every season there is either an existing or new character who ends up either making a connection with him or is ultimately feeling conflicted about him; thus, Dexter's ""dark"" secret becomes compromised. He seemingly tries to live his simple life doing what he needs to do and taking care of the instrinsic urge of killing he cannot evade from. This is a series where at times you will find yourself fighting with the remote control every night because you realize you have to turn off the TV so you can work tomorrow, but it becomes what seems like a perennial fight against yourself!","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

1021,10.0,8 May 2020,"Dexter is one of those shows I get excited about when I describe it to someone. For me I've never been into those crime drama series but with Dexter, the story is done perfectly. There are tidbits that people complain about the series but it is done so well. It has great characters, great writing, and great stories. While it might seem formulaic at times it always comes up with something interesting plot and has great characters to support it. Without giving too much away the final season is a bit ""soap operaish"" but if you over look the logistics you'll still like it just fine. It's a series I know I'll be recommending to people and be rewatching sometime in the future! Long live Dexter!","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
1022,9.0,18 June 2013,"So, not much of a review, but I had to post this somewhere because it was literally bugging me not to.

Incredible TV series. You would be stupid to miss it. It is sheer brilliance in TV format, with heaps of excellent dark humour.

The only thing which prevents me from giving it 10/10 is how I cannot help but find myself so unbelievably irritated by Dexter's sister (funnily enough I had the same problem with Dexter's sister from Dexter's Laboratory), and his girlfriend. And as the series went on, my frustrations just kept growing and growing, until they are at breaking point - and I'm not even finished with the series yet! This is probably due to the fact that Dexter is such a likable character you literally want the best for him all the way through.

Regardless, watch this or miss out on something truly epic!","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

This has to be the best show i have ever seen! its amazing from start to finish and completely addictive!! I watched Season 1 online and i became hooked and finished it in a day.(yea i have no life!) Then i decided to buy all seven seasons on DVD (Season 8 wasn't out yet) I watched them all back to back for a week. OMG! what an amazing program! This show made me laugh, and made me cry (season 4) and also there was parts where i was sitting on the edge of my seat!! When i heard that season 8 was going to be the last season i nearly cried. And with the events that happened in the final episode of season 8 i did cry! for hours! I didn't want such an amazing show to end! I give this show 10/10 because it has amazing story lines and also amazing characters. The characters became part of my family and i felt at some points i could actually relate to them. the acting from Michael C Hall, Jennifer Carpenter, Julie Benz and every one else was sensational! I have every season 1-8 on DVD and re- watch every episode continually i cant get enough!! id highly recommend this show to anyone! GO WATCH IT!!","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

1028,8.6,27 June 2012,"""Dexter"" is a superb series and beats most of its competition with other series for one main reason. The final episode in a season does not result in a soap-opera-type ending. A soap-opera-type ending gives lots of hype but no closure leaving you only with a promise of answers in the next season. For example I enjoyed ""Prison Break"" Season One until the last episode where it leaves one with no answers. Dexter cleverly tells a complete story across the season and still leaves one with something to think about for the next season. Nothing happens by accident and nothing is held back; nor is there a pretence of possible excitement and closure in the future. Instead it delivers with perfect timing each time. In fact, each episode tells a complete story of it's own - a rare trait in TV series.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

1030,8.6,10 June 2016,"Just finished watching Dexter on Netflix and it rates in one of my Top 5 ever TV series. I wasn't too disappointed with the ending because the whole series seems to lead to this ending and it could allow more to be made. Dexter is a fantastic diverse character and the casting of him and the other characters bar one or two is perfect. I found the characters of Jamie and Elway to be really annoying. There are a few technical inconsistencies and questions about certain aspects of life and how people act and respond in situations that can be raised throughout but the overall story arc and series is brilliant and enough you can overlook things. Occasionally you'll find yourself saying ""would that really happen in real life"" but there's a good mixture of drama, comedy and crime fighting here! The character of Dexter is essentially a madman or psychopath but the show gets you to like him and feel his pain and anguish when things go wrong but share in the joy when it goes well for him. Some people will view Dexter as the person he is where as others will love him, which is why the show is so well written.

The acting and chemistry between his on screen sister played by Jennifer Carpenter is excellent and both the main characters are cast well. The support cast are very good and there's some good cameos by big actors throughout the series. It's hard to write a review without giving spoilers away.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
1031,8.6,12 April 2014,"What a great intriguing series! At first I just didn't think it would be my thing - that lasted about 10 minutes into the pilot. It's suspenseful and each episode is better than the last. I was not a fan of the sister but her character began improving and didn't seem as forced as it had in earlier episodes. All the characters are realistic and their performance are outstanding. Each episode has me on the edge of my seat - all different from the last - no repetitions and thoroughly convincing. I'd never heard of the main character before, this is the first I've watched him in anything...and he is so believable it almost makes you wonder what his ""real"" life is like! If you don't think this series would be to your liking - do what I did and watch the pilot...incredibly addictive!","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

1039,8.6,6 May 2023,"Dexter tells of a blood splatter analyst/scientist with a dark secret or as he calls it ""his dark passenger"". He's somewhat of a vigilante - think the Punisher but in serial killer format.

He picks up the crimes where his police colleagues failed to secure a conviction. He will do his own investigation, be the judge, jury and as the case often ends up being, the executioner as well.

There's some very hard scenes to watch and while there is a compelling undercurrent narrative, the episodes can become repetitive. Never the less, given the content and charisma of our protagonist, we can't help but tune in for more.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"
1040,8.6,17 November 2016,"I loved watching Dexter, but if you were to ask me for my two favourite seasons i would say the first two seasons. I was impressed by Jennifer Carpenter (Debra Morgan) because for the first couple of seasons i was not her biggest fan but she got better and better as the show went on and i would easily say that in the last season she was the best actor. She was amazing in the last season. Two other characters i liked on the show were Sgt Doakes and special agent Lundey. Overall the acting was fantastic from all actors, I don't think i was annoyed by anyone on the show. I read online and saw on Youtube ( before i reached the end of Dexter) that a lot of people were disappointed with the last episode but i didn't see anything wrong because really how are you suppose to end a show because i reckon that's every writers nightmare anyway.","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

The entire credits for these show goes to the screenplay, director and story writers departments, I know how much pressure or risk they take to complete each season. Then coming to Dexter Morgan his acting and projection of his dark side is awesome then Debra Morgan character is also excellent and again I need to thank to all departments creating each character in these show. In any show at least 1percentage of flaw will be there but while watching the show completely they should not be considered.

The emotions we felt with Dexter were powerful, the voice off is always very ""philosophical"" and Dexter's Dad character was used with the best effect. As if he was the conscience of Dexter, always appearing when Dexter was about to do something ""not by the code"" or shall we say stupid.

I am pleased with the end that the producers gave to Dexter, but a little disappointed with the last 30s-1 minute which was truly too much! (Even though I get why they did show this to us). Boy, I'm gonna miss that show for sure! And I hope that Michael C. Hall will come back with another TV show after Six Feet Under and Dexter!

1048,8.6,1 March 2016,"This is in regards to the character of Debra Morgan. Just my opinion. This is the most unlikeable, foul mouthed, nasty, gross, unprofessional, self involved, sleazy, pathetic excuse for a female (and I use that term lightly) that I have ever had the unfortunate opportunity to view on any show. Every other word out of her mouth is a profanity. The writers certainly missed the mark with this one. A female can do an excellent job and be in positions of authority without having to talk in such a profane, nasty foul mouthed way. They did an injustice to the character and certainly TO WOMEN EVERYWHERE by writing this kind of dialogue for this female character. None of the male characters talk in such a profane and disgusting way. Shame on the writers and producers of this otherwise great show. After the first season I dreaded her scenes and only stuck with it because of the rest of the characters and the other great actors and actresses. The character was completely irredeemable and unlikeable. I now don't like the actress who played her either. Goodness--and please cut that stringy hair!!!","October 1, 2006 (United States)"

I really enjoyed the show though my moral compass battled with me connecting with dexter but wanting what was right. I would recommend watching the show...but not the last episode. The last episode really breaks your heart with no purpose. It totally made me wish I'd never watched Dexter. If you value love, justice, purpose, anything really good....don't watch the end.

Well I am and the show is still on Showtime. So that should tell you something right there that the show is still hot. I hope this show gets another season.

I really enjoyed this series because of the intriguing story line. If you are looking to watch this show, you may be easily disturbed. Full of blood and mystery, Dexter is a show that will not put you to sleep.

The drama. The suspense. Dexter taking the justice system in his own hands. Every episode was written well. All actors played their parts great. I wished they kept some characters. The theme song is one of my ring tones. I'm currently watching the seasons again.
