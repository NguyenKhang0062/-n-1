10.0,26 July 2019,"Started watching this brilliant spin on a superhero show after dinner. Now it's 4 am and I have just watched the whole thing.

From the very first episode I was glued to this exciting, interesting and crazy ride.

8.0,6 December 2021,"I've had big expectations about this show, because I thought that is going to be exactly that kind of show, in which the good guys (the superheroes) fight the bad guys (the villains) and of course, they win. I couldn't have been more wrong, especially because ""The Boys"" it's not about a desperate attempt of superheroes to save the world from evil, instead this show takes a much more realistic approach, about what is going to happen if superheroes had really existed.

I'm saying that I had big expectations in the beginning, because I thought that it would be the same usual show with superheroes and villain, that is most likely to find everywhere. In the first couple of episodes I've been a little bit disappointed, or rather shocked, because like I've already said, ""The Boys"" describes what the MCU never did. Of course, the movies and shows from Marvel are destined to other public's category, but this show is tough. It has all you could not expect from a TV series with superheroes. It has violence, gore, nudity, astonishing CGI effects and a very unpredictable and solid storyline. In the end it seems that this one delivered what I didn't expect it to and I am pleased with that. The show is definitely worth watching."

10.0,26 July 2019,"First it's just a very interesting take on the whole superhero genre. But there's also a lot more. Great actors, great storyline and very nice picture. I guess for me it's the best superhero series yet, followed by Titans and Umbrella Academy."
10.0,26 July 2019,Just finished watching the four first episodes. The pilot has to be one of greatest pilots I've ever seen. It has everything and I was hooked immideately. And it keeps getting better. I didn't know I needed this. It's really bold and a fresh wind for TV.
10.0,1 August 2019,With all these awful shows like supergirl and legends of tomorrow etc..The Boys is the perfect antidote to that insipid moralistic tripe that's spewed our TVs so thank you Amazon Prime for treating us like adults and I can't wait for the second season
10.0,28 August 2022,"There's nothing more that I can really say about The Boys that hasn't already been said. It's just a flat out awesome show! It's easily become one of my favorite new shows in years! I binged the entire first two seasons in just a few days when they first came out and rewatched them again for the second time before Season 3 came out. I was expecting a little bit of a drop off for Season 3 because Season 1 and 2 were so great, and there is a little drop in quality but it's still a very good show! It takes everything you loved about Season 1 and 2 (the violence, humor, heart, craziness, character development, etc.) and takes it all to a whole new level! This show has such an original take on the Superhero genre that is both exciting and hilarious! I can not recommend this show enough! Just a warning though...once you start watching it it's hard to stop. Give yourself enough time because you'll want to binge it as quickly as possible!"
10.0,15 August 2019,
6.0,11 October 2022,"The Boys is one of the best Superhero shows I've ever seen. While Season 1 was the best season of the series, Season 2 and 3 were also both very good and absolutely worth watching. Season 3 was fantastic, Jensen Ackles was the perfect actor to add to this already incredible show! This show continues to amaze as it's not afraid to try new things and is a show that is definitely for adults. It has no problems being offensive and making you feel squeamish. You don't even have to be a fan of superhero shows to enjoy this. It's violent, funny, thrilling, etc.. Everything you want in a good superhero show. Season 4 just added Jeffrey Dean Morgan to the cast. Another great addition to an already incredible cast. I don't know what else I can say except I absolutely love this series and can't wait for more to come!"
5.0,5 July 2024,"Season 4 of The Boys is close to unwatchable.

Violence and gore are ok as long as they're justified and part of the plot, in season 4, it feels like it's there just to A, fill up the time and B, because the writers are simply deranged

But the biggest problem, as many other viewers point out, is that it is way too political

Hollywood and Hollywood-adjacent screenwriters and showrunners need to understand that the audience does not want political views shoved down their throat

I guess it's going to take a few more years, box office bombs and scathing reviews for them to understand it, but they'll get there in the end

hopefully."
9.0,9 July 2024,"The boys started really well, but from the last episode of season 3, the show has been going downhill. The story has stopped progressing, and the creators are only adding stuff to generate shocking reactions from viewers. Unfortunately, this isn't working anymore. Weird scenes looked good when the story was moving forward, but now that it isn't, I am just unable to watch it anymore. The performances of all the actors are good, but the writing has been really bad. The characters are making weird choices that don't match their personalities, and the attempt to stretch things out is very visible on screen. All in all, The Boys has fallen off."
9.0,22 October 2020,"This Amazon series is set in a world where there are superheroes; they aren't typical superheroes though; they work for the powerful Vought Corporation and consider ratings and profit to be more important than saving lives. They are also arrogant, disillusioned or generally unpleasant. The worst of these are 'The Seven', the most senior heroes who are heavily marketed by Vought. Working to expose them is a group known as 'The Boys'; led by Billy Butcher who is convinced that leader of the heroes, Homelander, is responsible for the disappearance of his wife. We are introduced to each group via new members; Hughie Campbell joins The Boys after ultrafast hero A-Train ran through his girlfriend; and Annie January an idealistic young heroine known as Starlight who joins The Seven. Hughie and Annie become friends before learning what the other is doing.

When I first heard of this I thought it was just a case of Amazon jumping on the superhero bandwagon but then heard a radio review which made it sound like a series I might like... it most certainly is! If you like your heroes to be heroic and good rather than self-centred egomaniacs you might not like this but if you like to see conventions turned on their head this is great. Another major difference between this and more typical stories featuring superheroes is that this is definitely not family friendly; there is a lot of strong violence, some sex and nudity and possibly the most swearing I've heard in a TV show. The story develops well over the two seasons that are currently available with some good twists and plenty of interesting character development. The characters on both sides are interesting and the cast does a great job portraying them. While the story can be a bit dark at times it is lightened by its humour; often being genuinely hilarious as we see events that wouldn't seem the most obvious source of laughs. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to older superhero fans who are looking for something different. I can't wait for season three."
9.0,28 July 2019,Want to see what it would really be like with super heroes around? Check this out! No kids play here folks....not for kids. Best damn series on right now....about time!
10.0,28 October 2019,"Can't say I recall seeing Anthony Star in any films (and I'm an Aussie) but his performance as Homelander is really something else - someone give him an award. Can't wait for next season, and more projects with Star."
10.0,26 July 2019,Great twist on the superhero genre. The story is well written. The acting is good. Definitely an entertaining series.
10.0,30 July 2019,"When I first heard of 'The Boys', I thought it would be your standard superhero series, but when I actually watched it, I discovered I was dead wrong. After 15 minutes of the first episode, it was impossible to stop watching. It was a more believable take on what the world would look like if superheroes were flying around today, with characters that were unforgettably unique. There were times when I thought that the 'good guys' were the 'bad guys', and times when I thought the 'bad guys' were the 'good guys'. But in the end, I found that there weren't any 'all-good' or 'all-bad' characters, but 'all-human' characters, sometimes with more-than-human abilities. It's a super series, definitely worth your time."
10.0,20 July 2019,
8.0,15 October 2020,"EXCELLENT first season.

Incredibly, an even better second season."
6.0,26 July 2019,"Bad superheroes have been done before, but not like this. Very entertaining."
4.0,6 July 2024,"Predictable. One shocking scene after another. This is the layziest writing and directing ever. Talking heads, bs dialogs and constantly people sitting and talking. And talking. No dynamic. This season is so off, it looks like they cut the budget in half. If it wasn't for some effects this would be really impossible to watch. The quality dropped so much that it is not worth wasting time and energy.

The family story lines are boring and feel like time fillers. The characters are off and lame. Even the new ones. The pretend like we know them, but we don't. And why would you care? There is so much implausible stuff in this season.. I don't even know where to start."
8.0,5 July 2024,"It's a sad year for The Boys.. What started as a captivating and entertaining show, has devolved into a painful hour of viewing each week. I could easily binge the first 2 seasons seasons (and even season 3 for the most part)... but the subtle & clever political undertones of earlier seasons, which were an afterthought to the storyline & character building, has become the sole purpose of the show now it seems. I barely get through each new episode, but continue to hold on in the hopes of some kind of glimpse of The Boys seasons I fell in love with in the first place. There are still a few good scenes and humor sprinkled in, but it's mostly just the writer shoving their extreme political view down your throat every chance they get. It's becoming predictable and very repetitive at this point. I hope things will start to get better, and I'll most likely tough it out for the remainder of the season as something to put on in the background while I'm doing other stuff, but if it continues this trajectory, I won't be around for season 5 (if it even gets there)."
10.0,17 November 2020,"(Review updated after Season 4).

Hughie Campbell's life is turned upside down when the love of his life is accidentally killed by a superhero, a member of The Seven, the most elite and adored of superhero teams. The Seven are the rock stars of the age and untouchable but the more Hughie investigates, the more he discovers they're far from perfect. His moral crusade sees him drawn into a band of anti-superhero vigilantes: The Boys.

I'm generally not into superhero movies or series but this is different. Here the superheroes are more the villains than the heroes, making for a very interesting and original take on the genre. Throw in some very intriguing sub-plots involving the superheroes' private lives, the politics of their jobs and machinations within their team plus some profound observations and themes involving the (forced) superficiality of public figures, the intrusiveness and control of the media and the influence of social media status and you have a series that is original, entertaining and a mirror of the times.

Action scenes are well done, with some great CGI and graphic grittiness - this is definitely not Disney! While mostly a drama there's some wonderfully funny moments too. Just about anything involving The Deep was always bound to raise a laugh.

Not perfect though. The central plot - The Boys vs the superheroes - often appears clumsy and seems to go around in circles. It starts well enough but after a point, towards the end of Season 1, it just seems to get bogged down in endless escapades that have no point and occur based on the flimsiest of excuses. Plus these escapades often got resolved in silly, plot hole-riddled ways.

The writers would have done better to initially concentrate on the internal machinations within The Seven with the superheroes vs The Boys plot starting as a sideshow and then amping it up as the series went on.

Things do come together quite well in Season 3 though as the plot finds its focus. Season 3 is action-packed and intriguing with some great internal machinations within the superhero camp and a very interesting new character. It was heading for a fantastic showdown but the writers fluffed this somewhat in an effort to prolong the series. The final episode of S3 is a bit confusing and disappointing.

This disappointment continues into S4 as the main plot doesn't develop much. Instead we have heaps of sub-plots that don't add much and are just there to kill time. I was expecting showdown between The Boys and the superheroes but instead we have heaps of politics, all very polarising and I assume meant to be some sort of commentary on US politics and society. Before there was some engagement with the superheroes, now they're just plain cartoonish, malevolent villains. The middle of the season is the low point with meaningless space filler galore.

Things do improve towards the end and the season ends on a high. However, I suspect that S5 will be more of the same: two or three episodes of plot development, five or six episodes of padding. Why would the producers give us a tight, development-filled plot when they can stretch this out for several more seasons and make more money that way?

Season ratings: S1&2 8/10, S3 9/10, S4 6/10."
9.0,6 August 2019,"2nd only to HBO's Chernobyl.

This series is dark, gritty and gripping. From the very first scene you know right away that this isn't the MCU or DC or even the Watchmen. It's somehow darker and even more twisted and yet, still inexplicably grounded in reality.

That's the appeal of this show.

Not that the heroes are really villains, though some of them are quite evil, they're just broken by the system that created them... just like the rest of us.

Watch it, I promise you that you will not be disappointed."
10.0,4 September 2019,"Give a celebrity super powers and you have The Boys. Narcisistic and arrogant. Above the law. Of course I enjoy Marvel and DC, but honestly, they are unrealistic. If Supes were real, this is how they would act. Sure, you would have a handful of good ones, but the majority would do what they wanted. The Boys shows the real and darker side of humanity. Our current celebrities consider themselves better than everyone else, and if you gave them super powers, then just imagine how they would behave. On the outside they would appear good, but behind closed doors their true colors would show. Well, ""The Boys"" know this and they are bent on taking down the Supes and showing their true colors. Like I said, if Supes were real, this is how I imagine it would be. Did I mention Karl Urban? Stellar performance. And Anthony Starr as Homelander is fabulous(Superman meets Captain America meets Arrogant Superstar). If you want a realistic look into Superheroes, then watch The Boys."
10.0,27 July 2019,"Finally something new and fresh from the stereotypical drivel being jammed down our throats for the past couple of years. None of the clichés either. Dark,gory hilarious, ethically mind bending. Like how far would you twist justice to serve your needs, what price would you be willing to pay for revenge is it worth losing your humanity? All this mixed into a beautiful first season. Can't wait for more. A definite must watch epically if you enjoyed titles like Titans."
10.0,22 June 2024,
9.0,13 August 2019,
10.0,5 August 2019,"The excellent performance by Karl Urban just made this show for me, along with the casting of Simon peg for Huies dad (Huie is based on Simon peg in the comics) so that was a nice surprise, also the characters of the supers were played perfectly with Home lander being very well played"
6.0,24 April 2022,"Review of Season One:

This was a real treat and by far my favourite superhero show. An out-and-out satire of modern America, taking broad swipes at consumerism, celebrity, religion, politics, big business, big pharma, you name it. Very well acted (Karl Urban gets the role of his career) and with every episode packed with twists, good characters, action, bloodshed, you name it. I bingewatch this and loved it.

Review of Season Two:

I was worried this one wouldn't match the first but it did. The story expands, the action and mayhem is ramped up, the new characters leave a real impression, and all of the good stuff from the first season is back. Looking forward to the third...

Review of Season Three:

I was a little worried about this third season when it first started. It felt like the freshness was gone to be replaced by the crudity and forced outrageousness that marred PREACHER. However, after a few episodes this finds its feet with the introduction of a great new character, some strong acting and all of the twists and political intrigue we know and love.

Review of Season Four:

Sadly, the series begins a downward trajectory with season four, in which very little happens of note from beginning to end. There isn't even much in the way of decent gore or action as in previous series. The old characters are back and a few new ones join them, but the new subplots invented for this season are singularly unimpressive. Even worse, they focus too much on grossing out the viewer rather than contributing original plotting. This is how PREACHER went. I'm glad the next season is the last."
4.0,20 August 2021,"Yeah, this is perfect

I don't think there are enough words to praise this.

Different types of characters ,screenplay gave equal space to everyone and they just nailed it."
10.0,25 June 2024,
10.0,24 June 2024,"This show was always a satire of America, particularly of the populist right, this was obvious. It also took shots at virtue signalling corporations, but it was obvious that its true target was the right of the culture wars.

However it wasn't too preachy and the show's tone was still anarchic, cynical and amoral - i.e. It gleefully offended everyone which, in our over-sensitive times, was refreshing. But in season 4, it has shifted to preaching standard issue, mainstream liberal talking points which is boring.

The black comedy associated with Homelander - the character who carries the show - isn't quite as good and you have this feeling that all the usual US Culture War talking points are going to be addressed. The writers no longer want to poke fun at the pieties of our age; now they want to 'use their platform' to address important topics. Snore.

This show has gone from Sex Pistols to Taylor Swift in 4 season. Sad."
10.0,10 September 2019,"Wow I like it. Probably the first TV show my partner has introduced me to that I haven't been bored the first few episodes (except vikings, that rocks!). We really can't wait until the next season comes out. The cliff hanger of this season was gobsmacking. Awesome show guys"
10.0,17 September 2019,"What I have always wanted in a superhero show. Graphic violence, an engaging stories with well developed characters and even some well timed humour. Already waiting for season 2."
10.0,18 February 2022,"Everything about this show is freaking amazing. The acting and writing are some of the best I´ve seen on a show. And they make enough changes from the comics so that it feels like it´s own story, and so even people who read the comic don´t know where it´s going."
10.0,10 September 2022,"I can't stand Marvel and DC and all the comic book stuff, (Deadpool and Guardians I will watch) BUT THIS IS DIFFERENT!

Imagine a superhero world that was real, none of this nicey nicey holier than thou rubbish, where the only person doing anything wrong is some crazy genius super villain (for those that have seen it, I meant to put that lol), it's what humans are like, with all their neurosis, prejudices and proclivities but with powers.

Honestly I didn't think I was going to like it until the scene where we met A-Train (no spoilers) but I ended up binge watching it ALL over a lazy weekend with a few bevvys and I can honestly say....

Thia is one of the best shows around, best show since Game of Thrones.

You'll love characters, then hate them and the opposite, there's all the grey area that is needed with character development.

Plus the fact it looks brilliant, the effects are stunning. Welll directed, well filmed, honestly the DOP on this needs some recognition...

So if you don't like super hero stuff (especially the happy Disney ending type stuff) then this is for you and if you do like super hero stuff you'll still like it, I couldn't recommend this more!

10/10."
10.0,22 May 2021,"This show is a remedy to the super hero culture.

Revitalising, violent, quick-witted and anti-pop.

It's not afraid to pull the curtain of our hypocritical society."
8.0,11 February 2022,"I hate superhero movies and maybe only saw Christopher Nolan's masterpiece, Batman.

But this TV series drove me crazy, all the moments of the story are fascinating and the choice of actors, especially Homelander and Butcher, is unique.

Congratulations on this wonderful series, everything is going great."
6.0,15 September 2019,"This show is awesome and I thought I knew what I was getting myself into when I watched the first episode. What if all superheroes weren't all good right? Yes you are correct but with more.

The series has a great story, great characters, crazy twists, awesome special effects and so on. A lot of the story is pretty much how we Americans and corporations are. Yes there is a lot of sexuality, nudity and gore but it's an adult series. Did people complain about how much nudity l/sex GOT had? Nope! If this bothers you then don't watch it but don't give it a bad rating for that. Was it needed? I think so, every part of that makes the story more intriguing. It plays to all the different characters and storylines in the series.

All I can say without mentioning any specific content is that I was disappointed that season 1 wasnt longer. It really got me into the story wondering what's going to happen next and the season finale had such a twist that you have to wait until season 2 to see how it will pick up from there. Lots of possibilities and storylines for season 2.

I really hope they can keep up the hype (which is real) for season 2 as they did with the first season. This show is a must watch. The ratings are accurate."
2.0,9 July 2022,How bad is the season finale--filled with predictable outcomes and things that make no sense? Am I the only one that think it's just stupid writing. I will expound if need be.
10.0,11 August 2024,"When it premiered, The Boys was a crazy comic come to life and a blast to watch. Season 2 kept it up. By Season 3, the rot had started to set in. Season 4 has its moments. Those moments are almost entirely because of Karl Urban (Butcher) and Antony Starr (Homelander). These two actors have brought to life two of the most outrageous characters to be on a series. They ARE the show, such is the force of the roles and how they are played. But after 4 seasons it has become repetitive and worse, seems to have lost most of the crazy humor that was a signature of the first two years. Frenchie has become tiresome, Kimiko as well. Annie (Starlight) has become quite shrill and brittle. This is not a knock on the actors, who perform what is written and do it well. It is a knock on the writing. All series ultimately exhaust the creative well and The Boys has reached that point."
9.0,4 July 2024,"I've only watched up to the sixth episode and my disappointment in the overall quality of the show is immeasurable. A clever, funny TV, that turned sour. There's no plot progression, the series only have gore and shock value, and everything is thrown out of the window.

The main story's plot is going back and forth, but in the end stays the same, it's clear that the writers have lost their passion for the show, especially considering the fact that even the humor is quite often just dull. I can't name a single interesting thing that happened in the six season 4 episodes, because NOTHING happened. Season's wrapping up, two more episodes to go and it feels like it still hasn't started. Every episode is a bottle episode.

I only recommend watching the first two, and possibly the third season."
10.0,3 July 2024,"""The Boys"" initially captivated audiences with its first two seasons, offering a fresh, irreverent take on the superhero genre that was both darkly humorous and thrillingly intense. The show's early success was driven by innovative storytelling, complex characters, and a gritty, unfiltered portrayal of a world dominated by corrupt superheroes.

However, starting with season three, the series began to lose its way. The narrative became less sharp and witty, with some story arcs feeling forced or unnecessary. Despite occasional flashes of brilliance, the overall quality and coherence of the storyline started to falter, leaving many loyal viewers disappointed.

Season four, unfortunately, continues this downward spiral. The latest season struggles to recapture the magic of its earlier years. The plot is increasingly convoluted, and character development takes a backseat to over-the-top spectacle. Instead of delivering the biting satire and character-driven drama that made the series a hit, season four often feels like a hollow imitation of its former self."
10.0,29 March 2020,"I don't care amazon or netflix buy this over. But make more of this soon, can't wait,, can't watch all other crapy super hero series, that you predict miles away. This is entertaining and much more realistic and oh my god the acting and the dialogs are awesome.. Butcher you are super."
10.0,12 October 2022,"Great but it's not a ""dystopian reimagining of a world with superheroes"" it's quite literally an allegory for America and the world as it exists right now. I tried to catch all the major obvious ones. There's a super cool Celeb Supes find Scientology parody in here that's brilliant.

Ironically the people who would normally be crying about how everything is super political and ""woke"" don't understand that lol.

Great material. Fine acting. Predictable, but the journey is the destination and it's a hell of a trip. I don't think there's anything like it on air right now.

If you're looking for straightforward Black comedy with a hint of satire or parody with actual storylines that are interesting, you'll find all that and more here."
9.0,29 September 2022,
9.0,20 July 2019,"'The Boys' is a fantastically written satire that was also the brainchild of the creative genius, Simon Pegg. Karl Urban was the perfect choice for Butcher, with the vocabulary of Negan (The Walking Dead) and the vigilante drive of Paul Kersey (Death Wish). There is so much material to work with that this series could continue for several seasons. Kudos to Seth Rogen and Amazon for bringing this brilliant concept to streaming media!"
10.0,26 July 2019,Even better than i hoped for! Well written. Well acted. Totally worth watching!
7.0,17 October 2022,"Truly an antidote to Marvel and Co.

Having American super heroes forced down our throats 24/7 is so tiring. But out of nowhere comes this gem of a show, which shows us the grimy under belly of being a super hero and its great and liberating, and maybe we can all rethink the role of America in the world.

So yes this is a relief from the never ending train of films this is so much welcome relief. It's not for kids and I love the choice language which is appropriate.

The only reason why I changed it from 10 to 9 is because of Kripke's over fascination with Jensen Ackles - please can someone stop him from taking all his Supernatural cast and placing them in this production."
5.0,6 September 2022,"Now I admit I will be in the minority, but I didn't really like season 2 of the boys. After an excellent season 1. 2 was a stepback. Sure there was a larger scale. But the slow pace, so many flashbacks, so many side stories that divert from the main story. I lost my interest in the season. Only 3, 6 and 8 were the good ones in season 2

Season 1- 9/10 Season 2- 7.5/10

Now let's talk about season 3. What a return back to form. Crazy from the minute go. More violent, intense and gripping than seasons 1 and 2. The addition of the V24 and Jensen Ackles as soldier boy just adds to the fun. Although Ackles enters late, he takes the spotlight the minute he enters

Now, the character development is the most interesting this season. Homelander is crazier than ever. Butcher and Hughie go down a dark path. Starlight taking a huge step against Vought (really, she had enough of them). The deep coming back into the game. A-Train coming to the realization what's it like to watch one's own get hurt. MM's past with soldier boy. Really interesting development

Below are the episodes in season 3 I found best to worst. There is no episode I found bad, it's just the ranking I found them most interesting

Herogasm (without a doubt, the best episode)

Glorious five year plan

The instant white hot wild (yeah, a bit rushed, but definitely not bad as everyone says it is)

The only man in the sky (the ending of this episode, Oh My God!)

The last time to look on this world of lies

Here comes a candle to light you to bed

Barbary coast

Payback

Coming to the performances. Antony Starr went to another level this time. This guy really deserves an emmy for this role. Karl Urban, as delicious as ever, bringing his unique style of saying sarcastic lines. Amazing. Jack Quaid got some really good scenes to shine this season and he did. Erin Moriarty proved why she will always remain the best choice to play starlight. Laz Alonso had the emotional part this season, I think he handled it well.

Always lovely to hear Tomer Capon's French in every season. He doesn't disappoint. Karen Fukuhara really dominates the action scenes. She's a boss! Ackles's Soldier Boy appears late and takes the center stage in the second half. His deep voice really supports in making us believe that he is a force to be reckoned with. Cameron Covetti doesn't get much to do except the last episode. Same goes for Chace Crawford. Jessie T Usher didn't get much screen time to perform what he had to. Others do well in their parts

So. Final word, I thought season 2 was bad and it got me to lost interest in the boys and wasn't really excited to watch season 3 but I decided to give it a try and thank god I did. Just amazing. Without a doubt, the best season for me out of the trio

Season 3- 9.5/10."
9.0,26 July 2019,This show obviously deserves all the praise.also I think marketing team was slow to advertise this one it such a amazing show everyone should give a chance to this series.
10.0,13 July 2024,"This once brilliant show is now like Spider Man 3, the 2007 one.

Every, *single* character is going through an existential crisis that is about as well handled as the oft memed Toby Maguire strut montage. It took bit to realize it was going to be this bad because it was only 1 or 2 of them to start with, evolving over several episodes with inciters that the viewer could see. Every additional character they did it with was handled more poorly until we get MNM's breakdown that comes out of nowhere and relies the most lazy, poorly established shorthand.

It's great when a show can explore trauma in an authentic, human way. There is space for that in shows and it makes them better.

But when it's every character of the *entire* cast and devolves to the level of sophistication of PSAs and children's cartoon? Come on!

And the rest of the show goes the same. The allegory isn't even allegory any more. It was more patent in season 3 and now is completely lacking any nuance or subtlety."
10.0,9 July 2024,"Season 1 and 2 were great and season 3 was pretty good. However, season 4 is garbage :(. Where is the plot? BDSM scenes doesn't move the story. Did season 4 have different writers? It seems like the writers are throwing in nasty and graphic scenes just for shock value. It wasn't that extreme in the first 2 seasons. Season 3 got worse but season 4 is terrible. I lose my appetite watching season 4. This show use to be one of my favorite shows. I don't care for politics so the politics in this show doesn't bother me.

Season 4 doesn't have a strong story. Nasty scene after nasty scene. It was only 1 good episode so far this season. The other episodes are just graphics scenes. This show is basically hardcore BDSM Corn. I am not excited for season 5 after this season. All that hype for nothing. If you are into nasty ""scenes"" then maybe this show is for you."

9.0,29 July 2019,They definitely hit a home run with this one. I've tried to get into their top original shows but I'd always walk away before I could finish for lack of interest. I'm embarrassed to admit how fast I finished this series. If they can keep this up Netflix might have a real contender in the shadows.
10.0,17 September 2021,
10.0,9 August 2021,"Glad I decided to watch it.

It's beautiful, and indeed, if humans had superpowers, something like this would happen."
10.0,26 July 2019,"If you know one, you know them all! That goes for superhero movies and shows from the past decade.

The screen adaption of The Boys comics finally brings a complete different viewing angle to the superhero genre to TV.

I recommend this to everyone who is tired of Disney's family friendly Marvel and post-Nolan DC films. The Boys, Joker and Watchmen - this year seems to bring the long required change."
2.0,22 July 2024,"The Boys really turns the superhero biz inside out. Hilariously disgusting adventures abound, yet there's still a lot of heart to the show. Great characters & character dynamics. Antony Starr as Homelander is brilliant. I really love seasons 1 & 2. Season 3 is also excellent. The vibe is slightly different, but still super enjoyable.

I don't know what to make of season 4. It had been a well balanced show - there were always political parallels but they were more in the background. They gave the show a nice bit of weight without being too in your face. That balance is off in season 4. Also, most of the characters have been given depressing storylines - where did all the fun go?

Half the show feels on-brand & delivers all the craziness, filth & brutality you have come to expect. The other half feels very soap opera-ish with abundant lame blah blah blah. I'm guessing that scripts were rushed through as a result of last year's writers' strike. In the past The Boys would avoid such cliche stuff.

Hopefully things recover in season 5 so The Boys can go out with a great final season!"
9.0,3 August 2019,
10.0,2 November 2020,"Each episode had me hooked, can't wait for season 3 just watch!

All the actors in this did a brilliant job! Great casting!

Watch it!"
10.0,2 August 2019,"I have FINISHED this frickin gem on AMAZON PRIME VIDEO! This show is a must see! It is based on the comic series of the same name by Garth Ennis!

The show follows four men who take it upon themselves to keep Superheroes under control, specifically Vought International's elite team, The Seven.

The Boys:

Karl Urban (you MUST know this Star). He was Eomere in Lord of the Rings: Two Towers, Return of the King, Judge Dredd in Dredd, Vaako in the Riddick Film Series, and Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy in the Star Trek reboot films. A damn good actor, peeps! In this black comedy, he portrays Billy Butcher, the violent leader of The Boys who is willingly to do almost anything to ""spank the people (superheroes who get outta line) back in place"".

Jack Quaid portrays main character Hugh Campbell, who joins team after horrifically witnesses his fiancee killed by one of The Seven and suffers PTSD throughout the first season.

Tomer Kapon as Frenchie, a multi-talented Merc who has a shared history with Butcher as part of the original The Boys time prior to the series's events.

Laz Alonso (Fenix Calderon Fast & Furious 6) as Mother's Milk, the sensible, well spoken, and educated team member. He and Frenchie share a mutual hatred for one another.

Karen Fukuhara as Kimiko / the Female, the mute member of The Boy and their most lethal physical weapon.

The Seven:

Antony Starr plays Homelander, the All-American team leader of The Seven who wants autonomy of his image.

Dominique McElligott as Queen Maeve, long-time member of The Seven experiencing burnout.

Erin Moriarty is Starlight, the newest member of The Seven. Naive, genuine, and heroic.

Jessie T. Usher as A-Train, a speedster of the group who wishes to keep his rep as ""the fastest man alive.""

Chace Crawford as Kevin / The Deep (the Series' Aquaman), the self-absorbed dolt of the team.

Nathan Mitchell is Black Noir, the strong and silent type hero.

Alex Hassell portrays Translucent, a Supe possessing invisibility.

Recurring Characters:

Elisabeth Shue as Madelyn Stillwell, the VP of Vought International.

Simon Pegg (Star Trek, Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz) plays Hugh Campbell, Hughie's dull dad.

This show is amazing from start to finish! It is a Black Comedy Superhero series that explores contemporary issues surrounding media's narrative of celebrities as larger than life icons. Ironically, they're people like us all, who through the pressures/stresses of maintaining their status, make choices that have severe layered consequences on themselves as well as the everyday folk who worship/cross them. The Seven (5 this season) are as developed as The Boys they encounter over the 8 episode arc. Each character expresses a relatable side of humanity (specifically the primitive sides). This is perhaps one of the most grounded, gritty, unrelenting takes on the superhero genre I have seen to date! Two Thumbs WAAAAAAYYYYY UP!! YOU MUST CHECK THIS ONE OUT!"
10.0,24 July 2024,
10.0,15 February 2023,"There have been other shows and movies which have tried to give us a realistic take on superheroes but none of them do it as well as ""The Boys"" does. The Show is dark, violent, gritty and sometimes even humorous. It doesn't pull any punches especially with the amount of violence being displayed. I personally think the shows biggest achievement is bringing in politics and somehow not making it seem forced like most of the shows do nowadays. The Characters are extremely well written and the show has one of the greatest protagonist-antagonist dynamics I have ever seen.

Last but not least, take a bow Anthony Starr. Anthony Starr puts on a terrifying and sometimes a downright disturbing performance as Homelander which is what the character demands. No one else could have played Homelander like he did. In fact the show wouldn't have even 50 percent as good without him. Hats off to him. Homelander will go down as one of the greatest antagonists of all time."
10.0,7 January 2020,"Summary before seasonal reviews:

Most people who are sick of Marvel or have general superhero fatigue will love this show. It's so far outside the norm and satirizes the genre. However, I think the bigtime superhero fans will get the most out of it.

I watch basically everything superhero related, Marvel, DC and other. The Boys gives me another entry in a genre I love, but so different from all the others, while taking numerous jabs at specific movies. There are so many small references that will go unnoticed by most. It makes fun of some of my favorite superhero movies and I eat it all up. Num num num num num ;-)

Season 1: 10 stars (4 viewings, 1/5/2020, 9/2/2020, 5/22/2022, 10/7/2023)

I love this show a lot. I treasure the concept. The characters are fantastic. The humor is extreme. The cast is awesome. NUMEROUS memorable moments. Multiple great emotional moments. Several uncomfortably intense scenes. ""Adore"" really is the best way to describe how I feel about this show. Its only flaw is that the fight scenes are bad with lots of quick cuts and shaky-cam close-ups.

Season 2: 10 stars (3 viewings, 10/9/2020, 5/29/2022, 10/11/2023)

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Everyone involved in making this show, you are so amazing, I love you all. Keep up the good work, and THANK YOU.

There is a scene near the middle of the season involving Homelander that legitimately might be my favorite moment in television history.

Season 3: 10 stars (3 viewings, 7/7/2022, 7/19/2022, 10/19/2023)

I don't even know what to say. No point in listing out what I like. It's everything. It has 2 of my all-time favorite episodes (episodes 2 and 6). There is a scene in episode 6 where I literally couldn't sit down. I watched the entire scene standing up.

Best first 3 seasons of any show ever. I considered making this the second time I give a season 11 stars. And I still might. It feels like a step up from the previous two seasons. Again, THANK YOU.

Season 4: 8 stars (1 viewing, 7/17/2024)

First half of season 4: I could not have been more bummed out. My amazing, beautiful, perfect show is suddenly mediocre. A show satirizing politics and agendas suddenly has politics and agendas. They take one of my favorite characters in Frenchie and absolutely destroy him for no apparent reason. It's unforgiveable.

Second half of season 4: What a sigh of relief. It still doesn't forgive the weak first half, but we're right back to elite-level entertainment. Finishes with two amazing episodes and a beastly conclusion."
9.0,13 June 2024,"We waited two years for this crap? Sage is a terrible actress it looks totally out of place with the other antiheroes. I don't know what they're trying to do with the series but it's going down the toilet fast. I like the first few years of the seasons in the series. This series up to this point is total trash. Sage is terrible, she looks totally out of place, she doesn't look like she belongs here and her dialogue is worse than any other seven. If Amazon wants to kill a series, are they doing a good job home lander should've been killed off the last season this could've been a lot better without him there dragging it on and on and on. For heaven sake's at least put some more comedy in this garbage. Oh, and one more thing, make A-TRAIN join the boys. He is better with them. He's another one who is at this point totally out of place in the series."
8.0,11 June 2021,"Maybe not adhering to the Ennis comic entirely, but a great watch, especially for those who are fed-up with studios blowing good money (that could be used to make something decent) on yet another super-hero franchise. Ironic, I know.

After Misfits, this is probably the best antidote out there."
6.0,31 January 2022,"The show has a very good story, a lot of action and is very fun to watch. The plot twists are litteraly making heads explode. So if you like Action and gore, the boys is perfect for you."
4.0,18 September 2019,
10.0,24 August 2024,"Incredibly well written. Incredibly acted. Incredibly gory.

This is a show with substance, as much as it can appear aloof, comical and even wacky... It can also be serious, gritty, melancholic and even a little romantic. I love every casting, at first I didnt like Hughie, but I've come to realise he was was perfect for that role, and now I cant imagine anyone else doing it that well.

The stories are interesting, sometimes grotesque. Sometimes you're glued to the screen, and sometimes you're absolutely horrified. It's a rollercoaster of a show, and it deserves a lot of love.

Homelanders, Starlight, Translucent, The Deep, Maeve, Lamplighter, and many more casting all really convincingly tell a different story. I really liked Shawn Ashmore as Lamplighter as it's a subtle nod to the 2000's x men trilogy which I also love.

Jensen Ackles as Super Boy was incredible for any Supernatural fans (like me). He played that role incredibly well.

I hope it comes back after season 5 as it really is the best show I've seen in years. The spin-off show is also good."
8.0,2 August 2019,"Nicely done, not for the kids, Karl Urban's accent a bit all-over-the-place but settles down after a couple of episodes."
9.0,22 September 2020,"While season 1 was a breath of fresh air and was simply great, season 2 isn't anywhere near as good. Pretty average so far. Taking it down from 9/10, and it just may go down further, but season 1 remains a must see."
10.0,25 July 2024,"I like the show, but season 4 lost me. It was all over the place. There were things added to the overall storylines in the show that made zero sense. Some of which felt like it was added just to check off a box (like Frenchie's love interest), which to me means you are catering to the political masses rather than going against the grain which this show does in many other areas that get people so triggered in society nowadays.

The back and forth with Butcher being good and bad is getting really old. How long can you keeping doing the same thing with him and think you are telling a good story? I hope season 5 is better, but if season 4 is any indication I don't have much hope for it."
10.0,5 July 2024,"First 2 seasons were great. Season 3 was good. Season 4 is just going downhill in a hurry. The violence and sexual content has always been extreme and even sometimes disturbing, but this season it goes into the disturbing realm more and more and for no real reason aside from perhaps shock value or cheap laughs. Not only that, but the plot and characters for the most part seem to be going in circles or scattered feeling with little real sense of purpose save for maybe some aspects (don't want to give spoilers).

I believe they are another show that's sacrificing quality content for political narrative and personal interests. There was an element of this in the early seasons but it was much more subtle and wasn't the focal point like it has now become. Maybe if they had some more of the principles of the side they're bashing they would have more viewers because I know I'm not the only one getting put off by their grotesque violence and disturbing sexual content. It's starting to make GoT look wholesome.

Funniest part if all is that the shows writer has stated that his concern is that as a country we simply see opposing political parties as immediate enemies and then goes and creates a season like this."
10.0,26 August 2019,"Love the show, best thing on Prime for a good while, but I'm at episode 7 and want to eat my own ears after hearing the english accent mangled by Urban again with an ""Aaahllo, ahllo, ahllo, wot ah we got ere den ay? wosh yeore naahme schweetaaaht?""

As a Kiwi, he should be ashamed if himself as it sounds more Australian than anything.

I thought i could get over it but i can feel my inner ear actually trying to strangle itself to death right now, either that or its trying to take over my brain to make me change channels...

I cut it a deal and wrote this."
8.0,12 October 2024,
9.0,10 August 2019,"This film is not a parody nor your typical superhero tv show... Somebody managed to come up with a brilliant idea to show the essence of Hollywood/Instagram celebrities through a prism of superhero stars... Everything that is portrayed in this Tv show is in fact our reality that we created ourselves glorifying Holywoood stars ... Evil Megacorporations brainwashing everyone, pretending they care about someone but it's all about making profits ""Disney"", ""Marvel"" etc... Yes, it's Justice league, but that's what it would be like in reality we live in... And don't forget american patriotism - because USA is best, starting with the cape of ""Homelander"" and finishing with his speeches, this show parodies everything that is wrong with USA patriotism. American patriotism starts to look like fascism, and that is what USA looks like to the rest of the world, brilliant show 9/10 ..."
7.0,2 October 2020,"Don't get me wrong, I love the Avengers and I'd love Justice League if they had writers and a director but this show is something else. It seems to me that a lot of people, including me, binge watched it when they found it and for a reason, it's a crazy ride. And the other thing I really like is the casting. Not one actor out of place! I loved Karl Urban before but now he has the ""always a win"" title for me (CinemaWins fans know what I'm talking about). I did not know Antony Starr before but he is such a great Antisuperman, but really, everybody, good job."
8.0,9 October 2020,"Since Breaking Bad or GOT (bad ending), people were looking for a good show like this. Interesting, intelligent, and really well written.

Primevideo's best choice after Fleabag."
9.0,5 June 2022,"I think everyone loves this show if you like superhero films but I watch it for Home Lander, hands down the best super villain ever made, so well acted!"
10.0,28 October 2020,"This show is hilarious, serious, dramatic, and fun all at the same time. Nothing I can think of mixes tones with this degree of skill. All of the characters are believable and interesting. Can't wait to see the story conclude."
10.0,23 May 2021,"We all have always watched many super hero shows and movies where there is a general assumption that super-heroes are gonna protect people and save them form the evil. But its DIFFERNET in THE BOYS! Super Heroes are corrupt and a group of men (the boys) take charge to bring a change in how people see their so called super heroes. The show involves a lot of abusive language but I think its fine as the intensity is almost every time high . The show is dark in a way, but the viewers will definitely enjoy as its gets more and more INTENSE."
9.0,5 January 2023,"The concept is great - what if our 'superheroes' weren't really heroes at all? What if they're just like us? Well, they're way worse.

The show is funny. Lots of quirky, clever, and laugh-out-loud scenes. There are, however, many over-the-top, outlandish and vile scenes that go too far. I'm not too keen on shows that use shock value to draw in viewers and this show has a lot of them.

With that aside it's an interesting take on how we generally view superheroes. What is the gist of the show? Imagine a below-average person: overly emotional, bad habits unchecked, and a slew of addictions. Take a bunch of them, give them superpowers, and throw them in positions of power and authority...

You'll quickly see how messy and funny this can get. It's very comedic and refreshing to see something not commonly done before. Again, it's often pushed too far that you lose relatability and sensibility. It's like watching a bunch of degenerate X-Men mutants partying together and that's my weakest point of the show. More world building and character building and less shock value is needed."
9.0,24 June 2024,"I LOVED this show, I had previously given it 9 stars, but her comes season four, off to a good start then POW, in my face with, well, you know. UNBELIEVEABLE. I am done with that already. I mean ok but do not keep rubbing it in everyone's face. Please. I am not going to watch the show anymore. Iam sure that I am not the only one that stops watching. STOP ruining all the amazing shows and movies with your choices. I wonder when or if this will stop being rubbed in our lives and our children's lives. Their have been so many shows ruined now because of it. I do not believe that I need to say it. I am pretty sure that any one person reading this will know exactly what I am referring to. Can we please start having a show without the crap that is not for everyone. Thanks!"
9.0,3 January 2021,
6.0,20 August 2022,"The Boys: not for everyone. Some of the goriest, most violent & vulgar TV ever produced. But wow is it good. The writing, vfx, and acting are all top notch (Anthony Starr in particular). S3 had the best episode ever, & some of the best build up... which was promptly thrown out the window in the finale.

Nonetheless for me S1 scored a 9/10, s2 a 9.6/10, and S3 a 9.2. Highly recommended *if* you can stomach ultra gore in the name of dark comedy. A+"
10.0,3 August 2019,"This show has the potential to be another gem such as GOT or Breaking Bad. The acting is superb, the humour hits perfectly at every point, and the directing/writing is a refreshing twist on the superhero/antihero theme. I am a massive marvel fan, but I must say I wish that they would forget the family friendly brand for a movie other than dead pool and take on a project such as this. This show hits perfectly on every level, and the season finale is one of the best I have ever seen, wrapping up a intricate plot while still leaving questions on the table and having you wanting more. 10/10, keep up the great work Amazon, more like this please"
10.0,8 July 2022,
9.0,26 August 2024,"Ridiculously good series. It´s like your favourite Guy Richie movie, only with superheroes. A pinch of Watchmen, a pinch of Kring´s Heroes. Only gorier, even more dystopian AND, well, better.

The fact that so much of the plot is happening right now in front of our eyes, in the real world of US politics, only adds to the genius of this show.

The depiction of the right wing lunatics of America feels especially spot on. Goodness, how I´ve laughed.

Antony Starr´s performance as Homelander is second to none. None I tell you. Those facial expressions! He IS a psychopath. Haven´t seen this kind of 100% in- character since the glory days of Al Pacino. Just stellar. (Imagine Trump with a brain and superpowers. Gives me the chills.) There isn´t a single bad performance from any of the other casts, either. I thought for a while that ""the English element"" of Carl Urban´s Butcher might have been a bit over the top, but no. He is exactly who the show needs him to be, and he is absolutely brilliant.

Now, go make movies like this, please!

P. S This is a 9/10 from me because of all the X- rated stuff, especially Love Sausage. I can´t watch this with my girlfriend :)."
9.0,20 August 2021,"Definitely love how this just jumps right into the conflict of the story, and I really like the character arcs made in this show, it makes em feel very fleshed out with multiple flaws and all. I also really like how they were very meta with Vought."
8.0,22 September 2020,
9.0,4 March 2022,"Absolutely fantastic. I like how it's more realistic, dark, lots of humour, covers complex social issues and is highly entertaining. Los of action and gore."
9.0,30 January 2022,"I've watched a lot of TV, but never something as well written and executed as The Boys. I genuinely struggle to find a flaw (except maybe Karl Urban's questionable accent) but that's just nitpicking. The writing and dialogue is quick witted and humorous, but also steady and intelligent. The special effects and CGI are both incredible, and make some of the most creative and well executed gory deaths I've seen on TV. The acting is whatever it needs to be at any given time, whether that's funny, heartbreaking or outright terrifying. Antony Starr gives what should be an Emmy winning performance as Homelander, and every character is excellently developed and captivating to watch. The show is visually stunning and has an incredible plot, with great pacing that keeps you hooked. This isn't even my favourite show, but I have to admit that it is objectively the best TV show I've ever seen."
8.0,1 August 2020,"Rather unique, excellent character development, and gripping flow. Homelander and Billy Butcher stand out as the leads. Having binge watched it, waiting for Season 2."
6.0,22 August 2021,"I was not expecting this at all! This series is a wonderful twist on the superhero cliche. The ""villain"" is very well written, and all the characters are very complicated and interesting. And the effects are very very very good and kind of disturbing. It also is like very funny!

I totally recommend this series and everyone who can handle the harsh comedy and disgusting visuals should absolutely watch it!!"
10.0,23 December 2020,"Found season 2 a lil boring I dunno. Episodes felt long, was just ok."
9.0,30 December 2020,Well even the thought of superheroes getting bad is great and I dont know much about the comic.But the show is great!
10.0,9 October 2020,I think a few reviewers should have actually finished the season before commenting. The final episode was unreal. Can't wait for Season 3
9.0,4 August 2019,"Oh, WOW. Just finished THE BOYS, Season 1. While it's not perfect, it's thoroughly interesting, funny in a dark way, original by means of DC-lore & I'd say: Yo, Joe! and contains full frontal male nudity...in a comic book show. Yeah, I'm on board. Everyone was great, but gotta give it up for the always impressive, deep and fun Elisabeth Shue. Still not sure why it's called ""The Boys,"" but I am completely stoked for Season 2. I mean...you kinda have to be with how this ended. Cheers, mate!"
9.0,12 July 2024,"Season 1: Wow, this is good! Antony Starr, Karl Urban, and Erin Moriarty absolutely crush it. Must-watch TV.

Season 2: Same energy, even better acting! Starr, Urban, and Moriarty hit it out of the park again, and Claudia Doumit joins the A-list. Still a must-watch.

Season 3: Took a tumble, but Starr and Doumit are unstoppable. It's good, but not season 1 or 2 good.

Season 4: Imagine watching CNN in a hospital gown. That's this season. Super political, one-sided, the complete opposite of what made the show great. Starr and Doumit are still phenomenal (Starr truly embodies Homelander now!), but Erin Moriarty and MM look rough.

I was holding out for a season finale redemption, but for me, this is where the story ends (S04E07)."
8.0,27 July 2019,"To be honest, I'm an easy person to get bored watched TV series,but for this one, i really enjoyed it, each episode made me addicted to continue watched it. The story was unpredictable and the character was amazing with the great actor who played it. I think i'm totally ready for season 2!!!"
9.0,20 February 2023,"First off, this isn't for kids. Themes of rape, some gorry scenes and drug taking. But it isn't excessive. I mean, it's a group of guys that have been wronged by superheroes that are taking vengeance. The characters and character interactions are great. There are moderately complex story lines that out the characters in difficult situations emotionally. Even the awful superheroes start to reveal a human side. Underlying plot original and interesting. Need to see if Season 2 can do what season 1 achieved.

You'll love this if you're tired of suoerhero movies, cos this isn't one. Also if you like action, character development and moderate scifi like story line. Try out first episode and see!"
10.0,18 August 2024,"If you're looking for something that completely flips the superhero genre on its head, *The Boys* is the show to watch. I went into it expecting another typical superhero series, but what I got was something far more intense, dark, and surprisingly real.

The characters are what really hooked me. They're so flawed and human, even the ones with powers. Karl Urban as Billy Butcher is just awesome-he's rough around the edges, but you can't help but root for him. And Homelander? Easily one of the scariest villains I've seen in a long time because he's so unpredictable and disturbingly charismatic.

The show does a great job of mixing brutal action with moments that make you think about the world we live in. It's not just about superheroes punching bad guys; it dives into issues like corporate greed and the dangers of hero worship. It's dark, it's funny, and it's super smart.

Honestly, The Boys isn't like any other superhero show out there. It's got a ton of twists and turns that keep you guessing, and it's not afraid to go places that are uncomfortable or shocking. If you're tired of the usual superhero stuff, this is definitely worth checking out."
7.0,31 July 2021,"I think this series is the best to portray if there are real people with superpower in real live. It has darker theme than DC yet still funny like Marvel movies.

The first season is 10/10 for me. Yes the second season isn't as good, but still great. In the second season they reveal more secrets that was kept in first season. So in a way it feels slower. And there's some unnecessary plot, but maybe if they will make third season there's an explanation for this.

And I think people misunderstood the second season. They complaint about the series were forcing SJW agenda. Or forced LGBT theme, white power, etc. They missed the point. This series is actually exposing about how things work. It's all about money.

Here we see Superheroes, but they were just a pawn for big company. They don't care who you are, what your feeling, what your sex reference as long as you make money for them.

I just wondering what will they bring again if this series get third season. Because almost all major problem are solved. I hope they will be as good."
9.0,11 September 2021,"This show idea got my attention at first but you know what else did? The first scene, episode, season and now it's my fav tv series up to date, season 1 was great we get to know the superheroes (homelander) huray to him he carried the show alongside Butcher & hughie, a shocking ending that made season 2 exceptional in all means especially the third and last episode, can't wait for season 3."
8.0,3 November 2020,"A no-holds-barred show about superheroes who are superjerks who work for a soulless mega-corporation. And a small band of normal individuals set on taking down the superheroes and/or their employer, Vought. It's crazy, it's insane, it's fantastic.

I do have a love hate relationship with the show, but you have to have a significantly hateable antagonist to have a rooting interest. For me, there are/were two very loathsome antagonists, a few unlikeable characters (both good guys and bad), and a few very likeable characters. It's a good balance, there's something for everyone."
10.0,27 August 2024,
9.0,27 August 2024,"This is probably the only time you could fathom comparing a superhero show to another, normal show. I get immediately that seems a bit weird. There's not been many superhero live action projects as of recent or at least not a variety. Marvel with their Disney money put out a lot of stuff before, but are slowing down when they realise they can't really rival their back catalogue with absolutely dreadful writers.

So I haven't really watched any superhero projects as of recent that I've liked. I was immediately skeptic of the Boys as an uber-violent show and I didn't quite fancy it. I feared it would be, much like the work Garth Ennis produced in the comics, a good excuse for a lot of bloodbaths and edgy revenge storylines. Now I'm not saying this isn't partially in the show, especially in the immediate, but Erik Kripke and co. Have produced something a lot more with such a simple concept which could've been wasted on plotless blood spilling.

The concept of the Boys is simple. Supes are real, and they're everywhere. All superheroes are owned by the private multinational Vought Industries. As a result, Vought are the richest company in the world. Products, media coverage, movie franchises, everything is this one capitalist dystopia where a single company is a government sized power with massive influence. Vought have an Avengers, the Seven, headed by Homelander, a character not unlike Superman.

So we have this world which draws parallel with DC and Marvel. So what? What good does that do us? Well it's the GTA V to your SimCity. The world is messed up, superheroes are all corrupt, and the system is flawed. As a result, next to the massive evil industry tycoon and their superpower cronies, we allow ourselves to make any character who stands against them redeemable enough in the initial, motives and values aside.

This is where the show starts in season 1 - a group of social outcasts, miscreants and muscle trying to take revenge on the society that left them in awkward positions. Hughie Campbell, the protagonist is the most redeemable, however we see even he becomes more comfortable with ruthless action to stop the society around him.

This is the season 1 and 2 plot to a tee without any major spoilers - living in the dark, hiding from supes, blackmail, murder, all paralleled with the thuggish actions of the company who are supposed to be on the side of the good guys. This formula of revenge could start to be repetitive, but every season different core issues are tackled and different new variables come into play. With good writing, some of the best acting performances I've seen in a long time from an original show in its own separate sci-fi universe.

I feel however where the show really takes off is season 3 and 4. Now a lot of people say 4 is the worst season of the show. Take it from me, who watched the whole show in the last 3 weeks: it's not. At all. The concept still feels fresh, the ideas are great, there are just notable differences in tone and pace to season 3 which had the most action.

Season 3 and 4 move on from the revenger ideas and move more to explore the concept of superior life forms and the potential influence they could have on politics, the divisions they could form and the consequences of allowing them too many freedoms. It throws these ideas at all different angles with different powers: superheroes in plain sight, super-intelligence, you name it they've done stuff with it. And the show becomes more comfortable in the comedic value of some of its characters. It was great in the first 2 seasons but in the third season the show truly starts to understand what it wants to end on and we see this goal being progressed towards. Character growth is non-linear, with characters seeming to veer in one direction then being set on a completely different path, and I think this is what really makes the show entertaining, in that you physically cannot predict all the ridiculous ideas the superhero concept has never even attempted.

The show is a witty mockery of both society and superhero films. The satire is top notch and the enjoyability isn't ruined by concepts. Quite the contrary. The concepts define the show and its entertainment. It's a show so self aware of what it shouldn't be that it actively inserts what it could've been into the Vought TV channels and movies.

Overall, a 10/10. The only thing which may hold you back is the contents of the show. Definitely read the age advisory if you're not a fan of gore, violence or explicit content."

8.0,1 July 2020,"I do a few days from now until September. If you read this review after witnessing the second season, I know that my expectations are very high for him, it will be one of the best seasons, and if I hit my expectations, all you have to do is like"
6.0,15 October 2024,What a show.. ahahjhhhhhhggg I'm just going home and I'm not going back in the office today so I'm not going home tomorrow I just want you know so you know I'm gonna go to bed and get some sleep and I will call me when you're ready love and I will text me if you're not too late I will talk tomorrow I will text when I'm on the road I will text and let me see if you can get me some food or whatever you need I will call and let me and then tyttttttyy The only way I could do that was if you had to do a little more work and I would be happy with it but you have a hard day and you don't want me working on your.
8.0,12 August 2021,"Cracking TV show, and definitely what would actually happen if humans ever got super powers! And how good is Urban as the Butcher! I can't keep the grin off my face when he's in a scene! Only just started season 2 but loving every minute!"

9.0,21 September 2019,"What can I say, it shines a light on o society issues. But is showing how the world would be like if we did have Super Heros..not everyone would be a Saint or have the morals, let's just be real. However, very entertaining and definitely has a dark side. I thoroughly enjoyed it and am wondering how Season 2 would play out. Definitely worth binge watching and trust that there will be plenty of WTF moments. lol"
9.0,11 June 2020,"Truly a dark dystopia. So awful (world, not the show itself) that I couldn't look away."
8.0,28 July 2024,"This was no doubt a nine / ten star show throughout the first two-two and a half seasons. It was nearly perfect! It had Everything you could possibly want for a series with this type of premise in my opinion,,,from the writing, directing, acting, casting, originality, storytelling, mood, setting, etc...etc.... And then came the (inevitable) WAY OVER THE TOP obvious and extreme politically motivated and biased stereotyping nonsense.. I've come to expect a subtle level of left leaning political spin in most of today's TV entertainment, and most of it is easy to ignore for the sake of enjoying a series or movie. But when it becomes the obvious primary narrative with an obvious flat out dishonest agenda, it completely destroys the ability to look past it and to simply enjoy the show.

You'd think Hollywood would have learned its lesson by now after numerous shows tanking and losing ten of millions of dollars?"
9.0,26 May 2021,"A really unique and entertaining show. It's well paced and the characters are excellent. What I especially like is that the relationships between the characters feel very realistic, making you that much more invested in them.

My only big complaint is that the second season wasn't on par with the first. A solid 9/10 for the first season, which is lowered to a 7.5/10 for the second season."
9.0,12 September 2019,"The is a story about amazing super hero who have 2 sides and the show is funny ,action pact I loved it"
9.0,14 November 2020,"Fantastic series with many unexpected twists and turns. Dark undertoned characters lending to a fresh approach to a new wave of comical theatrics. Definitely lingering right on the edge of acceptable viewership but hey,thats what makes this series so entertaining!"
6.0,1 August 2019,"When i first saw the trailer and all the promotion on IGN and Screenjunkies, i was kinda underwhelmed. I expected it to be some dark slapstick comedy, but instead i found an amazing and compelling show that shows the dark side of superheroes (with ofcourse a few 'laugh out loud' moments) that is not only action packed but also tackles major real-life problems."
1.0,18 April 2021,"Not what I expected, but was a good watch! Refreshing take on the heroes things we've had a lot of lately."
9.0,8 January 2020,"The Boys was a strong series right until the last episode. Its very funny, painting super heros as humans just as flawed as anyone else. This is the niche in the genre The Boys serves. There has been other movies such as Super, Special that focused on flawed super heros, or individuals who believed they were super heros but were not. The Boys strength is the funny way they paint the super heros personalities, as its a far more likely scenario, in the real world, than the good and evil fantasy characters usually represent. Its as if the plot was right under our noses all along. Pity I didnt come up with that one."
8.0,1 August 2019,"Very different atmosphere compared to the ideal superhero persona in movies and TV. Interesting storyline as characters are evolving throughout the show. The reason I am giving it a 9 out of 10 is because of the expectation for a little bit more action and the storyline is kind of ideal for drama series. Need something out of the blue and not so much expected.

However, this TV show is something not seen before on television. Amazon Prime's masterpiece comparable to Bosch and Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan. Would recommend watching it."
9.0,3 August 2019,"Great concept executed so well. I loved this from the moment it started and I only paused once to eat and shower. It would have got 10 stars if it wasn't for one of my pet dislikes, a bizarre London accent. Karl Urban's weird Kiwi/London accent made me cringe with every line he uttered. He joins Johnny Depp, Elijah Wood, Don Cheedle and, Charlie Hunnam in my London accent hall of shame."
9.0,9 October 2020,"It's sad to see another great show taking a nosedive in quality because of hamfisted attempts at being topical and ""relevant"". I consider myself to be a liberal in most regards, however, the 2nd season was often unbearable to watch because of the way the writers tried to shoehorn as many liberal talking points as possible into one season. I was never able to really immerse into the story because the show reminded me of current day politics at every turn in a very heavy-handed way. It had everything: White supremacy, bad white incels, alt-right memes and the power of Twitter, anti-immigration propaganda, Islamophobia, and ""America first"" rhetoric, literal Nazis, homophobia, feminism on steroids - girls kicking ass while the The Boys stand by and watch, toxic masculinity by bad fathers contrasted by loving and caring mothers, potshots at privatized health care, an Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez-like character etc. The only thing missing at the end of the season was ""I'm Joe Biden and I approve this message""."
10.0,6 July 2024,"I've watched both The Boys and Invincible. After going through several episodes of season 4, I've realized that The Boys is simply Hollywood's fetishes put on screen. I've no desire for this. I was actually interested in a storyline about supposed ""super heroes"" that were flawed. Invincible is a better story.

Season 1 had a good setup and story. However, it seems like they are more interested in shock value than good content. Exploring the idea of super humans that are flawed is interesting to me. What they've added to each season has gotten progressively worse and more disgusting. I'm not interested in what gets these writers and directors off.

In summary: I've gone through Seasons 1 - most of 4. Each season has gotten progressively worse. So I'm out."
9.0,3 January 2020,"Ever wonder what the world would be like if super heroes actually existed? Well it's not cute, it's not all roses and it's not for kids.

If you're tired of the typical Marvel, Disney and Pixar stuff but still want super heroes, this is the show for you. It's very dark, funny, the characters are flawed and 'real' and in the end you're not sure if the good guys are actually the bad guys or vice versa. It's kinda depressing actually, and that's what makes it so refreshing.

Finally, fantasy content for mature viewers without the cute Disney nonsense getting in the way."
9.0,30 September 2019,"First, the bad: The Boys suffers from a bit of mid-season wonkiness, the music is often just ""ok,"" and you can tell where the producers had to save some money by slowing things down, particularly with one of the character's story arcs later in the season.

Now, the good: WOW! What s great change of pace from other comic book shows and movies. Like others on here, I've been ""super hero-ed"" out with the films and TV shows as of late (looking at you, Marvel), and many of those had been becoming predictable. Not so with this. You're in for a messy, vulgar, and unpredictable ride.

If you haven't read the comics or don't know to much about the show other than trailers, do yourself a favor and just start watching it!"
9.0,14 September 2019,"Wow! What a show! Really refreshing to see a dark superhero series, I've grown up being a fan of superhero shows and just been bored recently with how cheesy a lot of them have become.

This was dark, gory, funny and fast paced with foul language and great characters. Can't wait for the next season!

Only reason I didn't give this a 10/10 was Simon Peggs character, accent was off and I'm just not a fan of his acting skills."
6.0,3 August 2019,"As a huge Marvel fan, I find this to be a hilarious and welcome relief. The language is colorful and funny, but never over the top. It all adds to the environment of the show, and it's great. Also, I may have the tiniest crush on Karl Urban and I will watch anything he is in."
1.0,26 July 2019,"Don't think about it.... Just watch it!

Tale as old as time but watched through a mirror!"
10.0,16 June 2024,"Another one bites the dust. I'll keep my previously given rating of 9 for the sake of the first 3 seasons, but i'll always remember episode 2 of season 4 as the one that made me stop watching this series, as much as I used to like it. Previous three seasons were awesome, clever, funny, bold, entertaining, shocking. All that was replaced by boring, disturbing and most of all, disgusting. Ep. 1 was already much below my expectations but I decided to carry on and give it a chance to redeem itself, but far from it. It only got worse in ep. 2. Whoever watches this episode will probably guess at which particular scene I just had to turn it off because of how unnecessarily disgusting it was. Final note to the producers: there is a fine line between shocking and disgusting and you just crossed it.

0 out of 0 found this helpful."
10.0,13 November 2021,"This show very accurately shows what superheroes would be like in our modern society. All about social media and the outlook of the hero instead of actually saving people. Despite superheroes not existing, it feels very accurate. I love the characters and actors a lot, especially Homelander played by Anthony Starr, who is my favorite character.

Season 1 is fantastic and season 2 is also great, but not as good.

This show really does feel like one of those shows that everyone should see because of the heavy amount of amazing moments. They also curse a lot. A lot a lot. But I think it works pretty much every time they use a curse word."
10.0,9 November 2020,"An excellent series that gave a new look to the superheroes. Homelander presented an excellent villain, unlike the rest of the seven with Black Noir. As for the boys, they were excellent, prepared Hughie. It was very bad. I really enjoyed watching the series."
9.0,23 July 2024,"I've watched all four Seasons now: Season one was good as it was fresh and new, two was ok and then it started to slide downhill from there. The series has it's characters stuck in a perpetual cycle, they make some progress and then they get slapped back down to start the cycle again. Which is fine and works for a bit but by season 4 it's feeling bit long in the tooth.

The gore throughout is somewhat over the top, the humour in places is just puerile relying on getting the most offensive words out just for shock but again by season 4 it's wearing a bit thin. Some of the jokes land but, honestly most of them feel like they were written by someone far too obsessed with reproductive organs and sexual acts.

I like to watch things to experience another reality of sorts, a fictional world with new dynamics however Season 4 seemed very blunt in drawing many parallels with real-world America (I'm not American and I don't even live there) which ruined bits for me. I want to know about the fictional world of ""The Boys"" not some champagne-socialists' world-view. This coupled with some bizarre character changes/decisions that come out from left-field and a fairly weak story left Season 4 on a fairly low-note. I'm not even remotely excited for the next season.

At most, given it's trajectory, it's got one season left where it should close out the storyline. Anymore and it's just going to be a boring rinse-and-repeat cycle of the main characters going over the same ground and everyone is just going to be bored of it."
10.0,23 June 2024,They started so good. Everyone loved this show including me. Season 3 was so good but that's the thing it should have ended at season 3. They are dragging the story too much just for the sake of making 5 seasons. Season 4 is the most boring season of The Boys. Half of the season is done and it is the boring thing I ever watched. And this is after waiting for 2 years for the season to release. It seems like in Season 4 they have forgot the main storyline of the show that is Billy Bitcher's revenge with homelander and The Boys' mission to kill homelander. Why would they fill the 4th season with so much political drama which no one is interested in. Come on it's supposed to be a superhero show. Show us some action. Some fights between normal humans and the superheroes. We should be at the edge of our seats while watching this not snoring throughout the episode.
10.0,30 July 2019,This is the exact thing Jessica Jones was trying to do but done the right way. What living with superheroes would actually be like. Absolute love this comes with flaws but nothing is perfect. Completely recommend also love the supporting cast of characters some big named actors.
10.0,26 July 2019,"I've just finshed Episode 1 and it was so amazing!

No wonder why amazon were so confidenct to announce Season 2 upfront.

If you're looking for something new in a superhero movie or you are ant-super heros you'll definitely enjoy it."
8.0,11 June 2021,"Seems to be really hitting it's stride with season 2. After the UK series of Misfits this has to be the best tongue in cheek bunch super-c__ts.

As Butcher would say, 'all those pompous, eye-liner wearing, emo tw__ts who moan about series 2 can go hide back in their Nazi cellars'."
7.0,21 October 2020,"Having literally closed my browser on the final episode of season 2 I am so happy that this series is holding up the high standard set in Season 1.

It's gory, funny, full of in fighting and I am not sure there is a weak character in it, some are superflous (get it?) sure, but the key cast all do exemplory jobs.

The script is tight, the action is short, sharp and hard hitting in more ways than one.

Overall though, it is the plotline that has surprised me. I really did wonder where they could take this 'sup universe' but so far, so (insert Billy Butcher explitive) good.

Not for kids and unashamedly so! Keep up the good work!"
4.0,27 July 2019,"I anticipated a simple satire show making fun of the way we celebrate the idea of superheroes. Well, I was wrong. Instead I got a funny, gripping series filled with dozens of 'WTF' moments. In the end I sat down to watch the first episode und stood up when I finished the last."
10.0,2 June 2022,"This is one of the best shows of all time. It's something you've never seen before, which is tough to do these days. Every character is likable, even when you don't like them. Home lander is the perfect villain, there's something charming about him in a twisted sociopathic way. Stormfront was a good villain too, the actress did a fantastic job playing her. The second season was a little too political, but at least they made light of it. I have to fast forward some of the gore scenes, and they throw the F word in every other sentence. But I still love this show and consider it one of my favorites. I've seen a couple reviews complain about Hugie, I like Hugie. He adds balance to a dark comedy. I highly recommend this show, if you can get past abundance of gore."
8.0,20 August 2019,"One of the coolest anti hero series ever! Beautifully filmed especially in 4K and entirely well acted! So much fun, brutal, epic soundtrack, and very intriguing throughout; I'd recommend this to anyone! Easily top best shows to me!"
8.0,6 June 2022,
10.0,24 April 2022,"Season 1 starts strong. Highly original, lots of action, Season 2 is a jumbled mess and adds lots of unnecessary politics. Disappointing because of how much promise season 1 showed."
9.0,18 July 2024,"The first season was something new, different, funny, scary, thought provocing and well written. How war this series has fallen since that. Season four is a cheap copy where characters are shallow, the story rushed and predictable and th script focused soly and sex jokes. Everything happens top quick leaving now room for credible character growth where many of them (the deep) are just there for cpmic relief. Where is this story even going besides trying to be an edgy commentary of society? Amazon and these incompetent writers have taken what they thought worked to an extreme and made a grown up series into a bloody immature kid's show. Sad."
10.0,13 August 2019,"The Boys is so fun. Prime Video has killed it and how. When superheroes are actually supervillains in disguise, it is up to the oh so ordinary people to show what it takes to be a hero. The superhero genre has been fantastically turned on its head. Bravo!"
9.0,20 April 2021,"There are several hundred people in America with supernatural powers, led by The Seven, a team of the seven most famous, who operate under the powerful and all-pervading corporation Vought. The official purpose of this corporation is to take care of superheroes and perform logistical work related to their heroic deeds, but the corporation as a corporation is concerned primarily with profit, and the lives of their Supes are reduced primarily to PR and marketing, commercials, and superhero movies. And when, here and there, they set aside some time to fight crime and terrorism, ""Vought"" is there to cover up the collateral damage. However, some people refuse to accept that they are collateral damage, so they organize into a guerrilla unit, a kind of resistance movement, with the goal of exposing the true faces of selfish and arrogant superheroes and overthrowing the all-powerful corporation that has risen above of the law.

In essence, ""The Boys"" is a satire of the corporate system and society in which the individual is nothing and the flow of money is everything, presented in the form of a parody of the superhero genre and its rising popularity. Genre-wise, the series is a black-humored action thriller, explicitly vulgar, violent, and bloody. Over-the-top gorefest, spiced with just enough drama and romance to give it an emotional note and allow us to connect with the characters. Superheroes are diverse and I think there is a counterpart in the DC and Marvel universes for each of them. The parallels are obvious enough for an effective parody, and they differ just enough that the series does not risk a copyright lawsuit. Consistent with this, the other, non-superhero characters are clichéd, but they have a good enough characterization to be convincing and enough originality and variety not to be boring.

Karl Urban plays Billy Butcher, a seemingly intimidating, ruthless, cold-blooded vigilante who will not rest until the last superhero is dead. But when you get to know him a little better, his hard face, with a combination of macho attitude and British accent, will quickly charm you. Jack Quaid plays a nerd who does not know what hit him. Here we have someone to identify with, and to show us that each of us, no matter how we feel insignificant, can make a difference if his heart is in the right place. There's also Frenchie, my favorite character in the series. Israeli actor Tomer Capon, with a perfect fake French accent, plays a charming expert in weapons, drugs, and improvisation and, as he says himself, ""the troubled teenager of the group"".

The series is full of various characters, and I didn't list even the leading ones. I stayed on these three because they left the strongest impression on me. It's up to you to see the show and maybe get attached to some completely different ones. I believe that there is something for everyone. It's not a masterpiece of television and may not even enter the top 100 TV series in terms of quality, but for those who, like me, have long been tired of movies that cover up shallowness with special effects and visual spectacle, ""The Boys"" brings more than a touch of freshness to the superhero genre.

8/10."
9.0,4 August 2019,"This is one of the best show I have seen in a long time. The cast of this show is amazing especially Butcher, Hugh and Homelander. Every episode is amazing with some or more surprises. The ending of the show is great with some expected and unexpected turns. Also the Vfx and graphics of the show are good. Waiting for 2nd season now. I hope the quality of the show doesn't decline."

9.0,26 July 2019,"I only found out about this show a week before release, and was intrigued, but not hyped. However, after giving the first episode a shot I was hooked and practically binged the entire season.

Hoping for more of this kind of quality in other shows. Definitely curios to see where they take it in season 2!"
10.0,1 August 2019,As someone who has watched multiple superhero shows from MARVEL Netflix to CW to DC universe shows.. the Boys is a very welcome addition to that and it entirely upends the superhero genre. I think the boys is actually one of the most realistic shows out there. It's not inconceivable that multi national corporations might wanna manage superheroes for their profit and superheroes might not be so good also and may have multiple flaws.. So.. Absolutely amazing show.. a must watch for any superhero fans out and others.
10.0,3 August 2019,"For people who like to watch dark stuffs, this show is for them.

So this is not your average, typical superhero story where the heroes come and save the world rather it tells you the story of how they deal with their power and all the perks (!) that come with it. Its also about the people who deals with the casualties these superhero stuffs bring to their lives. The pilot would hook you right away. Casting was amazing too. Carl Urban talks with an accent and you get used to it with time.

I am giving it a 9 cause I think they have more potential to make it better while bringing out season 2. Overall, this was a great watch."
8.0,6 October 2020,"Really liked the Season-1. Season-1 was a fresh take on Super heroes. It was fresh/ irreverent/ funny/ violent/ sexy. There seemed to be a purpose to the story which was engaging. I was looking forward to watching Season-2. But Season-2 turned out to be a very big disappointment. I have never seen a show degenerate so fast in its second season. Whatever components made Season-1 so good, the writers of Season-2 made sure they don't exist anymore. The writing seems to be all over the place. It NOT funny and irreverent anymore. There is a huge element of political correctness injected into the show. Very disappointing. I am going to stop watching this."
10.0,2 August 2019,
10.0,31 August 2024,"This is a series that mixes so many great elements, that I can hardly explain it to my friends. Would I tell them: listen , it's a great series, give it a go, that would not do right to the series. When I tell them this is a 9, then I need to really come up with a great description. And tough I want to : it's hardly possible. So , this is a series you suddenly find yourself watching. That you don't talk about a lot: until someone drops in the name and often, it's unexpected people that turn out to watch it. One thing is for sure: do you like this series, and you meet people who do also: you share something very special. And will be the best advisors for future watch suggestions (and you for them)"
10.0,25 September 2019,"None of the media synopses I read before clicking ""Play"" really captured what was to come. As a frame of reference, I found it closer to Deadpool than anything else I can come up with in its irreverence and humor. But unlike Deadpool you'll find yourself invested in the bad guys too, caring about how they came to be that way and sometimes rooting for them. For me, the standout performance was that of the actor that plays Homelander, Antony Starr, the lead Superhero. He's dissolute, petty, scary, sarcastic as hell, smart and sad. I thought Starr's commanding performance gave us all of that and really lit up the screen (sometimes literally) whenever he appeared. I even slowed my roll on the binge in order to enjoy the show for longer. The Boys is a really great ride and well worth the trip!"
6.0,3 August 2019,"Nobody will regret it.

But anywho, thanks, lads, for bringing Garth to the masses. He's a blessing!"
5.0,20 January 2022,"I've rarely been so surprised by a series like this one. Entertainment, satire, social criticism and some fun, is full of surprisingly crude sayings and violence. A breath of fresh air in the world of superheroes. Wild and brutal. Definitely one of the best series in recent years."
10.0,29 July 2020,"Everything was pretty great about show, especially the dialogue. The only exception was the lack of background about some the characters and the history of Compound V... unless it's being saved for season 2. Still though, there should be more character depth in the first season. It would help keep the audience more engaged/attached to the show. However, I'm still interested to see which direction season 2 takes."
9.0,29 May 2021,This is one of the most compelling and addicting shows I have seen. It has a sort of realist look on what celebrities act like behind the scenes and that not everyone is as perfect as they seem.
10.0,6 August 2021,I was shocked by this masterpiece never thought it'd be that brilliant for Mes it is the most entertaining TV series I've ever seen and I have watched all of the popular TV series including GOT AND BD waiting for season 3 and hoping that there will be more seasons after that brilliant!!
10.0,9 October 2020,
10.0,10 July 2024,"I started watching the Boys since the first season, which got me hooked right away. I love the general idea, the critic and the politics involved. Even the acting is great although some characters are somewhat boring, the plot makes it pull though and makes it exciting. The reflections that the series can bring are great, and it is an important piece for americans to have a glimpse on what the rest of the world thinks about them.

That said, it is awfully unpleasant to watch due to exagerated vilence and the really unnecessary disturbing sex content on it. Some of it might be necesasry to get the point accross, but the was done for in the first season. It's like the writers and showrunners write an episode and then go back on it and say ""Wait, we need some disturbing violent weird sex happenning here, because our viewers are mentally and spiritually ill people."" I get that it's all intentional to make an analogy of the american media consumerism, but it simply gross us out and often you think and that kind of content simply was not necessary to get the message accross. Why are the showrunners pushing these images into the viewers?

I'm no puritan or nothing, but I found myself wishing for a censored version of the series. For that reason I give it a 5."
10.0,24 April 2021,"Just incredible, dark, violent & funny all at the same time. The Boys is a refreshing change in a world full of superhero series and movies."
8.0,1 August 2019,"Did not expect it to be this good. The actors are on point , the script is very good ... what more can you ask for.

Worth the watch , needs more advertisment so people know how good it is."
10.0,28 July 2019,"I'm disappointed that I binged watched this because now I have nothing great to watch :( this was so dark,edgy, dysfunctional, conflicting and just purely ""messed up man"" and I loved every second of it. Well well done actors, writers, directors and everyone else. Can not WAIT until season 2 so hurry up and get this done."

9.0,24 June 2022,"Third season close to finale and the show keeps on giving. Smart writing, cool characters, good actors...It's really rare to see seasons of a show equally good as the first one. Good work amazon."
10.0,18 June 2022,"Finally a show examines the ridiculous values our modern society believes in. A biting satire that takes a real shot at our blind celebrity worship, what the majority of celebrities are really like in private and a decent swing on our addiction to social media accounts and our increasing 'look at me' fascination."
10.0,7 June 2021,"Great idea for a tv show and really well done. Was a nice touch to have some characters not from America, too. The first season was great but the second season .. wow. I cannot wait for the third!"
10.0,4 August 2019,"This show is one of the best comic book adaptation shows I have ever seen. From episode 1, you are engaged when you see how raunchy they can get.

Full blast on their true colors. Then the end has so many twists that you will be screaming second after second when you realise that the characters know something the other one doesnt.

No dull moments. Cant wait for season two!"
10.0,27 July 2019,"This is the most perverse, insidious, horrible show ever... in a rare good way, it shows a disgusting side of human nature... even being super heroes... the plot twists blew my mind, the comic was good... but this is BEYOND GOOD... man, Im so surprised of this, it's also very realistic, 9,2 it's not fair rank, it's perfection, 10/10"
6.0,28 July 2019,"There have been a few attempts recently to make a Super Hero anti hero series and most have failed through bad scripting, lame acting, and just poorly though out plot lines.

This series The Boys knocks it up another notch. First season so far has a good balance and great storyline, interwoven plots and well thought out characters.

Casting is also very superb. It has great re-watchable value and the human frailties and quirks shown in acting make the performances so believable.

This series has a future as long as they don't cancel it too soon or run out of original ideas."
10.0,12 October 2020,If you haven't watched it yet don't believe the season 2 haters! Season 2 is just as good as season 1 and you will be begging for more once you have finished both seasons!

8.0,4 September 2019,
8.0,11 September 2019,"Garth Ennis penned a great series indeed.

So how do we make a big flip on the superhero genre and make it fun again after the comic fatigue has set in? We make the series about non-superheroes who hate and want to kill the superheroes of course! This is not your typical cape story, this is about the public at large around the superheroes in a world that's written realistically about how superheroes would exist.

Hughie was having an ordinary typical day with his girlfriend, the future seemed bright. Only for everything to change in a quick flash of red, his girlfriend is no more, leaving him standing on the sidewalk, unable to even comprehend what is happening. He watches as an intoxicated superhero stumbles away, and is left with the aftermath. Understandably upset, he is approached by a man named Billy Butcher, and if he'd been in the right state of mind, he'd probably have told Billy Butcher to tottle on. But this is where the story begins.

This series is intelligently written, and downright hysterically comedic. There are so many elements that I'd love to write about, but that'd be spoilers. Hughie is played by Jack Quaid, whom I've never seen before but has a great delivery that makes the role believable, and his father Hugh is played by Simon Pegg (who is always amazing). Billy Butcher is played by Karl Urban in what I would say is possibly his best performance to date. This series is not about superheroes, this series is about the people who are disillusioned and despise the superheroes. The superhero characters are the driving force of the plot, but they are not the main characters by any means. And our antagonist is Homelander, played by Antony Starr, who basically comes off as the Christopher Reeve superman if he hated humans and lost the fight with his evil half in the junkyard. He's great in the role.

If you're a fan of the comics, you might have a few nitpicks here and there, the series is a DRASTIC contrast to the comic books. Some of the base elements are unchanged, but the actual events tend to be drastically different. When the series reveals how and why there are super ""heroes,"" and then reveals how and why there are super villains it really elevates the entire thing."
10.0,8 August 2024,"I was really surprised by how good the first season was. When I reviewed the show back then I gave it 9 stars. I wish there was a way to rate seasons separately in IMDb.

Super hero fatigue hit me several years before this show first aired. The umpteen installments from Marvel and DC have bored me to tears as it's more or less the same thing over and over again. But The Boys came as a complete surprise to me. It has real characters and an intriguing story. And it's funny! Unlike the tepid humor and dad jokes in the neutered Marvel kids movies. Furthermore, the acting was really good for the most part (Frenchie being the glaringly obvious exemption). I can't remember if I've seen the guy who plays The Deep before, but he's a real find. Homelander is fantastic as is Kimiko. And Starlight was truly the heart of the show anchored by an excellent performance.

Although not as good as the first, the second season was still good.

The decline begins in season 3, which I rewatched after the release of season 4. It is essentially eight episodes of fluff. At the end of the season every character essentially ends up where they started with nothing really changing, kind of like an episode of The Simpsons. Crazy shenanigans ensue, but next week they're right back where they started. It was also at this point that this show was beginning to feel pretty drawn out and with no clear end goal in sight (because why kill a cash cow?).

The fourth season is not very good. It's as if both the actors and the creators are starting to get fed up with this show and are only going through the motions.

Karl Urban is good as Butcher, although his ""Oi govna!"" routine is starting to get a bit old.

The writers obviously have no idea what to do with Kimiko and Frenchie, so they're mostly off on some inconsequential sidequest. Despite spending three seasons building up the relationship between Frenchie and Kimiko, he's apparently gay now. That is, until he's not at the end of the season. I guess that counts as character development in the 2020's. I wish the writers could come up with something real for Kimiko to do. I would not mind one bit if they killed off Frenchie, one of the hammiest hams that have ever hammed. Same with Mother's Milk to be honest. In season 4 he's more or less a glorified extra. Shame, because he had the potential for an interesting story.

Starlight's change in both physical appearance and acting is jarring. In the fourth season she looks bored out of her mind and is slurring her words like she's constantly hammered. As I said, she was the highlight in the early seasons of this show, little traces of which can be seen in the later ones.

I'm afraid this is going to be yet another one of those TV shows that overstays its welcome."
10.0,24 May 2021,"I got hooked from the first episode, i swear i finished this show in two days. The reality of superheroes, this show will exceed your expectations."
10.0,29 July 2022,"Gritty, plot, nudity, profanity and gore.

This isn't Marvel or DC.

This is better.

By far the best superhero show out there.

Shock factor goes to 11 and its the stuff teenage boys would talk about and debate all the time when we were younger.

Not gonna lie when I started watching this originally I only knew of Karl Urban and Simon Pegg. The show just gets better and better and the casting for everyone involved is just perfect. Each have taken the role and made it their own.

Bravo."
10.0,21 September 2020,Season 2 major disappointment.should have waited for a better story. Losing its appeal. First 5 episodes are like sleeping pills.

10.0,2 August 2022,Every series got more insane and crazy but it kept to its core and I'm so impressed with this. I love the comic writer as I think he did preacher another favourite of mine. It's just amazing. Watch it.
10.0,30 September 2022,"To say much about this show would be a disservice - it's best watched with fresh eyes. An unflinching look at modern society through the lens of superheroes and biting satire, ""The Boys"" is not afraid to take on everything from sexual assault to neo-Nazis. A masterclass of a show where acting, directing, production, and editing all work in perfect harmony. The sound department alone is one of the finest in all television. The plot is anything but formulaic, and even when you can see where some threads might lead, you never know just how the show will get there. Each episode is more depraved than the next, and I can't wait for season 4. A must watch for any screenwriter."
10.0,6 February 2022,"And I don't even like superhero movies/shows :)

But there is really nothing in this show that would be bad.

The pacing is great, the characters (both good and bad) are perfect, with probably the best villain I have seen for a very long time, the music is insane and spot on and the production values are very high.

It's simply a masterwork in its genre, so good that you will enjoy it even if you normally don't fancy ""Supes""."
10.0,14 July 2022,"They will never be able to kill off Homelander, and don't even have the balls to off any of the other cast either.

Its really sad but this show feels so creatively bancrupt. There are too many characters that has no real point in staying around. Like the Deep, A-Train and Starlight."

10.0,30 July 2019,"Started to watch this yesterday and I ended up binging the first seven episodes in one sitting.

The show is well written, funny, dark, gory, over-the-top and so, it's exactly what I like.

Basic premise, without spoilering too much: The 'Soups' (""superheroes"") are a big business franchise gone bad and some disgruntled CDS (Collateral Damage Survivors) are on a misison to tear that franchise down by uncovering its dark secret.

As a comparison, I have also recently started watching the ""Another Life"" show on Netflix and I lost interest (and literally fell asleep) after two episodes.

If you, like I, like funny, dark, gory, over-the-top then give it a try.

[Oh, some reviewer commented on the fly. I also believe this isn't incidentally caught on camera, since they went to the length to foley in the fly buzzing every time. It might be another Soup... I dunno yet]"

2.0,10 June 2022,"People who think this show has gone ""woke"" are totally missing the satirical point of the show. It's making fun of the woke. It's making fun of both political sides because both y'all voters and parties are ignorant fools. It makes fun of this entire country, the media, the celebrity, the politics, the big business side, the big pharma side, everything. It's great tv, great plot, great characters, great action, blurs reality at will, just shut up And watch."
8.0,18 August 2019,"I JUST finished season one a couple minutes ago by the time of this review being published (maybe a few hours I'm not sure) and I gotta say, this show is fantastic! This show managed to make characters that give me goosebumps (and that's kind of rare to me). The show has great writing, really amazing characters and the narrative just keeps on getting me excited on what's going to happen next. I'm going to end the review here because many people had already said what I had plan to say.

10 out of 10. Really recommend it! I genuinely can't wait for season Two."
8.0,31 July 2019,If you see any negative reviews it's because they are haters. The show is amazing and ended on a cool cliff hanger. Hope hope the 2nd seasons lives up to the 1st
8.0,17 January 2024,"Absolutely phenomenal. This show brings me back to superhero-related things again. What I really like about this show is how it differs from other superhero-related content like Marvel or DC. The acting is the best part. Man, Antony Starr sure deserves an Emmy for that performance. His character, Homelander, is one of the villains I would be terrified to meet in real life. I love how every character is dark in this storyline. Aside from others, I'm really enjoying the character of Homelander. I would miss him as a villain if he dies. He sure is one of the best villains of this decade. And bring back season two already."
10.0,12 July 2024,
10.0,4 August 2024,"The Boys started as a remarkable series, but it seems destined to end poorly. During the first two seasons, I frequently recommended it to friends, especially when it was still relatively unknown. It was original, with a compelling story that was entertaining to watch. Although it always had subpar acting, the captivating plot overshadowed this flaw. Now, with the conclusion of the fourth season, my perspective has completely changed.

The first season stands out as the best by far, introducing a unique world filled with perversions and human-like traits in superhumans, bringing a realistic touch to a fantastical scenario. The story progressed rapidly, keeping the audience's attention despite the limited budget and mediocre performances.

The second season, while slightly inferior to the first, still featured numerous iconic scenes and a well-developed plot. However, the third season marked a significant decline in quality. Despite this, there was hope that the fourth season would restore the series to its former glory.

Unfortunately, the fourth season was a complete disappointment. The director seemed more focused on making political statements than on continuing to develop one of the best series in history. This approach would be better suited for political debate programs rather than creating propaganda caricatures. The season was riddled with competing subplots, poorly developed characters, and left viewers confused, resembling a mediocre Disney or Netflix series. It's important to note that I am from Chile and have no affiliation with the Republican Party in the USA, as some might assume.

As of this comment, the fifth season has not yet been released, but given the current trajectory, it seems likely to be a significant letdown. Even good series struggle to conclude in a way that satisfies all viewers, and this one appears headed for a ""Supe Failure."""
10.0,19 July 2024,"The boys is a great exiting, funny and all around enjoyable watch. Really my only issue with the series is how much it tries feeding into the shock factor, which leads to the show losing itself here and there. Aside from that, brilliant show with great characters, performances and storytelling.

I have just finished season 4 and have had a blast throughout the season and series in general, the though as I've mentioned before, this show tries a little too hard to fill the shock factor, trying to get hire reactions form the viewer base though this arises the problem of the show leading away front the storyline."
10.0,16 September 2023,"It's very strange how a fantasy show gives me all this emotions, but when I try to take out all of the unreal elementas, what's remaining is a real life plot The boys is telling the story of how many real life conflicts is happening right now in our world.

It tells the power held by major cooperations, and how corrupt they are.

It also tells how you can change the narrative of everything, how the supper heros and the supper villains are not fixed roles And how ppl can be misslead.

Take any major conflict in this world and u can find ""the boys"" involved You will also find ""Vought"".

It's a sad truth."
7.0,20 September 2019,"First, I love this show. It feels a lot like 'Watchmen' with a Dark Comedy twist to it. It's fun and crazy!

Now, I've seen a lot of Movies and TV series. Sadly, it's much more than the average person. I'm not even sure if Dark Comedy is extreme enough to describe it. There are so many 'over the top' dark moments that are or could be funny, but at the expense or in the wake of extreme graphic brutality.

I'm not saying this is bad, it just is. Film and television go through these kind of evolutionary jumps where something extreme is done and the 'shock and awe' of it creates a new level where it then becomes the new standard. Then Hollywood does what it always does, rinse and repeat, until we become desensitized to this new standard. Think back to the first 'Saw' movie. It was graphic and shocking, but now 20 years of that standard and that same movie seems almost tame. As for rinse and repeat, do I need to bring up 'The Blair Witch Project""?!

This series is awesome and graphic and funny, and funny in the dark recesses in your mind, and fun! It's well worth the watch, but be warned......It's got everything left in! If you are opposed to your kids watching sex, nudity, drugs, graphic gore scenes, language, rape, sexual harassment, video game type violence....you better keep them away. Doubt they'd have nightmares, but it might crack some screws loose. Don't want to end up on the news as a victim of a 12 year olds re-enactment of 'The Boys'!

Can't wait for season 2!"
10.0,19 May 2021,Now I have to change some of my other ratings because I can't give this one 12.
10.0,19 August 2024,"Is one of those shows that grabs you from the very first episode and doesn't let go. It's dark, violent, and completely unpredictable, but that's what makes it so addictive. Unlike most superhero stories, this one shows what happens when those with superpowers are more interested in fame and power than saving the world.

The characters are deeply flawed, and that's what makes them so interesting. Homelander is the ultimate villain-you hate him, but you can't look away when he's on screen. The rest of the cast is just as strong, with each character bringing something unique to the story. The writing is sharp, the action is intense, and there's this underlying tension throughout the show that keeps you on edge."
10.0,1 August 2019,"I am one of those who although watches every marvel movies (and enjoys) but my heart lies in the watchmen, dark days of DC when you didn't have to crack a one liner every now.

I hope this doesn't become one of those cult favorite shows because this show deserves to be renewed for at least 5 seasons if not 10. There is enough material and characters to explore and so much to go on. This is one of those shows with strong, interesting characters. Some of them have heart, soul and motivation while some of them are there to make you wonder yet amuse by just existing on screen. The plot feels fresh yet an age old tale of hunger for power. And there are some solid acting and a surprising cameo too.

This show is self aware of what it is and also doesn't pull it's punches. There's Gore when there's need for it and there's ample action, drama and it's wonderfully shot and scripted. The background score, soundtrack is nostalgic but not just for the sake of it. It does fit the narrative. Most importantly there's no boring moment. The villains you'll really hate and the heroes you'll either side with or make you question do we have a choice but to side with them?

My only complain is that the last episode cliffhanger was like as if there's a next episode. Not that it's a weak episode or anything but very unconventional. It still gets 10 out of 10. Highly recommend."
10.0,6 September 2019,"This is such a new exciting different take on the superhero universe. Unlike marvel and DC, it has a gripping story like the whole way through, funny, sad and dark parts. Karl urban is absolutely spectacular and the series would not have been the same without him. Don't give this one a miss, you'll regret it."
10.0,20 September 2020,... disappointing. The first series was brilliant and I was gripped from the first episode but series 2 has failed to deliver. I've found the story lines less interesting and I'm bored watching the show
10.0,10 June 2022,"Gripping and entertaining. Dark humour and awesome.

A refreshing and relatable twist on the superhero genre.

The characters are deeply flawed, human and often not so super."
8.0,10 August 2019,The caracters are complex. The humor and grapic is not for everyone. For me one of the best tv-series in a long time. No superhero tv-series will be the same after The boys. The actors are great. Season 2... come soon! Please.
10.0,31 July 2022,"It's about time we get a good show that isn't so predictable and dry. This is such a great antidote to the woke garbage out there and all the trash written superhero movies coming out.

Definitely worth a watch."
6.0,12 October 2020,"Great series, as per its rattled the snowflakes on the right and the men who are afraid of women out there... which is always fun to watch. The reviews saying its too crude and vile are also an absolute pleasure to laugh at, if you think the TV series is bad you should read the F comics. LOLOLOL

I hate all the superhero spam in Hollywood so this series is great for me."
5.0,20 July 2024,
8.0,12 August 2019,"I never like superhero movies or dramas. They are all just one dimension characters, predictable storylines, superhero always good looking, evil people ugly (really??), good always wins. The reality is anti-hero dramas is always so much more interesting, so many things can go wrong, there are so much you can develop with the characters.

The reality is 'Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely' and the Boys have delivered that with shock after shock, colorful & twisted characters, poweful lines, gut crushing moments and brutal action scenes.

The actings of how pyscho of Homelander is so breath taking. Billy Butcher loud sweary mouth is ice on the cake. I wish Amazon have made it more shockings by not pulling back some of the decisions. Can't wait for season 2. As long as Eric Kripke keeps up the momentum, I am in for Prime member.

Netflix is definitely lacking behind recently."
9.0,29 July 2024,"This was a blast from the first episode. I had no expectations going in, I was just recommended to watch this by a colleague and boy am I glad I did!

Nothing has felt this fresh (or weird) on TV before. You get everything from laughs to emotional scenes portrayed by amazing actors all packed together into an almost genreless show.

Up until season 4, this is a solid 10/10 for its genre, no question.

Season 4 sadly goes the classic political route and sacrifices every other episode to just straight up hammer on republicans in every possible way. Every other scene has a random TV broadcast thrown in showing the political right as conspiracy driven rednecks or comments alluding to it by any character in any situation, no matter how forced it feels.

To those of us who live nowhere close to the US we're not exactly invested in the politics here per se, but you can bet we're incredibly sick of the subject.

You had struck gold here, steer back to it, don't merge into the hundreds of other shows that are just like your fourth season."
10.0,28 July 2019,1st show that I've felt like binging in some time now. Some twisted sh...!
10.0,15 September 2020,"I dont know what happened to this series. The first season was amazing, well paced and character driven.

Now season two is slow, dragged out, boring and agenda driven...

Went from my favorite new series to having to force myself to watch. If this season doesn change things in the last 4 episodes Im done with this nonsense."
9.0,16 July 2024,"That's because season 1 is the only legitimately good season of this series. It starts off so strong with the way it introduces each character and clearly shows that the stakes are high and the characters are in actual danger from time to time. There is plenty of political commentary but it seems somewhat thought out and the story actually progresses.

In season 2 you get much of the same but it starts to feel like they didn't plan for any more story than season 1 and the political commentary is way more hamfisted with direct slogans from the real world.

Season 3 goes further downhill in this regard and by the time you make it to season 4 it takes up so much of dialogue that it's almost unbearable. The political commentary of the latest season is as intelligent as a 5 year old repeating back what you say to them in a mocking tone. It's impossible to ignore it because it takes up so much of the dialogue.

It feels like the writers don't have any respect for the story, world, characters, or the audience. It feels like they don't have any ideas of their own. All subtlety and satire is lost in a sea of buzzwords.

Watch the first season, maybe the second, the third if you like Jensen Ackles, but skip the fourth.

If you just want to watch gore and shock content, just mute the sound and watch the rest."
10.0,26 July 2019,"Generally I find super hero movies slightly annoying at best, and usually ending up under the category 'mind rotting fodder for the masses'. But this super hero series is the best super hero franchise ever! Well done, Amazon. Now, just dont skimp out on season two's production just because we're hooked on The Boys now."
10.0,26 July 2019,"Very interesting and dare I say frighteningly realistic take on the superhero genre, combining it with everything that has corrupted the modern real world - out of control capitalism, corporations and money controlling politics and basically everything, and the across-the-board corruption of moral values that ensues. Now that might sound gruelling but the show mostly keeps a pretty light tone of black comedy satire while it makes its pointed social critiques.

I don't love the Hughie character or performance but Karl Urban is an absolute riot in every scene he's in and the rest of the cast is pretty good. Visually and in terms of score it's not quite on par with the best things out there but definitely above average, and there's a wit and creativity to the writing that you'd expect from a show created by Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen. I just hope they keep their eyes on the road this time, given their last show Preacher (also based on an insane comics) took a serious dive after its fantastic first season when it seemed like they got distracted with other projects. Would be a shame if the same thing happened to The Boys given the level of promise."
10.0,8 December 2021,"One of the best shows out there, and my favorite currently that I am watching. The vfx, story, characters, acting, shot selection, cinematography, ALL TOP NOTCH. Such a gem of a show and I hope it stays on for at least 10 seasons."
7.0,24 October 2019,Its a 'real' series in that there is a conflict of good and bad. The good and bad is happening to anybody no matter if you are good or bad. The good guys are getting beat up pretty good which makes it an unusual story since other adaptations have superheroes saving the day in each episode and hardly struggle.

In fact, everyone fulfills their role in a standout fashion. 6 episodes is definitely not enough... bring on Season 2!!!!"

10.0,27 July 2019,"Well finally visual superhero media begins to catch up with comics. Unfortunately it's only just caught up with the superhero deconstruction that began waaaayy back in the eighties. Witness the enthusiastic and overly glowing reviews of people who've never encountered this angle before. Sadly this is already ""old hat"" for many of us.

I quite like Garth Ennis but his work has never been the pinnacle of the ""superhero as flawed icon"" trope. Ennis is known for his darkly humourous plotlines but they always seem a little bit juvenile to me. Always crude and frequently cruel with a toilet humour bent not forgetting his perpetual adolescent treatment of female characters.

I think this series is so busy trying to be so edgy that it actually fails to be entirely compelling.

Don't get me wrong it's very well made and occasionally very entertaining but copious swearing, sex scenes and crudely intentioned bloody violence are not a valid substitute for a well crafted story.

One more for the Mark Millar crowd and/or thirteen year old boys."
9.0,15 June 2024,"As the title suggests, ""The Boys"" initially captured the audience with a fresh, gripping narrative in Seasons 1 and 2. These early seasons excelled, offering a unique blend of dark humor and sharp commentary that kept viewers eagerly engaged. However, as the series progressed into Season 3, a subtle shift began to emerge, suggesting an increasing alignment with a particular socio-political narrative. By the time we reach Season 4, the underlying themes have transitioned into overt agenda-driven storytelling, akin to the proverbial toad slowly being boiled. The initial ingenuity and raw edge seem overshadowed by a pronounced emphasis on specific ideological undertones. For those who relish the original vibrancy and audacity of ""The Boys,"" my recommendation is to savor the brilliance of the first two seasons. Beyond that point, the show transforms into something markedly different, which might not resonate with every viewer's tastes."
8.0,25 September 2019,This is definitively worth a watch. It's one of those series like Chernobyl that has a low amount of episodes but instead delivers high quality on all fronts and suspension each episode.

7.0,10 April 2021,"This show is non-stop addicting, gripping, loaded with fun and major WTF moments all the way. Just how superhero shows and movies should be!"
1.0,13 October 2024,"Previously, I always considered television series as a form of entertainment that was too long and boring. However, The Boys managed to change my view completely.

Since the first episode, The Boys has succeeded in attracting my attention with its dark plot, full of surprises, and complex characters. This series presents a superhero world that is very different from the one we know before. The superheroes here are not perfect heroes, but rather a group of corrupt, selfish, and power-hungry individuals.

What makes The Boys so special? First, this series dares to reveal the dark side of the superhero industry. With sharp satire, The Boys satirizes big companies that control superheroes and use them for personal gain. Second, the characters in this series are very interesting. Starting from Billy Butcher, the leader of The Boys who is thirsty for revenge, to Homelander, a superhero who is hungry for power and has a very narcissistic personality. Each character has a complex background and motivation, thus making the audience continue to be curious about the development of the story.

One of the things I admire most about The Boys is its courage to show violence and explicit scenes. Despite its brutal appearance, the violence in this series has a clear purpose, namely to show the dark side of superpowers and the consequences of abuse of power. Apart from that, the dark humor that often appears in this series also succeeded in making me laugh out loud."
10.0,12 September 2019,"I very much enjoyed watching 'The boys' tv series. I can find very little at fault with it and whenever an episode finishes i can't help but want to watch the next. Truly a mind blowing story line with constant plot twists that i never seemed to expect. The action ,although gory, was i thought fitting of the brutal grittiness that is a theme throughout. The only poor thing about this series that i found only very slightly annoying was Karl Urban's (Butcher) poor cockney accent. To be fair to him he had most of it nailed but every now and then just a little bit of his New Zealand accent came through and it did change his character a little for me. However, this is just me nit picking, the series is well worth the watch and i can't wait for season 2 which is hopefully released soon"
10.0,22 October 2019,"Great ideas about what superheroes would actually be like. Very intelligent and exciting. A lot of violence for my taste, but that is common in this era and does not take away from the excellent story and acting. I would have rated an 8, but after watching the terrible HBO Watchmen pilot, I wanted to give extra points for not ruining a great story and staying true to the original graphic novel."
8.0,25 September 2019,"I finally found a show on Amazon Prime that I love and it's The Boys! For the record, I don't really care for any of the marvel or dc superhero shows. I find the stories redundant and cliche and the acting subpar. IMO The Boys is leaps and bounds better than anything Marvel has done in the last 5 years. The story is incredible and if you don't follow the comics then I recommend going into it blind. I loved the ""good guys"" just as much as I do the ""bad guys"". The story is brisk and there is absolutely no lull in the storytelling. The B stories are just as captivating as the A stories. I truly couldn't tell where the next episode would lead next. The casting is flawless. I haven't loved a show this much since Breaking Bad. Highly recommended!"
10.0,12 July 2024,"Somehow I am waiting for the main plot to continue but season 4 seems to get you nowhere.

After the brilliant first season, a very good second season and a okeyish third season this shows seems to be trapped in the typical succesful tv-show-trap, where they begin to stretch the story material. Not much that happens in season 4 is moving the plot forward after the (somewhat) resetting ending of season 3. Hopefully they pick up the pacing in future episodes but somehow I doubt it.

I still will watch the show because I wanna know what is happening to its fabulous main characters but I am growing a bit bored."
10.0,18 July 2024,"What happened?

This show was pretty good season 1, mediocre 2 & 3, but dear lord season 4 is absolute trash. The writing is terrible and doesn't make sense, and characters don't follow the motivations built for them the entire series prior.

I'm not sure I'll be able to spend more time on the final season.... Season 4 is so boring and the writing is just so mid.

Honestly the guy who plays homelander carries it and is a great actor, without him I don't think this show would have lasted as long as it did.

The writers need to take an honest look in the mirror.... The new writing style is very lazy and in your face. All shock value no story."
10.0,15 September 2021,"Its a master piece .can't wait for season 3 , definitely the mosttt amazing series i've ever seen."
10.0,27 September 2019,"I rarely write reviews but I can't keep quiet about this one. What can I say, true masterpiece. There isn't a single moment that's there just to fill the time until the end of the episode - everything was top-shelf. Watched some scenes in a single breath. Those exhaustively boring, lookalike, lame-humoured Marvel bs are nothing compared to The Boys. Would rate it 11 if I could. Can't wait for Season 2. The only thing that bothers me about this show is that Eric Kripke, Evan Goldberg & Seth Rogen now have a tough mission meeting my expectations with S2. Hope you three gentlemen keep up with the outstanding work! All in all, the series are fire!"
10.0,26 May 2020,
7.0,28 July 2019,"That's basically it. Of course I can go on and explain every detail, but it's better when you experience this for yourself.

If you really want a breakdown, here it goes:

First of all is the amazing setting, a world very closely related to ours, apart from the obvious. The twist of having the supes be the bad guys is just incredible. But everything here really has to be praised about the original works. Let's get that out there.

What really stands out here is the efficiency with which they translated the great story into video, and this is just from a technical point of view. The world is immersive, the preformances believable, the visuals impressive, and the blurred lines between drama and comedy blend in in such a way that you find yourself drowning in its glory for 8 episodes that just pass right trhough you in a flash, and I'm talking hour longs.

Bottom line, it sure desrves a watch if you are into superheroes, sick of them or just want a good story."
2.0,26 July 2019,Totally worth it ....loved it... binged it...delicious
10.0,17 June 2022,"I don't like superhero tv show adaptations so I have no idea what made me start watching this but I'm sure glad I did. You don't have to like superheroes you just have to love a laugh. It's unorthodox and isn't afraid of getting gory. Heroes in Marvel and DC universe are great, it's la la land where the heroes always save the day but you might have read a thread on how we'd hate to live in a city with heroes... imagine Hulk using your car as a shield, Batman assaulting people, apartment building torn down during an invasion, or if luck has it, have the Flash on drugs running through your girlfriend. The collateral damage would be insane. We would hate superheroes if we're pragmatic about it and that's what The Boys is about. It's filthy, vulgar, violent and realistic take on them.

One way to distinct this from Marvel/DC is how the writers of endgame refused to give us Antman crawling up Thanos's butt to save half the universe from obliteration, small price to pay. The writers over at Amazon tv however, went a step further on that, and it wasn't to save the world, nope, just some random suped up villain that had no significance to the series. They did it just because they could and I love them for it. I love how the characters in the show take everything sternly, nothing's funny, they're out for revenge or putting a stop to corruption, searching for justice, or doing their jobs, none of them are trying to be funny but it all just ends up humorous. The story is so well written and the series is paced well so it has no dull moments. Homelander's character depth is unrivaled in the genre, almost on par with some of the best drama series characters. Had high expectations after watching the first season, it somehow surpassed them in S2, S3 is off to a decent start as well and I hope this never loses it's essence.

If you don't watch superhero shows and movies because you think it's childish this might change your mind, it's definitely immature but it's definitely not for children. It's not your typical good guy vs bad guy, hero save the day sorta show."
8.0,4 August 2019,"Having not heard or read the hype about this programme, I was drawn to the 9.1 rating at the time. What can I say? Superb in every department. I had worried that the shocking nature of one of the story lines might detract from the viewing but it's a very well observed, funny (at times hilarious), well acted romp. Great one liners and action. Karl Urban steals every scene. Made up for the disappointment that was Game of Thrones

Enjoy"
10.0,3 August 2019,"Absolutely brilliant, something for everyone, very dark but that's what I personally like about it, this is what super heroes would really be like none of this fluffy helping cats out of trees bs"
10.0,11 September 2020,Season 1 absolutely brilliant one of the best shows I've ever seen. Season 2 nowhere near. Very poor up to episode 5. Gutted.
9.0,25 June 2024,"Some good ideas,it wants to be different from the average super hero series but it's actually very common.

Good vs evil. Women empowerment. Happy endings. Only bad guys can die. The best thing is the actor who plays Homelander.

There is no coherence at all. It has some good ideas that will be destroyed along the season to become the average Super hero TV show with some wokism.

It's quite sad to see what it could have been, and what it actually is. A show with no flavour, no surprise, no difference.

Just a very consensual TV show.

At the end of the day, the best aspect is the comedy.

Some funny punchlines and situations."
10.0,28 July 2019,"I had never heard of this source material before and upon seeing this trailer I, being a cynic, initially thought this dark, bloody, violent, Rated R superhero type of tone they were going for was a studio's blatant attempt to copy Deadpool because of that franchise's recent success. Or maybe they took the fighting superheroes thing from Marvel's Civil War or DC's Batman v Superman.

Boy was I wrong! This was such a different and original concept that organically grew throughout the season. If I had to compare it to something it'd be Watchmen, but that really doesnt do this show justice.

From the second scene you already started caring for the characters. The characters are genuine, and deeper than they initially seem. Acting was phenomenal, the writing was fresh and original, and the thing I really liked about the show was the pacing. There was never a dry scene and I never checked my watch, because there was constantly something happening or some tension building for a big payoff. Butcher stole the show, but honestly every character was interesting in their own way.

It was funny, ridiculous, sad, gruesome, and I couldn't get enough of it. I finished this in about a day and a half, and will certainly revisit it again. This is by far the best Prime Original I've seen, and they've already greenlighted season 2. While the premise might seem weird at first don't be afraid to give this show a chance, you won't regret it."
10.0,12 July 2022,"What starts out as a fresh, inventive superhero satire devolves into drab plot lines in season 2. The Butcher persona is a hoot of a caricature in the beginning, however he quickly turns into a tired, same old one-note character. Starlight is uninspired and is someone I never feel like rooting for, and her storyline with Hughie is equally boring. I do like Maeve and wish that she gets more airtime. Certain episodes do stand out (Herogasm, anyone?). But the true savior of the series is the emergence of Jensen Ackles as Soldier Boy in mid-season 3. He is perfectly cast with his handsome manly looks, strong presence, and the funniest delivery of non-PC acerbic lines that only a vintage supe could utter. I hope there will be more Ackles in future seasons to come."
10.0,29 July 2019,"Ok - think Watchmen, but smarter, better written, and better acted. Right off the series grabbed me, and it did not disappoint, all the way through the credits rolling on episode 8. One of the best rides I've been on in years!!!"
6.0,29 July 2019,"I will start by saying that I have yet to read the graphic novel series by Garth Ennis though I intend to start it since I have bought the entire series. I'm strictly basing this review off of the show and not the contrasting differences of the comic. The show is about The Boys AKA a specialized group of people seeking to take down the conglomerate known as Vought who use The Seven whom is an alternative JL of sorts down. Simple yet very effective with a handful of really well done twists. The acting was Incredible. The standouts being The Homelander played by Antony Starr whom I'm overjoyed is coming off of his hit show Banshee. Literally killing it as a clone of Supes. The second being Billy Butcher played by Karl Urban. Incredible acting with multiple dashes of humor. Everyone as a collective did an outstanding job of selling the world minus one or two whom seemed out of place. The action was fire; this is what happens when you have a company like Amazon take the reins on a Mature comic and have no censorship and allowing the team to make it how it deserves to be made and in-turn allowing your fan base to be delighted. Lots of cursing and limbs flying to make the Cirque du Soleil jealous. The cinematography was stunning. The world being sold even though it's on a small scale with it seeming to expand in S2. I'd recommend this show in a heartbeat if you enjoy the likes of Deadpool, Logan and other M rated versions of comic related material. 8 episodes goes by way too fast. Excited for S2."
2.0,10 March 2024,"Initially, I had some reservations about this series, but those doubts quickly faded once I started watching it. Typically, I'd recommend giving it 2-3 episodes to really get into it, and then you're hooked.

Finally, we're presented with a universe where heroes aren't necessarily good, despite similarly being considered gods. It explores what happens when the world isn't just good, but evil, even for superheroes. While there are some forgettable characters (heroes), they often don't stick around long enough for you to care about them, which seems to be a deliberate choice by the writers.

And then there's Homelander... Love or Hate him, but you simply can't help but have strong feelings about that guy!

With the addition of GenV, there are high hopes that these two elements can deliver something that the Marvel/DC universe hasn't been able to achieve so far.."
9.0,28 July 2019,If i had to describe this show in one word i would say:diabolical. i just finished watching it and i want to say that this show is one of the best that i have ever seen.
10.0,1 January 2021,"For me this is One of THE best series of 2019/2020 Absolutely marvelous! Season 2 gets Even better! A must watch for any superhero genre fan, with a lot of violence and Gore!"
10.0,7 May 2021,
9.0,28 July 2019,"A fantastic concept, good humour and interesting characters kicked off this series well. However after a few episodes the drama, intrigue, tension and humour started to wane. The writer's appeared to get lazy as if they were relying on the original hook to force viewers to continue to watch through to the end."
9.0,1 July 2024,"Season 4 of this show has become difficult for someone not living in the US to follow, mainly due to its focus on domestic disputes and politics.

The plot feels secondary now they are on election year. On the positive side, the special effects and acting remain impressive, as expected with Amazon's backing.

However, the excessive explicit nudity is off-putting, I'm not exaggerating, you'll get more naked males you can count. After three seasons, I've decided to stop watching. Perhaps Season 5 will be more appealing, and I might give it another chance. For now, I'll switch to something lighter for entertainment."
10.0,1 May 2023,"The conflict in this show is unwavering, there isnt an episode where things die down and the plot lightens. One solution leads to another problem, and each time you want to stick around & see how on earth they will resolve the next one.

Its social commentary is also something it does not shy away from, and its a fine mirror of how current model of society. It has plenty of characters but they all mean something vital to the overall plot, you can easily binge this show and probably complete a season in a day, given you have nothing else to do.

Well done to all the filmmakers who were a part of creating the show."
9.0,31 July 2019,"This programme about ""superheroes"" is one of the best i have ever watched.....i could not fault any episode and the story is superb. If you havent watched a tv series in a while make this top of your list"
10.0,19 August 2021,This show is really fun to watch. The best part about this show is its character development and the amazing acting performance. Also it manages to be the most realistic superhero show.
6.0,27 April 2023,This show is brilliant. Acting incredible and theme top notch. It is gleefully without constraints and a commentary on n our society that hits pretty close to home. The characters are likeable and relatable. It is funny but serious and over the top. I just finished season three and can't wait for number four. The story arc is pretty solid...some gaps and liberties taken from time time but just fits with the overall theme anyway. If you are easily offended probably best to avoid although if you are adult minded it shouldn't bother you. I don't often review things but this show deserves the support and accolades given how much garbage is out there.
3.0,10 January 2023,"This is a superhero that turns superheroes into villains. It follows a rag-tag group of ""boys"" who are out for revenge against a corporation of corrupted superheroes.

The violence is gory and unexpected. The visuals are stunning. The writing, direction and acting are absolutely unnerving and phenomenal. You'll be on your edge of your seat during some scenes involving certain characters like Homelander and Butcher who keep you being unable to guess what their next move will be.

The soundtrack is pretty awesome too, I found myself Shazzaming certain songs and to this day still listen to them. Can't wait for the next season."
10.0,2 April 2020,This is the best things that happen during the quarantine period. Antony Starr is just perfect with his performance. he is born to be the Homelander. Watched it after the 9 months of its release but waiting for its next season so desperately.
9.0,2 August 2019,It's very dark and awesome at the same time. I like the little twist in the end.
10.0,30 January 2023,"I would give the ""The Boys"" TV series a strong positive review. The show offers a unique and darkly comedic take on the superhero genre, with a well-crafted world filled with memorable characters and shocking moments. The acting is top-notch, particularly from the lead cast, and the writing is sharp and thought-provoking. The special effects are also well done, and the series doesn't shy away from the gorier aspects of its source material.

The negatives of ""The Boys"" include its sometimes uneven pacing, and its tendency to veer into over-the-top territory. However, these are minor criticisms in the face of the show's overall strengths, and fans of the genre will certainly find a lot to enjoy here. Overall, ""The Boys"" is a standout series that is sure to please fans of dark and subversive superhero stories."
10.0,23 July 2024,"To begin, I am a fan of the concept behind The Boys. The idea that superheroes are a reality and that they are monetized in every feasible way is not only hilarious but fascinating. However, that idea works on its own and does not require any injection of progressive political leanings or references to current events to work. Homelander represents conservatives and Hollywood writers hate them, we get it. Making him needlessly brutal is not necessary. Similarly, Starlight represents progressivism, but making her a champion of everything from feminism ro abortion is just unnecessary. Had the writers been more subtle about it, it would have been a lot easier for viewers to get attached to them.

However, that's just one part of the problem. Since the writers seem to be focusing on their political leanings, they are completely butchering the story. Nowehre is this more apparent than in the constant use of fuilthy sexual imagery in the fourth season. I don't have a weak stomach and it takes a lot to get me to flinch, but even I think that much of the content is gratuitous and does nothing to advance the story. If it's meant to be funny, the writers have clearly missed the mark. Nevertheless, it doesn't seem to be meant as funny as much as an insult to people who lean right. I can't help but notice that Homelander's allies in the story all have extreme sexual perversions while Starlight's all appear wholesome and decent. It is definitely getting very exhausting.

Much like with The Witcher, I wish writers would just stick to the stellar storylines that have already been written for them and simply reproduce them for the screen. Their adaptations are genuinely awful, and it should not be a secret to them why the industry is struggling as it is. I don't want to root for artificial intelligence but I don't think a computer could do any worse than they are at the moment."
10.0,22 July 2022,"Season 3, I guess it's just a sign of the times when this is acceptable entertainment, it's amazing to me that almost every new show has 1 or 2 good seasons and then the writers just go off the rails. Anyway watch if you want, I'm out."
9.0,21 January 2023,
10.0,29 July 2020,"Well I've had this on my amazon video watch list for ages and have just binged watched series /season 1 over 2 days.

What a great concept for a super hero show, certainly worth watching if your fan of comic book super hero's or the marvel / DC universe.

Very much looking forward to series 2 in September."
9.0,11 September 2019,"This is one of the best, most well written TV-series released in 2019, if not ever. The casting is spot on, the actors are great, the story is amazing and a real realiever in todays Marvel extravaganza where each title is supose to be more amazing, and more expensive then the other. So if your like me, fed up with the Marvel and DC crap hitting the cinemas and TV, then this is for you. I loved every single episode, and can´t wai for season 2. I just hope that they don´t go mainstream with the next season..."
6.0,23 February 2023,"I don't usually write reviews however, I want The Boys to continue. I absolutely hate series and get bored watching them however all of the episodes flow like one big movie. It gives a different perspective to super hero films and you're essentially following the villain story. The humour is great and isn't typical corny referencing. Actors all suit the roles and no one seems flat when on screen. Would highly recommend the series and I really hope that Amazon develops this into something bigger. All though it will never rival the mcu in terms of scale I think I enjoyed it just as much as it was well thought out and not just trying to be woke all the time."
4.0,16 September 2019,Very good apart from Karl Urban accent..... it's NOT British.... it's AUSTRALIAN
10.0,4 August 2021,Totally unexpected and out of the park crazy. I'm not a Superhero fan but ended up binge watching the lot in one sitting!
10.0,6 August 2021,Awasome and exeland tv show in Amazon prime video 😎😎😎😎😎😎
9.0,1 August 2019,"Anything with Karl Urban will be good but this great. Highlight are the relationship between Hughie and Annie, the exploration of superhero's on their free time. Makes me want to read the comics."
10.0,11 October 2020,"Season one was solid. It did a good job of establishing the characters and creating its world. Season two, everything that was cleverly built up in season one came crashing down with weak and pandering storylines. Big letdown from what could have been. Probably won't waste my time with season 3."
9.0,13 July 2024,
8.0,28 July 2021,"What an original concept, all the episodes are fascinating and a must watch for all the members and non members as well. Its colorful, cheerful, dangerous, adventurous and storyline is also wonderful.

My favourite."
10.0,5 September 2022,"You will probably start watching this to have some good laughs on the superhero genre. And you will indeed laugh with all the action, portraying how our world would be if we actually had superheroes.

Slowly but steadily, something else unfolds. The real tragedy of every character, good, evil or neutral, who follows his destiny without being able to change, to stop, to exit. Simultaneously, the show doesn't afraid to parody on taboos like cancel culture or political manipulation in a way that will make you process it again and again. Every single social and political problem on modern west world is mentioned directly or indirectly and that's incredible for a show that at first glance seems shallow and cheap. It's not. Want some more info? The Boys is marvelous mix of humor and sadness and you must watch it asap."
9.0,16 February 2021,There is absolutely no point going on about how good this show was... Sick of superhero movies...? Just watch this...!!!!!!
7.0,26 July 2019,"One of the best shows that are out there. Great take on superheroes, gory, with a hint of mystery to it in just 8 episodes. CGI better than in most big budget productions. Definitely a recommendation from my part. 10/10!!!!!!"
9.0,26 July 2019,"When I heard Prime was making this, I didn't know what to expect, good or bad. Wow, was I wrong! This is an exceptional twist on superheroes and you don't always have to make them the good guys! I really enjoyed it and the story line was put together nicely! Although, I was a little surprised to hear about Freckles! (You'll understand once you watch it, no spoiler)"
8.0,3 July 2022,"Despite how grotesque and disgusting this show is it's easily one of the best written, filmed, and performed shows out there. As super hero movies become completely cookie cutter and irrelevant this show inversely become more entertaining. A little more visual discretion would be nice but I get it and I hope they can keep the quality that narrowly justifies it."
10.0,6 April 2020,Awesome web series really interesting. Butcher's acting really awesome
10.0,18 July 2022,"I just finished binge-watching all three seasons, and wow, what an incredible series. All casting and performances are perfection, especially Karl Urban, who was born for this role. Directing is outstanding, and the brilliant mind-blowing (no pun intended) writing pushes social satire past every boundary in the most exciting and realistic way possible. The twists and turns are all pleasant surprises that keep raising the bar and your eyes glued to the screen. And Seth Rogan's cameos are legit rolling on the floor laughing out loud. I'm glad I hopped on this hype-wagon and will impatiently be waiting for season 4."
10.0,15 July 2022,Although the boys goes totally against rhe grain for normal superhero movies I must add that Karl Urbans supposed Cockney accent is up there with Dick Van Dykes in Mary Poppins.
8.0,9 June 2020,"The story is gripping from the begging, and the idea of superhero's being a advertising and political schtick, is just perfect. Every, single, one of the characters is believable, and is enhanced by the cinematography and entirely perfect cgi.

The way the story is told, from the perspective of the people that are usually regarded to as ""bad guys"" in super hero movies makes this an even better watch, as it's different. It's definitely not aimed at kids, which is one of the key reasons that it works, it doesn't care if it offends anyone, and therefore the universe engulfs you entirely.

Home-lander is a devilishly well acted character, he feels like an Ed Kemper (From Mindhunter) but rather in a comic way, which makes him feels even more psychotic than he already is.

Hughie is a great character as well, with great comedic prowess throughout the story, however I don't think I'd call him a main character, but rather an introductory character. He's one of the people that make me think a bit more about the series as his development arc is really good.

Cinematography is very good as well, with some shots that I swear will become classics, and shots that people in film school will be looking at in the future. The contrasty tone makes the entire series feel dark.

The one thing that makes me rate this series just slightly lower, is the incredibly annoying product placement in some of the scenes, some are just so obvious it can distract from the story and break the flow of the show. I don't care about the product placement itself, just the fact that it break the flow of the show sometimes.

Overall, you must watch this show, and I mean must as in, if you don't you will die unfulfilled with life."
10.0,29 July 2019,"Dark, subversive and unreasonably gripping. Karl Urban delivers the only false notes in any one of a host of butchered accents. The soundtrack too can be too noticeable and try-hard at times. But thankfully, the rest of the cast are all crackers and the tempo and visuals are great. All in all, near perfect grown-up escapism. Loved it."
10.0,4 June 2022,"If you're smart and enjoy dark satire you will love this. If you're squeamish and easily offended, avoid. Either way, best watched in a different room from your parents .. Cannot wait to see what Ackles adds to the equation."
7.0,26 July 2019,"This looks set to be a real stunner. My one draw back is what the hell is going on with Butchers accent, it's a cross between his natural Kiwi and Dick Van Dyke mockney."
5.0,11 August 2024,"What an incredible journey with ""The Boys""! Chilling, thrilling, horrific, breathtaking, heartbreaking, truth-telling. This show honestly has it all. The acting is out of this world, the character development is heartfelt and thoughtful, and the show always has the viewers on their toes. The gore and moral abominations have to be reckoned with, but the writing is so phenomenal that it's worth all of the body-ripping and head-popping (oh, and the assault/abuse...). It's such an impeccable commentary on the state of our world, mirroring and amplifying our national issues. Simultaneously, it provides a sense of hope about our future as we see the good in, well, Hughie."
8.0,28 June 2021,"This review is after finishing season 2. I am not a fan of gore and will usually avoid it but the story is so compelling I stuck too it. Although there was one scene I had to look away were a dude gets his face ripped off and you see the whole thing.

Gore aside the acting is top notch from everyone even characters that only get a scene or two. The story is pretty good but I did find with a short 8 episode season it moved along almost to fast. It would have been nice to get a bit more in depth but still considering it was only 8 episodes I really shouldn't be complaining.

This show has comedy, tragedy, love story lots of action and tons of gore. There is some sex scenes but it really is the gore that is prominent. If you can stomach that level of gross I would recommend. DEFINITELY NOT FOR KIDS though even though its all about superhero's. These people are depraved so keep the kids away."
10.0,29 July 2019,"My first opinion, right in the beginning was ""Oh, no! One more super hero thing in which danger happens all the time to justify there is a super around!"", but, fortunately, I was wrong... Right after that, I kept on being surprised over and over again... Such a delight in watching it although, at the same time, so much hypocrisy with which we deal on a daily basis (politics, I'm looking right at you). I am still thrilled by that. Brilliant!"
10.0,31 July 2019,"Amazing how they manage to made a fan of the comic wonder what will happen next. I'm really glad it's not the same story that Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson all ready told.

I suggest to read the comics and then see the series, don't stay only with what the series has to offer. Really excited to see what will happen in season two."
10.0,2 August 2024,"Season one and two - 9/10 Season 3 - 7/10 Season 4 - 5/10

The first two seasons were perfect. I loved the dynamics of the evil corporate superheroes and their media against a ragtag dirty group of underdogs.

Season 3 and 4 slowed way down and became all about drama, trauma and politics. Disappointing.

It's like the entirety of season 4 was a filler episode. They threw in some family drama, trauma, gay stuff, political leaning, protests, a presidential election and called it good. Nothing actually progressed and they took half the action away. What the heck happened??? So confused, the last season especially felt way off."
9.0,5 August 2024,"The Boys was easily one of the greatest shows on television!! Season 1, Episode 1 will get you addicted, all the way till the end of season 2. But, the show quickly becomes disjointed and drawn out by season 3 with excessive perversion and exhausting/needless plot twists. It's obvious that with its initial popularity, the producers of The Boys are now using it as a ""cash grab"" to keep it on the air longer. A great disappointment, The Boys would've done better with a shorter plot line, and intentional storytelling, as a limited series.

NOTE TO THE PRODUCERS: The Boys was a masterpiece that you've now tainted. What was a great break from ""superhero fatigue"" is now a show written from the perspective of a perverted 12-year-old boy with mommy issues. You did a fantastic job with the 1st two seasons translating the original crassness of the comic book to a more palatable rendering for the screen. The show however has now lost its way and initial intentionality. The only intention at this time is to shock and confuse the audience, but it's no longer working in your favor. Please rein it back in and be intentional with the plot line. Make this b**ch Number-01 again!"
10.0,20 October 2020,The day I Heard abt boys series Amazon prime original.......I was excited to start watch the series.....at end of both seasons......the reaction is totally badass And cool....best casting and acting My rate is 8/10
10.0,6 April 2020,"Can't wait for season 2!!!! Thank you amazon!!!!

So good. Easily one of the best 1st season ever"
10.0,8 August 2019,"Bottom line, this is this is one of the better TV shows in the last several years, and the best thing to happen to superhero media since Watchmen. For film fanatics that would be a good place to start with a comparison. I admit my opinion of superhero movies and TV may be slanted more toward story driven experiences like Logan, vs more pure action experiences.

To offer some explanation of what The Boys offers, the world is one where superheroes exist, but their activity is tied into big business, corporate interests, politics and religion. The Boys displays some insane version of what our world would be like if people with superpowers existed. The viewer gets to experience this world from the eyes of civilians, mercenaries, superheroes, and those who are trying to exploit their power. The world is unique, but speaks to contemporary themes, and while grounded enough to be very convincing? One could also draw from The Boys a great deal of symbolism that would parallel modern events. But like the best of any given media, the entertainment comes first, and that entertainment is delivered from the first to the final scene.

The Boys, having 8 episodes to travel across the story arc, delivers a deep, rich experience. The Boys also has a consistent humor, despite the violence, corruption and other negative themes present. Even though so much is wrong in The Boys, there is an underlying feeling of optimism that I really, really appreciate.

The Boys does have shock value, right from the beginning - but I'd still call this a show for everyone. Well, anyone prepared for graphic violence, intense sexual situations, and otherwise mature themes.

The major strengths are writing, production, casting and (in terms of storytelling) - perspective. Everything is at least good, but the writing is absolutely fantastic. Every episode has mesmerizing dialog that ranges from very convincing situations to, ""did he really just say that?"". The production is AAA film quality, but The Boys knows what it is, and doesn't (ever) rely on special effects the way many comic films do. Karl Urban is always good, and this is a great role for his tool set. He leads the way, but all the characters hold up, and it's amazing how much texture each character has by the end of the show. They all have a story.

Which brings me to the strongest storytelling element: Perspective. The viewer gets to see the story from multiple perspectives, and since so much changes, the characters evolve throughout this changing perspective. And this would come back to the complexity of the writing, which is why The Boys is so refreshing in the superhero sub-genre. The complexity is delivered with such stunning ease, analysis becomes challenging - the immersion is real. I would give my highest recommendation."
6.0,10 June 2022,"Everything in The Boys deserves praise and every accolade the show qualifies for.

From casting to acting to show effects to story to dialogue to characters and their own unique development, I cannot fault the show.

Homelander's character in particular is masterfully crafted and the portrayal of his character by Antony is incredibly good. An Emmy is well overdue!"
10.0,13 November 2020,"The Boys is superb. It's as simple as that.

Everything a superhero would probably be if it wasn't for our eagerness to inflict a moral code on the powerful (Now where could the general public have got that desire from I wonder)

The characters are unique and interesting, the plots twisted and the violence and script compelling and realistic.

Just wait until you see what try's to strangle Mothers Milk in series 2."
10.0,7 September 2020,"..i mean this serie hits the level of major cinema on all fronts.

This is the ultimate camp to hit Netflix from het throne.

The story above all is unique. Combined with the comedy and drama it is a hit!

Absolutely loved it, just enough amount of the sjb in this serie, not too much. No political statements, juat enjoyement.

I love every minute of it. Homelander is the bomb and so is Karl Urban his charachter.

I hope they go up to season 40!"
9.0,2 August 2019,Has a very watchmen feel to it but also great writing and cinematically pleasing.
10.0,24 June 2022,"Recommended you should watch surely you'll get what you expect.

Maybe more than that.

Homelender's acting is superb.

And Butcher.

Will get you hooked till end."
8.0,22 October 2020,"If you like woke, if you like political messages, this season is for you! I get tired of companies preaching to me."
10.0,30 July 2019,
10.0,5 April 2020,"One of the best unexpected supersizes I've seen in a long time. No apologize in this show everything passed expectations and not just because there were none. Very entertaining, can't get enough. Superheroes gone bad and people turned semi good. Either way it's a great show and refreshing to see an R rated show like this."
10.0,26 July 2019,
6.0,31 October 2020,"Evil superheroes, best show ever, absolutely love the dark humor!"
10.0,16 August 2022,A really fun completely over the top (sometimes a little too much) and intelligent skewer on the superhero genre. Homelander really makes the show but Butcher and Stormfront are also great characters. Season 2 was my favorite but they are all compelling and mostly well written. My one gripe is that I personally found the romance plot lines to be fairly cringey especially Hughie and Starlight and their performances overall kind of drag the show down a little but the other elements more than make up for it.
9.0,5 August 2022,"I just finished watching 3 seasons of this great show. The acting is terrific, especially by the guy who plays Homelander (Antony Starr).

Homelander is by far the best villain I've seen executed in a comic book, live-action show or movie; beaten by the previous best, Heath ledger's legendary joker and even Omni Man from Invincible.

He is unpredictable, terrifying and downright disturbing to watch at times; while still being a superbly written complex character.

Butcher is also an amazing anti-hero character, played by the charismatic and talented Karl Urban. He does things unconventionally but gets the job done superbly.

The rest of the cast is amazing as well, including Hughie, MM, Annie and the others.

Those who thought this genre didn't have any adult-oriented shows, this gem's just for you. It deals with narcissism, extremism and corporate greed fantastically through the medium of unchecked superpower authority.

The finale of the 3rd season was a slight letdown, though I would say, its a strong 9/10 for me."
9.0,28 November 2023,"What can be said about this shows greatness that hasn't always been said. This series has revived the uninspired ""superhero"" genre and subverted near all pre conceptions an audience will have on it before they begin watching. Amazon smashed it out the park with The Boys well and truly enough for most if not all viewers to not picture the monotonous drawl of sequels in modern marvel when they hear the words ""superhero genre"". The character arcs in this show are nearly comparable to a breaking bad of modern times with Homelander especially being a focal point of analysis for the viewer to monitor along their viewing experience to predict the series's future. Truly spectacular."
9.0,18 October 2020,"MIND BLOWING . That's the words to describe season 2 . But I am gonna go a bit deeper . The acting is amazing !!! Anthony Starr is a damn legend and so is Carl Urban . Tomer Capone and Aya Cash are a highlight too . A lot give the boys season 2 1 star because it's slow and they are so stupid. The first episode is definitely not as good as season 1's first episode but season takes time . In fact every episode is slower than season 1 episodes but oh boy are they gory! This season is the goriest I have ever seen since ... Ever! I have ti say season 2 features the best episodes . Episode 3 9/10 , Episode 6 9,5/10 , Episode 7 10/10 , Episode 8 10/10 . Yes it's that good . This show isn't for everyone . Definitely not for children . Huge amount of gore and other disgusting things . But if you can handle the gore , what are you waiting for . Go binge the Boys NOW!!!"
9.0,7 July 2024,"I started with 9 star rating until season 4.

I am at Season 4 episode 3.

Now my rating is 6 stars.

I was able to put up with everything what I saw until season 4.

They really didn't need to add all this homostuff and disgusting dark sci-fi humour.

I like the storyline and the actors are good, but all this exaggerated humour trashes everything.

Also there is a lot of stuff that don't make sense at times, and we as viewers are just suppose to not ask about it and just accept it.

I don't want to add spoilers, but sometimes it's obvious that some stars do stupid things, or things that don't make any sense and this is not explained later. It's just skipped in a way. Whatever...

6 stars.

I Hope there will be no season 5."
10.0,29 August 2019,Really don't go by this. This is a more realistic take on what certainly would happen if anyone had super powers. Excellent writing and casting with a brilliant concept makes this one of the best shows in a long time
10.0,4 January 2024,"The Boys was originally planned to have all the eight episodes of the first season released on Amazon Prime Video on July 26, 2019. This Amazon Prime series is set in a world where there are superheroes and based on the comic book of the same boyz. Very popular superheroes from Marvel and DC intending to give them a more depraved, problematic and realistic counterparts, with each season introducing a new Super that is based from a popular super heroic character. It is so addicting television series I crazy watch tv is great all day enjoy. So thank you Amazon Prime for treating us like adults and I can't wait for the second season."
9.0,29 July 2019,"Things make sense. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Not only do the ""Supes"" have powers, they also have the media behind them. Supes, are big business! Advertising, movies, products.

This mirrors my own experience and observations in life. I live in Syracuse Ny. Where everybody in the antiques business knew an auctioneer was wasn't paying consignors for years! But he was spending a lot of advertising money. So you never heard a peep out of TV, radio or the Newspaper. Instead he was constantly proclaimed as honest, integrity, the best one to deal with. When he ran out of money, suddenly he was vilified by all three! The same thing happened with a Mall, and a Mayor, and a big car dealership. Most people knew they were crooks, somehow the news sources were play three blind mice as long as the checks cleared. And that's just in my small community.

This kind getting away with things because the money is good happens all over. Not only getting away with it, but having it reversed on the victims, it was somehow their fault. Like in the very first episode.

But enough preaching about not believing things like these guys must be the best lawyers to hire because they're on TV the most. (it actually means they're looking to settle your case five minutes after you hire them with the least amount of work)

The dialogue is probably the best on TV right now. They define what motivates each character. They writing is superb.

This IS what would happen if 250 super powered beings were running around with nothing to check their activities and hold them accountable. Very few would really be heroes. Actually out helping and saving people."
6.0,5 April 2021,
2.0,26 August 2022,"Brilliant series! Just when you think it's going in one direction, it turns around and surprises you.

I was kind of hoping they'd get rid of that annoying, spoiled Homelander, but....err.. nothing. I'll have to wait for next season.

I'm glad they brought Jensen Ackles into the story. I hope to see him again later."
10.0,18 August 2022,A masterful deconstruction of the superhero genre expertly blended with dark comedy and brimming with social commentary. I wasn't sure if I was going to like this one at first and it turns out I was right - I don't like it. I love it.
10.0,8 July 2022,One of the best super heroes shows of all times. Amazing story and delightful characters development. Impossible not to fall in love with the villain.
10.0,16 November 2020,"I was skeptical to continue watching this show after finishing season 1 because I've read many reviews saying season 2 was not up to par with season 1. After finishing season 2, I must say I don't understand the hate on season 2. Both seasons were great. This show is a lot of fun with dark humor & action and has a refreshing take on superheroes, our superficial society, and even politics. Looking forward to season 3"
10.0,10 July 2022,
10.0,10 July 2022,"Protagonists have been chasing the same antagonist for three seasons now. After watching the third season, there's no progression in the storyline or plot and just feels like a big waste of time. Not even excited for a fourth season or looking forward to it."
10.0,7 April 2021,As a non native french speaker I find the Frenchie the best character. I read negative comments about his accent from native speakers. Billy Butchers terrible accent is annoying me personally so I can understand this critique and would wish that American producers would finally understand that native speakers should get casted for roles as such.
9.0,15 July 2021,"I'll make this quick because I have nothing bad to say about this show.

It's so unique among the superhero genre and that's a huge advantage. The themes and messages the show portrays hold up well and still will years into the future.

Great characters with great actors that make the characters even better. There are so many characters in this show but each one gets their own story and their time to shine.

The story and world building is great as well, with tons of lore put into every episode that helps to solidify the plot and tease future events in the series. With each episode I wanted to watch more and more.

To wrap things up, the comedy almost always hits its mark, the gore is never ending and the absurdness is just the right amount. This show is amazing and I would recommend it to anyone... as long as you don't have a weak stomach cause its VERY brutal."
10.0,3 August 2022,"Honestly this is one of the only 10/10 series in the world in my opinion. Not only is this a good example of what would actualy happen If there were people with superpowers in the world, it also gives one of the best villains ever created: Homelander. The most insane sycopath you'll ever see. As the series goes on you see the bucket get fuller and fuller Until the last drop that makes it overflow. Pacing is great, charachters are really good and you get what they're feeling. It's a must watch."
7.0,4 September 2019,"The title above basically says it all. Phony superhero's are just like phony celebrities, who seem so honorable but are just a bunch of fakes. So non superhero's put their foot (feet) down & try to do something about it.... maybe they do. Maybe they don't. Have to watch to find out & I'd be shocked if you didn't like the series. Can't wait for next season!"
4.0,4 September 2024,"The boys was really cool and nice, Billy the leader was creating a special group of people who have feelings of grief from losing their family and friends to the nasty superheroes. There is some really good recruiting with also a lot of uncertainty in the team from Hughie being too jelly like and the Asian girl being super strong but, maybe an enemy lot's of uncertainty in the team which looked nice how it was getting resolved. There is also starlight who had uncertainty in team.

They set traps such as video or CCTV footage that captures illegal pills to enhance the nasty superpowers. The video was then attempted to go public. My favourite part was when Noir got to them in the estate and they had to hide but, Noir was trapped from attacking them cause, of public perception of him."
8.0,27 August 2022,"This show is simply awesome. The idea of superheroes being corrupt by corporate money is brilliant.

While there's a serious storyline, these guys could give Trey Parker and Matt Stone a run for their money on making fun of pretty much everything. They take shots at every movement, regardless of political side or angle, and its hilarious the entire way. They don't seem to be slowing down either, it only gets better.

Along with their punches on every mainstream topic, they also throw in a lot of out of the blue dark humor.

I honestly couldn't recommend this series enough, as long as you enjoy a bit of dark humor. If not, eh you probably wouldn't enjoy it."
10.0,10 September 2022,
10.0,16 September 2019,"Being a fan of superheroes series/movies, i am used to be extremely dissapointed with the current superheroes productions (coff coff marvel) . I started watching this show with 0 expectations, and ended up sitting up and clapping of joy at the end of every episode (yes..my wife was a little concerned but i couldnt help it)

Awesome series, awesome acting, awesome script."
10.0,9 October 2020,"Surprised by all the 10/10 ratings. It's an ok show, but the ratings are a bit inflated."
10.0,17 June 2024,"A terrible script and a predictable story. The series stagnates and the characters feel weak, unwilling to work. Homelander is the only good thing about the show, the problem with that is that the performances of his fellow ""superheroes"" are somewhat poor. Butcher does not seem like that charismatic leader of past seasons. I kind of like that it follows the line of making fun of everything that has society in such a bad state. I wish our team (The Boys) had some victory, even if it was a small one. I hope it improves with the new chapters because they honestly don't make you want to keep watching."
9.0,9 July 2022,"If super heros were real in America, this is exactly how it would go down. Brilliant use of super hero powers and corporate America tell such a gory, comedic story."
9.0,30 July 2019,"From the beginning throughout and to the very last episode, this show keeps you engaged. It's believable, rigid, and polished enough to hopefully span over several seasons. Each actor perfectly complemented the next not in a cheesy way but in a let's take our time on casting this show way. Netflix, particularly since they have gotten into the rhythm of churning out terrible shows and movies and only a few gems is in trouble with the quality that Amazon is releasing. This is EASILY the best superhero show I've seen.

Side note: it's not family friendly. But it's damn good. Binged the entire season in a couple of days and looking forward to the next."
10.0,24 July 2023,"This is quite the opposite of your average marvel movie. ""The Boys"" is a gripping and inventive TV series that fearlessly deconstructs the superhero genre. Led by Karl Urban's magnetic performance as Billy Butcher, the ragtag group of vigilantes takes audiences on a rollercoaster ride through a dark world of corrupt superheroes. With thought-provoking storytelling and sharp humor, this Amazon Prime Original stands tall amidst an oversaturated market of superhero content. However, be warned of its unapologetically mature content that pushes boundaries. If you crave a thrilling and unforgettable journey that challenges your perceptions of heroism, ""The Boys"" is a must-watch."
6.0,24 September 2023,
4.0,4 August 2020,"If there were really super heroes, they would be corrupt in this corrupt world. A superb production. I'm looking forward to the second season"
10.0,8 August 2021,"The series is really good, the first season is a masterpiece in the superhero show out there and way better than all the CW crap of shows(Arrow, Flash, Supergirl), the series combine perfectly comedy with the gore and dark humor; season 2 is also good but not at the level of season 1."
10.0,6 January 2024,"Violent, Gory, Explicit but also Deeply Satirical and Critical of the world of superheroes and more importantly, the corporate driven world we live in. As one of the characters in the show very rightly puts it ""When in history has it ever been about anything other than Business."" Its unafraid and unapologetic in exposing the glam and gloom side of celebrity culture, and the consequences of treating them as gods. And its a treat to watch.

Anthony Starr as Homelander is hands down the best written and acted villain in all of TV show history, maybe even all of cinema dare I say. Karl Urban (as Billy Butcher) is also amazing in the role. The show is worth watching based on these 2 actors' charismatic performances alone.

Not to take anything away from any of the other cast members, Erin Moriarty ( as Starlight), Jack Quaid (as Hughie), Tomer Capone (as Frenchie), Laz Alonso (as MM) and many others all bring their A game which makes the show all the more entertaining to watch.

Binge The Boys if you are looking for an escape from the endless superhero media content out there."
10.0,26 July 2019,"The humor, so many unnecessary deaths, the contempt against the normal humans ... i love it :)"
8.0,26 July 2019,Loved the show from the first episode till the last. Now I see why Amazon renewed it for the second season before the first season even aired.
9.0,22 July 2024,
9.0,28 July 2019,Amazing series finally something different from marvel and dc
10.0,26 July 2019,"My god this is so great! Gory, wild, mature. A tad predictable but still refreshing enough. Absolutely stunning piece of television entertainment. All acting are pretty on point, the scenario seems plausible enough to be ""real,"" think about it, we are all human and when human obtain absolute power bad thing happens. BTW, from what I heard from my friend, this is already toned down compares to original comic which kinda blew my mind."
6.0,1 August 2019,The best antidote of crazy fake super heroes from Marvel and DC. The antagonist and protagonist are super epic the cast is RIGHT on. Every moment has intense psychology to it. This anti super hero squad has just the right amount of gore drama fiction and emotions
2.0,5 October 2020,Used to be great.... now it's just another show pushing the left agenda. Can't we just make shows without some type of bias anymore? Garbage
10.0,26 July 2019,"This is what happens when you get good actors and script that gives them something to work with.

Has been done before (like all thing) but this does it more well produced and clever. Best iteration of it"
10.0,26 July 2019,"Honestly, I respect the minds behind TV series like ""The boys"". Those creators are worth to be talked about. I mean, I love MCU! They are on their way to make an epic for the ages of cinema and movie industry. But a very few people read non-mainstream comic books, and even less thinks deep enough to make a good show about that. And my, this show. It becomes better by every passing moment. Just give it a watch. And if you have started late up night, there is a good chance you will mess up your schedule for next morning."
8.0,12 August 2019,Finally a series that is relevant without being woke. Not afraid to push the boundaries. Outrageously funny! This is the type of fresh creative content we desperately need. Great work Amazon for stepping outside the box!
9.0,18 October 2020,"S1 was great. The acting, storytelling, everything. S2 was decent but I felt it was VERY preachy and I felt the whole arch in S2 was lame. Yes racism is bad we know but making an entire season based on that premise? I also felt like it was a little more predictable and cliche in S2.

Also some of the stories are just boring and I found myself skipping through. All of The Deeps scenes were an insta skip for me. Adds absolutely nothing to the story. Also way to much filler. But theres so much filler because the actual story is paper thin. All in all I feel like this show tries to be different but its actually pretty predictable and they try to throw you ""off guard"" with gore scenes here and there. S1 = 8. S2 = 6.5."
9.0,23 June 2024,"After watching the first 4 episodes of season four I am so disappointed. Is this show here to entertain an audience, or to display and promote Kripke's politics? He is giving into hubris, thinking his views are more important than the story. His comments about the audience shows he thinks very little of us and obviously considers himself above the common viewer. I think this show needs to be cancelled now, stop before you ruin this franchise.

Maybe hire some decent writers? Start catering to your audience. Stop mocking your viewers. I'm not watching this anymore, it's the some as all the other garbage."
8.0,4 August 2019,Really good. Can't wait for season 2. Watched it all in a day
8.0,27 July 2019,"Very entertaining, great effects and a great cast!"
7.0,7 November 2021,"Dint quite like & enjoy season 1, but season 2 definitely made the cut. Great storyline, acting & character development. A few scenes were a bit off, yet continued watching season 2 and was worth it. Recommend watching!"
1.0,2 November 2019,"A few people mentioned The Boys, but none were effusive about it. So my expectations were that it would be ok, but not great. I'm glad to say my expectations were wrong.

It's at the other end of the scale from the excellent Marvel films, which unflinchingly portray heroic superheroes; much closer to the Marvel series like Jessica Jones, that delve into the psyche of the heroes themselves. Unlike Marvel's heroes, those in The Boys aren't just flawed, they are convincingly broken.

The subtext, the shocking brutality, the corporate manipulation, the impotence or obliviousness of ordinary people and the terrifying prospect of such power in the hands of charismatic, amoral celebrity makes for an outstanding alternative to the superhero mythos; one that is almost believable (bad physics notwithstanding). Add some excellent acting, especially from Homelander, and this is a series you should watch."
9.0,22 October 2021,"An entertaining look into a world where being super doesn't necessarily mean being better.

I haven't read the comics but I love the show. I didn't realize a mostly evil, misguided version of the Justice League could be so fun!

An interesting twist in that the real heroes of the show, who are trying to bring the supes to justice, are a ragtag group made up of mostly regular people.

Very much looking forward to season 3 and the addition of Jensen Ackles."
9.0,24 September 2019,Loved it! loved it! Loved it! A particular high point for me was Urbans take on Dickins's Bill Sikes. All thats missing is Bulls-eye the dog!
9.0,23 October 2019,"Okay, it's a very good show. I usually do not watch fantasy's shows, but this one kept me from skipping boring minutes of being bored ( erm, just a few ). BTW, it's not comedy, more of a drama, crime and, of course, fantasy with a dose of reality."
8.0,10 September 2019,"Karl urban & Anthony Starr are the show runners. Thanks to Amazon for making this TV show, big relief from all the generic & pathetic superhero movies. Although, I have a issue with the ending of this series where suddenly things appear out of no where, like any other TV show."
9.0,1 July 2024,"Big fan of Karl Urban but this is worst season of this show and of any show I have ever seen. It like the producers and directors are trying to be every single thing in that would shock or offend anyone who watches just for that purpose. Your audience is better than this or are they. I know I am. I am not watching this crap anymore. Karl, find better scrips. That goes for every actor in here. Was the money just too good to turn down? Money really is the root of all evil and least in this case. This show is just nasty and what is so bad is I enjoyed the 1st season and it just kept going downhill."
9.0,25 September 2019,"It is the best dark comedy tv show I have ever seen. Having been thrilled with plot twist at the last episode, I cannot say that I could have guessed what would happen at the end."
9.0,28 September 2019,"Best thing I've seen in a long time. Superb acting across the board, brilliant writing. This is an excellent series. Definitely intended for mature audiences, but this sets the standard for a super hero series."
9.0,27 October 2019,Very good stories about heroes. Butcher is a good man. Fight scenes so good and perfect. I wanna to see the 2 season .
6.0,23 September 2019,Loved watching a different type of super hero movie. Plus I'm quite proud of my cousin playing Ashley Bennett.
8.0,30 September 2019,"Written well and nice to see something different than the normal superhero show. Has romance, drama, and even a few laughs"
9.0,30 December 2021,"The show has quite an original and interesting plot. Superheroes aren't a force of good, they are not saving the day. At best they are an inefficient, violent, and glorified police force. But more often than not the (super)power gets to their head and they become unpleasant, some even psychopathic. Many of the ""supes"" abuse their power and cause more harm than good. It has good action and an interesting story.

The missing star is because it is often a bit too graphicly violent for me. Graphic violence can be great for inciting strong emotions, but sometimes it gets a little too unpleasant. However, that is not a major point. I strongly recommend this series, it is perhaps the most exciting series I have ever watched."
9.0,9 January 2022,"Amazon know how to create a great captivating superhero series. Both the invincible and the boys.

It's the perfect example on how to respect the source material in comics and still add a flavor of it's own.

Advised for all!

I still can't believe how two Amazon creators can be this great in the boys and this awful in the Wheel of time. I would love to see the wheel of time redone by the boys creators."

8.0,8 July 2022,"If you find yourself ""rolling your eyes"" at superhero films because the good heroes never let their powers get the better of them and always save the day without hurting anyone ""innocent"" (aka those that ""deserve"" to live), and the bad guys/girls who initially seemed superior becoming exponentially inferior towards the end, so they are defeated with seconds to spare, then The Boys is a great antidote.

So why 6/10 instead of 10/10?

Because of the last episode of season 3. What a disappointment (1/10).

It goes against everything the show is about (according to me anyway).

That episode itself feels like the show is now a victim of it's own success.

What a shame that it chose to go down the same path as all the other boring, ""by the book"", ""off the shelf"", ""factory scripted"" superhero films."
8.0,3 February 2020,"After all the copy-paste action superhero movies that filled the last decade, The Boys bring some fresh air with its different take on the superhero stereotype. No more paladins of justice but exploitative, manipulative bastards thriving in a capitalistic world where the superhero is now a commodity. It's gritty, dark and hilarious without being pretentious or pandering. Most of all, though, it's just fun. Great characters, acting and an interesting, although at times reused, storyline. Especially the main protagonist and antagonist, elevate the quality of the show presenting two opposing views that coalesce in a communal disregard for the boundaries of good and evil. Definitely worth watching. Hopefully, after the great first season, it will stay on the right track."
9.0,22 October 2019,"What a great antidote to the never-ending kiddie-friendly cavalcade of Marvel and DC movies this series is. It isn't for kids. Karl Urban, who is brilliant as the foul-mouthed Brit Butcher, emphasises this in the first episode, during which he utters the C word at least three times.

The Boys is perfect for anyone who's sick and tired of having to sit through yet another awful Avengers movie."
9.0,2 October 2019,Wasn't expecting a lot from it. So glad i gave it a chance. It's funny and dark and a total change from the conventionnal superhero stuff. Maybe even more realistic...
7.0,13 October 2020,"It is very enjoyable and entertaining. I would not say it is dark as per some reviews. I would say it is dark humour. If you do not get it, you will not like it. Season 1 was better than Season 2 mostly because the second season seamed a bit prolonged and not much was happening until towards the end of the season. Overall, it is good, original and a good watch but could be better."
1.0,23 September 2019,"Its amazing how many times people are handed ready to go material and they go off and try to reinvent the wheel from scratch. Its like that with The Boys. I read the whole 72 issues for the graphic novel and it was good, not great but good. Not so much social media oriented bit darker bit more perverted, I don't see why they choose to throw all that out, just borrow some characters and certain concepts and rewrite the whole thing. But for what it is, its a good distopian hero universe where being a hero means market value, movie contracts, merchendise and public apearances. It is not a show about heroes but about those who without powers are trying to bring them down, punish the guilty. It is about loosing innocence and blurring the lines between good and bad, what is just and what is not."
8.0,26 October 2021,"It's gory, with a solid storyline and it's a great adaptation from the comics. The world building seems very life like, it's a joy to watch. The first episode set the precedent and tone of what to come. A world where superheroes are prevalent is chaotic and not everyone can be saved. This is basically how actors are in real life without the pr machine."
9.0,6 October 2019,It's the superhero series we've been waiting for. Great story line.
9.0,10 January 2020,"Honestly, I didn't have high hopes for this and just hit play on the first episode at random. Wow, I couldn't have been more off the mark.

It nails it in every facet; the production quality it stellar, the writing is tight, the editing and directing feels spot on, and the acting...this group of actors brought this to life in all its dynamic beauty.

You see characters move and take shape ORGANICALLY, which is all too rare. The range these actors manage in EIGHT episodes is something young actors should study."
9.0,28 June 2024,"This show is a perfect demonstration of two things: The first is that streaming TV is the new premiere art form. I will always love films and dearly hope cinema survives but shows like this have the cinematic vision of big screen movies, alongside the depth of character development we expect from an immersive cinematic experience.

The second is that what began with three seasons of subtle, even-handed, unpredictable and sometimes funny drama, has given in to the unsubtle, cliched tendency for shows to shoe-horn sophomoric political (and socio-political) messaging into what is supposed to be entertainment. A show this good should be much smarter than that but there it is.

It hasn't ruined the show - it's still one of the best - it's just that every so often you have to switch off your brain and sit through a tedious message."
10.0,23 June 2024,"Same story arc, same shock value bombardment, same boredom. The boys went from Excellent S01, to Wait What? S02, to Total Crap S03 and now S04 combines S02 with S03. Don't waste your time and go watch something else.

Plus the more it goes on, the more bias it shows. Ok, we get it, Homelander is evil and will become a dangerous sociopath (eye roll). Like we needed more reasons to hate him (the role, not the actor).

The one playing Mothers Milk, I wish all the best, no way he lost all that weight so fast. The Female's arc is boring and so is Frenchies' side story. Out of nowhere they are making up things in the past never referred to."
10.0,2 October 2019,
10.0,10 October 2019,"In a Superhero fueled genre era ""The Boys"" is a refreshing look at what if the caped crusaders are not here to protect our freedom and liberty but to actually get famous and rich. Season 1 had both wonderful moments as well as ""Why the F** am I binge watching this"" moments but I would surely say I wasn't disappointed and am looking forward to Season 2."
6.0,23 March 2022,"I really enjoyed this dark satire the superhero genre. Fantastic characters and darkly hilarious situations. It definitely is not for the faint of heart. At times, it felt like the writers were competing to see who could come up with something more disgustingly gruesome or bizarrely sexual. The actors all seem game, with Antony Starr as Homelander eclipsing them all. Season 1 was an especially fun romp; season 2 leaned darker and meaner, which made it more interesting, but also less fun. Looking forward to season 3."
2.0,22 October 2019,"I started watching this series, cause it randomly showed up on my Prime video account. I was eager to watch a series, and honestly that's why I started watching it. The first few episodes looked like a complete bad rip off, and lost interest for a moment. But maaaannn, after some episodes later, the story does get really interesting. This is definitely a break from the regular DC and MARVEL fight. Maybe like a bit to realistic based story (except the superpowers obviously xD)

Totally love the concept of rogue/fake superheroes. Definitely deserves a watch!"
10.0,7 September 2019,"This, much like the majority of Garth Ennis writing, is superb. The actors, especially Antony Starr, are so good in their roles. On this one Amazon got it right. The only minor nitpicking annoyance is Karl urban's dodgy accent."
10.0,27 July 2019,Easily one of the most bingeworthy shows of the summer
9.0,1 August 2019,"This series is ridiculously good; crazy characters, even crazier storylines & suburb directing.... oh, & the soundtrack is mint!"
10.0,28 July 2019,"Not knowing what to expect, the first episode is entertaining and leaving you to want to binge watch entire season 1."
10.0,16 July 2022,"First and second seasons were cool but it's getting too political and woky for me in 3rd . Christianity bad, Russians bad, Black Lives Matter, Pride excetera...I get it , its social commentary but I get bombarded with this S in my daily life and want from my tv show some distraction from it , not some more of it lol. Also kind of meta considering that show is made by Amazon which is no better than fictional Vought and will do whatever to be trendy and appear socially responsible while doing some sketchy stuff. Anyways, not sure if I'll bother with season 4."
10.0,1 July 2024,"I guess it's a trend in Hollywood to start out great and over time ruin the show. It happened with so many great shows. That's why I hear from so many people that they are going back to the old shows that ended years ago that they have already seen.

Well no wonder.

If you are thinking about watching this show, just save yourself from the inevitable disappointment and skip it.

The only positive and consistent thing about this show is the acting. Superb cast that delivers despite the fact that the screenplay gets worse and worse.

If I were you, I would find something else to watch.

Wish there was someone to tell me the same before I started."
10.0,3 August 2019,"Ok, maybe I am gushing a bit with a 10 out of 10 rating. But this show is absolutely brilliant, dark, addictive, and totally fresh. It has been a long time since I last binge watched a show like an addict, since Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, The Killing, Madmen, etc. It is genius on all levels: character development, acting, tension, intrigue, suspense, originality, and yes, occasionally filthy, black, and brilliant laugh out loud comedy. This is a great study of good, evil, and the human condition... and more specifically, the corporate American human condition. I have been loving every minute of it. Highly recommended."
10.0,26 July 2019,"I am a Superman fan, and this completes me. Dark, funny, and sick as _______"
6.0,26 July 2019,"Behold the superheroes of Vought, smarmy and jaded. They are peddled by their rep (played by Elizabeth Shue, in a superb expression of creepy corporate greed). They don't do good for good's sake, and they don't care about you and me, or the cities where they supposedly fight crime. When Hughie (played by Jack Henry Quaid)'s girlfriend is plowed down by one of them and dies, he joins The Boys, to fight back against the supes and to right wrongs. Karl Urban is in this gem of a series, too. And he's GREAT. Watch his fight set to the strains of ""London Calling"" ...and yes, that's Simon Pegg playing Hughie's Dad! And yes, Seth Rogen has something to do with the script! I am dazzled by all this! Yay! What more would anyone want? Grade: B+"
10.0,26 July 2019,"Ein absolutes Muss, super Schauspieler und eine fantastische Story."
10.0,2 August 2019,"One of the best shows I watched in the past year! Not a typical superheroes them, deadpool style with a twist."
10.0,27 July 2019,This is what the world would be like if superheroes really exist.... love it
10.0,3 August 2019,"I can't say anything as it'll be a spoiler. But! If you don't like Marvel or DS then you'll love this. If you love Marvel or DS then you will love this. If you want to experience first class action, acting, direction and something new and bloody great! This is for you."
10.0,2 August 2019,Binge worthy! One of the best shows I've seen. Very funny.
10.0,27 July 2019,"With all the cringe content available of different streaming platforms, The Boys was a welcome change. I really liked the settings, dialogues and characters. Each characters is relatable to people we see around us, with character flaws of each making them unique from other superhero sagas. I liked the overall tone and message this show sends out to people. However, last 3 episodes took a very fast and boring turn. Looks like writers were in a hurry to reach the end, so they just let go of a good 5 episode buildup. Everything felt rushed and story did not make much sense after that. Also, this show has one of the worst cliffhangers I have ever witnessed. It's definitely worth a watch, and I would have rated it better, if only the drama was played out properly."
10.0,27 July 2019,"Wanted a show with this concept for a long time and the show doesn't disappoint at all.after all the marvel movies it's a nice addition to the whole genre and it's freaking R rated I mean story is great ,acting is pretty good ,pacing is what it should be and effects are pretty cool but can be pretty ugly at the same time depending on the scene demanded by the story (VFX is gooood)"
10.0,3 August 2019,I went in not sure what to expect. And boy am I glad I gave this one a go. It's dark. It's funny. Characters you like. Good story. Absolutely awesome show. I cannot wait for season 2.
6.0,29 July 2019,"Nice satire on a well saturated genre. I liked how the show handled the mix of dark humor, drama and over the top violence. Though not all characters are well developed and fleshed out as the Butcher and Homelander, it is enough to grip us through the 8 episodes. Between this show and the Umbrella Academy over at Netflix, it shows that you don't necessarily want to have the Marvel/DC tag to produce gripping Superhero tales."
4.0,24 June 2022,Well written and action packed. If you love superhero's and you love good drama and action. Look no further than the boys. Amazing show. Each season gets better and better.
10.0,28 July 2019,"What if people you knew in the real world we're superheroes. What if you took away the word ""Heroes"". Now if you want to take a chance in life for that's the show you would be watching. You see the big brand names all day, everyday brainwashing you of a World of corporate whitewashed Superheroes. The comic books, magazines, TV show and movies making you believe that is going to be all good and gravy, but in the real world that you actually live in that's will not the case. ""The Boys"" is the best opportunity to see a real world scenario of what superheroes would be really like if they were in the prime universe aka our Universe!!

ENJOY"
9.0,3 August 2019,I've binged the entire series in just one day. And can definitely recommend it to anyone who is tired of the constant stream of new pg superhero movies.
10.0,4 August 2019,"This is absolutely amazing! I loved this series was surprising, entertaining, funny (dark), exciting, satiric.

It was 8 episodes that flew by way, way too fast, and i can't wait until season 2.

This has the freshness ""Watchmen"" had when it came out, just better i think, and a big middle finger too all the corporate spinning, social medias and what is important in today's society.

I don't write many reviews in here, but had to do it for this series, it is worth it, trust me!"
9.0,3 August 2019,I've never even given the time to write a review on here but this series was just absolutely brilliant. I won't say anymore other than just watch it! 🔥🔥🔥
10.0,28 September 2022,"The show starts great, new and refreshing plot, interesting characters & well made Visual effects, and kept well written until seasons 1 finishes.

After that, same old typical Hollywood shows, got dragged up to make more seasons & more money, which drastically affected the Quality of the show in all aspects.

They tried to make up for the pathetic situation with needless extreme scenes, either Graphical violence or explicit & pointless scenes, just to make weird situations. Even made some crappy scenes in terms of visual effects, seemed very rushed & fill in gaps & minutes.

In summary, just watch season 1 & stop, go watch something else."
10.0,16 July 2024,"Seasons 1 and 2 would be right up there as a 9.

Season 3 was still strong at a 7 or an 8 at a stretch.

But what has happened to season 4?

I love my horror and sci fi genres. I dont mind gore and graphic violence. But season 4 takes the foundations of the first few seasons and over amplifies them in all the worst ways.

The boys always had shocking scenes but they were spread out enough for you to keep wanting more whilst maintaining your interest in the captivating story of flawed superheros.

Season 4 throws you into a world where pronouns are seemingly integral, characters become gay on a whim and overdramatised violence is constant with no regard for a progressional story line.

If anything sums this series up for me its a human centipede rim job.

Just well and truly over it.

Id rather be at the end of the centipede than hear another nonsense pronoun in a tv show. Gen V had all the warning signs. What has the world come to."
9.0,18 June 2022,"I can't get enough of this. Well done to everyone involved. If you're looking for a new show to watch, I highly recommend this. Especially if you have the stomach for it."
9.0,27 July 2019,"A lot of the reviews are having a dig at the show because it's not like the comics. I've read them, I'm a huge fan of them and there is no chance that what is in the books could have ever been filmed or allowed to be shown. Taking the show on its own merits its fantastic fun that I'd definitely recommend anyone watching."
7.0,26 July 2019,"Dark,Fast paced,Entertaining and to the point.Awesome show and Awesome cast."
10.0,27 July 2019,"Surprisingly good from a guy who went from a B grade network show to a very well refined television series. Big fan of the original comics, it takes a few departures from the original content but nevertheless it still great. It's a good new take for the bloodthirsty adults who aren't into Marvel as much or have gotten superhero fatigue."
10.0,27 July 2019,This realy is a breath of fresh air! just watch it!!
8.0,27 July 2019,"This show has it all. A great plot, gore, the occasional humor, and so much more. I started the first episode and finished the series in a day because it was able to keep my attention that well. This show is like if the Avengers moveis were in the dark DC universe, with a Jon Bernthal Punisher atmosphere and action. It is a great show and I get the feeling the second season is going to be just as great, after how the first ended...."
10.0,16 April 2024,"I began to watch The Boys because of Homelander played by Antony Starr but ended up loving the other characters of the show almost as much as him or even more.

The plot wouldn't be nearly as good without the amazing cast of characters but that is the charm of the show.

In the latest season of the show (Which is total madness of fun) came a character known as Soldier Boy played by Jensen Ackles. He stole the spotlight through out the season with his unpredictable actions and dialog.

The show can get really crazy (especially in season 3) which is not for everyone but for me it was fine.

But yeah, if you are into superhero media like Invincible or Peacemaker, then this show will take you through a rollercoaster of fun."
10.0,8 July 2022,"The Boys shows you what would happen if people had super powers in the real world. It's funny, gritty and better than anything Marvel or DC is putting out."
10.0,13 July 2022,"First 2 seasons are great, Season 3 is pointless and full of adds (the white claw add is so obvios is painful)

Very Disappointed. Hope they make a better 4th season."
10.0,4 August 2019,"Yeah. It's really original and a breath of fresh air. The characters are all really well fleshed out, with constant engaging plot twists. It deserves a lot larger fan base."
9.0,3 August 2019,"I was so excited to watch this series after seeing the trailers! A dark twist to the typical superhero genre... I grew up as a 90's kid and indulged myself with comics and Saturday morning cartoons. The Boys shows a different side of super heroes, flawed and remarkably talented - something that finally shows the other side of heroism."
7.0,9 July 2022,
9.0,27 July 2019,"I'm heavily into the MCU films; they're extraordinary to me. So when I saw the trailer for ""The Boys"" I was immediately interested. I had feelings it may be kinda over-done due to how excessive the trailer was, but man, it really blew my expectations out of my head. With laser beams.

Plot- A man hellbent on vengeance (although not explained right away) aims to take down the corrupt superhero organization ""The Seven"" which just acquired a new, innocent hero. He seeks the help of a young man who lost his girlfriend in a superhero accident, and from there it completely rocks you. I thought at first ""how will they do it?"" But the show is purely clever. The plot never slags.

Writing- I thought this show would totally rely on non-stop profanity, sex, violence. While it is heavily explicit, the show pops with its highly likeable and multifaceted characters, a wild storyline, intensity, and most of all- substance.

Characters/Acting- While not every single character gets an extensive backstory (no idea who Black Noir is but he looks cool and doesn't speak) I still felt myself feeling for them. The Seven ""heroes"" are always interesting even though you might not see exactly what they are totally capable of. Homelander is completely chilling as a manipulative Superman-esque figure. The actors have the power to make you tear up. Perfect casting (although I'm not a fan of Elizabeth Shue... woman stop smiling in every scene!)

Quality- It's got a gritty, yet focused style that truly has some good special EFX. The violence is very realistic yet downright nasty and relentless. The cinematography is awesome, very tense. The music is great, often starting the show with a quick song snippet and an inciting incident.

Overall, if you like action, dramedy, and can handle gore, you should not turn it down. Every episode felt like a movie- there was no slag in the story (unlike Netflix's shows that continually waste whole entire episodes monotonously chatting.) If you have Prime and like a wild show every now and then, check it. I hope it comes out on a physical release someday."
10.0,1 August 2019,"I totally loved it! It's like X-men exposed. Great storyline, great acting, and awesome directing. Total home run"
10.0,2 August 2019,It's dope. It ended great. Season 2 will be the jam. End of review.
10.0,28 July 2019,"I'm tired of all the generic superhero stuff, but this show has a very realist outlook on how such great powers can abused and manipulated for dark, selfish, and monetary reasons. It's just a very fresh perspective."
10.0,27 July 2019,"Now I have to wait for Season 2. Really good show. Interesting, mostly well written, kept me engaged. Basically a mashup of the X-Men and The Tick. Season ending didn't wrap up nearly as much as I would have liked. Worth your time!"
9.0,13 October 2020,Am I missing something here? Season 1 was exceptional but season 2 has been a complete drag. Am trying so hard to force myself to finish it.
10.0,27 July 2019,"I was so skeptical about this show at first, but now it's one of my favorites of this year. It has a clear personality, with colorful characters and tense plots that keep you guessing where it will go next. In my eyes, this has the potential to be one of the better shows I've seen. If you're tired of the MCU nonsense, this is the superhero fix you've been wanting all along."
10.0,26 July 2019,I wasn't sure how this was going to be. After watching the first episode I am hooked!!!
7.0,9 October 2020,"Story-line => 5/5 (The concept of an anti-superhero universe is unique and the story is amazing as it moves forward.); Acting => 5/5 (The acting was well-synced and awesome. Homelander and Butcher's acting was always on another level.); Directing => 5/5 (The presentation is nice and the show sticks you like glue); Visual Effects => 5/5 (Diabolical); Screenplay => 5/5 (The characters were portrayed very nicely and in a very realistic way.); Personal Recommendation => 5/5 (Well the show contains many graphic and adult contents. If you think these bothers you, you should hold off. Otherwise it is beyond amazing); Most Favorite Character => Butcher (When the series started, Butcher seemed like a bully and pushy character. With the passage of time, we got to see his many sides, and now, he is my most favorite one. Also, Homelander is the most favorite one for phenomenal acting. );

Overall Personal Rating => 10/10"
9.0,7 August 2024,"""The Boys"" is a groundbreaking web series that has redefined the superhero genre with its dark, satirical, and unapologetically gritty narrative. Premiering on Amazon Prime Video, this series, based on the comic book of the same name by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson, presents a world where superheroes, or ""supes,"" are not the paragons of virtue typically seen in traditional comic books. Instead, they are flawed, corrupt, and often morally bankrupt individuals, driven by greed, power, and a desire for celebrity status. This subversion of the superhero archetype is one of the show's most compelling features, providing a fresh and cynical perspective on the genre.

At the heart of ""The Boys"" is the titular group, a ragtag team of vigilantes led by Billy Butcher (played by Karl Urban), whose mission is to expose the truth about the supes and the powerful corporation Vought International that controls them. Butcher's personal vendetta against Homelander (Antony Starr), the most powerful and sociopathic supe, drives much of the series' tension and drama. The dynamic between Butcher and his team members, including Hughie Campbell (Jack Quaid), Mother's Milk (Laz Alonso), Frenchie (Tomer Capon), and Kimiko (Karen Fukuhara), adds depth to the narrative, showcasing themes of loyalty, revenge, and the fight for justice in a corrupt world.

One of the series' strengths lies in its ability to blend intense action with sharp social commentary. ""The Boys"" is not just a show about superpowers and explosive battles; it is a biting critique of contemporary society, exploring issues such as corporate greed, media manipulation, and the cult of celebrity. The supes, managed by Vought, are depicted as commodities, their images carefully curated and marketed to the public. This reflection of real-world celebrity culture and corporate exploitation adds a layer of realism to the fantastical elements of the series.

Moreover, ""The Boys"" does not shy away from depicting the brutality and consequences of violence. The graphic and often shocking scenes serve to underscore the moral ambiguities of its characters and the world they inhabit. This unflinching portrayal of violence and its impact is a stark contrast to the often sanitized action sequences found in mainstream superhero media, making ""The Boys"" stand out as a more mature and thought-provoking alternative.

The performances in ""The Boys"" are another standout aspect. Karl Urban's portrayal of Billy Butcher is intense and charismatic, capturing the character's relentless drive and underlying pain. Antony Starr's Homelander is chillingly effective, embodying the menacing charm and hidden psychopathy of a supe gone rogue. The supporting cast, including Erin Moriarty as Starlight, Jessie T. Usher as A-Train, and Dominique McElligott as Queen Maeve, deliver nuanced performances that add complexity to their characters.

Visually, the series is impressive, with high production values evident in its special effects, cinematography, and set design. The urban landscapes and corporate environments are meticulously crafted, creating a believable and immersive world. The attention to detail in both the mundane and the extraordinary aspects of the setting helps ground the fantastical elements in a recognizable reality.

""The Boys"" is a masterful blend of action, drama, and satire, offering a unique take on the superhero genre that challenges conventional narratives and explores darker, more complex themes. Its success lies in its ability to entertain while provoking thought and reflection on the nature of power, corruption, and heroism. As it continues to push boundaries and defy expectations, ""The Boys"" has firmly established itself as a must-watch series that resonates with audiences looking for something different from the typical superhero fare."
9.0,29 July 2019,"Such an awesome take on superheroes. There are absolutely hilarious moments, heart wrenching moments, exhilarating action, and underlying truth to this show. This show personifies corporate greed on the grand scale. Seth Rogan and co. are on fire."
10.0,21 July 2023,We have a image in our mind that all super heros are good and trust worthy but what if its wrong.. This series shows us dark side of super heroes which is quite interesting to watch.. From the beginning itself the series holds you to your seat.. Superbly written you'll enjoy each and every minute...... I liked butcher and also homelander the actors acted so well.. If you are someone who loves super hero fiction kind of shows then you are gonna enjoy it... But there are some scenes which are a bit violent and dark so if you are okay then please go ahead and watch it.... Overall i would say its a good show..
10.0,2 August 2019,"Brilliant stuff, was gripped from the start, it's a shame they took away the Scottish element of the main character but I am biased I guess. Really enjoyed the show and the numerous punchers throughout"
10.0,16 June 2022,"I can not say enough about this show. It's twisted on every level. Brilliant. Sure sometimes it shocks just for the sake of shocking but that's ok. This season definitely has one part that is probably the most shocking thing I've seen in a TV show lol. I probably could of lived without seeing that but it's ok. It's the Boys so I expect to be shocked. The acting is top notch. The story of homelander story is fascinating. Each season keeps getting better.

It's been so long since I've anticipated a show dropping a new episode. Every Friday morning I wake up like a kid on Christmas and watch the new episode of The Boys."
10.0,26 March 2022,This show was very fun. A big escape from the Marvel nonsense. And then the wokes got ahold of it and made it about politics... because they can't handle making a fun show without infusing the bull.
10.0,7 August 2019,"Only 3 episodes in but this show is the nuts. I imagine if people did have powers, THIS is what it would be like, not avengers risking their lives just for the greater. With power comes great responsibility but also greater temptation, and in a world where a lot of peoples validation now comes from their revenue, I believe the superhero world has (and most probably will) never be depicted with this much truthfulness."
10.0,3 August 2019,Fabulous show! Really enjoyed it. Looking forward to season 2. Well worth a watch.
7.0,8 December 2020,This show is off the chart. Every single scene is a masterpiece.
1.0,24 June 2022,"It's the gift that keeps on giving.

Send the kids to sleep and buckle up for one hell of a ride!

It's so fresh, unlike anything ok TV right now and it's got it all. You name it, the boys got it."
10.0,27 July 2019,Unique context and great choice of language. No episode fails to amaze ya. Waiting for a season 2 already.
10.0,27 July 2019,"Very well executed, great casting, great storyline to begin with. Stunning, twisted, but not so dark that it overshadows the plot. Highly recommend."
10.0,29 July 2019,"After decades of brilliant superhero based films and shows, focusing on the heroes and their unrelenting sense of morality and righteousness, which of course can be boring at times. When of course heroes only ever do the right things and sometimes refuse to sacrifice for the greater good, it can sometimes be somewhat annoying.

However this show, revolves around a small group of people that are sick and tired of heroes does the exact opposite of this. The 'supes' in this show are selfish and morally debatable, and that in itself is refreshing. The show of course depicts people trying to prove that superheroes aren't super at all but are just selfish and destructive. Which gives a refreshing twist to the common superhero formula.

Its filmed very well and contains what some would consider an overly large amount of gore and nudity and unnecessary violence, but i am fairly contempt with.

I would strongly recommend watching this."
9.0,1 August 2019,"The thing I enjoyed the most about this series is how multidimensional it is. On the surface, the characters look like Marvel and DC knockoffs. In reality, the characters from ""The Boys"" have more depth than any of the traditional comic franchises. The series tag line is about ""heroes"", but after watching it I feel like there were no heroes or villains - just broken people reacting to circumstances. It left me replaying scenes on my mind and questioning the morality of each character. This series has sharp edges. It is as funny as it is dark. Most of all, it's brilliant."
10.0,14 October 2020,"I really enjoy the series. Creative story telling and some very funny dialogue. I'm not happy that they went back to weekly episode releases, but it is what it is.

The only thing I don't enjoy about the series is the constant political agenda that's pushed down your throat. You can clearly see that the writers and directors have established symbolic ""democrats"" and ""republicans"" in the series have pushed their agenda. Keep the series about the story and don't push the politics."
10.0,23 June 2024,"To call the boys the most smutty , abhorring and disgusting show ever would be an understatement. It's unbelievable how these shameless actors can sell their soul and agree to act in such heinous and filthy roles. I hope the producers and directors of this show have their kids watching this and turn out to be equally perverted and disgusted as they are trying masses to b through this disease of a show called the boys.

At first, I dismissed many scenes as typical of the modern soft porn genre, but the scenes in the first few episodes of season 4 are so extreme that even the most explicit ones would seem tame or bizarre in comparison.

Don't come to my screen with such filth, keep it to yourself and show it to your kids . If I could challenge it in court I most certainly would but there has to be a limit to the amount of obscenity that they can show to the mobs."
10.0,5 April 2024,"Went into this show thinking I wouldn't like it. Now I'm counting down the days till S4. Can't recommend it enough but if you're a prude def not for you. Homelander is easily one of the most diabolical villains in the last 15 years. It's got a little bit of every genre and keeps you intrigued every episode. The casting , dialect, and special effects makes it feel like a movie and not an Amazon Prime series. Antony Starr deserves all the praise. Having only seen him in Cobweb, his performance is outstanding. The raunchiness, gore, sex, all plays its own part in the show and making it standout. The actors are what makes it the best !!"
9.0,2 August 2019,"It has got dark humour almost everybody will love it , already waiting for season 2."
6.0,29 July 2019,"This series is what series should be. Natural behavior. Good acting. Good CGI. With all that, any story will fit.

The plot is also good, giving a different view.

This is a series that Netflix managers should watch, recently theres only garbage, i'm changing to Prime."
10.0,26 July 2019,"Finally something new, Amazon dared to create a super heroes series completely different form what we are used to from marvel, netlifx and cw. I have ""the boys"" succeed so other companies will have the courage to do something new, because right now 90% of TV series are all the same."
10.0,31 December 2020,After watching The Boys your attitude to superheroes is going to be changed undoubtedly. Marvel or DC will not rehabilitate it. This is a masterpiece.
9.0,28 July 2019,"Listen here you little bums, I want SEASON 2 and I WANT IT NOW. If I don't get a new season in 30 ('Terty' as Butcher would say) I will be SUING JEFF BEZOS AND AMAZON FN PRIME. THANK YOU"
8.0,10 August 2019,"This show is fantastic because it is next level in terms of the layers to its characters, as well as the story arcs, and the world in the show as a whole. The acting is fantastic, and the show gives a great assessment of the state of power and corruption - particularly in the corporate and political realm - and how it impacts the rest of humanity. It's smart, exceptionally violent, hilarious, and a surprisingly deep show."
10.0,4 August 2019,"Really refreshing. I am a big fan of DareDevil. After watching 3 episodes, so far find the story/screenplay absolutely original, dare I say better than DareDevil! Give it a chance."
10.0,14 September 2020,"The first season had a solid storyline, The second season is all over the place and doesn't what it's trying to say. Like West World it runs out of steam and there's no narrative."
10.0,21 September 2020,"What can I say, Billy and Hughey are like batman and robin to homalnders 'superman'. I tried to explain this show to a non- comicbook reader simply by saying ""what would we do IF Superman was real and went insane"". The interactions between the characters is really smart, not cheesy like a soap or sitcom. It feels authentic. Then we get the 'magic' of supes having feelings too. :) I can't hardly wait for the next episode."
10.0,15 November 2020,"You can't leave it until you will finish it. Only one bad thing in this show. And its that you have to do wait for Next season. Homelander Looks Better than Superman for me

Everyone in this show is awesome. Breaking bad guy Gus fring was awesome."
6.0,2 August 2020,"This show will shock you, surprise you, and the worst part about it is: theres only eight episodes!! This is a show that spins the traditional superhero genre on its head. Not every person that claims to be a hero is a good person, much like today in our world with corrupt policeman. If you love superheroes, great storytelling, dark themes, and bloody violence, this show is for you."
1.0,7 August 2024,"I wish IMDB allowed users to rate each season separately because the show started on a high note and has been declining each subsequent season. So, I will put my season-wise ratings and super short reviews here,

Season 1: 9 (The best one. This got me hooked on The Boys universe so much that I watched each episode twice before the next episode)

Season 2: 8 (Another good season. Also watched every episode twice)

Season 3: 8 (Again, I enjoyed this one too)

Season 4: 7 (I didn't enjoy this season as much as the previous ones. The ending earned a point from me. Otherwise, it would have been a 6/10)

Season 5: - / 10 (I will update it after the last season airs)"
9.0,27 October 2020,"Honestly, this TV show is probably one of the only shows that I can say doesn't have a bad part - every episode was just as exciting as the other and had pretty much every aspect you could want in a TV show, you need to watch this."
8.0,4 August 2019,Amazon out did themselves on this series. Taking the whole Superhero storyline and making them human with powerful flaws. Fantastic dialogue and acting.
10.0,6 October 2020,"The boys is an unique take on Superhero shows that might change the perspective how we see Superheroes.

The boys is well written, phenomenal performance by the lead, stunning effects, unpredictable plot that elevates this show. Showrunner Kirpke has made some clever changes which would satisfy the fans.

Karl Urban and Antony Starr are the Star of the shows. Starr as Homelander is one of the best villain's of all time. the action scenes, gore are handed really well.

The boys is faithful to it's comic and also erases certain elements which are clever . Season 2 may be slow at parts but it picks up brilliantly. the pacing is fantastic.

Mostly Superhero Tv Show effects won't be impressive but this show has nailed it. Homelander Laser scenes are done perfectly. The Dark Humor adds a bit of pleasure to the show.

If this show maintains the same momentum, this could be one of the greatest Tv Show of all time."
10.0,31 July 2019,Better than any other superhero series.Can't get enough of it. Get you addicted after 10 minutes.Very good concept and storyline that doesn't bore you for a millisecond. Good Acting by all of them. All Characters are Lovable.
10.0,14 September 2020,"From an intersting watch in the first season, the show drags on forever in the second season. Even the actors seem bored and non committal! Please send somebody to the writing department..."
10.0,14 June 2024,"Seems every show that is interesting in the first season degrades as the seasons go on, this one should have died last season. The first episode of this season has absolutely ruined this series for me. It started out awful and just got worse from there, I lost my desire to care what happens to the characters after they have perverted from their original incarnation.

Game of Thrones was good until the fourth season then even there it was hard to watch. I won't be continuing to watch this as there are lots of other more original stories to be unraveled with the time I have left in this so called life. I gotta get off this channel and go outside."
10.0,13 September 2019,This show is funny and smart. Super entertaining. After watching the first episode you will be hooked.
10.0,3 December 2023,
7.0,10 August 2019,"Well never expected that they would make the boys so perfectly, everything is so balanced.the violence,action,jawdropping moments everything is amazing,music is quite amazing too.only thing ate me up was cinematography.this is the most badass show i've seen in years."
4.0,10 August 2019,"Perfectly paints a picture of what superheroes would be like in real life and I cannot praise it enough for that. There's nothing wrong with the CGI-heavy movies in which superheroes are single handedly saving the world but this is a real nice breath of fresh air and a truly unique take on the genre. The acting is great, the characters are likeable, the humor is also really well done and will give you some proper laughs without distracting you away from the plot. The only bad thing I can say about this show is that the first season is too short at only 8 episodes and with an inconclusive ending... Feels like there should have been a few more episodes in the season after that, but nevertheless I'm excited and impatiently waiting for the second season. If you're reading this and haven't seen it yet then I strongly recommend that you do even if you're not a fan of the sci-fi/superhero genre. 10/10"
10.0,11 August 2024,"A fantastic and bloody show for nerds and normies, a fantastic mix of action, comedy and drama, its a well executed show about these regular folks like you and me trying to fix the world getting rid of these superheroes, they are definitely awful people both, there are no good guys, only awful people, Hughie after 4 seasons he is evil, Butcher it's obviously the last antagonist of the show, the fourth season it's obviously the worst for obvious reasons, it's simple not a good season if you compare to the other ones, but every show wants a season like season 4 to be honest, its definitely a good show guys, very good for all ages."
10.0,4 July 2022,Its an awesome show overall. Season 3 gets even better with Jensen Ackles. His screen presence is so dominant. A show is as good as its primary villain and boys gives you more than just one. Every character is very cast. Nice plot. Good pace. Good direction and screenplay. Very good performances.
10.0,2 August 2019,"Highly entertaining. Perfect balance of comedy, action, drama, and blood & gore. TV show of the year so far. Do yourself a favor and binge this one."
8.0,4 June 2022,"Back in the days I rated 9/10, but seeing this excelent acting from everyone of crew, dark humor, bloody scenes, twists. This is one of the best tv series in history. Antony Starr is amazing as big crybaby antihero. This show rules. Must to watch for everyone."
10.0,4 August 2019,"I'm surprised by all the 9 and 10 ratings for this show. It tries to be a lot of different genres without ever being excellent at any of them. Definitely worth watching, but not great yet."
8.0,15 July 2022,"If I were to rate season 1, I would put 9 or 10; season 2 would get a 7. Season 3 shows a degradation of this show and the inability to add anything new to the topic. I think the creators wanted to shock the viewers with gore, but it is an old trick, which is usually used to fill the gaps in the plot. Even though each episode had a lot of action, the season was dull and predictable overall. The creators made the main protagonists so irritating and toxic that I rooted for Homelander, who had to represent a creepy evil megalomaniac. I skipped all of Butcher's dialogues because I could not care less for him or his motives. The creators made him particularly toxic and irritating. Hughie remains a whiny loser who is always the third wheel anywhere he goes. The rest of the crew represent dependent whiny idiots who have literally no motivation to continue fighting with supes. On the plus side, Ackles' character was good, and Maeve was interesting to watch."
10.0,27 July 2019,"So, this is hands down one of the most unexpected things i ever experienced. - This was so unbelievable good, binged it all in one go! couldn't stop! I am now a die-hard fan. This is the best writing, acting .. well heck, this is one of the best things i ever watched.

and i cannot wait for more! 10/10 without a doubt."
8.0,27 July 2019,"Perfection, kinda reminded me of FireFly in some aspects, i really love this show, hope for more of ""The Boys"" next year"
7.0,27 July 2019,"And it's so good. Half way thru this crazy ride, don't want it to end. It's the; funny, crude, violent, personal side of superheroes."
5.0,19 September 2020,"Eric Kripke in a recent interview asked not to hate the show because of the ridiculous decision to release an episode weekly. Dont worry, we dont. But we do hate the unparalleled level of arrogance you have to punish the viewers all to stretch out the weeks your show stays on top. I didnt cancel my cable just to go back to watching cable, whats next? Commercials? Censorship? Binge is in, if you havent noticed.

The show is a 10/10, great cast and fun story. Too bad they ruined it, 5/10 now, sorry."
9.0,29 July 2019,Definitely the best series of the year! I guarantee you will fall in love with it.
10.0,19 August 2022,Loved the first and second season. Bucket loads of blood and sexual perversion. Third season gets political. Total turn off. Hollywood can't stop shoving their agendas down our throat.
10.0,30 July 2020,"Binge watched entire Season 1 in like a day! Great mishmash of suoerhero franchises like MCU & DC, an evil corporation & social media. Very relatable, esp refreshing to see the darker side of superheroes!"
9.0,5 June 2022,"The quest to create the perfect human using secret methods is as old as time - Hitler invented cocaine in his efforts to create a super human military. I normally like reading reviews but most here are, not surprisingly, from a very young crowd who mainly see this as a new twist on the super hero theme. All in all, it's a well done fantasy with great attention to detail right down to the cheap gaudy costumes, dramatization of the idiotic way the public reacts to celebrities, how celebrities control the media, and how the giant corporations control politics. It's very graphic & violent w/fetish situations. The characters are people we get to know and have an investment in even if we don't necessarily like them. Lots of interesting characters, situations, & surprises. It's dark but humorous although not in the black humor genre. I haven't gotten to S3 yet so the many saying the series bends to the woke theme at that point, I haven't experienced. But so far it's more of a lens at how rediculous the far end of each narrative is. All I can say on that is, anyone who sees Homelander as a rep of the Republicans had an extremely warped sense of what the Republicans actually stand for. But I guarantee many libs watching think that's exactly what they stand for. But I see this as more of an extreme caraciture of how the media interprets ideals, and in that sense it's intended as a sad comment on those who buy into their hype."
10.0,18 September 2020,"Season 1 was superb and I don't need to say any more on that. I remember reading that due to the success if season 1, season 2 was going to have a shed load of money spent on it so I went into this expecting something extravagant and jaw dropping but it doesn't seem to be happening.

Although this show knocks spots off the CW's Wokefests such as Supergirl and The Flash, the producers of those shows at least take the trouble to show their characters doing stuff on screen that relates to their super powers. Supergirl flies, The Flash runs...

In this season of the Boys I don't think Homelander has actually flown yet. Yes we see him land and there was one 0.5 second shot where he flew across the a city sky. Freight Train cant run due to a heart condition (A convenient money saving plot line) and the creepy fish man has been interviewing potential victims to marry. There was some action at the end of episode 2 but for the most part this is just a moody drama.

I'm still looking forward to the rest with hope that something spectacular will happen. I'm writing this after watching episode 5. I gave it 7 out of 10 because I think the acting is good and the whole thing looks like an expensive movie but it is at the moment beginning to induce sleep."
10.0,15 October 2020,"There is a noticeable drop off in quality of plot and script between the two seasons, so despite the same actors and the same general innuendo, season 2 feels relatively dull and vapid. I'm hoping that season 3 returns to the glory of the first season....they had a good thing going there for a while."
9.0,10 August 2022,
10.0,4 September 2019,I gave this a 10 because it wasn't a consensus of 9 yet... and it CERtainly deserved at least that much... great idea...well executed... i wasn't sure to begin with...but it got such a high rating HERE that i thought i'd give it a chance...so glad i did... great surprise ending...i'm pretty good at guessing stuff... this ending never even beGAN to occur to me... enjoy...can't wait for s02...and no doubt about it...there WILL be a s02...
6.0,25 May 2020,"Very entertaining, well acted, and a times hilariously over the top- The Boys may not be as unique as people say it is, but it has enough clever and fun moments to make for a more than decent time. The casting is surprisingly very well done, with Karl Urban as Billy Butcher being the overall stand out of the show- and most likely proving to be quite an iconic character for future watchers. Other notable performances include Jack Quaid as Hughie, Antony Starr as Homelander, and Erin Moriarty as Starlight. The idea is a fresh concept and it can lead to some ridiculous and often fun situations over time, but often enough, The Boys seems to rely too much on tropes from previous superhero entity's before it, and it feels a bit too predictable and formulaic for its own good. That being said, if you can push aside the lower quality standards of writing throughout the show, and focus on the pure entertainment value, the show will be incredibly easy to watch. At times it does take a dip or two on pacing, but for the most part, The Boys is able to be a quite entertaining and interesting satire with some quite clever ideas. Some moments in the show seem a bit too drawn out, and there are quite a few plot holes within the show that are never really explained. It's characters are interesting to watch, but before you get to dive deeper into each of them, they can seem a bit generic and a bit of a copy off of other characters from D.C. comics- such as Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Starfire, and Superman. However, if you are looking for a fun and raunchy watch that can surprise you at times and entertain you pretty much all throughout, The Boys is the show for you. It lacks the strengths that other recent superhero television shows, such as The Umbrella Academy, have in terms of unique formation of story and situations, but it has enough to keep you going and more than enough to keep you wanting more. My Rating: 8.75/10

Season 2 was fantastic, very few seasons have been as consistent and breathtaking to watch as that one, especially that season finale.

Season 2 Rating: 10/10"
10.0,2 August 2019,"What's great about 'The Boys' is the envelope doesn't just get pushed they pick it up and throw it for a mile. A superhero themed show that gets into the weeds concerning the mentality of a world that commercializes humans with gifted powers has never before been told in such a pragmatic way. It's really hard to believe this isn't exactly how the world would be if hero with powers like superman and aquaman actually existed. The nuances of this series are astounding it really delves deep psychologically without going all out Sigmund Freud. The special effects are used perfectly and look amazing the acting across the board is timely and crafted specifically for the tone of each episode and there isn't much I can say that doesn't bode well for 'The Boys' except it's name. 'The Boys', I thought by watching each episode and really trying to extrapolate the defining messages that were coming across I would be able to figure it out but no. The truth is there's no good reason they call it 'The Boys' or why the original creators came up with that name ots really the biggest mystery revolving around this series and the main reason it isn't a 10 on my list. With that being said I would recommend this series for all adults to see and rate it a 9 which garners Heavy Worship and should be a show that everyone should see."
10.0,9 July 2022,The series has been bulding strong interesting and compelling characters for 3 seasons straight and the story makes for an epic disturbing yet so much fun result. Everyone from the writers to the directors and the cast are incredible at what they do. Can't wait for season 4.
10.0,2 July 2021,"""The Boys"" is simply superb! An extremely adult take on the superhero genre, this series is DEFINITELY NOT for kids. Some of the violence and gore is even more intense than anything on ""The Walking Dead"" or ""Game Of Thrones"" and sex is equally over the top. It's got some of the sickest humor on TV right now but it's got drama as well and plenty of action. ""The Boys"" is pretty much everything you'd want in a series. The acting is superb, the casting is spot on and the production values rival those of a big action Hollywood movie. Each season plays out like an extremely fast paced, 8 hour film.

With this said, it's not a series for everyone. Some might thing this is just another ""superhero"" TV show yet nothing could be further from the truth. ""The Boys"" brings the superhero genre down to earth and begs the question of ""what if"" these supernatural humans were among us? Would they work for an almighty corporation like Vought? Would they have genuine private lives? Would they be like Hollywood stars? The premise keeps getting interesting as the show moves along.

Can't wait to watch the 3rd season. Fair to say this is my favorite series right now and a worthy replacement for those of us who still miss great shows like ""Game Of Thrones"" and ""Breaking Bad"". Yup, it is THAT good!

11 out of 10!"
10.0,14 June 2022,"Why isn't this guy in every third movie being made in Hollywood. He killed it in Banshee and he is absolutely, can not look away from the screen, amazing in this show. Either his agent secretly hates him or Hollywood just sucks that much.

Imagine this show with literally anyone else playing Homelander. You can't, right? 11/10."
10.0,18 October 2020,The best show since Breaking Bad. At the edge of my seat and can't miss a second of dialogue. I will rewind it if I have to. I give this a 10 and cannot wait for the third season. 👏👏👏 I'm not a comic fan at all but this got me. Got me real bad.
9.0,26 September 2020,Season 1 shocked us and kept us on our toes. Season 2 is a disappointing snoozefest.
10.0,3 August 2019,Just finished the season and it's amazing! It's a breath of fresh air when it comes to superheroes.
9.0,17 August 2022,"Is Your idiot Brain Getting F£&@?d By Stupid?

Nothing can top that line from the man himself Homelander and he's one of the best villains that I have seen for a long time, the actor should be really proud of his work he did an amazing job and the rest of the crew are amazing as well but Antony Starr easily stole the show for me."
7.0,24 October 2020,"Best show on Amazon Prime! So dark, so funny, so different. Well written and so human...or as human as superheroes can get :)"
1.0,16 August 2019,"Best series to binge watch. I'm not usually into sci-fi/hero films/tv however due to the positive reviews I gave it a watch and was very impressed.

Good story; Karl really plays the part well."
9.0,19 August 2019,This is one of the best tv shows on at the moment. A different take on the superhero genre.
9.0,7 October 2024,"This is the perfect combination between brutal, dark, controversial, and funny, and sarcastic, witty. What I love about this show is how the scenes can go from very serious to funny and ironic.

The actors are cast perfectly for their roles, and every character is well written with a good story and development.

I think the boys is almost 10x better than Marvel and Dc. Everything about it is better, the characters, the actors, the plot, the brutality, the sarcasm and the irony.

I think it's hilarious how this show portraits the American politics and propaganda.

You can almost call it a parody of the American government.

Season one started of great, and season two was even better in my opinion. Season three is probably my favorite season and that's because of the fight scenes and because of a lot of characters backstory's. Many people thinks that season four is far from as good as the other seasons, but I enjoyed season four, and I saw it as kind of a build up to season five.

If you need a good watch, this is the perfect show for you. I binged it and it's probably my favorite show of all time."
10.0,2 September 2024,
8.0,26 July 2022,"This series has a lot of aspects to it that help make it a memorable show and one of these things is the characters in the series. All of the characters in this series are incredible and I love how unique they all are. Sure there are some characters that overlap and seem similar but for the most part, all of these characters are unique and feel like real people. I dare you to watch this series and either not relate to one of these characters or say that you know somebody just like one of them. Every single character in this series feels like a real human being who could exist in our world and this wouldn't have worked if the actors didn't help bring these characters to life.

Every single actor in this series is amazing and brings so much to their roles which helps make them feel real. Now, I would love to shout out every single actor in this series for the performances but there are so many good ones that I'm going to keep it to three. The first one I want to talk about is Antony Starr, who plays Homelander. He plays Homelander in such a way that you legit can see why everybody is scared of this man and how mentally unstable this guy is. I love the way he was able to effortlessly switch between being this mentally unstable guy to being this cool, calm, and collected guy in the public eye. The next standout actor for me was Karl Urban, who plays Billy Butcher. Now, Billy Butcher is the kind of character who you're not supposed to like at first but he plays this character in such a way that you can't help but love him. I also love how out of all the characters in this he has the most character growth and Karl Urban does an incredible job showing it. From when you first see Billy Butcher in season 1 to season 3 he changes so much and Karl Urban showed that growth all while still maintaining certain aspects of the character that everybody loves about him. The last person I want to talk about is Erin Moriarty, who plays Annie January/Starlight. Annie is legit described to be this sweet and innocent all-American girl who could've been a boring character but Erin Moriarty made her a memorable one. She helps make this character a badass and gives her so much more depth that makes the audience feel for her. Just like with Billy Butcher it's interesting to see the change from when we first see her to the last. I know I said I was only going to mention three but just a quick shout out to Jack Quaid, who plays Hughie Campbell, for playing a character that I related to way too hard.

But it's not just the memorable characters that helped make this show a standout amongst other superhero shows but the story as well. How many shows or movies have the plot of superheroes that are only in it for popularity and money and don't really give two damns about regular people without powers? Not too many which is why this show stands out above the rest. The audience gets to see the dark side of having powers and what some heroes might actually be thinking. Another aspect of the story that helps keep it original and unique are the twists that it takes. This show might not have too many plot twists in it but it does have enough to keep you on the edge of your seat and want to click that next episode button. I will say though that for me personally, and this is mainly for seasons 1 and 2, that there are some side stories that just bring the series to a halt. I understand and see why those stories needed to happen but for me, they didn't need to happen in every single episode.

But even with those side stories that make the series come to a halt the pacing for this series is incredible given how short it is. Each season is only 8 episodes alone with each episode pretty much being an hour long and they keep it going smoothly. None of the episodes feel like filler episodes or that any parts in the episodes are rushed. Every moment in this series moves organically and helps the audience feel like a fly on the wall the whole time.

Another aspect of this series that helps the audience feel like a fly on the wall is the directing which felt like it was done by one director and not fifteen. Lots of directors have their own style of filming which can bring some conflicts in how a series feels but here you can't tell. Just like with the directors this series obviously had a lot of different writers which once again just felt like one.

The writing for this series was phenomenal and mixed between serious and more comedic perfectly. It was also thanks to the great writing for this series that the characters got fleshed out and felt like real people. The writing never fully felt cheesy, although I will admit there were some lines that were eye-roll-worthy, and just felt like real people. I also loved the fact that this series was not afraid to deal with real-world issues and make references to things that we do all the time, helping make the viewer feel like a part of this world. The last thing I'll say is don't do what I did which is to analyze this series as I did this and noticed a few plot holes in the series and certain things that just didn't add up.

In the end, The Boys has a unique spin on the superhero series that has barely been done with an outstanding ensemble cast. It might not be the most perfect series but is still definitely worth the hype and I can't wait for season 4."
10.0,19 November 2020,"If I talk about the first season it's brilliant. It keeps you interested and excited with the turns, twists and thrills but when it comes to the second season it falls flat and immature like watching a half cooked story."
10.0,18 June 2024,"It's really too bad the writers/producers decided to take the series into pornographic waters. Scenes like the anal ala Human Centipede are totally unnecessary to further the plot of this series. As if the anal stuff wasn't enough, someone decided, hey let's have a person that splits into multiple bodies and, oh, let's make him naked and have his swinging member flopping all around in a fight scene. I guess the writers , directors and producers felt like the episodes wouldn't be good enough without throwing in some outrageous porno/gore scenes. Because the porno scenes, in particular, add nothing to the plot, it seems as though they were added to simply fill up a required time issue. Pitiful."
10.0,23 September 2019,"I'm thinking, ""Alright, another super hero lame-o,"" but, no, not lame. Not lame at all. This one surprised me right out of the gate with an ultraviolent scene that I did not see coming. Basically this show boils down to this: You know all the heroes in the Marvel and DC comics movies ? What if behind closed doors they weren't good guys at all, but instead were ego maniacal morally bankrupt monsters? Enter 'The Boys'. A group of vigilantes determined to bring the supposed super heroes down. If you like super violent, foul mouthed, darkly hilarious shows this is one you should at least give a look. Entertaining as Hell."

7.0,16 August 2022,"I just finished season 3 of The Boys and I'm absolutely stunned. I've never written a review before but when I finished this show I had to. Why is this show so great?

For starters the acting. The casting is FLAWLESS. Everyone in this show plays amazing! I have never before been so in love with a character arc in any show as I have with multiple of characters in this show. Every character adds to the show The writing in this show is just incredible. The character development, the humor, the plot twists, song choices. Everything!

I also really love the fact that it doesn't shy away from being extremty gory from time to time and this isnt just gore for the sake of gore. It ties together with the story every time.

This isn't your ordenary super hero show. I would argue that it's the complete opposite and If I had to pinpoint one bad thing about the show it would be that there are only 3 seasons."
5.0,15 September 2020,What happened to OTT .....if this is the format I am getting ...that is weekly episode.....no use paying for Amazon prime..... absolutely disgusted.
10.0,7 November 2020,I just love the every character and the story plot of this series. everything is so crazy and badass.. amazing.
10.0,30 July 2019,"The first four episodes are just downright amazing, reminiscentt of the times prior to all the PC/SJW nonsense. I had the time of my life throughout episode four, haven't laughed that hard in ages. Really great up until episode five.

Episode five itself isn't all that bad, but you notice that the tune of the series turns around from humor to darker and worse preachy. Yes, the PC crap slowly finds its way back sadly in to the series. Characters whine more, cry more, sorry for this and that, by the end of the season the humor is stale, stilted, rough and not in a good way as there can be funny rough humor but that wasn't it. You then start to have those token 'gay relationships' that has to be there to make that look normal as well like all other 'PC' series.

Not to spoil anything but the series opens up with a really funny moment that for a PC crowd may be hard to swallow, and regular folk laugh like crazy but this does not go unavenged sadly and we're back to the script of the past twenty years.

Not sure what happened, maybe producers, investors or otherwise saw the material up until episode 5+ and said it was too much out of line with the mainstream narrative and it had to be brought back in line or if this was the plan all along, to bait people to start watching then go back to regular PC 'programming'.

I started watching this series because of the humor element, and the return to saying and doing anything without having the make excuses for it later in some form of punishment for characters or constructed morals and that failed towards the end. For those that speed ran the series, reflect on this and rewatch it and you will eventually notice that the tone changed utterly from what it started as.

Cast itself, as you can see from the first four episodes, are really well put together and are able to deliver when they have great material. Karl Urban carries the show to some extent, but it is a team effort and the others do really well too.

My wish for season two, if I am ever to watch it, is that they go back to unapologetic delivery like they started off with, back to humor being front and center, and consequences of such be darned."
9.0,4 August 2019,"Like almost all great works of sci-fi, this beauty is not about what it looks it is about (""what if superheroes were corporate"" and dystopian reality grounded superheroes). This tv show is about our real life worshiped godlike humans: super famous actors, singers etc. It is also about corporations and how they influence the world around us.

I am amazed at how many people do not see this and thinks of this masterpiece as a new take on ""superhero"" genre."
9.0,2 August 2019,"Karl urban is jam up, plays the role damn well. Original idea, to me anyways, and well executed. Very mature stuff but that makes it good. A definite must see. Hey Heather!"
8.0,29 July 2019,This is an absolute brilliant show that I have been waiting for. In a age of super heroes movies and shows. this takes it to the next level by showing a very real scenario with gruesome reality. The characters are right from the start believable and epic .in some cases better than Marvel and DC comics characters if I may say. And the plot was just keeping me on the edge of my seat wanting more.. In the end I kept enjoying this show as i watched every episode . I truly recommend this to every person that can handle rated R films
9.0,17 August 2021,"Unfortunate that the rating system does not allow separate ratings for seasons. Like so many tv series, this increasingly overstays its welcome. So my rating is an average of the two.

Season 1 was great with a cute switcheroo of villans and heroes into anti-heroes and anti-villains. Production is great. Very worth watching. Series didn't take itself too seriously.

But once the starting premise got old, the second season gets into SNL level of parody aping everything from Xena warrior princess to The Politician. But worse, what started as a tongue-in-cheek twist starts to take itself too seriously and so becomes a parody of a parody with gratuitous violence and gore that serves no useful purpose. You can only see the head explode CGI so many times before it becomes a yawn.

Unless there is a Season 3 with some introspection to get back to the Season 1 level of interesting story lines, this will only appeal to the mindless violence and gore genre watchers of which there are plenty."
10.0,10 August 2024,"The boys started of with a bang. Season one was amazing, season 2 another banger. The first half of season three is good (not great). The later half sort of okay but from there it is going downhill. Season 4 is really really really boring. The same thing over an over again, the same scenario over an over again. Its boring me to death. I an just sticking to it because I am a commited person. I Don't know what season 5 holds. But if It's like this then I Won't start it at all. You want to show gruesome scene, sexual scene, its fine. But if the story is lackluster then there is no point. The balance is all wrong now. And what's wrong with starlight? She is becoming zombi each season."
10.0,23 June 2022,"This show is mind blowing but don't watch it if you don't like a bit of heavy language, gore, violence, nudity etc. The term Superhero is used loosely so don't expect the usual hero and villain that has been dished up in recent years."
6.0,3 August 2019,"I dont often write reviews for any shows or movies. However, this is right up there with the very best. It is brutal, funny, dark and visually amazing. Forget shows like the Flash or even agents of shield. These super heroes have issues, lots of them. Perverts, rapists and killing for fun. The way this is written and how it's been put together makes me enjoy this even more so than Stranger Things. Watch it you will love it."
4.0,4 July 2022,"But of course, it's not perfect or anything. I kinda don't like the quick cuts they do in the action scenes and they did get some woke stuff in there, but it's not too on the nose and people complaining about it are hilarious. I don't know what show they watched before season 3 if they think that now the show is political.

For now, I keep my rating on 9 and I'll change it after the whole show ends because it's fair to give a 10 then if they can end it well.

Anyway, about the show: Pretty much everything in this show is top-notch, from the direction, cinematography, and music choice, to the amazing acting from the whole cast but especially Karl Urban, and Antony Starr as Homelander. This guy has created and acted as one of the best and most memorable characters on tv and he deserves an award for his phenomenal acting.

This show is very mature in every way and most of the bad ratings you see are because they think the show is ""vile"" and against their religious upbringing or something. This show has everything, extreme violence, nudity and all that. (And lots of swearing, in case you're a weirdo who doesn't like that and thinks there shouldn't be swearing in movies and shows). So if you don't like this stuff please don't watch this and then ruin the rating by giving your dumb score because you were offended by one word in 23 hours of the show.

The story is really good and gets better with each season with new plot lines and great and iconic new characters. Writing is getting better in season 3 and the writers find really creative ways to make the show even more entertaining and not boring, like the way they did 2 flashbacks in episode 7 of season 3. Of course there are lots of clichés and tropes in the story, some that don't make sense at times and some that do, but they work really well for this story and you know what they say, if it ain't broke don't fix it.

In conclusion, the show is one of the most entertaining shows I've seen, with great acting and visual effects. It's one of the best most enjoyable shows I've seen.

As the disclaimer of season 3's episode 6 ""Herogasm"" said, ""this show (epsiode) is not suitable for any audience at all"". So be an adult and view it at your discretion."
10.0,26 July 2019,"We've just celebrated ten years of Marvel, Batman is about to be recast again and there is a very real risk of genre exhaustion. Suddenly The Boys arrives, a brilliant, complex, disturbing and dark reimagining of the classic heroes. Written by Garth (Preacher) Ennis this is a satirical and disturbing look at heroes behind the capes, men and women corrupted by the power and prestige laid upon them. Karl Urban is excellent as always and this really is a stellar cast and production. Looking forward to more episodes and definitely on my watch again list."
9.0,3 May 2024,"This TV series is like someone took your typical cape-and-tights story, crumpled it up, and then set it on fire- in the best way possible, of course. Set in a world where superheroes are corporate-sponsored celebrities with all the flaws and scandals to match, The Boys is a dark, gritty take on the genre that doesn't pull any punches. Our ragtag group of anti-heroes, led by the charismatic Billy Butcher, are determined to take down these so-called ""supes"" who abuse their powers and run amok without consequence. Think of them as the Avengers, if the Avengers were a bunch of sarcastic misfits with a vendetta against spandex-clad narcissists.

But The Boys isn't just about punching bad guys in the face (although there's plenty of that). It's also a biting commentary on celebrity culture, corporate greed, and the dangers of unchecked power- the stuff that makes you question whether wearing a cape automatically makes you a hero."
9.0,26 July 2019,"I love most comic book movies, but it's great to see a different spin on the classic take among the deluge of Marvel/DC films and TV shows."
10.0,27 July 2019,A very faithful adaptation of a comic and with hell of a good writing the boys is superheros you've seen on screen before. I would recommend this anyone who is into comic book movies. incredible casting and actually impressing effects for superhero show. Hope the season 2 will be as good as this or even better
8.0,16 September 2019,This is definitely not what I was expecting when first beginning to watch. Very intelligent and thought out writing. Please make more shows like this.
9.0,28 July 2019,This is simply great television. Do not be put off thinking it's just another super hero TV show. It's much more than that. Writing is amazing. Excellent choices of actors for all of the characters. The finale was so superb and I cannot wait for season 2.
10.0,18 August 2024,
9.0,29 October 2020,"Fantastic TV show, great action, interesting characters and very funny."
6.0,1 December 2023,
5.0,24 September 2024,"""The Boys"" is an exhilarating and gritty take on the superhero genre, flipping the usual narrative on its head. Instead of the typical heroic stories, it explores the dark side of fame, power, and corruption among superheroes. The writing is sharp, witty, and loaded with satire that brilliantly mirrors our society's obsession with celebrity culture and corporate greed. The performances are top-notch, with Antony Starr as Homelander delivering a chilling portrayal of unchecked power. The action scenes are intense, and the show's boldness in tackling sensitive themes sets it apart. It's a must-watch for anyone seeking a fresh, mature, and thought-provoking take on the superhero world."
10.0,8 September 2019,"*** Season 2 *** Wow, just wow. Season 2 of ""The Boys"" amps it to another level! The creators' vision for this series is just crazy! These superheroes are so totally flawed, with the top ones being all out murderous sociopathatic megalomaniacs! How do you defeat, how do you compromise such powerful beings? Well, they're only human afterall and subject to human failings. And this series has legs, it could easily run another few seasons and we can only hope it does. *** Season 1 *** Echoing most here, ""The Boys"" (S01, 8 eps, 1hr, Amazon) is a real gem of a series amidst so much other chaff/filler. It's a much more plausible, realistic take on those with powers/abilities far beyond normals. If you're into tales of betrayal, corruption, abuse of power, and the like then you'll love this like most everyone else. ""The Boys"" is a series where S02 can't come soon enough. My main nits have to do with lost opportunities in dialogue, like near the end where a character is telling his unknowing kid ""I'm your father,"" now that could've been an epic play on the classic Darth Vader line but they totally whiffed it. There are little disappointments like that throughout."
8.0,29 July 2019,"Not everything is a chess piece to be moved by one side or the other in the current political battle. I just flat out disagree with the folks who've decided that is the case here. I'm someone who'll turn off a show if I detect its only purpose is to impart ""woke"" politics, and I never got that impression from this, even though it dealt with things that are topical. I understand why people who're honed in could dismiss it as such, though. I enjoyed it quite a bit despite its dark tone, and think it deserves to be judged fairly, and not just on the basis of current politics. I think there was an instance or two where it took a bit long for resolution to happen, and occasionally I was unsure of a protagonist's motivation at a given time; overall I liked it though and I'm looking forward to a second season."
10.0,29 July 2019,Finally someone is going off the path with superheroes movies/TV series👍 Amazing!!!!!
9.0,29 July 2022,If you're bored with the Marvel Multiverse then come to this. Superb series. Very visceral but completely in touch with itself. And doesn't take itself seriously. Urban is superb just as he was in Dredd. In fact the cast is faultless.
8.0,2 August 2019,
9.0,8 July 2022,The first two seasons had me hooked! Then it turned into a stoners weird storyline. I loved the shock value but then it got silly! First series I've watched with my kind of humour but then season 3 it went insane. It didn't add up and didn't have the same shock value.
9.0,24 July 2024,"In my opinion, this season of ""The Boys"" was a significant letdown. While previous seasons delivered intense action and rapid plot progression, this one felt like it was inching forward at a frustratingly slow pace. The anticipation built with each episode suggested a climactic finale, but I was left hanging, with major plot points deferred to the next season. The lack of action and the unfulfilled promises made this the worst season yet for me, leaving me very disappointed. The show built up expectations with each episode, making me think it was going to go all out towards the end of the season, but instead, it ended with a whimper. I'm hoping the next season makes up for this season's shortcomings and brings back the thrill and excitement that originally drew me to the series."
10.0,30 July 2019,"I've never read the comics so no, I'm not even trying to be one of the guys who cling to that format. I binge watched the entire season and can't wait to watch it all again after discussing the characters with friends. There is A LOT going on in this show. Every single character is quite interesting. Visually stunning.. so many scenes that are etched into my mind now. Instant CLASSIC!"

10.0,31 July 2019,"From streaming services to buying movies and shows on digital platforms, the way of watching content will be forever shifting. With an endless slew of streaming services, there will eventually be too many to afford for most people, but while we have the ones we have, we should be able to bask in the fantastic content we are receiving from most of them. Amazon Prime has recently graced us with the first season of their highly anticipated The Boys, and all I can say is that it's worth all of your time to sit through it. It may be incredible gruesome and absolutely too violent for certain viewers, but I'm sure many viewers will call this one of the best new shows to be released in 2019.

In a world that feels like a rip-off of the DC Universe and has a very similar cast of characters to the Justice League, most of the ""heroes"" use their powers for evil but make themselves out to be heroes to the public. Throughout many vile and graphic sequences, the audience consistently gets a taste of what these people are truly capable of, but the protagonists are truly the characters who are on the hunt and believe the heroes to be what they truly are. This diverse collection of characters makes for a very enjoyable show.

All having their own reasons and backstories for where and why they are where they are, The Boys celebrates the Superhero genre, while also ripping it apart. This series, although bloody, will be a breath of fresh air for those who have grown tired of this medium in cinema and on the small screen. Personally, I don't find myself garnering any fatigue when it comes to superheroes in the live-action format, but I too felt this show was needed with the flood of content we're receiving at the moment.

Karl Urban as Billy Butcher steals every scene he's in and his back-and-forth with Jack Quaid as Hughie Campbell is worth watching alone. On top of these two great performances/characters, Erin Moriarty as Annie is really the catalyst that brings everyone together and her character evolves a great deal throughout the course of the season. The group of heroes known as The Seven are truly all twisted and likeable in their respective ways, but Homelander, played by Antony Starr made my skin crawl the most. This is a show about terrible people doing terrible things, and there are some truly jaw-dropping moments, but if you can find a way to get enjoyment out of that, I think you'll love it as I did.

In the end, this was a stellar first season for a show that wasn't even on my radar until recently. I can't wait to see what the future of this show has to offer. Amazon Prime has released one of the most refreshing shows of the year. From surprisingly great camerawork and direction that feels both inspired by generic superhero fare and horror alike, this group of directors gave it their best in bringing something special to the small screen. I can't recommend this show enough. At a mere, breezy eight episodes, The Boys is now streaming on Amazon Prime."
9.0,7 August 2024,"I watched the first season on a friend's recommendation a couple years ago (it's now August 2024), and I liked it a lot. For some reason, the second season lost me almost immediately. I got back to the series a month ago and started from the beginning, this time skipping happily through the first two seasons. Sort of slowed down with S03. I got tired of The guy with the bad British accent as his character seemed to drift back and forth a bit too much.

Then they turned Frenchie gay? Like they didn't already check off enough boxes on inclusivity in the series that they felt they needed to double-down on gay? I never liked Hughie's dad and his character got stupider as the series progressed.

What I really hated, absolutely hated about the series were most of the fight scenes with the Supes. They dragged on forever and we as viewers never understood why one Supe was superior to the other. And why did the humans keep using guns against them when they were completely ineffective? For this same reason, I despise the traditional, comic book superhero movies. Some hero will be thrown through a brick building, only to spring back the tear into his opponent again and again.

Starlight seemed mostly freaking useless as a protector of her group. I got bored and annoyed with the mute girl and her powers were also all over the place."
10.0,31 July 2019,"As the title says, this show is very different from the comic series (which I have only read some of). But everything that is done here absolutely works. I watched the whole season in 3 nights because I couldn't stop. It's delightfully gory (featuring some of the best human explosions I've ever seen) and relentlessly brutal, which is primarily what interested me. What I didn't expect was being absolutely hooked by the characters, which are developed and interesting and have enough arcs to keep you guessing. They're all played excellently by their respective actors/actresses, especially Anthony Starr from Banshee as Homelander and Karl Urban as Butcher. Dialogue is expertly written and results in some seriously tense and even uncomfortable scenes where characters are just talking. Since the show retains the comic's brutality, darkness, mature themes, etc., the main difference is in the plot (although some characters have changed genders, but characters are generally consistent). Some things are taken directly from the comics, dialogue included, but in many cases characters are introduced differently. The relationship between Butcher and his ""Boys"" is fundamentally different at the beginning but grows into what we get in the comics. The show changed some background elements and some other minor things but the biggest difference is in the finale of the show vs. the finale of the comics (which I've only read about, not read). Anyway, I don't have a problem with the changes with the exception of one - not enough Butcher brutality. In the comics he's portrayed as an unstoppable beast that is perhaps ""the single most dangerous man on the planet"" or something. Karl Urban just doesn't kick enough butt in the show (physically - he's still an absolutely brutal blackmailer), so if you want to see that, watch Dredd. But don't get me wrong, he's still a total badass here. Deeper than the characters and the blood and the changes that ranged from minor to significant are the themes that the show tackles. #MeToo and female empowerment are major thematic elements here, and I love it. Same with religion (Butcher on religion is one of my favorite nonviolent scenes). Anyway, watch the show. It's really, really good."
10.0,24 November 2023,"The movie was based. Which is good.

Every episode had something exciting in it.

The storyline moves forward, which makes the series more fun to follow.

Additionally, the small marvel references are hilarious. I watched the series right after the first time just to see all the references. The plot switches on the series is are also quite unpredictable.

As for humour wise. The series contains quite violent and sexist humor, which is quite based (sunglasses emoji). It also makes you think if there actually were superheroes, they would be quite abnormal.

The series finely questions superhuman abilities and has a deeper to it self. It also tackles some common societal problems of today."
10.0,5 June 2021,"In the past 2 years, I have struggled to find shows that keep me captivated and waiting for the next twist without having some people take their clothes off. The BOYS did that and more, as the show progresses, we get a look into a dystopian future of a world with superheroes, not one that is awfully common. It shows what happens when the corporate worlds rears it ugly head and the most important of it alll, IT HAS CHARACTER ARCS, I can't believe how difficult it is to find a show where characters actually grow, where character aren't static, but rather grow for better or for worse. The escalating characters and well-placed plot events make the show binge worthy, not something I can say for a lot of shows out there. I can rarely say this, but this time, I think I should, this show deserves to be an hour long."
9.0,17 July 2024,"The Boys remains a standout in the superhero genre, earning a respectable 7 out of 10. This series delivers a potent mix of dark humor, intense action, and biting social commentary, making it a unique and compelling watch. Karl Urban's Billy Butcher and Antony Starr's Homelander lead an exceptional cast, each bringing depth and complexity to their roles. The show's willingness to delve into the murky waters of power and corruption sets it apart from typical superhero fare.

The Boys excels at blending brutal violence with sharp satire. Its critique of corporate greed, celebrity culture, and the dark side of hero worship is both entertaining and thought-provoking. The storytelling is bold, unflinching, and often shocking, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats.

The cast, led by Karl Urban's gruff yet oddly charming Billy Butcher, is exceptional. Each character is layered and complex, with the writing allowing for deep dives into their moral ambiguities and personal demons. Antony Starr's Homelander remains one of the most terrifyingly captivating villains on TV, and the ensemble cast around him brings a raw, emotional depth to the story.

One of the standout features of The Boys is its willingness to tackle real-world issues through its hyper-violent lens. The satire is biting, skewering everything from corporate greed to celebrity culture with a sharp, unrelenting edge. It's a show that doesn't shy away from showing the darker side of power and the corruption that comes with it.

However, my biggest gripe with The Boys is the painfully long wait between seasons. The two-year hiatus has significantly dampened my enthusiasm. In fact, I haven't even felt a pull to begin the new season after such a prolonged gap. This wait disrupts the show's narrative momentum and makes it difficult to stay invested.

The Boys is a gripping, provocative series that deserves its praise, but the extended breaks between seasons are a major drawback. This frustratingly long wait makes it hard to maintain excitement, and the show risks losing its audience's engagement. If the release schedule were more consistent, The Boys could easily score higher in my book."
9.0,28 October 2020,"I loved it, I hate Avenger's movies because of the stupid jokes in the middle of the fights and the super heroes always winning everything. This serie shows a total different approach to this Super heroes topic."
7.0,2 November 2020,"Just finished season 2. That's how you end a series. No schmooze, no faff, nothing predictable, nothing vacuous, nothing 'Hollywood'. Just pure good quality, riveting, hilarious, action packed, slightly subversive, intelligent TV.

90% sure there'll be a season 3. Although there's doesn't need to be. We're offered enough closure to satisfy but with enough open to allow for more.

Above anything else this show has shown how you CAN end a season with class and (mostly) dignity instead of selling out to the lowest common denominator for a lacklustre send off that pleases no one.

I'd love there to be more, but I'd also be totally satisfied if this was the end. Hallelujah."
1.0,2 August 2019,"It is one of the best and smartest social and political satire I've seen in a long time. Some of the scenes are truly over the top, but I suppose it adds to the overall impact. I will skip the plot since many have probably already commented on it. Great acting and cinematography with overly dark tone. A truly original piece of work. Remember that it is intended for mature audiences, so if you don't mind some sex and gore, this is a show I would highly recommend."
8.0,11 August 2021,"I finished watching the boys last night and all I can really say is how amazing it is! Only one comment not all British people say ""see u next Tuesday"" constantly."
8.0,5 August 2022,"I'd heard good reviews, but wasn't expecting much.

Enjoy the superhero movies, but this was a new twist.

It is an acquired taste, but if up your street this is fantastic."
9.0,5 August 2019,I like the story it's something new and the storyline gets better! Highly recommended.
9.0,19 August 2019,"I'm not a big superhero fan but this series is different. A new perspective about superhero's universe. Nothing can't go wrong with actors like Anthony Staar (I love him from Banshee) and Karl Urban (Dreed) in the cast. The storyline is pretty interesting and the Fx's are quite good. So, overall first season is really promising. I'm just waiting for season two."
10.0,6 October 2024,"The Boys is an absolute must-see for anyone who loves original and hilarious series! This show takes the superhero genre and throws it into a blender with a hefty dose of satire, blood, and a pinch of chaos. You expect superheroes to be good and save the world, but instead, you get a group of heroes who are just as guilty as the villains they're fighting, my kind of humor!

The series is brilliantly crafted, with clever dialogue and a refreshing plot. The characters are so over-the-top that you can't help but laugh, especially when you consider that most of them care more about their Instagram followers than saving the world. It's a fantastic mix of action, drama, and hilarity that you simply can't resist.

But let's be honest: after a few seasons, it starts to feel a bit repetitive. It's like they're thinking, ""Why stop something that works?"" And yes, sometimes they do go a bit overboard. You can only handle so many shocking twists and outrageous superhero stories before you think, ""Okay, I've had my fill of absurdity for today.""

Still, if you enjoy a series that makes you laugh while also making you think about the absurdity of heroism, then The Boys is a great choice. So grab some popcorn, get ready for a wild ride, and remember to set aside your expectations of superheroes because in this series, nothing is what it seems!"

10.0,21 June 2024,"First three seasons were original and edgy. The writing and characters were awesome. Story was unfolding in an organic and fun way. Then comes season Four. I say it's lazy cause they took issues of today and just made that the backdrop to the season. They have to know the core audience for the show is who they're insulting. Furthermore they just turn a pretty main character gay out of nowhere. Making everything so obvious is part of the problem. If they wanted to incorporate these topics in the show, at least be creative about it. How do these writers and media companies not realize people watch shows to be entertained and get away from the nonsense issues of everyday life?"
10.0,24 November 2021,"This is an awesome series, its dark, gritty and potrays what i think superhero's in real life would turn out to be if they were real. The characters are great, the story keeps you entertained, all in all id say give it a watch, it may not be for everyone but if you like the superhero genre, this is a unique take that i think you's enjoy."
7.0,1 September 2024,"""The Boys"" is a gritty and unapologetic deconstruction of the superhero genre, offering a fresh and darkly humorous take on what happens when superheroes go rogue. The show, developed by Eric Kripke and based on the comic series by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson, dives headfirst into the corruption, greed, and moral decay that could arise if super-powered beings were controlled by corporate interests.

At its core, ""The Boys"" is a satire that exposes the flaws and dangers of idolizing superheroes, portrayed here as egotistical, violent, and often morally bankrupt individuals. The main protagonists, a group of vigilantes led by Billy Butcher (Karl Urban), are determined to bring down ""The Seven,"" a team of heroes who are anything but noble.

The series excels in its ability to blend shock value with meaningful commentary. The violence is graphic, the language is harsh, and the humor is pitch-black, but beneath this gritty exterior lies a scathing critique of celebrity culture, corporate greed, and the moral ambiguity of power.

""The Boys"" isn't just about blood and guts; it's a smart, subversive show that asks tough questions about the nature of heroism and the corrupting influence of power. Whether you're a fan of the superhero genre or a skeptic, ""The Boys"" offers something unique and thought-provoking, making it a must-watch in today's entertainment landscape."
2.0,28 March 2021,"The Boys (2019) is brilliant! It shows that not all ""heroes"" wear capes. Homelander is the big bad, and I've never seen an arrogant character as much as him on screen before. I love the fact that the day-to-day people are the ones you're cheering for. On the other hand, the so-called heroes have it all, and they're not who you think they are. That's what I love about this show and it's truly, amazingly unique.

Karl Urban is great in this show, and Anthony Starr shows that he carries the antagonist role perfectly. A nice surprise from Simon Pegg is great stuff, and the rest of the cast including; Jack Quaid as Hughie, Erin Moriarty as Starlight, Jessie T. Usher as A-Train, Laz Alonso as Mother's Milk, Chase Crawford as the Deep, and the others are just great.

The Boys (2019) is definitely one of those binge-watches. I cannot wait for Season Three.

9/10.

Magnificent."
10.0,4 August 2019,"You knew it was coming . The last avengers movie leaving you feeling mugged . The constant conveyor belt of spiderman movies . Was in the only one who thought black panther was pants? Well thank you The Boys - fu marvel fu dc and fu superheroes. Completely politically incorrect , a great take down of modern life and most of all the swearing ...before I forget the soundtrack is cool . Oh and the main dude ain't British he's an aussie. ..big boo boo and aussies don't normally drink guiness it's fosters . Besides that ...get on it ASAP ."
10.0,6 October 2024,"I loved every second of this show. It is absolutely the best superhero show by far. It's perfectly balanced between brutal and funny. The cast all fits their roles perfectly. If you need a good watch and like brutal sci-fi, this is the perfect show for you. I would recommend this show for everyone who is mature enough. I love how it's a lot of witty scenes but still some serious ones. It's also a fantastic story of moral, good and bad, and how powerful people abuse their powers. Another thing that's also really good about this show is the character's and their writing, almost every character has a good story and I LOVE it. This is one of the best shows of all time in my opinion and I seriously recommend you watch it."
8.0,6 October 2024,"This is how superhero shows are supposed to be, dark, brutal, controversial, but at the same time funny, interesting and witty.

I love how some scenes can be very serious and then the next one can be completely ironic. The characters are so well written and almost everyone has a good backstory and development, The actors are casted perfectly for their roles.

I binged this entire series, I enjoyed season one & two, and I loved season three. Many thinks that season four is not near as good as the other seasons, while that may be true i think that season four was kind of a build up to season five, I at least Enjoyed season four.

If you need a good watch I would recommend this a hundred times. This is probably my favorite show and can't wait for season five."
10.0,1 September 2020,"And the Wookies have written every story line to show the women are really super, super-powered more than the guys - and outsmart them.

So tiring"
10.0,27 July 2019,"First, I binged the whole season in 1 day. That was not the plan going in, but the show is unique. I didnt read the comics, so I had no idea what the show was about. The show is raw and delivers twists all the way to the last minute of the series. It is graphic and keeps an edginess to it throughout the series. The Boys will surprise one with the flip on a superheros role. I felt real emotions for the characters, each of them, supes or not. Great, great writing."
10.0,30 July 2024,"Had the show rated at a strong 8/10 until I completed season 4. Now I rate it (over all four seasons) as a weak 7/10.

Season 1 and 2 were really good, and in many way new in the sense that something similar hadn't been made before. Season 3 dropped of pretty far from the two earlier seasons, but was at least somewhat entertaining.

Along came season 4, and now it's getting ridiculous. Shocking just for the sake of shocking gets old really fast, and that seem to be all the creators are aiming for in the last season.

I'm not a quitter regarding series, so I will give season 5 a chance as well, but if it doesn't improve drastically it will be the last I see, and possibly the last they produce."
10.0,28 July 2019,"Was not expecting this to be this good. After being disappointed time and time again by some of the new series coming out in 2019 I had pretty much given up on there being anything good this year. This TV series was just outstanding. There seems to be a theme of bad superheroes e.g Brightburn but this was done way better than Brightburn. Cast was great and acting was top notch and the plot and storyline, twist and turns was outstanding. I was going to give it a 9 but I think it should be more a 9.5 so rounded up. Definitely worth the binge."
10.0,24 May 2022,"""The Boys"" is not the superhero show or movie that you are used to. It is very dark and 100% not for kids (or teens). And the show is awesome. The series looks at society and asks ""what if super heroes existed, and they were treated ed like actors/sports players?"" Just how horrible would they be?"
7.0,4 August 2019,"This is a great all around show, super funny with great characters and gory action. I loved it, can't wait for the next season."
1.0,20 October 2020,"Season 2 (4 out of 5 stars.)

The Boys 2 continues with a little wild, crazy, and bloody adventure with the characters as they try to stop the supes from taking over. The first half was a little slow moving and boring. It picks up with Stormfronts agenda being revealed. It is a lot of fun. Great cast. Bloody and violent. The climax has some surprises and exciting moments. While leaving more room for another season."
9.0,29 July 2019,This is the best thing i've watched in ages... everything falls exactly where it's supposed to so far (ep3) and the feel of the comic is quite well respected in my view. Hope they don't try to cancel this awesome show
9.0,13 August 2024,"I love The Boys. It is litterally the best show of all time. I like the shows depiction of how superheroes would be In real life, or if the wrong person Got superpowers. They would be corrupt because of theyre massive Powers that stretch far beyond Human capabilities. Like Homelander. It is actually realistic - not the superhumans - because of how the World is In the show. I Think that it would be like it In real life. Superheroes would constantly make casualties. Destruction and Human damage everyday. The depiction of the corruption of capitalism In this show is peak television. By the way, The Deep (Chace Crawford) is the best character In The Boys. Hes just funny. The fact That he thanks he is smart is real comedy. Every scene with him is my favorites. I really hope he doesnt die In Season 5..."
9.0,4 June 2022,"The Boys is a masterpiece, so well written and so fun to watch! The actors are fantastic.

I hope to see a great fight between Captain Homeland and Butcher.

Disney please take some notes how to make a show!"
9.0,23 September 2021,The Boys one of the Best so far It's has everything that u want It Turnouts Truth of Superhero and the way it has Showed is so close to reality so u can connect to story both season are good second season carry and Continue story and It's 18 plus brutally killing people and and Action not preety much like Marvel or DC movies but Still stand Out and Challenge got Other Studio and Screenplay is another topic well done Boys and Cast performance are brilliant and only say is Can't Wait For Season 3.
9.0,7 August 2019,"You cant go to the toilet these days without a new superhero Film/TV series being released, so when you find out 'The Boys' is about....yep you guessed it Superheroes you might think not another one but.... you couldn't be more wrong.

Yes it does involve Superheroes but they aren't the heroes here, step forward William Billy Butcher (Karl Urban) and The Boys, a group of dysfunctional vigilantes determined to take down the corrupt company breading evil superheroes ""Vought""

The sheer brutal nature of the show accompanied by fantastic pacing, acting (especially Karl Urban and Anthony Starr as Billy Butcher and Homelander) and bit of everything else, ensures The Boys is very much a whole new refreshing adult take on the superhero genre and one that shouldnt be missed."
9.0,6 February 2023,
9.0,5 August 2024,"Seasons 1-2, fantastic. Season 3 started to turn a little but season 4 was just sad. All I wanted is to watch a show and be entertained. I think that's what most people want. To watch a show, enjoy it, maybe listen to an official podcast, and talk to others about the episode, what characters we like, don't like, etc. Now I can't get through an hour without them blatantly shoving the narrative that I must be a sociopathic elitist bigot hell bent on destroying democracy because I vote republican. And on the flip side, although not stressed as much, I highly doubt others enjoy being portrayed as self righteous, soft, snowflakes. Left, right, doesn't matter. People just want to watch tv and enjoy. It's a shame that this show and a lot of others have lost sight of that."
6.0,5 September 2019,"To be honest the build up to this series was big and i did expect more from it but its still awesome, shocking and at time jaw dropping.

The effects are awesome but i expected more, theres a lot of things dragged out."
9.0,27 March 2021,"Here's what I like about this one.

* It has humor.

* Has Karl Urban in it.

* Gives you an idea how Superheroes could be if they did not choose the ""goody two-shoes"" way.

What I dislike: * Having to wait each week for a new episode.

I thought I was done waiting by the week for a new episode of TV series after Game of Thrones, Boardwalk Empire, TrueBlood and Ballers. Is it the end of the world? Probably not, but since this review is written during a pandemic ... kind of hard to binge watch at home when you got to wait 168 hours between episodes ...

That said, I really enjoyed the show, and look forward to seeing more Seasons to come."
9.0,17 May 2020,
8.0,25 October 2021,"One of the most entertaining TV series around, at the moment. It gives us a real look at how superpowers would be used in today's world. Karl Urban as Billy Butcher is a pleasure to watch."
8.0,14 September 2019,"Takes the, ""With great power comes great responsibility."" And twists it with, ""Absolute power corrupts absolutely."" Genius creation brought to tv splendor with the amazingly inspired acting by all of the damned cast! (Well done!!!) The only reason I didn't give it 10 Stars was the lack of perspective on the emotional range of the female characters with regard to sexual assault. I think the writers did a good attempt to understand. But, c'mon guys... unless you literally live every day knowing a larger, more aggressive guy could choose to molest, rape, or even murder you with very little risk of reprisal, it just won't feel authentic. P.S. We need more Billy Butchers in this world!"
9.0,7 June 2020,"This was pretty much everything I've been desperate for over the last few years with pathetic and disappointing marvel and dc superhero movies and tv shows. Brutal and awesome, I hope this show continues for a while and gets more funding, it truly deserves it. More people should know about this show."
9.0,20 September 2019,"There are a lot of things I didn't expect on this show and I kept watching and the more I watch it, the more I was falling in love with it. I never read the comic of The Boys so this was very surprising to me when the superheroes are corrupted and abusive and a bunch of vigilantes trying to stop them. This is something I have never seen before in the superhero genre. Now, I'll be waiting for Season 2 coming soon."
9.0,19 September 2020,"Nice satire that sometimes loses pace. I hate Hughie, and the rest of the gang is almost as useless too. Otherwise, spot on"
8.0,7 August 2022,"The series starts with lot of Supes which we fall in love with, but as the series progresses we get to know their true colors. The Boys team up to take down the Supes one by one and in that process the leader of The Boys learns some diabolical truths.

Overall, it's a fun ride. Worthy to be binge-watched."
7.0,16 April 2022,"I am a major follower of Antony Starr, and yet in another role completely different from all of his others, he makes Homelander so believable. The Cast overall play their roles to a T. I am loving it to bits.💕💕"
5.0,2 August 2019,"A clever premise for a series which reflects how superheroes would be treated in our modern, corporate world. Karl Urban is great, although he can't seem to decide which accent to use :-)"
8.0,27 March 2022,This is how you do a comicbook show it is dark and violent and weirdly fun. It is also very faithful. Season3 look like it is going to be the best one yet.
9.0,10 September 2019,"In summary, go watch it if you are fed up with all marvel and DC movies and stuff - I can't stand it anymore. But this one is really great, compares a bit to the Astrocity comics, very unique approach on dramatizing the supers. I wouldn't say the acting is that great, its good, but not outstanding. But the script with all its quirky characters and surprises keeps me continuing."
9.0,5 August 2021,I like the fact that the entire show is just chaos and the language also matched with it. Pretty excited for the third season.
8.0,16 March 2020,"Since some of us have time on ours hands. I would check out The Boys on Amazon Prime. It only one season so far but it is a really good show. It a show about how having superheroes in this present day would be. The good, the bad and the ugly. Cant wait until season 2"
9.0,6 June 2021,"If you are looking for something different that is about super heroes this tv show is the one, very entertaining with very good scenes of action."
8.0,7 February 2022,
8.0,14 July 2024,
8.0,8 February 2023,"It's a fact that this image of a bad superhero who use his powers by his own it's very used and popular but this serie it's like the glorification of this got a characters for every taste, the protagonists and the antagonists got his own spirit and personality and you never know what to expect because this serie surprise you with plots over plots, you think you know somenthing but the plot change or somenthing happen and always got you on the border of the chair expecting and excited of what's going on and having you waiting for the next episode, the just bad thing about this serie it's like sometimes feel like the same, it's not a bad thing the formulaa that they choise and use works and works well so they use it and got you used to it, but sometimes you can feel burned out of that, but it always refreshing got more character building of every member of both teams."
7.0,2 June 2021,The series is an amazing perspective if superheroes really exist or if they come in future...!! Karl and Antony have done an amazing job in their role as Billy and The Homelander. Some of the scenes done by Karl will be remembered as one of the coolest and some scenes by Antony as quite scary. I binged watch the entire season on the weekend which was seriously not planned but the series is so great. Desperately waiting for the next season...!! Stream it for sure..!!
3.0,24 April 2021,The true explanation of real heroes . Must watch this series.
9.0,23 May 2021,"TheBoysTV After some initial slow paced episode season 2 of the The Boys picked up well in last few episodes, love the rivalry between Homelander & Butcher. S1 was awesome."
8.0,10 September 2019,Karl urban u r the best.... The best dialogues and ur accent....just loving the whole season and all of its characters....intoxicating from the very first episode till the last one
9.0,4 September 2019,"With the level of popularity the MCU has gained, superheroes are everywhere on the big and small screen now more than ever.

The Boys looks at superheroes (Supes) in a different light, you could say a more realistic light. I mean if you could turn invisible, you'd use that in whatever way you want.

Supes are presented as selfish, narcissistic, corporation tied and money motivated individuals.

The story is one of revenge against Supes by ordinary individuals who have been affected by the Supes actions.

It's hard to review without a spoiler but this is the first Amazon show that I've watched and really enjoyed. It's right up there with Daredevil and Punisher. About time Amazon!"
8.0,22 February 2020,"""Darkly entertaining, unabashedly violent and certainly never dull."""
9.0,6 March 2022,"Im a bit lost, i kept hearing this show was about soups, and yes, every now and then in the show they talk about soups, but never do we get the chance to see a receipe, or just 5 minustes of cooking. So yea, its very original for a cooking show, but it lacks jsut a bit of cooking."
8.0,27 August 2019,"The Boys came out of nowhere: another superhero television show thrown into the mix, but nothing like those we've seen before. Not following the typical line of storytelling, this show presents superheroes far more in the light of abusing their powers under the guise of celebrity life. On the other side of the coin are those not blessed with powers, looking at superheroes with derision having glimpsed the truth of the situation. In the middle of this is Hughie, someone who has idolised heroes forever - only to see his girlfriend accidentally killed by one. From the word go, this dark outlook on the superhero genre is not afraid to tackle any issue, and is a better show because of it.

Clearly a sizeable amount of funding has been devoted to The Boys - the CGI isn't as sloppy as most of these action-based tv shows, and the acting is actually strong for the most part. The story needs time to develop; character building is essential when creating these hero characters, otherwise they become muddled and indiscernible. As a result, the first half of the season takes its time to actually get interesting, but pays off by investing in a story for the long term, rather than episodic plots for the sake of cheap thrills.

Amazon have provided an adult antidote to the Marvel/DC mediocrity, breaking the mould set as the precedent by the success of superhero films. Before now there has been conclusive proof of darker films being better received: The Dark Knight, Deadpool and Watchmen are prime examples of how a more gritty tone can elevate these sort of shows. Finally, something is giving television's heroes an update - hopefully the coming seasons are as well received as this opening salvo."
9.0,13 July 2024,
10.0,1 October 2019,"One of the best shows on this year! I've spent the past couple of months telling everyone I can about The Boys. Karl Urban is great as always but the whole show, the cast, the writing all of it is so well done! Just watch it, you won't be sorry!"
7.0,19 January 2022,"I have watched a lot of superhero series, and the new ones which are coming out are unique, especially The Boys. Can't wait for season 3. Not much to complain, just grateful this was made."
8.0,14 November 2020,"As we all loves superheroes but this web series bring something very fascinating out of the box.

Love the series."
10.0,19 September 2019,"This does has many twists which don't occur until you get through the first few episodes, which better helps to create & solidify the characters. Once you're hooked, watch out. I'm just disappointed that I've finished season one though so greatly look forward to next season's surprises & plot storylines"
10.0,25 March 2021,"This is everything what most of the Marvel movies are not: Great actors Fantastic script Surprises a plenty Horrifying, funny, wtf?!?

Season 2 was even a slight bit better than season 1.

And for those who have read the comics and have seen what homelander was doing at the end of season 2... you know what a great release there will be in season 3 🤣🤣🤣"
9.0,26 April 2021,"This show and it's storylines show you what would really happen in the real world if superheroes existed. Not everything would be hunky dorey! People with abilities would take advantage and reek havoc in the world, murdering, raping, and much more. This show represents that side of things and is soooooo much better than your rated PG Marvel and DC crap. I love the gore, blood and bad language. The first season was better than the second season, but still enjoyable to watch."
10.0,11 April 2021,
10.0,18 May 2023,"It's been a while that a movie or a TV show based on superheroes caught my attention. Although DC fares better on my scale, both them and Marvel produced mostly unwatchable movies. The CGI is exquisite, yet the plot is usually non-existent, although there is a broader narrative connecting movies and shows.

And after an unspectacular experience with Jupiter's Legacy where the show never reached the potential of the comic book, I didn't have high hopes for The Boys. The first fifteen minutes or so of the first episode almost confirmed my preconception. Yet just before I wanted to quit, something changed.

Now, this is not the best superhero creation ever, but it offered considerably more than any of those mentioned above. The Boys has humor, action, drama, some character development and criticizes the society revolving around money, power and media.

Interestingly enough, the behavior of the good guys annoyed me so much that, at a certain moment, I almost rooted for Homelander and his gang."
9.0,27 July 2019,"This took me back to my City of Hero/City of Villain days where I got to be both good and bad as a hero. I loved the twists and turns, and not being able to always predict what would happen. Well done Kripke. You have another hit on your hands. Hope to see Jared and Jensen appear at some point. Villains would be nice."
10.0,27 July 2019,
6.0,2 August 2019,"As a huge fan of Garth Ennis' graphic novel, the TV series turned out to be exactly the type of mundane, watered-down dumpster fire I've come to expect from present-day Hollywood.

The series completely does away with Ennis' brilliant dialogue, sub-plots and motivations of the characters, leaving only the most bland and basic elements of the source material. Why, why oh why does Hollywood ALWAYS does this? Instead of using the brilliant source material, they replace anything worthwhile with endless amount of filler BS.

Reading through some of the 9 or 10 star reviews, I get a feeling they are bought reviews. It's either that, or people have very low standards these days. Don't get me wrong, The Boys is better than current Marvel series on Netflix - which isn't saying a lot - but compared the the awesome graphic novel, this is a huge let-down."
10.0,24 July 2020,"Talking about the western cinema, they always provide their audiences with fascinating, interesting and thought-provoking premises followed by their brilliant storytelling and extra ordinarily visualization and ""The Boys"" is the recent addition to it. What makes ""The Boys"" so special and unique is its premise based on the Comic Book it gives the unorthodox concept for Superheroes. As since the inception of superheroes genre we've seen and we've been told that Superheroes sole job is to protect humanity from antagonists which popularly includes Terrorist organizations or Aliens who have nothing but sole agenda to destroy the world and in return they want nothing but peace and safety of this world. Now that's before the arrival of ""The Boys"" who gives the counter narration that what if the superheroes we admire, we love and we look forward to are being handled by the corporates and to clear it further let's say that any state of USA shows the upward movement in crime figures, so this organization known as Vought will just approach the State's mayor and offer them one of their employed Superhero to fight with crime against a heavy amount as their remuneration. Not only that they have their own Media, Brand and Business Development team to handle and promote their employed Superheroes and to cash them accordingly. Things get more darker as series develops with whole superhero concept of saving humanity is being flushed down and showcases the idea what if Superheroes gets corrupted and their sole mission is to serve their employers rather their people and for that they can do whatever it takes even on the expense of peoples life. That's only one aspect, series gets further darker but to avoid spoilers I'll just stop here and leave that on you to further watch and experience it by yourself. Full marks to the creators of the show who has given the unpopular concept a new direction and people have already liked the show including positive reviews from the critiques, Talking about the performances, the cast is not familiar at least to me except Simon Pegg, who have nothing but a cameo role. Leads are simply brilliant and to mention some of them is actually due in their credit so lets start with Karl Urban as Billy Buthcher he is BAdAss and Ruthless, Antony Starr as Homelander leading the superhero team he is just brilliant as unpredictable shady Superhero, Elizabeth Shue as leading corporate lady is very convincing with her looks and cunning nature, Jack Quaid as Hughie a young simple common guy is adorable and last but not the least Erin Moriarty as Annie aka ""Starlight"" a good Superhero and lovely to watch also she actually resembles with Selena Gomez so the whole series I've watched her as if she's Selena Gomez also knowing that she's not. The series is comprised on 8 episodes with almost 1 hour of runtime each and is being streaming on Amazon Prime since 2019. You can binge it over the weekend and just to give the readers a heads-up the season 1 of the series has been ended on an interesting turn of events and Season 2 is due in the second half of 2020 which is September 2020 and has already been renewed for season 3 due to its popularity with the audience which I'm saying because as of today it has the IMDB rating of 8.7. So yes, just stream it online and do share your comments about it."
10.0,9 April 2021,"The show is outstanding. Such a pleasant surprise. Every character, every episode is excellent. Absolutely love the British accent & humour injected by Kiwi Karl Urban. Homelander vs Butcher is must watch stuff."

10.0,2 August 2020,"I just finished season 1, it is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good Honestly one of the best shows I've ever seen, definitely one of the best superhero TV shows to date"
10.0,29 April 2020,This show is amazing! Every episode draws me in. The aspect of superheroes being company property and the Every aspect of what a suoerhero is is really interesting and well written.
10.0,27 April 2021,"I couldn't help but picture all these actors that we so dearly love in real life. Knowing nothing about behind of scenes of these 'idols', we love them blindly and defend them with all we've got. The creators did a good job by showing us how corporates can and do control these stars and their public image.

This series has been absolutely eye opening and brilliantly captured. The storyline deserves 10 stars. It keeps you on edge."
10.0,29 May 2021,"What to say?!

Its dark, it's humorous, its biting satire.

Its a chilling take on corporate control of politics and media. That's probably what I love about it the most. It pulls nopunches. The casting is excellent, script writing is excellent. Its tragic, super dark and violent. What a mix of styles!

Karl Urban is great as the over the top not job. The lines between good and evil are blurred so far its very refreshing to see characters that are not 2 dimensional in a super hero flick.

Elisabeth Shue.. Still very sexy.

She was sexy in The Saint all those hears back. She's still hot. The characters are all quite likeabke in very unlikable ways if that makes sense. Just love the show.

The dark humor almost goes too far sometimes.. But then you remember this is based on a graphic novel.

Some scenes are hilarious. The whale?!

Without needing a spoiler alert.. There's a ridiculous scene involving a whale.

Homelander is so well cast and suitably creepy. Everyone's individual tragic stories just fit nicely. Its a lot or fun and action and some excellent writing to boot."
9.0,19 March 2022,"Neither all superheroes are nice nor they save lives. Growing up I had always watched godd side of superheroes but this one is different, can't wait for season 3."
6.0,9 August 2019,"From the description of this series, I thought it would be a subversion of the normal superhero tropes, but it's really quite predictable. And a bit too gory for my taste.

If you enjoy the comic book superhero type of entertainment, you may enjoy this. For me, the humorous bits did not work all that well. I quit watching during episode 4 when I realized it wasn't improving and that there are many better shows and movies out there."
4.0,18 May 2021,Best show ever I don't care. Amazing Visuals all episodes are movie quality.
10.0,20 February 2023,"I am not much of a fan of watching superhero movies and series, and this is different from everyone, especially the characters of Homelander and Butcher, and now Soldier Boy. This series really shows you what is done behind cinema and fame. Maybe the first series is boring at times, but it will surprise you at the moment. I am waiting for season 4. Very violent and bloody moments that are different from other superhero series. Anthony Starr and Carl O'Brien's acting is good and acceptable, and now Jensen Ackley has been added. We know serials and movies as good and positive, but this series shows you the dark side of superheroes."
10.0,19 September 2019,It's superb .you are going to hooked with it .just go for it
10.0,10 September 2022,"How cool it is to finally see a series where everything never goes according to plan or what you think is going to happen. Today you always see the rock playing the rock. Watching the same new action movie that has been made 17 times before without any kind of innovation. This anti-superhero way of looking at things is super refreshing! Finally someone who thinks wildly outside the box and not just thinks outside the box but totally smashes it! Keep it up.

10.0,9 February 2020,"This went far beyond my expectations in every single way. The acting is superb, the humor is on point and wow is it dark. I have never felt so amazed at a superhero show before. The idea that superheroes are selfish celebrities only caring about reputation on social media is so mind blowing. The entire show is so realistic (for superheroes) that it is scary. I would highly reccomend this for anyone wanting something different in an overused genre"
8.0,4 April 2020,
10.0,1 September 2020,"This show is amazing, not only by their performance but the art and also the computer graphics. It took a lot of work to put it together. Not many people sees that way, and there are many people behind the scenes working night and day to have a show like this to go on."
10.0,11 January 2023,"What would happen if the superheroes became someone who was already a god and idolized by many? A group of vigilantes try to knock them out of the arbitrary deeds committed by the superhero.

Season 1: A series adapted from the comic of the same name, The Boys became a series that was so wild, brutal, deadly, rude that it appeared vulgar. The Boys tells how superheroes who have become gods and idols for society. Appearing full of vulgar scenes and bloody action is a strength for the series. This first season was able to explore well and deeply to build the world of The Boys for 9 episodes. The story is unique, interesting, entertaining and of course full of brutal and wild action. Presents a series of small problems that lead to large ones. Each episode is capable of giving rancidity and inflicting horror. This season is able to provide complex stories and conflicts. The conflict is so dense with problems that arise constantly from both The Boys and The Seven camps. This season has such a hard and cruel fighting action.

Season 2: Entering its second season, The Boys became a series that began to be loved by many people. The second season became a season that experienced good improvement and development, from the story, conflicts to the characters. The second season remained with the Boys attempting to fight and destroy the members of The Sevens. Increasingly complex stories with new conflicts emerging. The conflict between The Boys and The Seven does not degrade the quality of the story from this second season. Their feud is all the more exciting with the conflict they are experiencing personally. Season two gives us room to take a deeper look at the evil possessed by The Seven. This season has appeared even crazier and wilder. Did not let go of the same brutality of the previous season. Action scenes that are more amusing and look crazy. The last episode became the most good-looking episode, presenting a crazy fight.

Season 3: The third season did not detract from the intensity of the story of the series. A story that remains interesting, much better and still gives a crazy feel. This season is said to be a turning point season for Homelander, who is getting worse. The plot of this story focuses more on The Boys' actions to defeat Homelander head-on. Homelander, who this time has good character development, with his increasingly becoming-so nature that makes him even more devastated. Not only Homelander, but with other members of The Seven trying to raise their popularity. Likewise, Billy Butcher also started to become more selfish and create divisions in The Boys. In addition, this season also introduced the Payback group as the first group from Vought. Payback was introduced to provide a broad story for the world of The Boys. Payback itself actually has a relationship with Homelander itself. Therefore, this season has many new and branching conflicts so that the story is widening. Many conflicts have arisen either from the side of The Boys or The Seven with the personal problems of each of its members. This season doesn't have a strong enough story. Expanding and introducing this world of The Boys further might be something new."

7.0,22 September 2020,Loved Season 1. Dropped out after S02E04. The show was already getting boring at this point but then the woke preaching began. Damned shame. Bye bye
5.0,23 October 2020,
9.0,28 January 2022,Even better than peace maker and daredevil In my opinion but I have to go to the animated series of the best of luck in your opinion on the show and tell me what you think we should I buy a new message I sent you a call.
10.0,13 August 2019,"Sorry Superman, sorry Batman, sorry Spiderman, but that's what a world with superheroes would look like, that dark. Yes, Batman, even more dark that you!

Wonderful series. writing directing and acting, specially Antony Starr ""Homelander"", I mean this guy is superb.

Highly recommended, can't wait for season 2."
10.0,10 September 2019,I've been really looking forward to Watchmen coming to HBO since the news dropped a couple years back. The Boys is as good as I'm hoping Watchmen will be. It's dark and it's grounded. Anthony Starr murders his role as Homelander. Best new show in years. I can't get over it. I'll probably rewatch a couple times before season 2 comes out.
10.0,25 October 2019,"If you are looking for something fresh, then look no further. Nothing like Marvel or DC movies/series that most people are used to. This series shows how it would be if we had super heroes in real life."
10.0,22 October 2019,
10.0,13 August 2019,"Spoiler Free*****

It is a rollercoaster ride from the first episode and makes no apologies (nor should it).

Imagine a world where people that are flawed - selfish, power hungry, self righteous, no moral compass -real people (but the bottom of the barrel) and gave them corporate jobs as super heroes...this would be the result. They make The Watchmen look like heroes.

If you don't offend easily, are cynical with a sense of humor, love black comedy with some blood and guts thrown in, then this is the show for you! If the show does offend you, I suggest you stop watching and move on without taking it personally.

BTW, you can totally love Marvel and DC and this show as well. It's all for entertainment and boy does this show entertain! Can't wait for Season 2!

Karl Urban, Elisabeth Shue and Jack Quaid, (along with the whole cast) are excellent."
10.0,12 May 2021,Best Ever Anti-Superheros Series... Loved it So Much..
10.0,28 August 2019,This is a good show based on an interesting story with good actors. I really enjoyed the first half of the season however the ending is deceptive. We used to have 24 episode per seasons then half this number and now 8 here. Nowadays you cannot get a full story in a single season. Do not expect a deep development of the characters within this timescale. Some characters are just pointless and overshadow the development of other more interesting.
6.0,28 July 2024,"The first 3 seasons are some of the best TV ever made. Great humor, satire, and shock value (in a good way).

Season 4 is directionless, pointless, and throws in shock in ways that feel clearly thrown in for the sake of it. Season 4 is also nonstop preaching and scolding the ""wrong side of the political isle)"". I think they literally mention every major issue in politics today - - just like pretty much every single new show these days.

In other words, season 4 is a clone of xmen 97, anything star wars, anything marvel post endgame, and literally everything. You can finish season 3 and watch any of the shows i just mentioned and it will feel like you're watching season 4 because the political preaching is so heavy that the stories in all of these shows are literally identical.

How many times are writers going to satire ""January 6""? Jesus, we get it. You're trying to make fetch happen. Let it freaking go guys. No one cares about your politics. Just do your job and continue the legacy of what was once a well-written show."
3.0,17 March 2023,"""The Boys"" looks behind the well-known beautiful facade of superhero existence. In this world, protecting the city and its citizens is not the top priority for superheroes, but marketing themselves.

A handful of people who know about the dirty business of superheroes and harbor a grudge against them band together to put the superheroes in their place. This group later became known as ""The Boys"".

What is noticeable quite quickly and can possibly also have a shocking effect on the viewers, who don't know what they are getting into, is that ""The Boys"" is very macabre. Death is often used as a means of comedy.

The series also doesn't stop at depicting very unusual scenes and situations. Be it that it is shown in great detail and realistically how a person is practically torn apart alive or that sexual intercourse is depicted in an almost unpleasantly detailed and absurd way.

Foul language is also considered good manners here.

That's why many will probably already suspect - ""The Boys"" is far from a family series.

But that's what makes the series so special - in today's world, when every production is hellbent on being as politically correct as possible and keeping its age rating as low as possible in order to reach the widest possible audience, ""The Boys"" is very refreshing. As disgusted as I was at times, the special effects team must be commended for doing their job beyond outstanding! And even if you might suspect that now, ""The Boys"" doesn't do the opposite either. Also, not every scene is portrayed as absurd and grotesque as possible just to make it seem particularly brutal and absurd. A very good balance has been found here.

Personally, I have to say that I was already used to softened productions and was therefore often shocked by what this series dared to do. But that's also what makes her so funny.

Nevertheless, ""The Boys"" still manages to pack all of this into a nerve-wracking story that practically glues the viewer to the screen.

Finally, the damn good acting has to be emphasized as well. Antony Starr in particular plays his role as Homelander almost too well. But the other roles like Billy Butcher with Karl Urban, Hughie Campell with Jack Quadid or Annie January aka ""Starlight"" with Erin Moriarty have all been cast extremely well.

I only have to criticize that the story development in the 3rd season seemed a bit sluggish to me.

But I'm more than excited and hyped for the 4th season!"
9.0,12 November 2020,"The series really makes me think about the actual society. This is in my opinion the more realistic series about superheroes who was made until now. It shows that the most powerfull will abuse of their power and influenceat their advantages and be really motivated only by money and fame. I love this series, it shows the real face of human race."
10.0,25 July 2021,"I have just watched all the episodes, and it was hilarious, a lot of action, and the story over all was fantastic. In season 2 they Stepped up there game, the last episode in season 2 was one of the best episodes I have seen. Butcher was hilarious, and Homelander is one of the best villains. Don't be a c watch the show."
10.0,13 March 2021,"Crazy, fun, gruesome take on the superhero genre. I was hooked from the first episode, and soon binge watched both series. Hope its not too long until series 3!?"
10.0,30 August 2020,"One of the best and quirky series with hilarious dialogues with dark humor, crazy stylized violence and gripping performances. Don't think just go for it."
9.0,1 April 2020,"Going into this show, I was hesitant thinking this would be a watered down mature rated marvel or DC knockoff. I couldn't have been more wrong. The Boys actually has substance compared to recent marvel waves DC movies(joker excluded). It actually makes a parody of super hero shows. I love the constant digs this show makes at corporatism, I love the dark humor, and intensity of this show. The ending totally threw me for a loop and I'm left heavily anticipating many more seasons of this show."
10.0,16 May 2021,"First off, I love superhero stuff, but the reason I think even people who aren't so much fans of the concept may enjoy it is because of the major twist. Without spoiling it too much, lets just say the superhero league isn't all just rainbows, unicorns, and justice for all... The first event that happens almost had me a bit teary. I haven't finished season 1 yet, but I can already tell you its definitely worth the watch!"
10.0,9 August 2022,"I enjoyed this show very much, the writing was exquisite and the cast was incredible, everything was beautifully acted, the show felt realistic and believable it was emotional and funny all the best emotions. I recommend watching this."
10.0,11 August 2024,
6.0,16 July 2024,"Wow, just wow. So I've lost count on how many shows started with winning recipes, just to be over spiced and made into something else, like ...IDK, poison maybe?

I'm not a financial expert, but it seems that if a show makes a ton of moola for a season or two, every season after has to be for a tax write off.

Ok, nuts and bolts of season four. IMHO, and you won't hear anything new from me if you've read the other post, as it's a no story shock and awe(ful). Too political, too graphic for graphic sake and everyone, and I mean everyone is now a horrible azzhat... except maybe Starlite. Butcher, oh Butcher, I find myself fast forwarding through most of your dialogue. Shady, I like. Ie. Seasons 1,2 and a good part of 3. Season 4? Backstabbing, zero loyalty to allies or friends can hardly speak a line w/o something foul pouring out of it, grade A azzhat.

I loved the edginess of the first 2 seasons and season 3 was solidly good. They were a fresh and entertaining. I like my heroes and villains a nice shade of grey. Too bad you've made everyone so dark, all I see is crap shock and awe(ful) tombstone saying ""The boys"" season 4."
1.0,13 April 2020,"Great show, it is funny, entertaining, will keep you want to see the next episode right away. It's kind of a Kick-Ass type of show, only a little more dark. The Boys is such a surprise!"

10.0,15 November 2020,"I did not want to watch this series at all, i sat on my phone while my husband put the first episode on and now 2 seasons later I am fully invested and the phone is down. Im quite a girly girl although I like the odd marvel film but this is a GENUIS take on the superhero world from a dark point of view with so much humour and action. All actors genuinely play their part so well. I'm excited for season 3!!!"
10.0,24 April 2021,"Great show.

Stumbled across this by accident and what a wonderful accident that was.

The plot is nuts but ironically not too far fetched from the truth of today. Great characterisation.

There are some very witty lines and great CGI throughout.

Still can't decide if the guy's accent was cockney, Australian or South African.

Watch it (just not around kids or those adverse to the C word)."
8.0,14 June 2022,That absolute direction I wish DC and Marvel would take. The special effects are amazing along with the blending of practical effects. Just breaking down the effect is a master class in itself. The blend of harsh language and comedy (or just Butchers accent) is effectively use and wonderful story telling. A fantastic show if you are old enough to watch it.
10.0,6 August 2019,"The Boys is first of all an amazing series were with each episode we get to know the characters a little better.

But what strikes me the most about this series is, that it leans on our reality a lot (we just need to remove the ""Super"" part)

We see this with all the big superstars today, where everything they post and say are a facade, that the public loves.

This is truly a display on how superheroes, would be used by companies to sell merch and how the facade they put on, isn't their true self.

I could not have wished for a movie to come out at a better time than now, where everywhere we look we see celebrities doing ""good/cute"" things to rub it up their egos..

So if your into superhero movies/series with a sociopath twist, this is the thing for you!"
10.0,2 October 2019,"It could have been so much more and better. It's enjoyable and a nice to watch if nothing else is available but it's not a must see, I could have lived without seeing it and my life would be unaffected"
7.0,17 June 2024,"The series started strong and interesting, but within a few episodes, the writing and plot lines and acting got stale, with some exceptions.

I then felt like I had to keep on watching just for the shock, but after a while, you realize you're just watching the show purely for the shock value and it just got way too icky.

Acting is not that good. If you want to watch gross Disembowelments and overly-gross sex things, then feel free to continue watching. Otherwise I had to just get past the gross stuff and try to follow the little good plot lines that I was interested in. It overstayed its welcome early on.

I can't recommend."

This was the fastest I ever binge watched a show, and I'm probably going to do another rewatch when season 3 comes near."
10.0,6 September 2019,This show is great on so many levels. It's nothing like those regular superhero shows like flash. This show is just special shows the corporate side of heroes.
10.0,3 April 2020,"Well written, great cast. Original. Don't think I can offer anything more than what has already been said."
10.0,29 November 2023,"As a fan of THE BOYS graphic novels, I found the first season of the Amazon TV series to be a fantastic adaptation. It struck a perfect balance, appealing to us long-time fans while also being welcoming to newcomers. The creators nailed it in terms of smart storytelling, stunning visuals, and especially in the depth they gave to the characters. However, as the series progressed, it seems they've lost a bit of that finesse. The adaptation of characters like Soldier Boy and storylines like Herogasm felt toned down, almost as if they were filtered through the worries of executives concerned about conservative audiences or international market sales. These parts of the show seemed a bit sanitized, lacking the raw edge that made the first season stand out. Don't get me wrong, the show is still a fun watch, but I can't help but miss that original energy and unapologetic boldness of the first season, especially when it seems the bravest moments mostly exist now for comic, not narrative or character, effect."
9.0,6 August 2019,"It's like Avengers on crack! Absolutely love it!

I love the gore, filthy language & the randomness of it!

Not for children or people who are stuck up 🤣🤣"
10.0,15 June 2021,I started this show Sunday I thought it was going to be mid but I finished it in 2 days it's so good.
1.0,16 June 2024,"Definitely worth watching if you're a fan of the superhero genre. It's a very adult take on superheroes and how they would integrate with politics. It's just a real pity that this integration is done so poorly with little explanation.

The action scenes, cinematography and soundtrack are all 10/10.

The problems however relate to the show's writing. As the seasons roll on, it feels like the writers forgot what made ""The Boys"" standout from the saturated crowd. I believe the first sign of decline was found in the spinoff ""Gen V"", where ""Gen V"" was quite literally a teen drama by comparison to Season 1 of ""The Boys"".

All in all, it's a great watch but hampered by later creative decisions."
10.0,14 August 2019,"I delayed watching this show despite the hype in the same way I ignore any other Superhero movie or show because I don't like them (Superman, Batman, Spiderman, Antman, Whatever man, etc etc). All these movies have a pathetic plot and are highly repetitive. The only objective these movies are made is to make money as they attract the most crowds. Remakes and Sequels are made one after the the other. The train of films that exist on Superheroes can flabbergast anyone's mind. There's quantity, but where is quality. But after watching this show after a lot of positive reviews, I was ""PLEASANTLY SURPRISED"" It's a refreshing look to the whole Superheroes Saga. What a terrific idea it is, the idea that if the Superheroes were to exist in the real life, how it would be expoilted commercially by the big Business companies and backed up by the politicians. But it would only take some time for the system to become corrupt and redundant. The casting is brilliant, the acting is praiseworthy and the show very binge-worthy. Never expected to end up waiting for the next season. Highly recommended to everyone, especially you those who hate the Superhero movies and shows."
10.0,21 March 2024,"""The Boys"" emerges as a standout in the realm of superhero shows, delivering an electrifying mix of action, humor, and heart. With each season, the series continues to push boundaries and captivate audiences with its originality and unpredictability. From the gripping storyline to the stellar performances, it's no wonder that ""The Boys"" has quickly become a fan favorite.

Unlike conventional superhero narratives, ""The Boys"" takes a refreshingly realistic approach to its subject matter. The show explores what would happen if superheroes truly existed, delving into themes of power, corruption, and moral ambiguity. This unique perspective adds depth and complexity to the story, making for a compelling viewing experience.

While Season 1 sets the stage with its gripping premise, subsequent seasons build upon its success with thrilling storylines and captivating character development. While Season 3 may falter slightly in its pacing, it still delivers plenty of action and intrigue to keep viewers on the edge of their seats. With each new season, ""The Boys"" continues to evolve and surprise, cementing its status as a must-watch series.

Despite its many strengths, ""The Boys"" is not without its flaws. Some viewers may find certain plotlines to be convoluted or repetitive, particularly in the later seasons. Additionally, while the show's humor adds levity to the proceedings, it occasionally veers into silliness, detracting from the overall impact of the story. However, these minor hiccups are overshadowed by the show's overall brilliance and innovation.

In conclusion, ""The Boys"" is a groundbreaking series that redefines the superhero genre. With its sharp writing, stellar performances, and bold storytelling, it's no wonder that audiences can't get enough of this captivating show. Whether you're a fan of superheroes or not, ""The Boys"" offers something for everyone, making it a must-watch for anyone craving an adrenaline-fueled thrill ride."
10.0,5 June 2022,"I think it's great but keep in mind it is brutally violent and it pushes the envelope of even TV-MA. It's absolutely diabolical and expresses the political and personal lives of the superheroes themselves. There are some slow moments but overall it is action packed and it is by far my favorite Prime offering. I heard they ran out of prop blood, so they had to start using the real stuff. Lol. It's a great cast with many ongoing story lines to keep you occupied. Karl Urban leads the way in an endless bloodbath of entertainment. Keep the young ones away."

10.0,27 July 2019,"Was looking forward to this for a while, and boy, it was worth the waiting!

What a great show - it is dark, violent, hilarious, and above all, it has a great story line and in-depth characters. This is not your ordinary superhero story, nothing is pure black and white, no character is one dimensional. It portrays a complex world with believable struggles and conflicts. The heroes, if you can even call them that, are living breathing things like the rest of us.

One of the best fantasy shows this summer! Highly recommended!"
10.0,29 July 2019,"Out of soo many superhero familiarity, they managed to make this one feel totally different."

10.0,30 August 2024,"Started off great in season 1. A real change to what was being offered by Marvel and DC.

It's gradually gone downhill but season 4 has dropped off a cliff. It's not remotely interesting. The violence and gore is childish and I'm resorting to watching it whilst scrolling on the phone just to get through the dn thing.

Utter dross

Seriously, it feels like it's been written by some adolescents wondering how far they can push the boundaries of taste. It's dreadful.

Do yourself a favour if you've not watched any so far. Don't bother. It's just another one of these shows that starts off great and then runs out of ideas."

9.0,28 July 2019,"Move over MCU and Watchmen, this is what super heroes would be like in the real world. Flawed, narcissistic, arrogant, and obssessed with their popularity. And the real good guys? Well they're the anti heroes, the outcasts, the leftover pieces from the carnage of the super hero age. Karl Urban is at his best. Watch it you won't be disappointed."
10.0,8 July 2022,This show is incredible. The first 3 seasons are such an amazing thing to watch and I highly recommend this show to people. It's a great time and such a relief from most of the superhero genres.
10.0,15 June 2022,"This show has the perfect balance of everything. Humor, seriousness, sadness, action, etc. I heard about the show from family a while back but I just finally gave it a chance and it's easily my favorite show ive ever watched. I couldn't live until I was all caught up with the series. Watched 2 full seasons within a week, I think that's all that should be said."
10.0,10 October 2020,"My husband and I just finished season 2 of The Boys and we have loved every minute of it! We made sure to do a rewatch of the first season, and from start to finish this show just knows how to reel you in and keep you hooked.

The actors are phenomenal, I literally can't even single any of them out because I think they all provide top tier acting, which is insane given how serious the material is.

Many people like to get annoyed about political agendas, but based on what I've read about the source material I feel that the political tones should be expected. Regardless, I don't think a political tone should stop people from watching a show or movie, so I hope anyone that reads these reviews to please give this, and any show, a chance before saying no.

Here's to more seasons of The Boys and their diabolical storylines."
6.0,31 August 2020,"Ona word, great series. Unique and weirdly enough , realistic. The characters and acting are very good. Good drama, good scripts."
1.0,21 April 2024,"After all the hero and anti-hero epics of recent years, I wanted to at least give this series a chance. But what looked promising became too one-sided, no, too stupid for me from season 3 onwards. Annoying characters, hardly any depth, zero character development and the storylines don't offer much variety.

We know that the world isn't a pony farm, but the show's ""hair-on-fire"" mentality isn't enough for me personally to stay tuned, I'm just not interested enough in the fates of the characters and the plot of the show.

It's a shame really, because I've actually liked Eric Kripke's work so far. The plots he developed for Supernatural were the best."
9.0,31 July 2019,The exact opposite of the Super Heroes comics written in my 80 year old dad's day. Such a great story line which I have never see before. I really can't wait to see what happens with this series. Ten minutes in and I was hooked...
10.0,8 October 2023,"Although it often delves into extreme vulgarity, with many explicit scenes (both sexual and gory), and displays a frenzy of violence that even Tarantino might envy, ""The Boys"" is a series that also touches on intriguing topics and even answered some questions I had. It's based on the comic book series ""The Boys"" created by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson and was developed by Eric Kripke. The story is a satire, focusing on a group of individuals trying to expose the truth about superheroes who are essentially products of large corporations and who, despite their positive public image, engage in corrupt and harmful behaviors behind the scenes.

If you're familiar with ""The Rock and Roll Machine"" (Little Heroes) by Norman Spinrad, ""The Boys"" takes the story to another level. In Spinrad's work, media products are carefully directed and written based on audience and market studies. Song lyrics are the result of focus groups, music is composed following such marketing studies, and the appearance of the singers is meticulously crafted.

In ""The Boys"", supermen and wonder-women are active on platforms like Instagram and TikTok, with dedicated Facebook pages, and their heroic deeds are, in fact, calculated by analysis and marketing departments. They combat crime in neighborhoods where the company's analysts estimate the highest media impact, where there's a likelihood of being extensively and favorably filmed by witnesses, or where the demographic profile of the beneficiaries is most profitable. Their appearance and public behavior are tailored to cover various audience segments, based on criteria like age, gender, residence area, race, income, and so on.

However...

Behind these heroes are jaded psychopaths with extraordinary superpowers, but controlled by the company that sponsors them. They have questionable sexual tendencies (like fetishes involving milk or mollusks, which are the ""tamer"" examples, making you wonder just how twisted the series' creators are), they are indifferent criminals (with the company also playing a role in covering up their misdeeds), and can even be sadistic when the mood strikes, often involved in promiscuous relationships.

If you've ever wondered how someone seemingly blessed by fate, having everything - money, power, fame, beauty, health - can fall into a dubious and inexplicable affair, or indulge in drug use and thrill-seeking, know that this series might provide an answer. It's simple, logical, and easy to deduce, but we often rejected it because it was always wrapped in clichés. Now, it's presented to me in a raw manner, thrust in my face, albeit in a rather sophisticated context with an acceptable dark humor.

I recommend it if you can set aside prudishness and lower your tolerance threshold for vulgarity, because the series doesn't rely on that to sell itself. On the contrary, it advocates for finesse and humanity, for beauty and goodness, even if it does so while resembling a chubby BDSM enthusiast dressed in latex wielding a chainsaw.

I can't wait for Season 4!

Oh, and Garth Ennis is also a co-author for the series ""Preacher"" and ""Punisher""."
10.0,3 August 2019,Brilliant. just Funckin brilliant. You can feel Seth's influence all over this. Cinema quality episodes just like Game Of Thrones did. Love it. Cant wait for season 2

10.0,9 October 2020,Now before anyone comes at me. Both seasons for me are 10/10. I thoroughly enjoyed this series and while season 2 has a very different feel to it the magic is still very much there. There's no denying that the year 2020 has been very hard for Marvel and DC fans. Looking for something to deliver what you've missed all this time? Look no further. You'll find it in season 2.
10.0,24 July 2023,"The Boys got everything one could desires to watch in a show , funny ,sad, horror, thriller, romance, brutality, action and many more stuff that play with our emotions Deeply (get it ?) I would recommend watching it this second it is more then worth all the time one got it will hold the viewers like a parasite to his host (but in a good way 😜😁) I watched all the seasons and make my friends watch them too.

I can honestly put this show on my top list it got potential, energy, creativity and all the dreams one could thought of while watching and this is unexpected as a sad cow (I couldn't find a good metaphor on time 😊) just go watch it now."
10.0,24 June 2022,"If you enjoyed 'True blood' this is the equivalent for Superheroes. Not for kids and it does not fanaticize about non human beings. I don't think any kid should watch this and I can't picture anyone dreaming to wear a cape after this show.

Realistic and vulgar.

It captures you immediately starting from the pilot episode. I hope the scriptwriters keep it going like this. The whole cast is amazing & Jansen Ackles is a great choice- so good to see him back on TV."

9.0,1 August 2019,"All characters were 3-dimensional, which was refreshing. Production quality was like a movie. Acting was great. Storyline was good too; the trailers lead you to think the Supes treat the public that way when in fact they have the facade going on. It was believable (in a superhero kind of way) and I didn't find myself challenging or questioning much in the show, which is good for me! I'm a huge critique. The raunchy parts were gross, but it's a dark show. I could have done without that, but it wasn't too over-the-top. In summary, I was very impressed and truly enjoyed this show, on many levels. ""Good Omens"" was painful to watch. So bad. So very, very bad. I was sure this show would be bad too, but someone did something right because all the things about Good Omens that annoyed me or bored me didn't exist in this show at all. Now I'm hopeful for #TheWheelofTime!!"
9.0,16 June 2022,"I just love it, plenty of metaphors, good acting, many plots, it's difficult to stop to watch this Serie.

I'm a fan of superheroes series and movies, this is different and much more clever.

Thanks."
10.0,2 August 2019,"Homelander ""Antony Starr"" makes the show especially episode 4 -27:11 mins this scene is brilliant .This is how being a superhero needs to be not all rainbows and fairies. Billy Butcher ""Karl Urban"" is a good actor but his British accent was not convincing, why not get an actual British actor for his part ? He tried so hard but that New Zealand accent too strong but keep practicing for next season. Other than that loved it. Every episode was 10 for me. Can't wait for season 2."
10.0,5 July 2022,"Now that I am watching Season 3, I have broken down and just need to write a review. Eric Kripke, creator, and primary writer of the Boys, reminds me of several works by Alan Ball , and Quentin Tarantino.

It's excellent because there's so much talent packed into every shot. It's very well cast, has excellent character-driven plots, and the stories it tells are extremely relevant to this moment in American popular culture. It explores situations of fascism, corporatism, Nazism, racism, misogyny, and many other forms of ideological violence so the stories it tells are extremely relevant to this moment in American popular culture. (It's no surprise some accuse it of having political bias, perhaps recognizing their own partisan shortcomings being represented amidst these ideological conflicts.)

Almost every character is wonderfully complex, but not overwhelming or staged- and yet each character often appears as both underdog, and anti-hero at different moments of their journey.

Every single cast member soars throughout each season- the actors are deeply inspired and it shows in every single shot.

The writers have also mastered using gore or cringe-humour, and often at the same time, to punctuate it's most significant plot points. Both the narrative thrust, and the tension are held very tightly in every episode.

It's special effects are also wonderfully produced.

One small caveat is that both the tension of the plot, and some scenes are truly so wonderfully created, that you may wish to steel yourself- they are more impactful than anything you may have seen before- especially in a episodic series type show.

But if you can prepare yourself for some serious gore, you will nonetheless find that it is 'balanced' with a relevant and meaningful story with a lot of humour, and insight."
9.0,3 August 2019,".... or do. Your choice. I grew up on Monty Python and Derek and Clive. I don't think my parents noticed. Only on the second episode and I'm loving it. The language is rich , dirty and realistic. The themes are adult. Sexual harassment in the workplace, even for superheroes. I love adult TV for adults. Don't like it, watch the Telly Tubbies. One criticism, Karl Urban is a Kiwi but his London accent does slip a bit, but not enough to worry me greatly. The Clash song in EP1. Brilliant."
9.0,27 July 2019,"Thank you for the show,after watching Marvel and DC got tired of super heroes.This is best show which shows bad side of super heroes ."
10.0,10 July 2022,"I began The Boys on a recommendation from a friend who had seen the first two episodes. I had nothing new to watch except the usual Sunny seasons on repeat, so I took him up on it immediately.

Immediately I was immersed in this world that feels EXACTLY how our world right now would be if we had superheros. The entire show is incredibly well crafted and features fantastic satire. But above that, The Boys has an exceptionally talented cast that makes you believe everything that is happening.

I found each character well written and phenomenally acted. At the top of that list, and maybe the top of my personal favorite acting performances, sits Antony Starr: The Homelander. His performance is among the most captivating and authentic seen in recent memory. No other actor could convert the desperation, arrogance, the psychopathic mind, and insanity that is Homelander as well as Antony Starr. It is honestly, unbelievable how good this performance is. Next to Tony Soprano, Rust Cohl and Walter White, I have yet to see an actor convey this type of emotional roller coaster so well. Truly a generational performance."
10.0,28 March 2024,"I forced myself to read the comics before committing to the show and I am here to tell you: 1) Don't read the comics, 2) Please don't read the comics, 3) Oh God please don't. The show blows the source material out of the water.

The Boys is the R-Rated answer to the question of ""What would it be like if the world had superheroes?"" The answer is obvious: American corporations commodifying and selling the shiny plastic lives of superpowered individuals to the unsuspecting public with the maximum amount of cynicism and profit incentive serving as the lifeblood to keep the money-making machine rolling. In reality, these superheroes are far more flawed than their public personas would lead one to believe, and coupled with super powers, the love and adoration of millions, and the legal protection of a multibillion dollar corporation that will automatically swoop in any time the casualties pile up while 'saving the day', they are celebrities on steroids.

This show is far smarter than a simple surface level satire of the slew of superhero films churned out by Hollywood in the past decade. It's a smart and sharp critique of America's moral compass overshadowed by the eminence of multibillion dollar business; cliched story beats stuffed into Marvel films; the role of social media in how it tweaks our perception of reality; Hollywood's role in manufacturing the truth; the empty pandering by businesses of humanitarian/social causes (poverty, gay rights, etc.); the hollow cheapness of life in a country where the bottom line overrides any consideration or compassion for others, and so on.

Everything from the storyline to the characters was given a new lease on life in ample departure from their comic counterparts. Garth Ennis, the creator of The Boys comic, had the kernel of a good idea but saw fit to squander it with needless mid-2000s edginess and shock for the sake of shock, devolving everything into a gorefest, a sexfest, a transcription of a COD lobby, or a combination thereof. The racism, homophobia, and misogyny that was present in the original comic was edge for edge's sake. There are elements of it present in the show, but the presentation is one of mature restraint and a deft hand, often presenting it with a frankness that simultaneously indicates its wrongness, and thus a darkly ironic humor. The violence and gore is plentiful but not oversaturated as Ennis is wont to do. The show provides the perfect balance of humor, horror, and humanity.

Every main player in this show is multi-faceted, including the villains. There is not a one-note character in the bunch. Everyone is interacting and navigating through this story with their own motivations and hang-ups. Relationships are formed, fragment, stagnate, rekindle, or otherwise spiral off into different journeys. There is never a dull moment, nor a stupid decision that isn't acknowledged within the show. Actions have consequences for the heroes and villains both, and they sometimes come to bite them in the butt in unexpected ways. Truly, this show is a must watch."
7.0,9 August 2019,"The first season starts strong and gets better through the cliffhanger. Fantastic cast, one of those shows where you wish season 2 would be coming out next week. Probably give it a 9.2 but went with 10 to help boost the average in a small way. The good guys are fun to watch - the superheroes are giant a-holes and even more interesting. Only question is - what's with Black Noir getting zero lines and almost no air time?

Update - season 4 has started to spin off the rails. The obvious and forced left wing political agenda is pathetic. If these are the same writers they need to be fired. Hope it gets back on track because they are about to destroy a once great show."

10.0,27 July 2019,"To me this was a modern day Watchmen, fair enough if your a fan of the comics it might not be perfect to you,I dont read comics so I'm fine. Some of the low scores are just outrageous from the bible bashing brigade,and it's not even anti-christian!- it's anti-stupidity from religious believers. fantastic show and had me hooked,sure a few episodes weren't as fantastic of the super brilliant first episode but thats all forgivable."
10.0,27 July 2019,"I decided to give this show a chance even though I didn't expect much at all. Then one episode in I thought, ""this is pretty good"", so I watched episode 2. Several hours later I finished the first season completely and I have to say I'm super (pun intended) impressed! Great acting, funny, dark, violent, and downright horrific at times. It's a bit heavy handed in spots with politically correct stuff, but since that's so prevalent nowadays I've learned that by the time I roll my eyes, the offending scene is over. This show is very graphic and should not be watched if you are put off by violence, nudity (male and female) profanity, sexual encounters, or just about anything that upsets people."
10.0,27 July 2019,Watched the first episode and I'm absolutely hooked. I can't wait to tell all my coworkers about this show on Monday! Starting episode 2 now!

8.0,20 July 2024,This show is brilliant! It is real and raw and honest and gruesome and ugly and terrifying and so heartbreaking. It is amazing and crazy to see the parallels between what's going on in the show and what's happening in the real world and America especially. Especially how it shows the political climate in America is identical to how it is in real life minus the superheroes. The actions and sets and costumes are brilliant and creative and amazing and hilarious. I will always love this show so much!! The writing is so good and the characters are amazing and real and complex and feel real and honest.
10.0,3 June 2022,It literally a mister piece. It has everything from drama to action to fantasy it's perfect i loved it specially with the main characters it was great it's the best show i have seen in 2022 the cgi was amazing wow just wow.

However, The Boys has likeable heroes with loose morals and villains that are genuinely evil! Plus, the fact that it's only 8 episodes makes it easier to watch. Would recommend to anyone!"

10.0,27 July 2019,Karl Urban is fantastic. This series takes a dark perespective to the normal jovial and heroic lens that is present in today's movies (I.e marvel). Amazing series and highly recommend
10.0,18 July 2024,"Since season 4 has already been released, you can write about everything a little bit.

I'm not going to tell you any detailed story about why the series is so cool, what characters are there, how they develop, because even I get mad when it accidentally catches my eye starting in 2019, so briefly about each season and a little more about the newest one.

The first season is just WOW!

Back then, movie comics were at their peak, but still the Marvel antipode with blood guts and obscenities looked unusual.

10\10 just because all the episodes were on fire and I didn't even want to rewind for a second.

Season 2 was the last thing I watched in the voiceover of Cubes, because I was still a young fool then, and she seemed to fit the mood.

Season 2 was also good, but the feelings of watching the first one certainly won't compare. The ending will also fly away!

Season 3 had already begun to sink in the plot, but the new character saved him with his presence. The ending is miserable, which essentially rolled back the plot to the end of season 2. It turns out to be some kind of filler, although there was character development and hooks were thrown for the next season.

Well, our favorite season 4.

You can not even watch the first half of the season and even start with episode 6 somewhere, because there is a plot twist there and at least some movement begins.

If earlier we watched literally one main storyline and there was a complete WOW effect, then by season 4 this scatter of unnecessary and empty timing reached its apogee.

Literally EVERY character has their own separate story to make the viewer sad, but the viewer doesn't care. Having watched the ending now, I understand a little the efforts of the authors, but I love the characters from the previous 24 episodes, so this is in the form: I have an abortion, I love my wife and daughter, I don't know if I'm gay or not, the other one has a sick dad. What am I supposed to do with all this now?

If you don't like it, don't look. I didn't even look, having safely skipped most of this circus.

The last episode, or rather the last 20 minutes, is cool. After that, I want to immediately turn on the next episode, but it will be at best in a year, and at worst in 2, so it is questionable entertainment to make such endings. Last seasons were not spoiled like this and did not look like half a season.

As a result, are these still the same 10 \ 10 as after 3 seasons? Well, of course... I don't want to let him go until 9/10, and he didn't deserve it. I hope the final finale will be good, but in the meantime I'm waiting for another spin-off to be rolled out to pass the time.

Suitable for those who are tired of children's comics, suitable for those who do not like comics, because they are children's and suitable for everyone, because season 1 is the best thing that aired on television in 2019."
10.0,29 July 2019,A much needed fresh look at the whole superhero franchise. Great work by all the actors. Homeland especially is now my favourite super villan :)
10.0,28 July 2019,"I barely knew nothing about this release but saw the cast and read the few details and thought yep go go go......well it was an amazing series. Up there with Daredevil season 1 (if not better!).

So a lot of reviews have covered a lot of ground but first off, Anthony Starr....wow! His portrayal of homelander is compelling, intriguing and genuinely terrifying! He could easily be in top 5 bad guys list. He made me feel genuinely uncomfortable! The way he looks at men, women and children.....he has that Anthony Hopkins pizazz lol The star of the show.

Each character is perfectly casted and the acting stellar. The script is brilliant with Urban's Billy Butcher having the best of it. The story is intriguing, winding and meandering with purpose rather than time filling. You invest yourself completely in each episode. The gore is crazy but despite its lunacy goes perfectly well with the storyline I thought! The action is great although perhaps not as much as some might want to see.

The first series of The Boys is up there with the best and I'm eagerly anticipating the second series. Congratz Prime on this one!"
10.0,7 August 2019,"To start this re-review off, I'd like to state, that I would of given this show a 9 if it wasn't for Karl's Dick Van Dyke cockney accent.

The show is solid. IT ISN'T A SUPERHERO SHOW & that's perhaps what initially turned me off, because, i took it as such & if you do, this show comes off, initially, like a cynical teenage endeavour.

This show is actually a comedy-drama, that utilises the landscape created by the Marvel & DC cinematic universes & I like it, I like it a lot. It's a solid 8.

Cons: Karl Urban's attempt (at what I presume to be) a cockney accent. Far too Dick Van Dyke - Marry Poppins with a good slice of New Zealand. However, barring the accent he does a good job as do the rest of the cast.

Well written & acted.





Below is the original review when I was being a nasty judgemental c...

Judge me if you want, but, those who cast the first stone... & all that dross.

Original Review:

This show is not worth its current IMDB rating. If the show is a 9 what the hell is the Sopranos?

The opening scene is solid, but, it's downhill from there.

The show is the TV equivalent of a 15 year old girl's lunch time drama - It's nonsensical, tangent ridden & pseudo sincere.

3 stars for the opening scene."
10.0,31 July 2019,
7.0,10 August 2022,"The boys is the best show out for a variety of reasons. Absolutely flips the superhero genre on its head. Im sick of being treated like a child. The boys wants to please me and it works. Brutal honesty about real world stuff, violence, exposing hypocrisy, and a great cast. Antony Starr and Karl Urban are spectacular. The former I'm convinced is an alien.

And it has staying power. I love every episode and would rewatch any of them with a friend at any time.

The Peak is also the greatest superhero ever. Thank you."
1.0,3 September 2019,"The Boys seems like the perfect superhero series for an era in which trust in institutions is dying. In this series, our protectors are only pretending to be heroes as they live lives of casual corruption and a disdain for their fellow men.

The first episode of The Boys begins with a horrific, superhero-caused tragedy that is so ingeniously shot that I admired it even as I knew I would have trouble shaking it. Certainly one of the most disturbing things I've seen for a while, but I will acknowledge that the premise requires some horror.

That premise is that the most famous Superheroes, a group known as the Seven, is made up of psychopaths supported by a vast conglomerate that relies on merchandising and media. These superheroes mix the arrogance of celebrity with the monstrousness of unchecked power, but a small group of normal people are determined to bring them down for past crimes.

The one good superhero is Starlight, who looks like an Iowa beauty queen and has always dreamed of saving the world. She wins a role as one of the Seven and finds herself in a pit of snakes. She is harassed and objectified, but is too caught up her dream of doing good to walk away.

The series has a gritty, sour quality to it that made me uncomfortable. It's just such an awful world and even the human heroes are not necessarily the best of people. Starlight's degradation is disheartening, and Hugh's tragedy is heartbreaking and relentless.

What I'm saying is, as Superhero series go, this one isn't a lot of fun.

There are some clever visual ideas, an interesting plot, and good actors. But I couldn't get into it. The first episode is overshadowed by the opening tragedy. The second episode was better, although still dark and disturbing. By the third episode the unpleasantness became too much for me and I stopped halfway through.

I'm not saying don't watch it. I might have liked this series when I was younger and more open to grim experiences. But it's not the series for me.

(Funny thing; one of the other user reviews says the series starts slow but gets really good around episode 5. Someone else said the series started strong but was terrible by episode 5. So go figure on that one!)"
10.0,1 August 2019,"I don't want to add any spoilers, if I can but this is literally one of the most messed up tv series I've watched in years! I've read other graphic novel's and comic series in my nearly half century on this planet but somehow missed The Boys. I'll be honest I'm a diehard opening day Marvel fan and this is dark and I LOVED it! If you like Sin City, Sandman, Watchmen, V for Vendetta I'd say go for it. If your easily offended I'd say stop, go watch Good Omens (also absolutely WONDERFUL!) But much easier on the senses and soul. When you read the warnings in the beginning of an episode they mean it! This series is rated 18 (which I don't think I've ever seen before) with warnings like violence, drugs and rape and honestly they mean it!"
9.0,10 June 2022,"Carl Urban and Antony Starr. Both starring in this most wildest series of all time. They both cruel, psycho and i really enjoy of it. Actually no need to say more but this review has to be at least 150 letters."

10.0,5 August 2020,If you watch its first episode you will get so attached to their story and characters that you can't resist to watch all the series in one shot this the one of best webseries ever made I am giving 10/10👍🏻
10.0,15 January 2023,"Watched 3 seasons and loved all of them. Not a weak episode in this.

I fear they'll mess up in the future seasons, since what they have now is almost prefect.

I don't usually end up giving 10 star reviews, but The Boys deserves it right now. Humor is flawless. Great character development.

An AMAZING villain.

Acting is superb, dialogue as well. Really, all I want in a show is here.

Enough action to be called a superhero show, yet it is so much more than that.

The social satire, the commentary. I watched other hero shows like ''the Peacemaker'' and ''Doom patrol'', and they fall short but ''The Boys'' kept the quality for all 3 seasons and is always an entertaining watch. Highly recommended (for adults)."
7.0,27 January 2023,"I missed the releasebof the first season for an entiee year, until the second season dropped and a friebd recommended I watch it. And I loved it!

The first season has this awesome experimental quality to it, they were actually just trying something different and it worked!

The second season refined some of the flaws, added some more action, the dark humor got better, well written drama and the extra budget they got through it success really shows!

Then season third dropped... My god. I honestly don't know how to describe it. Everything is more ""in your face"" but in a good way. Somehow the producers finally seem to have embraced the edgy nature of the show and went all out on it. I'm pretty sure this is the highest point I'll reach, but I'm glad we got here and I'm still excited to know what comes next."
2.0,3 July 2024,"Here is yet another show that relies on shock value and gore to keep the audience's attention. The plot is good enough that the creators don't need to overdo the way they do. Game of thrones overdid it with the sex scenes every 2 seconds and they extended the show which ruined the ending- which this show is also trying to do. Get out of it while you can cause if they do extend it, it's going to end the same way lmao.

The writers have many disturbing fetishes they put on here for other weirdos to watch and enjoy- what has television and storytelling become..? That's just a personal rant though..."
10.0,28 July 2019,"Finally a superhero show for adults with a lot of blood, humor, sex and a lot of darkness. This is everything I ever wanted to see from a superhero tv show and the best production Prime has ever done"
10.0,16 July 2023,"The boys is a fantastic show which ruins any feeling of superhero fatigue you may be feeling.

Every character is deeply explored and you always feel like a wacky thing could happen in the next scene, or something you could never expect to see.

Although it does drag through with some less favourable episodes and moments which pull down the momentum, it keeps up the pace consistently and has yet to have an episode below good.

The powers are unique and creative and aren't used in stupidly silly ways and instead in ways which someone would actually do if they had those powers. And Anthony Star deserves an Oscar.

A must watch for any fan of superhero movies and beyond!"
10.0,25 January 2021,"The Boys is a dark comedy about superheroes who abuse their power for fame and reputation of their names ( in the presence of their company ) . Or you can say this show exploits the dark side of superheroes .... With our main character Butcher and his "" Boys "" try to bring these superheroes down . I dont want to spoil much since this show is so good especially on the second season which is more darker and more gripping than the first season with the addition of Stormfront ( another Homelander ) . That's just my opinion . Take it Easy"
10.0,24 August 2022,"Review is specifically about season 3.. but imdb somehow show just one title for all 3 seasons so far.

The first 2 seasons are great, but s3 jumps ahead in connecting satire of celebrity culture with superhero genre in the most brilliant way.

Most revealing is the scene from maybe 5th episode, where we see from a voight employee, a crude (without an ounce of empathy), attempt at making a dub video of john Lennon imagine song!

Those who remember during covid lockdown by millionaire celebrities video of similar type, might realize it. Superheroes (instead of millionaire celebrities) who are living in mansions/yatchs etc trying to pander to normies by appeasing them for social media ratings.

The social media wars, where no-one knows who's true or faking is reflected and idiocy levels of the audience as well in this tv series. Its very similar to the millions who commented on a bitter divorce of 2 celebrities (depp & amber) as if each one is an eye witness could be an indication that the dumbo crowds in the boys are the most realistic thing and not fiction.

Of course the series puts the audience in the throne as they see everything happening and be free to judge as someone who has never sinned ever.

Enjoy it, totally worth binging!!"
10.0,10 October 2020,Can't wait until season 3. I was hooked from the first episode in season 1.

10.0,22 June 2024,"I dont understand the hype about the Boys, i mean, there is good action and i can see some actors putting up good performances. But there are so many off putting things stuffed into it.

Most obviously the crazy amount of violence and sexual content, for apparently no reason. Maybe to seem cool or different? Its just so disgusting and out of nowhere.

Most distracting of all, is the painfully obvious political agenda stuffed into the show; conservatives are violent, bigotted nutjobs who believes anything. I haven't seen any commentary on this, but i cant be the only one who is taken out of the show constantly by this.

Also just the general vibe of the show is so pessimistic. I have many other points, but feels like this was the most important beef i had to let out."
10.0,26 June 2022,"Ok...first and foremost...this show IS NOT for kids. It is graphic in EVERY sense of the word. Having said that, the show is better off for it.

Second...leave your scruples at the door. If you're easily offended by extreme violence, extreme vulgarity, or extreme sexuality...fair warning, you won't like this show. Don't worry, no one will miss you, this show has a HUGE fan base, and it is earned and deserved.

Third...this show is the ""bomb dot com!"" It is the apex of Superhero cinema. It has taken all the failures and successes of past superhero IP's and given us lucky fans the perfected product we deserve.

From the very first episode, to the current episode (season 3 episode 6,) The Boys has managed to remain a highly entertaining, top-of-the-pack, take no prisoner's thrill ride.

Do yourself a favor and watch The Boys, you won't regret it! I promise!"
10.0,29 November 2020,It's a dark take on Superheroes. That's probably how they would act if superheroes really existed. All the actors play there part perfect. Just finished season 2. Jensen ackles is supposed to be in season 3. The show just keep getting better. Watch the first 20 mins of the pilot and I promise you will be hooked. Not for kids. I am a prime member now because of this show. I'm so excited for season 3.

10.0,8 August 2024,"Truly a refreshing new take on the life of superheroes, done in a way that is humorous and clever. Whoever thought superheroes were emotionally vulnerable and confused, and also prone to cause collateral damage. The acting in this is all high-level; there are no slouches. The director is sublimely talented... the action is loaded with details and situations that make me scream out loud, and laugh with delight. Although the situations get gory and occasionally somewhat ""pervertedly"" sexual or lewd (Herogasm, e.g.) and the language is continually vulgar, it all seems appropriate and funny. When the lead Boy (Butcher) spews out a clever string of insults in a way in which we've never heard, it makes me laugh out loud. I am in awe of the writers, director, and cinematographer."
10.0,29 July 2019,"When I first came late to the table making up for lost time with good comics, a friend recommended 'The Boys' to me and it remains my favourite comics series that I have read. I was very pleased to hear that it would be made into a TV series and having watched the whole series during the past few days I can whole-heartedly say that I am fully down with this screen adaptation. There is invariably a great deal of naye-saying whenever a much loved comic series is adapted for the TV but in this instance it will be completely unfounded.

It is not a direct literal adaptation from the comics but all of the most significant themes are either accounted for or alluded to for subsequent exploration. The biggest departure from the books is that the TV series is has a noticeably more balanced approach to gender which in my view is definitely a positive, and will certainly appeal to a wider audience. The narrative surrounding the Vogelbaum Compound is also dealt with quite differently but I have a feeling that there are probably good reasons for this that will become apparent as the story progresses. The script and characterisation are excellent, the production is totally seamless and the overall tone is entirely faithful to the books that we have known and loved. This often seems to be an advantage of having the storys' creator closely involved with the production of a screen adaptation.

As usual most of the critical reviews that I read would appear to have been written by people who either haven't actually watched the whole series, don't know where the story has come from (and consequently have no reason to have faith in what we have not yet been told about it), or in some cases have dismissively attributed it to another streaming service. Massive thumbs up! Long may 'The Boys' in its' most recent incarnation continue! ✊"
9.0,2 August 2019,AWESOME!! The writing is great the acting is great. everything is just great.must watch now! Me go pick up big rock now.
10.0,29 July 2019,Brings more emotion and enthusiasm then any other superhero movie you will see these days. Draws you in from the very beginning and never lets you go
7.0,30 July 2019,"This show literally has everything, a must watch. I can't get enough of ""The Boys"" can't wait for season 2. Instantly hooked."
10.0,29 July 2019,"The fact that you can sympathise and hate every character in equal measure. Similar to the achievements of You, Breaking bad, The Sopranos (and no, I do not make those comparisons lightly), the lead characters are literally able to commit murder yet be completely relatable.

This achievement alone would have me scoring highly, yet the clever storytelling of this show is what pushes it above many other shows that are just 'good'.

Never any pointless subplots, sometimes funny, always had my attention.

A must watch, whether your into super heroes or not."
10.0,4 October 2023,"I'm trying really hard not to song like a prude here and I really don't think I an; I am justso tired of seeing swinging penis's!! Seriously, can we do away with the whole deviant sex angle to this?? The show really doesn't need it! It's getting hard to watch with all the absolute rawnchiness and I find I'm fast forwarding through disgusting scenes that don't seem to lend anything to the story; so can you just stop? Let the story rest on its own. It's a good story.. you just don't need all the extra weirdness. Love the addition of Soldier Boy & Jensen Ackles! Hopefully he'll be back for season 4!"
10.0,16 May 2020,"Imagine a perfectly conceived, acted, directed, and produced series that takes the gritty reality of Nolan's Batmen and the first 30 minutes of the first Avengers and philosopher stones them into a stunning masterpiece that is at once totally original and hauntingly familiar... oh, and I was definitely lying. It is NOT for the faint of heart."
10.0,28 July 2019,"This show is top notch! Shocking, funny, dark and a definite can't miss!!"
9.0,1 August 2019,"An avid fan of the graphic novels and not disappointed by any means.

A must watch for any Garth Ennis fans out there."
10.0,9 October 2020,"Wow, Just finished season 2 and this show ROCKS! This is better than Marvel + DC + everything ever made on superheroes"
9.0,10 June 2022,"This show relievers constant content, laughs, a extremely well put together story line, thrills and action. It's everything you want in a show and more. For anyone offended, maybe you should rethink your life. This is a masterpiece. You're just a bad product."
9.0,26 July 2019,Man i can't wait for season 2....they have already green signaled for it..... Epic show. Just watch it
7.0,19 July 2024,"Since the first season this TV series we have seen many and every single episode entertained until the end so much so that it became almost an addiction this series for me, is really too good with ups and downs but despite the low moments are still higher than any other series. Today the last episode of the fourth season has come out and I must say that I'm very excited because we feel that we are getting really close to the much desired ending that (who read the comics will know) will be epic or at least I hope they do so. This last season was in my opinion the most absurd and crazy of the four for reasons that I will not be here to tell you but I assure you that a madness and a violence like that you do not even imagine. I really enjoyed the evolution of Homelander in the series and see the whole American situation gradually flow into the oblivion of the madness of the super. I will say nothing more to avoid spoilers but I recommend rather I force you to watch this show."
1.0,26 July 2019,To play Hughie's dad shows they know the story and fans. I was worried when I saw the changes they made to his part. But doing this reassures me and has me psyched!
9.0,26 April 2023,
10.0,2 October 2020,"This show is the literal definition of what America was and is. It shows how terrorists were made by an American organisation and then tries to be heroes under public eye by destroying them. What a cliche!. This movie is totally different than a lot other American patriotism boring stuff about how US save the world by hiding their dark side. Speaking about the show, the direction has been pretty good, unlike the CW shows that u guys see. Also the storyline is really well planned and is totally unpredictable with all the twists and turns. In my opinion Season 2 is better than first as it involves a lot of subject matter into consideration such as racism, politics, family drama and romantic relationships. However I feel that the Female (Karen) has been given little screen time inspire of the fact that she has got personal revenge with Stormfront."
10.0,27 July 2019,When super heroes are out for number one. Themselves. Oh and big business.
10.0,9 October 2020,"After watching this, you will never wanna see X-men movies again. I guarantee you that, if you are superhero movie/series fan.

Everything what they have done wrong in other superhero series, they have done it completely right in The Boys. Plot is greate, actors are great, all the visual effects are great. One thing that can be minus for some people is high ammout of gore effects and grimness in this series. But hey, it's K-18 and for me its salt of this great serie."
9.0,26 July 2019,"It is a different take on Sperheros for those who are bored to death with same superheros movies or series. It is supported by good story , good acting and good cinematography . You must give this a chance. Those who are used to tried and tested formula of superheros may not find it very interesting but for others it will be very enjoyable."
10.0,10 September 2020,"No boundaries, no moral code. To think that our society finds this disgusting show ""entertaining"" tells you just how far we've sunk. Maybe ""shock"" TV is all it requires to prove our ethics and morals no longer matter."
10.0,27 July 2019,A very gruesome series with a good balance between comedy and hard hitting drama. Great character development aswell.
10.0,8 July 2022,Wow what a season Herogasm was the best episode but this season S03 just made it one of the best comedy/action series I've ever seen. The storyline is amazing and the actors just delivered world class performances and FX was crazy!
6.0,5 September 2020,"Many of the below 5 ratings say 'couldn't even make it through ep1 of s2' etc. i mean you atleast should watch the further eps before you mark it low. By the end of ep3 the show set the further episodes really well. Theres no 'woke' brigade ruining this show or anything, Show's just following along similar lines as the written material. Eps been amazing till now and it sure as heck was fun!"
1.0,1 August 2019,"This show is a joy to watch. Great acting, good casting and a compelling script that takes a look at superheroes from a new angle. Grab a coffee, your favourite tv food, sit back, and enjoy."
9.0,13 February 2024,"The Boys, a series I started watching on someone's recommendation, grabbed my attention with its first two seasons but had me feeling a bit let down by the latest installment, leading to an overall rating of 8/10. Initially, the show impressed with its bold take on the superhero genre, blending dark humor with a gritty, more realistic view of what a world with super-powered individuals might look like.

The first two seasons of The Boys were particularly strong. They offered a refreshing and captivating twist on the traditional superhero narrative, with well-developed characters and a plot that was both engaging and thought-provoking. The show's ability to mix action, drama, and satire was executed brilliantly, making it a standout in the realm of superhero-themed entertainment.

However, the latest season didn't quite live up to the high standards set by its predecessors. The plot began to feel a bit too far-fetched, even for a show that revolves around superhumans. The shift towards more unrealistic elements seemed to detract from the gritty realism that made the earlier seasons so compelling. This change in tone caused the show to lose some of its initial allure and impact."

10.0,31 July 2019,I kept watching...waiting... wondering how they could possibly pull off a decent ending down to the last minute...and they did it. The only thing bad about this show is that it is over. Hoping for a quick return for season 2.
10.0,31 July 2019,I am only 3 episodes in but it has showed enough. It's an awesome show! If you need a reference its like Deadpool meets Thor: Ragnarok and given a boost from there. It's F'ing Awesom!
9.0,25 June 2022,Just finished s03e06 and man o man is this series the rawest or what!! Karl urban and homelander(dont know his name yet) are my favourites what a chemistry😝😝
9.0,16 June 2022,"The Boys has got to be one of my all time favorite super hero TV shows now. The show will always keep you engaged and anticipating the next episode, and the next crazy adventure!"
7.0,29 July 2019,"I liked everything about the series,the staff,the plot,the action scenes and the idea of the series that show how superheroes living among us,I liked it so much"
5.0,27 July 2019,"I started watching this show this morning and binged the entire thing. I couldn't stop watching. The story line is just excellent and it keeps getting better as you watch. Another point to make, all of the actors were so good. The characters were played to perfection. Can't wait for the second season."
10.0,31 July 2019,"I love this series! Dark, gritty, well-acted, and an interesting storyline. Reminds me of a brighter version of Sin City or Watchmen; but more anti-hero. It's so good! It takes a lot to catch my attention for a full series and this one definitely has my attention. I think it's unique and fresh. Give it a shot!"
10.0,13 November 2019,"If it wasnt for the fact that it hasnt ended or that Breaking Bad exists, this one could be right at the top.

The character development it's exquisite. The dark humor and the way they present hard situations is very memorable. I really hope this show keeps going strong like it is now."
10.0,21 July 2024,"The first two seasons were fantastic. Such a fresh adult take on the genre, even the gore had a purpose. Season three the show started to slide. The gore became gratuitous and the plot was driven by how many absurd moments they could deliver.

Now the latest offering is the biggest waste of time and such a betrayal of what made the show great in the first place. In season four we are fed a continuous stream of never ending political propaganda that just doesn't land. Even the new supes they introduced were a let down and completely forgettable.

I sincerely hope the creators course correct for the next season and focus more on delivering a good story instead of thier political views."

10.0,24 July 2024,"The characters are great and I really loved season 1 - It was a very interesting fresh spin on the superhero genre.

But the writing really went downhill after the first season - The plot armor is ridiculous and there is almost no tension left.

The show falls into the usual trap of inventing random drama simply for the sake of making more and more episodes. Most things simply happen without having any meaningful impact on the story.

The worst part is that the writers keep undoing their decisions ALL THE TIME. Everytime they do it, it ruins the tension completely and I absolutely hate it: Oh you thought a character was dead? Just kidding!!! LOL! It happens so often it's impossible to take things seriously here at some point.

Please! - a really good tv show needs some tension - and without lasting consequences of characters actions there cannot be any tension.

This show could've have been amazing - but bad writing ruins it in the long run."
9.0,28 July 2019,It's not perfection but it comes close. This is one of a handful of series that I'll watch over and over again. The casting is spot on and the story is pretty close to the original comic. Season 2 can't come soon enough!
10.0,5 December 2021,This show is every bit of the 10 stars it deserves. It is definitely a fresh take on superheroes. This is what a show should be with people with super powers.
7.0,28 July 2022,"Its Diabolical. This is the most unique and best superhero series. Literacy out of the box content.

Its perfect because the entire plot is very well balanced as it has required amount of action, backstory, focusing on psychology of characters, corruption, humor and much more.

In my opinion this series and its characters should be considered at par with Marvel and DC characters and movies."
3.0,28 March 2020,This is the best show I have seen in my life... I've finished it like 5 times and I'm still addicted to it and can't wait for its season 2 to explore more of that world...! Strictly saying kids below 18 stay away please...
10.0,8 February 2021,I really enjoyed this program. It's not laugh out loud funny but it is quite a giggle mixed in with some good action and great visual effects. If you are looking for something light hearted to watch with a bit of a twist to the classic super hero shows then give it a try.
10.0,30 July 2022,"Yes, the show is gross, gore-filled and utterly shocking at times with how far it pushes the envelope...HOWEVER, if you can stomach the over the top blood, guts and sexual deviancy (Not much nudity, but deviant sexual situations), then you'll find exactly what mature, thinking consumers are looking for:

Crafted, complex characters you can invest in.


Calculated, humanistic villains with real motivations."
9.0,24 May 2021,"It's a totally new take on superhero movies, not what we are used to see. The first season, especially the first some episodes were quite good. It was gripping, fun to watch and story was really well written with great pace but as the series progressed, the pace slowed down a bit.

But still the show is brutal, fun, violent and performances were just convincing. VFX were amazing. The Boys made us believe that there exist a land where superheros are there fighting and taking charge.

Everyone gave their best performance. Characters are aptly cast and very convincing."
9.0,12 September 2020,Pretty boring second season and wow you can't even binge watch it since they don't put out all the episodes...really disappointed.
10.0,1 August 2019,So so good. Best first season of a show I've seen in a long time!
10.0,14 August 2022,I wish I could forget everything ... so I could watch it again and again and again! Sick to say but Homelander is best caracter ever. Dont kill him please !
10.0,9 January 2021,"Can't wait for season 3!!!!!

This show is just too good, thank you!"
10.0,1 August 2019,"Just briljant. Every episode is at least a 9! Never seen anything like it. Can't wait for season 2 (and 3,4,5 etc)"
6.0,28 March 2020,Absolutely sensational series. I was very pleasantly surprised when I started watching it thinking what a relief that they still know how to make spectacular shows like this. Acting is spot on. The menace of homelander is awesome to behold and butcher is simply hands down superb. When I saw it was Karl urban I was initially worried about his take on a strong london accent but not only does he smash it he uses it in a way that's hilarious at the same time. Everyone in the series is excellent and the acting is so good that you don't want an episode to finish because you are completely hooked. Can't wait to see Season 2 and I would say that this is probably one of the best series I've seen in a long time. 10/10.
10.0,4 August 2019,"This is definitely a top tier series after watching the first season. All round it's just excellent. I love the whole superpowers going to these peoples heads. I also like that the actors chosen are not too well known. The humor is very funny. The action is exciting. The writing with the dialogue and the story itself, it's all really top quality stuff. If you don't know much about it well then it's better that way. The premise of the show tells you all you need to know - A group of vigilantes try to take down some corrupt superheroes ( some superheroes are supervillains). The wardrobe sometimes they can blunder easily with these types of shows, but that too looks terrific. I'm now looking forward to next season with the first one being such a huge hit. Hopefully they'll keep the writing team together."
10.0,1 August 2020,"If you're a man 15-35 you'll love this show, it's foul mouthed, dark and violent with a great sense of humor

some people aren't going to like it for one episode, an episode where they heavily criticize Abrahamic religions. (this is not the same ""we're woke"" wank from a lot of other shows)

the actors are great, karl urbans accent does get better or you get used to it i'm not sure. homelander (Anthony Starr) is so good he's straight up unsettling

it's a fresh take of realistic super heroes with realistic threats no 'the world is ending'... yet."
10.0,13 January 2022,"When I first found out about it, I was having second thoughts of whether to watch it, but I'm so glad that I did and I must say -> One of the best TV Series I've ever watched!

Can't wait for Season 3!"
10.0,25 January 2023,"Great plot, characters, pacing and overall truly enjoyable!

Anthony star and karl urban stole the show, quite literally.

Season 1 was a little bit slow but after that it escalated quickly.

Season 3 was the best in my opinion. Now i get it why a lot of people had problems with the finale, but for me i liked it honestly, it is obviously a set up for the future For anyone reading this and did not watch the show, if you can support ultra violence, and you love science fiction and superheroes, this show is for you Without getting into any spoilers, this show is simply great and hopefully it will continue this way.

8/10."
10.0,19 July 2022,
8.0,5 August 2019,Done right!! Loved the whole season finally a darker side to super hero shows!!
9.0,26 June 2022,This is better than any TV Show Marvel & DC has ever put out. Never seen such a perfectly cast Lead Villian & Hero who have different layers to their personality. Not for all age groups & definitely not for disney lovers.
10.0,4 August 2019,"Loved this series, it was a great insight into how it really would be if superhero's did walk the earth.... Really great characters in both the superhero set and the boys. If you enjoy things like dead pool and umbrella academy then this should be on your list. No spoilers here - just watch and enjoy!"
6.0,2 August 2019,"Throw some ""Breaking Bad"" characters and some ""A Clockwork Orange"" ultraviolence and you may get a good idea of ""The Boys."" Starring Karl Urban with a Commonwealth accent, and Simon Pegg with an American accent done well, where the good guys are really the bad guys, and the good guys are the bad boys and you actually get something original and yes...... even some good old fashioned socially redeeming value.

You'll find yourself rooting for ass bombs, sexual foreplay with gills, and newborns with laser eyes.. and you will still like yourself in the morning. I mean... come on... you will love The Spice Girls again too!

All they needed was some original songs and it could have been an operatic tragedy."
9.0,28 July 2019,"Signed up to IMDB just to rate this show, I am not waiting patiently for season 2 and cannot rate this highly enough. The story, the structure, script, actors.. questions it makes us ask ourselves and where the series can go, I was hooked every minute and of course binged watched.. not sure why people would rate it low because of how Christianity was portrayed (one episode), it's a show about superhero's.. people view religion differently, if that's not what it means to you or represents don't take it out on the show!"
9.0,10 August 2019,"Wow. I was not expecting this show to be as good as it was, which I think is partly the fault of the marketing campaign that doesn't do the show justice.

The Boys is special in the way it manages to sneak in humor into even the most gruesome scenes (if you've seen it you know what I mean). Nothing feels one sided - you're never sure who's ""good"" or ""bad"" or whether to feel sorry for or hate the characters.

All actors do amazing jobs, especially Antony Starr, Elisabeth Shue and Chace Crawford."
10.0,12 August 2019,"I won't write a review since there are already so many on here. But all I have to say is, watch it! If you love superhero's or hate them! Watch it!"

The plot, the acting, the script, the characters - I can barely fault it. It's so unique and both seasons were amazing. Bonus points for the woke writers and the hilarious script."
9.0,18 June 2020,"Damn it now I have a thinG for tall, dark men with beards and awful Hawaiian shirts with VERY bad language.

This show is a diamond. It's the perfect antidote for sugary superhero movies. Dark, gritty and very, very funny."
7.0,7 November 2020,It's basically the show we've all been waiting for
1.0,15 September 2019,"The Best Superhero TV series around, no questions asked. The best way to tell a story of ""WHAT IF"" Superheros were corrupted by the Government."
10.0,8 March 2022,"I don't know for someone reason hughie character keeps irritating entire show. He keeps crying and acting like saint .Anthony starr as always gave his best. Acting , suspense nailed it."
9.0,3 July 2022,"You have to love a show that makes no excuses for the sheer unadulterated depravity.

It's wrong on so many levels that it is perfect.

No subject off the cards. It gets worse and worse. I love how it makes you feel sick and enthralled at the same time. A genuinely genius portrayal of the comics. Enough changes to keep fans surprised and a truly great watch.

I wouldn't watch with the kids though."
10.0,30 October 2020,"This is a fantastic show that is a breath of fresh air to a saturated superhero genre that was becoming all too generic. The Boys inverts the standard fare whilst delivering a tongue-in-cheek take on contemporary issues. It's fun to watch, great storylines and great humour, with some brilliant characters. Anthony Starr as Homelander is absolutely fantastic! Karl Urban's cockney accent is also so bad it's good lol. Also be prepared, they don't hold back with graphic violence, so if your queasy watch out for this as it might put you off your dinner."
9.0,12 September 2020,"I watched season 1 and thought it compelling enough to finish the season, but I lost interest fast in the second season. Maybe, I'm just done with super powered themed shows. I see the 8.7 average rating and am trying to convince myself to keep with it, but I don't think it's worth it."
10.0,26 March 2020,"Recently, I've watched «The Boys» from Amazon Prime video. Directors of these TV Series are Eric Kripke and Garth Ennis.As far as I know, Garth Ennis is an excellent scenarist, who wrote many comicbooks about one of the coolest characters in comics-John Constantine. The characters of this TV-Product are played by Karl Urban, Jack Quaid, Antony Starr and Erin Moriarty. By the way, this superhero web television series is based on the comic book with the same name. And it's awesome. So, here is my review of this TV-Project.

First of all, the characters of it are brilliant, especially Billy Butcher who was very cruel, but at the same time, his violence and charisma make him incredibly badass, and Homelander who, in my opinion, is one of the best villains on TV. He is unkillable, powerful and he doesn't have a hint of humanity which makes him very dangerous for the team of Boys, as well as for the whole world. These characters were played by Karl Urban and Antony Starr.

Secondly, acting game of actors's cast is perfect. While watching this TV-Project, you don't even doubt that motivations of characters were badly decribed, because you just fall in love with them. Moreover, you really get enjoy from action in this TV-series. Brutal kills of heroes by the Boys' team will make everyone glad.

In conclusion, I'd like to say that «the Boys» is excellent TV-product which adds something new to superheroic genre. Of course, it's not for all, because not everyone likes cruelity in movies, but I think that it's a kind of fun view on movies about superheroes. And I suggest you to watch it."
8.0,14 January 2024,"Wow. I had some friends recommend this, but it sounded kinda lame ""superheroes gone wrong"" and even the trailers undersold it IMO.

However, for not the first time in my life I was wrong...

It is absolutely riveting television - up there with other gems of years gone by.

An exceptional mix of intrigue, drama, action, suspense - and exceptional plot twists.

It is certainly one to give a go, if you don't like it within a few episodes, then move on the genre is not for you - but if you like the premise of the inside story of what a Justice League would be like in the real world (of course they'd abuse their powers!!) then I suspect you'll be hooked like me!"
10.0,1 August 2019,"Watch this show. Seriously, you'll be hooked from episode number 1.."
9.0,11 October 2022,"My partner had been wanting me to watch the boys for the past year and I finally decided to.

I absolutely love the boys and everything about it, the only thing I hate is homelander ever time his smug little face comes on the screen I wanna throw my remote and the tv. My partner now won't watch it with me cause how angry I get over homelander, but that's okay, other then hating homelander so intensely, it is such a good series and I have recommended it to a lot of people. I love the gore and violence, it makes my boring life exciting and all the twist and turns in this series is great (besides homelander).

I highly recommend watching."
4.0,22 August 2022,
9.0,6 September 2020,"The Boys is a series quite ambitious in its extensions. On the one hand, it firmly presses on the classic who-watches-the-watchmen concern. On the other hand, the show is also trying something new. It is not enough for the TV show to demonstrate superheroism as conservative viciousness or as a state tool of repression. Instead, it attempts to represent a complicated superhero industrial complex that permeates almost all of mass culture and social life. So The Boys' superheroes, corrupt and arrogant as they are, become at the same time the most unexpectedly realistic as their actions are intertwined with business interests, advertisers, sponsorships, rights, fan culture, public presence and public order.

The Boys has the virtue of attempting to see superhero culture as a whole, as an industry and as an ideology. The series cuts through the simplistic superhero ethics of good and evil, the absence of complexity and the culture of collateral damage while balancing the themes it conveys with compelling and rich characters. In conclusion The Boys is a TV series that points to an increasingly diverse, demanding and multifaceted television superhero future. Even if the MCUs and DCUs fall into the cliché, it seems that a superhero door has opened on television that is not going to close any time soon."
8.0,7 August 2019,"Brilliant premise . Smart, cynical, yet honest writing. Inspired casting (Karl Urban is A-Maz-Ing. Even minor roles like Haley Joel Osment ironically as a child-star has-been). Hilarious, shocking, twisted. Did I mention how twisted it is? Yeah, it's twisted. Mwaahaahaahaaaa!"
10.0,7 October 2020,"This show is what other comic book stories should be like. The scripts, the actors, all great. Second season's pacing is... a little bit..mehh.. But, beyond that and the fact that 8 episodes per season is Not Enough(!), it's definitely a show worth watching. If you can handle the adult-ness of it all. .. side note: do NOT, let your kids see this. It will make them grow up much faster than you'd probably like.."

10.0,1 August 2019,"OMG was that one insane ride! It kinds reminds a bit of Watchmen and how many of those superheros were ...Unbalanced ,edgy and dark! My kind of show !he casting in this was incredibly good and I honestly had no freakin idea that Homelander was being played by none other than Banshee's Anthony Star, what with the blonde hair and all...Man, he Nailed that role as a seriously unhinged, Uber dangerous ,egomaniac superhero psycho who gave Every other character on the show ,supe or not reason to be terrified...Those glowing eyes! You get the impression Nothing could stand before this guy and survive, be it a man or an army! just wow! At 1st I didnt get what the title was referring to but ""who"" the boys are becomes very clear as you watch.I loved all the episodes but man, that episode where Homelander is on that plane and what happens next, ooh man! heavy stuff, dark stuff! and the finale episode..whoa....This is so good there had better be more seasons and I mean Plural! this reminds me of watchmen and also Titans, another fantastic show thats dark and edgy...this is just fantastic story writing here with a stellar cast...bring it on, More please!"
10.0,16 August 2022,If you like super hero's you'll like this. A great ensemble cast the preforms a stellar It's a over the top gore and comedy fest that will keep you wanting more.
10.0,1 March 2021,"Easily the best show I've ever watched. Important to note its not for everyone though, very violent."
7.0,18 June 2022,"My only complaint about this series is Erin's obsession with plastic surgery. She is not even 30 but she looks like Joan Rivers' ectoplasmic snail trail. It's sad that she felt she needed plastic surgery to be attractive even though she used to be gorgeous. Now, I can't even look at her. She looks like Michael Jackson from South Park. Everything else about this series is top notch. Please, can we get Erin some help because she looks like Mr. Jefferson."
10.0,27 July 2019,"I initially only watched this because 2 of the leads are kiwis. But managed to binge watch the entire season in 24 hours, it's that good! Very well written & acted & the special effects are amazing!! Season 2 come at me!!"
10.0,10 March 2024,"""The Boys"" is a superhero television series developed by Eric Kripke, based on the comic book of the same name by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson. The series presents a dark and satirical take on the superhero genre, exploring themes of corruption, corporate greed, and the consequences of unchecked power.

Set in a world where superheroes are celebrities controlled by a powerful corporation known as Vought International, ""The Boys"" follows a group of vigilantes who seek to expose the truth behind the superheroes' dark secrets and hold them accountable for their actions. Led by Billy Butcher, played by Karl Urban, the group includes Hughie Campbell, Mother's Milk, Frenchie, and the mysterious and powerful ""super"" known as Starlight.

""The Boys"" is praised for its sharp writing, compelling characters, and subversive storytelling. The series offers a fresh and cynical take on the superhero genre, deconstructing familiar tropes and exploring the darker side of heroism. It combines thrilling action sequences with biting satire and social commentary, creating a thought-provoking and entertaining viewing experience.

""The Boys"" has received critical acclaim for its bold and provocative storytelling, as well as its standout performances from the cast, which also includes Jack Quaid, Antony Starr, and Erin Moriarty. The series has garnered a dedicated fanbase and has been renewed for multiple seasons, continuing to explore the complex and morally ambiguous world of superheroes and those who dare to challenge them."
10.0,27 July 2019,"I've never given a show a 10 before this. What a ride, I've never wanted to see a second season as much as this. Give me more please. I won't say much apart from this is of the highest standard, from the acting to the script to the cinematography my god absolutely perfect."
10.0,6 September 2020,Feels good to see super heroes behaving badly for a change. Never though a series on super heroes could be this intense but got to give this a 9/10
10.0,10 December 2022,"The first season was a solid 9. The second maybe a 7. The third season was downright unwatchable. It was purely for shock value. It had massive potential but it got Seth Roganed with completely unnecessary side stories and disgusting scenes. Not even Dean Winchester, who was amazing in it, could save it. One of 2 shows I've ever watched where I couldn't finish it. Very disappointed in the writers.

I still give it 4 stars overall because there is some fantastic acting from the main characters and the main plot is refreshingly unique for a superhero show. The first season reels you in and hits a homerun for entertaining. After that, it is pretty clear the personal (lack of) morals and identity politics seeped its way into the 'creative' writing. Typical of Hollywood's new agenda driven wave."
8.0,26 July 2019,"This is what we call All-round performance. Tight storyline, Excellent acting, Action packed, Good C.G. and Awesome music."
10.0,27 July 2019,One of the best superhero show i have ever seen enjoyed every single episode of it
9.0,17 June 2022,"It starts building an amazing world based on the hard consequences of having ordinary people with unearned superpowers. But this eventually gets stale and the plot turns into typical formulas and by the third season it's just another superhero soap opera worth of Disney.

It's sad as it was so promising in the beginning."
7.0,1 August 2019,Fantastic adaptation. Kept the core of the comics and changed enough of it to keep it interesting and TV friendly. Cannot wait for season 2.
1.0,25 September 2020,"This show is all about how the media and major corporations control the world. The metaphors in this story keep referring to today's issues. The media groups are portrayed to shift the people's thinking that superheroes are good, basically like FOX News and CNN, to support their own narrative. This show also brings up religion. Now me being a religious person, I felt a little uncomfortable about the anti-religious talk in the show, but if you focus on why they are anti-religious, it's because the churches in the show are all organized by the major corporations, hence the idea of ""theres no God"" in the show. The ones that are trying to bring out the truth are labeled as evil but are actually the protagonists in the show. Needless to say, everyone that can handle gore should watch it. There is some nudity, so close your eyes kids. Also, the amount of cussing in the show is way over the top, but the goal is to normalize this so you get used to it, wouldn't show this to a 12-14 year old tho. But adults should watch it, and get the message of who really controls today's world. There's a lot of parallels to today's world in the show and that's why I like it so much, 8/10."
10.0,7 August 2019,"A twisted look at what the world would be like if Superheroes were real. Take all the messed up situations of today's ego-driven, Instagram generation and ""super-enable"" them and you get something like a full-scale train wreck you can't take your eyes off of. Focuses on the egos, absolute power corruption, liability and how normal people deal with having super folks in the world saving some lives and completely destroying others. This show is extremely well written, expertly directed with a stellar cast. 10/10"
10.0,13 October 2020,"I'm sure everyone has heard about this show by now and if you haven't and are questioning if you should watch it? The answer is yes you should. Likable, mischievous, to down right evil characters are all here. Even some of the evil you kind of feel for by backstory. Karl Urban is outstanding as butcher, but what really keeps you on the edge of your seat is Antony Starr as Homelander. Oh there has not been a baddie like this maybe ever. When he's on the screen you don't know what he will do because he's a sociopath Superman. If you like superhero films you should like this. If you're burned out by the oversaturated beating Disney gave us than you're gonna love this show. It honestly made me look at superhero movies differently. Like I watched Iron Man 2 the other day and the end? They had to kill so many innocent bystanders. This show addresses this immediately. The show will have you laughing, cheering, and be downright angry all within one episode. It's a masterpiece. I'll say it."
10.0,3 August 2019,If your tired of the tried and tested marvel formula heres a show about superheroes that is more an in depth drama than most Perfect 10/10
10.0,3 August 2019,"All the characters, the twists, the action and gore. The way this show handles the topics it covers is absolutely daring, open, bold and full of substance.

It is a prime example of how shows should be done, by the amount of care and attention to detail they put is amazing. Let's go Amazon. None of that weak, fast pumping out of not even mediocre content that Netflix does. Quality is what filmmaking is about, and I'm behind anybody who understands that.

Give the show a shot and you might come out in a full season binge like I did."
10.0,31 May 2022,"It's a cool show, with a great concept. But the second season kind of lost me. Still some great moments but it was just overall not as compelling as I was hoping. Hopefully season 3 is better!"
10.0,10 October 2020,
10.0,9 June 2022,You want to talk about a all star TV show. Wow they gave us an adult version of super heroes. It's the Justice League but bizzaro world version. The effects are wow. The story has been really good. So much blood and craziness. When you think they can't top the last season they end up doing it.
10.0,6 August 2019,"I was compelled to write a short comment. It was just soooo refreahimg to see something new. You don't need to be a superhero freak like me to love this show... you will just love it if you fancy dark satire and fantastic acting.The casting, wow... Anthony Starr (Homelander) and Butch (Karl Urban) are amazing!"
6.0,16 September 2024,"The Boys is a darkly comedic, satirical take on superheroes, turning them into flawed, power-hungry figures controlled by a corporate giant, Vought International. Unlike traditional heroes, ""The Seven"" are corrupt and driven by greed. The show masterfully blends intense action, social commentary on power and fame, and biting humor, with compelling characters like the brutal Homelander and the rebellious Butcher. Its raw, violent style subverts the superhero genre, making it unpredictable and gripping. The Boys explores the consequences of unchecked power, creating a fresh, thrilling, and often shocking take on the superhero mythos."
2.0,11 July 2022,"If superheroes existed it would be a documentary.

I don't mind profanities, gore, explicit content, politics... it takes our world and twists it even more."
10.0,10 July 2022,"I truly enjoy the homage, reference, and satire of the real world, and how this show not holds back at all. However, its plot is not strong and borderlines cliche."
8.0,24 October 2023,"The Boys is a satire show that boasts a gripping and subversive plot that explores the dark underbelly of superhero culture. And it is definitely for people who have dark humor, enjoy watching gory and violent scenes or anything explicit.

There are so many things that make this show so good (but I will just name some):

1. Well-written and structured characters Many shows don't stand out to me because it is hard to find characters that can truly take my interest or even if I do it is just one or two characters in one show. The Boys however, almost every single character hooks my interest.

Anthony Starr does an incredible job playing Homelander, when there is close shots of him, every single facial expression portrays as Homelander. What makes a good actor is when you see them in a movie, you see them acting a specific way, you know what character it is, and this is exactly what Anthony Starr gives. He is truly an exceptional actor and his character almost makes me want to relate and feel sorry for him.

Another actor that deserves a mention is Karl Urban. Karl Urban plays Billy Butcher, which is the arch enemy of Homelander. He is one of the main 'good' characters. He is a character that does the right things for the wrong reasons- revenge. He can play a tough, rude character but at the same time there is scenes where you can see a lot of emotion within him from micro expressions. Truly an amazing, underrated actor.

2. Good Plot What makes a good show/film is often and mostly depends on how good the plot is. In this case it is an exceptionally good one. Without spoilers, I'll just say that the plot is marked by intense confrontations between these anti-heroes and the morally corrupt superheroes, resulting in unpredictable and often gruesome outcomes. The show also delves into the past of the Supes, their disturbing origins, and Vought's sinister agenda. This mix of action, intrigue, and social commentary creates a compelling narrative that challenges traditional superhero tropes. I have seen many superhero type shows/ movies and nothing ever stood out to me to the point where I would pray everyday for a new release for a season.

Overall, The Boys cleverly delves into themes of power, corruption, and moral ambiguity, while offering a satirical take on the genre.

(It definitely gets a 10/10 from me and my fellow peers who I have forced to watch with me. /"
9.0,27 August 2022,"Through 3 glorious seasons, The Boys has managed to stay relatively high quality and thematically satisfying.

It's also sometimes absolutely bonkers and over-the-top.

It's not always perfect though.

Sometimes, The Boys gets too political and it's way too on-the-nose with its messaging, particularly in the third season.

It's not even that I disagree with the messages being espoused, but the series will veer from its incredible graphic-novel-esque, noir-inspired storytelling to relay these messages, like it's just ticking boxes.

Also, there are the occasional power-scaling conundrums that are common in this type of fantasy story and are even more prevalent in things like Shonen Jump anime.

There are also some fast-cut edits in some of the lower-budget action scenes that are confusing and restrictive.

But, when The Boys is firing on all cylinders, there's really nothing else like it.

From Kill Bill inspired martial-arts scenes involving superhero-themed sex-toys to congressional head explosions, when The Boys goes off-the-rails it's a blast to gawk in awe at its brilliant outlandishness.

It's also got some really solid worldbuilding and terrifying antagonists while still managing to strike a well-balanced spark of comedy and tension.

The acting is incredible all around, with the seasoned Karl Urban and the mesmerizing newcomer Antony Starr as particular stand-outs for their respective turns as Billy Butcher and Homelander.

These two really steal every scene they're in.

The Boys is also not afraid to embrace the comic-book schlock-writing that endeared so many fans to the likes of Marvel and DC, and it masterfully respects those fans while adding its own quirky lore and keeping its edge.

If Amazon keeps up this kind of momentum with The Boys, and allows it to gracefully end when it needs to, there's no doubt in my mind that The Boys will be a classic show that is long revered.

It's currently a 9/10."
8.0,11 October 2020,I have a question. Kimiko can't speak/write in English but she can write in Japanese. So why doesn't she write what she wants to say to Frenchie in Japanese and he just use Google translate to translate it? I admire the effort and the acting of some of the actors is really good but the show has turned out mediocre at best.
9.0,1 February 2024,"""The Boys,"" a series that initially captured the audience's attention with its bold and critical approach to the superhero genre, has unfortunately fallen into a common trap in television productions: prioritizing the series' continuity over the quality of the story. This approach results in disappointing season finales and a frustrating narrative, compromising the artistic integrity of the series.

The main issue with ""The Boys"" is the creators' apparent obsession with securing renewals for future seasons, leading to a narrative structure where character arcs and main plots are constantly sidelined. This creates a vicious cycle where each season finale seems incomplete or unsatisfactory, as the series is more concerned with setting up hooks for the next season than resolving the presented issues.

Furthermore, this ""always looking forward"" approach causes the series to miss opportunities to delve deeper into its characters and themes. Instead of exploring the complexities and nuances of the characters, ""The Boys"" often resorts to shocking twists and explicit violence, which, although exciting in the short term, ultimately diminish the emotional impact and thematic relevance of the series in the long run.

The series, which had the potential to make a sharp and meaningful critique of superhero culture and broader social issues, becomes a victim of its own success. Instead of telling a cohesive and well-developed story, ""The Boys"" gets lost in a sea of subplots and character developments that are never fully realized or resolved, leaving viewers frustrated and disappointed."
9.0,16 June 2022,"Blood, guts, beautiful swear words (lots of them), Butcher and Homelander........what's not to like?

It's a close call who is simply the best in this, Karl Urban or Antony Starr. I can't choose. Both are just perfect for the roles. Pair of fantastic cunts."
9.0,3 October 2020,"Amazing show season 1 was great but season 2 is out of this world.Great writing,great casting A perfect series to binge watch ......must watch season 2 is amazing"
9.0,3 August 2019,I knew this show would be good but bloody hell its fricken awesome thanks to all who have worked on this show.The actors on this show are perfect in every role especially my fellow kiwi's karl urban and anthony starr they are both bat crazy so if you guys get a chance watch u wont be disappointed.
6.0,2 August 2019,I loved The Boys from the beginning till the end. The Story is absolutely great and the acting is also extremly good. I love the brutal style of the Boys as well. It is different from all the superhero stuff we get to see several time per year in cinema. And that is great! I am really looking forward to Season 2 and wish everybody a great time with this show. It is worth watching it.
1.0,8 July 2022,
8.0,4 August 2019,"From the moment I started watching the 'The Boys', I was reminded of 'Watchmen', which also twists the superhero genre into something dark. This is a very timely series in that superheroes are part of American mythology, and as the American dream and democracy are facing existential threats, it is only proper that we ask where are the heroes whose task is to save America from peril?

A great series that I am hooked on after the episode 1 of season 1!!"
9.0,1 August 2019,"First off, I love anything superhero related no matter the background, somethings can get a little to Hollywood, Michael Bay, and JJ Abrams. But this show is none of those take the show preacher mix it with watchman stir the pot a little and throw a good well written script and this show was made. It doesn't bore, it makes you laugh and it surprises you. I really liked watching this show just for the simple fact of originality. There is to many reboots of reboots of reboots going on these days and what people want but are afraid to say is something gritty something that makes the people say damn did they really do that. And if it's to much for some people well so what they did it anyway, for that I love this show and can not wait till the next boundary pushing season."
9.0,9 October 2020,Can't wait for the next season. Absolutely brilliant season finale.
8.0,29 September 2024,"The Boys starts off with a stellar first season of great story-telling and character development. The show pushes boundaries beyond what the viewer will expect and beyond what most shows consider possible. Each show is produced like a movie. I loved the first season, but the show steadily devolves from there. The first one notices is internal inconsistencies, particularly in the characters. Characters do and say things that do not fit their prior choices and character arc. I get that these characters are complex, but when characters travel too far beyond their histories and behaviors, it comes over as disjointed, disappointing and confusing. By season 5 (the last season available as I write this), the storylines give way to gratuitous violence for apparent lack of anything else to say. It's a shame, really. Overall, the show has something special and season 1 shows originality and artistry well beyond the norm even for the great ones. Unfortunately, like many series before it, the writing seems to have given way to ""shock and awe"" with little satisfaction for the viewer."
8.0,27 July 2019,"Karl Urban is so good in this, that he is by far the reason this series was fun and enjoyable."
9.0,11 August 2019,Such wow! Finally a great superhero series for adults. So dark and so funny.
8.0,20 June 2021,"I find it hilarious that all these ""fans"" of the show say they loved the first season for being all in-your-face-screw-the-elites and then say they hated the second season because it became all ""woke"" and ""political"" all of a sudden. Um, the first season was just as political as the second!!! It is practically shouting in your face throughout that the rising power of corporations due to unchecked ""free market"" policies and greed is ruining our society, stomping on the average person and creating a huge wealth gap where the rich keep getting richer. You just didn't see deep enough to recognize it. The first season is CLEARLY anti-capitalism, anti-misogynistic men, anti-military, anti-religious (especially Christian) power, hypocrisy of the people we look up to, privilege of white men to get whatever they want, manipulating the media, etc. That is all stuff those complainers would characterize as ""liberal wokeness."" The show didn't change from season one to season two. The only difference I can see is that they added a theme of white supremacy, which goes along with capitalism and all that other stuff anyway, so the people complaining here are really just complaining about a show discussing real racial issues that are prevalent in our society because it makes them uncomfortable to have to recognize. The fact that reviewers are mad about a show telling them white supremacy is bad is VERY telling about these reviewers. That being said, if you think about it, all the bad guy superheroes, even in the first season, are white, while the ""Boys"" are more diverse, so it was hinting at white supremacy all along. Anyway, this is clearly an anti-capitalism, anti-corruption, and anti-everything-unjust-about-this-world show. Take it or leave it, but don't kid yourselves. It has always been this way and will continue to be. If you're offended, good. I believe that was the intention all along. One more thing: it is incredibly hypocritical to be against the ""elites"" in power and also support free market capitalist, multi-conglomerate corporatism. Capitalism is the root cause of inequality and some people having all the power and money while most have very little. This show has been trying to teach you that from day one, but you clearly choose to ignore the truth."
10.0,4 August 2019,"This season 1 is simply awesome. I wish Amazon would do a second season for following enjoying a ton like with this firs season. Homelander is the best villain in years, for me, the bes villain in films or tv shows. Amazon has done a great, great, great job"
6.0,6 September 2020,If after the first episode you're not hooked then i dont think youll like the series. I on the other hand was hooked the moment i finished e1
2.0,30 July 2019,"Well written and excellent cast, even the terrible, strange accent of Karl Urban (very Dick Van Dyke) could not spoil the watch. A great twist on the Genre exploring the flaws of Super heroes. Urban is great throughout (despite the accent)"
9.0,2 August 2019,Amazing tv show. You can binge watch no problem. There is no doubt I would watch a second season of this show.
10.0,12 January 2024,"This show is probably one of the best shows out there. It offers a unique perspective and a satirical representation of the world. It can make you think on many levels and also entertain you with its dark humor.

I didn't like how gory it is but some scenes are really pushing the limits and offering something different in a tv show.

Surprised to read so many people liked Homelander, he is definitely my least favorite character.

And I must say bringing Jensen Ackles as Soldier boy was the best decision, he made the show even better. I wish they'd show more of him in the future season.

All in all looking forward to see what comes next. That show is definitely a winner."
9.0,29 July 2019,"Absolute amazing series, characters portrayed very well, gripping, entertaining, action, great comedy! A series am sure to go far! Karl Urban at his best!"
9.0,5 July 2022,"Season One WAS AMAZING 8.5/10 Gritty, brutal and punk. Was great, like a more fleshed out Watchman series without that gross bargain bin feel to it like 99% of Amazon Prime Video stuff has. Amazing characters, great actors all around. Homelander especially who can go from Icon of Justice to terrifying sociopath in an instant. It was great, very promising. Understandable. NO REAL WORLD POLITICS in there, just IN-UNIVERSE politics. TIMELESS.

Season 2 7/10 OKAY, someone's starting to get too high off their own petard and now hijacking this show for their own political soapbox but it still is 70% show 30% CURRENT THING politics, not offensive, noticeable but not offensive and still somewhat enjoyable.

Season 3 4/10 Now they're just drunk with their influence and good will they garnered for the show. It's now 50% The Boys world a la the comics, and 50% REAL WORLD issues treated with the poise and grace of a wrecking ball. A Train has always been the annoying token character and at first they hid that fact, and it made some sense in the beginning. BUT THEN season 2 and 3 they removed the slight depth he had built up in Season 1 by the end and made him 100% political/social issue prop. Sanded all that depth down til it was perfectly flat and 2D.

The 'BLM' episodes were so blatantly offensive, inaccurate and borderline inciting. Then again you remember who used to own Amazon, now owns the Washington Post, which has lost countless defamation cases, against children even in the past 6 years, so makes sense. Then there was the continuation of the whole ""Nazi"" plot that was from the previous season which again was only in there for ""THE MESSAGE"" purpose. Just seems like everyone's character except Quaid was sanded down to be super 2-dimensional, and maybe Homelander.

I know there's two episodes left this season, but I don't see how they redeem this show. You took Starlight who was a great 3D badass woman and neutered her this season, why? HUEY that's his, comes into his own and kind of makes her redundant, another thing happens and shackles her even more. There better be a hell of a redemption arch for her by the end of this season, since currently I haven't seen a strong female character done this dirty since Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn (which is not her fault, I think she's a great Harley, they just write her terribly, a character that in the animated series was a DOCTOR of PSYCHIATRY, one of the best in the COUNTRY).

Conclusion: DROP THE REAL WORLD POLITICS FROM THE SHOW, it will age this and not in a flattering manner. The writers aren't talented enough to treat serious sociol-political issues in a realistic light, or with the care they deserve. THE BLM episodes cartooned those events doing a disservice to both sides. BUT TO be expected when Seth Rogen, I laugh at stab victims who aren't on the same political side as me, even if they're minorities. Season 3 is at its best when it's dealing with ONLY IN-UNIVERSE topics. Like the change in power dynamics at Vought. That stuff was great, the stuff with A-Train comes off as minstrel show-like. Stick with the fantasy world of The Boys, and leave real world issues out of it. Since I don't doubt that next year you'll hamfist a ROE V WADE plot line in the show that won't make sense come off super forced, and once again, MIRE a show that started out AMAZINGLY."

9.0,7 April 2023,"One of the best superhero series i have witnessed, what if the entire system is corroded. Roasting the marvel and DC characters in an epic level. What a match up work. A beautifuly well crafted series with heavy and good writting. This comes under a drama genre which is so good. The action acting plot scenes dailogues and mainly the brutality was top notch stuffs. Kudos to the entire boys team. Karl urban, omg his attitude and performance entirely through the series is top notch. And coming to the best man and actor of this series is Anthony starr, the homelander, he just killed with his performances. A solo play, with all efforts. His action and reaction is the pain showcased of people who work in corporate. Others characters like MM hughie Frenchie starlight were at their best. There r many other stories in parallel which is good and easy to follow as well. The best and must watch series, available in prime, please do check it out. PS i started to watch this series just because of the trending meme ""The boys"" and the imagine dragons song. Just with this temper i watched the entire series which came to be an osm one."
8.0,23 October 2021,"Any actual criticism that can be levied at season 2 of the boys is drowned out by a sea of people calling literal Nazi bashing ""woke"". Real self report guys."
9.0,2 August 2019,I didn't know what to expect from this series but it hooked me in quick. Karl Urban & the cast are great. The pace is fast & the show is not what I was expecting. Great cliff hanger to end season 1. Can't wait for season 2!
7.0,1 August 2019,It is graphic exploitative grindhouse. It is also what you get when an exec watches 'Misfits' and gets ideas and is a 'Watchmen' for this century. I like it (it's fun with great acting) but I'm very wary of the Starlight exploitation/mysogyny sub-plot.
9.0,11 August 2022,"You should definitely give it a try this series is so crazy with nudity,crazy voilence,and rough words This series shows the true face of superheros unlike marvel .

My favourite character is butcher He is handsome and can go off its limits .

Go watch it now but below 15 please don't ."
9.0,21 November 2021,"In this series we see how superheroes would really be in the real world: stars in the throes of omnipotence delusions, how in reality anyone would behave in their place. If a normal person discovers that he has superpowers, I am sure that in a couple of days he would believe God has come down to earth. Who could stop him? In this case our beloved ""Boys"", a badly managed group of people without great skills but with a lot of luck and a mission."
10.0,2 October 2023,"""The Boys"" storms onto the small screen with a wickedly irreverent take on the superhero genre, earning its stripes as a darkly comedic and subversive delight. The acting, led by Karl Urban's gritty performance and a standout ensemble cast, injects a healthy dose of cynicism into the superhero mythos. The film editing sharpens the satirical edge, navigating seamlessly through moments of gore, humor, and jaw-dropping revelations. The strength of the series lies in its fearless dismantling of superhero tropes, offering a refreshing and often shocking perspective on the consequences of unchecked power. However, the weakness may arise for those seeking a more traditional superhero narrative, as ""The Boys"" gleefully subverts expectations at every turn. The music, with its cheeky song choices, adds an extra layer of irony to the chaos. With an 8/10 rating, ""The Boys"" emerges as a binge-worthy rollercoaster that doesn't just break the fourth wall but gleefully smashes through it, leaving viewers exhilarated and questioning the very concept of heroism."
8.0,14 February 2023,"Full of surprises. Almost impossible to expect what is going to happen next. Loved it! Performances of all actors were amazing but especially Anthony Starr as Homelander was incredible. Also the show gives us the presentation of Eric Kripke's imagination and creativity. As a big fan of Supernatural for 15 years, it is really fun to see something from him with less holdback. The show questions more than the superhero concept, it feels like a interesting metaphor for the modern world. Loved all the pop culture references.

By the way, Jensen Ackles killed it in Season 3. Soldier boy had similarities with his Supernatural character Dean of course but for the most part it was different than anything he has ever done."
10.0,22 October 2020,"I've never been one for the super hero genre. Yea I watched Superman back in the day and Batman, whatnot. I haven't watched any of the new stuff out there today because it is absolute crap. This is different with the superheroes being the villains and I like that, but is it really that different? Not really, a regular crew that can match superheroes and somehow survive? That makes them superheroes themselves. I'm only in season 1(ep 7) and the political agenda is already flowing in hard. I've read that they go fully woke in season 2. I'll probably finish S1 and then can it. Go woke, go broke."
10.0,27 February 2023,"Season one was so exciting, groundbreaking, and promising. Seasons 2, and 3 turn the whole thing into a cheap soap opera. Daddy, mommy, basic relationship issues, wash, rinse, repeat. What a disappointment. From something that started as a long awaited sobering alternative to Marvel, it colapses on to itself to the point Marvel seems like a masterpice. Characters get confused, mixed up, no real hero of the story, no lead character, no real anti hero either. Lazy writing, lazy directing, and still no explanation why Butcher couldn't have been an Australian, or New Zealander. Everything i liked about the firs season gone with the wing, including Elizabeth Shue."
10.0,11 September 2023,"Review for (The Boys)

This series is VERY unique and NEVER done before , The story is so well written and I can't believe I haven't watched it when I've heard of it in the first time , BUT now that I've watched it I can safely say that THIS is EXACTLY the OPPOSITE of what you will think of a superhero Series.

It flips the thinking of the whole concept of super heroes , turning the evil into good and good into evil and it's done in a really good way.

The pacing is fantastic the plot moves from the first episode real quick and it shows how bad those supes are.

This series is entertaining but it has some episodes that are kinda boring and slow , but it's worth the slow burn of the plot.

The acting of Karl urban , Antony starr, Jack quid is PHENOMENAL especially Karl urban he is my 2nd favourite character known as William Butcher.

The best character here is of course , HomeLander , his acting is very amazing and EVERYTIME he's on screen you know that this is the best moments in that episode and I am not kidding he is really superior and really powerful as a character and I can say more but it's alright.

A lot of other characters have different roles and personalities and I like everyone of them , every other character in (The Boys) are amazing like , Frenchy, M. M Kmeku and more.

This series is really fun and the fun part is the superhero stuff and it's really the opposite of what I've thought about.

It's easily Amazon Prime's best series ever and I would recommend it if you have the time , Overall 9/10."

3.0,4 August 2019,"#SeriesReview #TheBoys You can't expect more than this from this budget. Good cast, good acting and spot on dark sarcasm on the heroic idiosyncrasies. A must watch! Better than any average anti hero plot. You might get some hint of Watchmen in here too."
9.0,25 May 2022,"Having just binged the first 2 series I really enjoyed this novel twist on the whole 'super-hero' genre.

Be aware it's not for the faint hearted though as there is lots of gore, blood and swearing. The latter being responsible for my wife stopping watching it and leaving me to watch it myself.

Whilst I don't mind 'normal' swearing as I do plenty myself, I'm afraid I can't condone the overuse of 'c**t' by Billy Butcher mainly. It simply isn't necessary and does not make sense. I haven't read the graphic novels this is based on but after reading other reviews it appears that Butcher is meant to be English but if that's the case then they've messed up completely here. I'm English and I can tell you for a fact that we definitely do not say 'c**t' in almost every sentence, in fact it's probably the most taboo swear word here and is used very rarely by anyone. Also Butcher's accent in the show is definitely not English/British at all. He's actually speaking Australian (not surprising as Karl Urban is from New Zealand) so I've had to take at least 1 star off my rating just for that.

Apart from those faults it's a very entertaining show and is a true indictment of modern corporations."

10.0,24 February 2021,"So freaking fun, and dark, and twisted! Just pure adult entertainment that reminds you of your youth but on steroids."
10.0,2 August 2022,"Realistic, good story telling as well as character development. Very nice to follow both sides, the boys and Hollander and his team. It is kinda what they did in got. Very good character who you can sympathize with."
10.0,3 October 2020,"I love The Boys from the first episode. It just grasped me. A new show is always excited, interesting setting, likeable characters and a great promise. My expectation was normal humans taking on supers. Trying to outsmart them and find their weakness to take them out. This is what I expected after the episode with Translucent. Maybe my favorite part was when they got him, and at the same time they had to escape one of the most fearfull super ever. Two points for the humans. Unfortunately it didn't go that way, instead they go after the company behind the supers. Nothing wrong with choosing a deeper story than action. First season deserved a 9.

Season never got the same steam. Yes we know, some supers are just super evil. But it really gone off the rails with episode 7. Suddenly they drag all the political nonsense and wokeness in this show. Outside universities, higher educated green-liberal millenials, Hollywood and globalist no one cares about this stuff. We normal people who go to school, get a job and just want to live a good life for ourself and the people around us are sick and tired of this political garbage. When the subtitles even write SJW and expect us to know what it means you know you just blew it with many viewers. This is how you lost the election 4 years ago. The Boys did many things right but politics killed another show."
10.0,31 August 2023,
9.0,27 July 2019,Mere human trying to take down corrupt superheroes? Very interesting and binged watched it after I got hooked on the first episode. Def not a kids show. Can't wait for second season! Don't miss this!
10.0,2 August 2019,I loved this from the beginning and it got better towards the end. I hope there is a Season 2 I can't wait to see how things progress. Thank god for Amazon prime and Netflix for making brilliant programs 😊
7.0,23 June 2022,"Pacing: If I had to rate season 1 alone, it would be 10. Season 2 was slow and had the unnecessary storytelling which didn't move the plot forward. For many scenes, I found myself skipping, especially the scenes between Kimiko and ""Frenchie"" which were very boring. Season 3 does pick up some pace.

Politics: Some seem to be offended that show has turned ""political"". It's a satire, not Michael Bay's Transformers, so of course it has to be political. If you're looking for senseless action where Captain America saves the day and can do no wrong, Marvel films might be better suited. This show makes fun of heroic narratives. Those who are easily offended and belong to the political extremes of Maddow and Tucker, this show might not work. It mocks the Right, Church's role in Washington, DNC and corporations' hijacking of social issues to advance their own careers & profits. And yes, it also ridicules corporate rebranding of ""girl power"", BLM, and feminism.

As for the ""Supes"", some of the writing is inconsistent. With the exception of Homelander and Storm, rest of them don't seem to know when to use their powers.

The show itself is refreshing, something very different and bold."
1.0,5 September 2020,"This show is violent , bloody, and freaking hilarious at times. Great character development, awesome storylines, and keeps me on the edge of my seat.If you're tired of the over CGI Marvel and DC movies with very predictable outcomes you should definitely watch The Boys!"
10.0,11 June 2022,"Without giving anything away, this is like a superhero show if it was written and directed by the creators of Rick and Morty. Absolutely fantastic show. 100% recommend to anyone with even the slightest twist to their sense of humor."
8.0,30 July 2019,"Not going to lie, I went in watching this show with doubt's but I am so thankful I watched it, everything is perfect in my opinion. The pace, the acting, the writing. I can't wait for the next season!!!!!"
9.0,30 July 2019,Really best series of this year ... can't wait for season 2
9.0,12 April 2023,
8.0,21 November 2020,"After a good start, it's became just a teen soap opera with simplistic, preachy reflectations about our current world behind cynical humor and violence to make it look ""cool"". And it's getting worse. There are some random good ideas thrown in here and there and there is some good acting occasionally, but it's all far too rare, so I give it a 3. Perhaps teens and young adults ought to enjoy it more."
9.0,19 February 2024,"It's worth watching and probably only reason that people even watch prime video.

Homelander is amazing villian and Billy butchers British accent swearing is really one the best thing in the series And frenchie is probably my best character And hughie is more like a side pack

Im currently watching 2 season where butcher gets and other hide from homelander and homelanders gets to know about his son.

Character of deep is really troubled till now. From the seven to being disturbed

And maeve is also one of the best character because she till now doesn't do anything.

To sum up it's really good and if you have subscription of Amazon prime then watch it because its really good."
9.0,28 July 2019,"Allow one premise that superpowers exist, but without the assumption that superpowers make people ""good"" and you have the setting. Intelligently written with a quirky no holds barred sense of humour and you get a brilliant show up there with the best of them. Reminds me of Watchmen. Does power corrupt? Watch and find out...."
8.0,26 July 2019,Very entertaining show but boy does Simon do an awful American accent
6.0,24 February 2024,"In my opinion ""The Boys"" had potential. However it was just like they didn't care. The only thing the creators did care about was to make it as gruesome as possible. Season 1 took so long to start, it took me a few months to finish it because it was just so boring and there was no plot the first episodes. It was just violent and sexual. That's it. That was the entire plot. The characters had no character development at all! In my opinion Starlight should have been the main character, she was this obviously good character who was innocent and didn't know what she was getting herself into. She was the kind of character that you could have empathy for. The other characters however didn't, for example Homelander. He was just evil, and being controlled by the council or whatever. Like he could have killed them all with a look but he just didn't, he just kept acting like their little pet (aggressive little pet). Also something I don't get is why starlight didn't just quit when she got there, yes the money would have been good but really, was it worth it? And when A-train was kicked out of the seven and then he just came back with no hard feelings, is just unrealistic. It's nothing against any of the actors, they were good at their jobs but the plot point and the character development was just nonexistent. Yes, I get that this is a tv series that is making fun of superheroes, but having no characters that you can relate to and or have empathy for is just stupid tbh.

Like you can make characters that are evil and that you can feel for.

For example, the joker, Ultron, Anakin skywalker, Lucifer, Loki, John wick, Deadpool. These are characters who are inherently evil, but in the boys there was just 0 effort in making these characters have anything that could have made us care about them."
4.0,10 October 2020,"10/10 for the show. But 1/10 where it counts, because I've never seen so many flaming anti-gun liberals make so much money creating one of the most violent and gory shows of all time and yet in every after-episode where we get to hear the actors' thoughts they denounce America, our way of life, and essentially a reason they make money with this show. I'm looking forward to this next 2020 election result so Eric Kripke and the rest of this cast can come to terms with where America stands. Don't wear the flag, if you can't bear the weight of the cape you made it from. Amazon, plz, season 3, blow em all away. Let's get new writers, new actors, and a new after-show host. I've never once walked through a metal detector, nor have my friends, in order to go to school. That after-finale ""fact"" was just BS. The fact is you can look up violent crimes and how countries such as the UK have had increased cases since banning guns. Let's also take Chicago. In a single year, more murders than the Vegas shooter, but no guns allowed for honest citizens there to defend themselves. Seriously, wake up. We're sick of hearing you celebrities that live in your little McMansions and spew your bs politics. See you at the polls."
9.0,26 July 2019,"Wow. Just wow. Amazing show. Production, Cast, writing, plot, all very well put together. Well done Amazon and team!"
10.0,27 July 2019,"They made something like this. Dark, gruesome, humor. Good guys arent always who they say they are!"
8.0,3 June 2022,"I honestly wish this show was 12 episodes a season but I guess you knw it's Good when it doesn't seem like enough..This is my current favorite show started when It came out and realized this isn't the average superhero/ action show..either way WATCH THIS!! It's worth it!! And the 3rd sesason has not disappointed!!

💯💪🏽"
8.0,27 July 2019,"I enjoyed this on so many levels even before episode 5 which sealed the deal. It is entertainment, social and political commentary and satire all in one. I will be very sad when I've finished the season but will be looking forward to the next installment. Heed the warning, this is NOT for children, prudes or the squeamish. I have a feeling there will be some bad reviews coming from the magats but ignore them, this series is gold."
10.0,13 October 2020,"Season 2 is below way the expectation. Starlight, Hughie are so fuqing annoying, more they are romantically involved show just getting worst. Too much unnecessary romance is going on. it's not a fuqing romantic show and already 8 episodes are done. I hope they come up with better story with season 3."
10.0,5 October 2024,"This show was amazing until Season 4 which is a steaming pile of sh#$. All of a sudden the writing and directing and acting went off a cliff.

There's no way the people responsible for season 1-3 can be the same people responsible for season of. It's so bad it ruins the entire series for me and I question if I even want to return to it when season 5 comes out.

It's gone from whitty satire and a good story and good acting, to a complete mess with an awful story, horrible forced acting, the most pointless story and idiotic dialogue. I Cs to believe this shown was ruined so much by the people involved... Smh."
10.0,13 September 2020,If the producers are hurt by these horrible reviews then next time please consider releasing all episodes at once thank you.
8.0,26 July 2019,"Really great production and an entertaining story. However, Too many elements from the comic are missing. (understandable). The tone of the comic would never transfer to TV.

Karl urban's accent is terrible, and that is unforgivable. Would have also liked to see Hughie and a Scottish character to be true to the comic."
6.0,20 March 2023,"What a gem. Well done to everyone involved in making this show. Such a welcome relief from serious, self congratulatory superhero movies. Inspired casting of Anthony Starr (Homelander) and Dominique McElligott (Queen Maeve). Starr gives Homelander enough menace and enough mania in his eyes to make the character. McElligott gives Queen Maeve the pathos, strength and vulnerability to make the character. I came to this when 2 full seasons were available and watched both seasons over a weekend. I had ignored this before reading a review and realising this was a different take on the entire superhero genre. Thoroughly enjoyed the first two seasons, looking forward to the next season."
3.0,10 October 2020,"It's all of crude, gory, joyfully over-the-top nonsense. I've never seen the source comic but this is certainly in every way a comic book come to life. Despite a large portion of the (excellent) cast being not-American, this show is a shamelessly and well-executed embodiment of American kitsch, up there with hamburgers and apple pie; an epic fatty, sugary, guilty pleasure."
9.0,9 October 2020,"The Boys is the show that the most made me put my hands over my eyes. Each scene I don't know what to expect. I know it'll be gory and exploding heads. What I liked most was it didn't happen when I did that. It keeps happening when I think nothing's going to happen. The cast is good, the making is good, the humour is good, the action is good (eventhough most of it is exploding heads). Can't wait for season 3. P.s. what a twist it was in season 2 finale."
8.0,3 August 2019,"Attacking the whole Disney superhero norms of the last 10 years was pure satisfaction for a few episodes. Since in overall the series is not progressive to anything much more than that, it can't be a perfect score, but it's still very much worth it."
8.0,3 August 2019,"What else can I say, this has to be the best, most original super hero show yet. I never do spoilers in my reviews so there is not much I can really say about this show without giving stuff away, so I'll just say that if you like super hero stuff with a very adult twist and a few laughs on the way, then you have to see this show."
9.0,13 October 2020,"I'll be honest, I'm not from USA, so... I really don't care what's happening there ( from a political view), and I know why season 2 ""deserves"" all the hate. But you can't deny it, it was good. Well, not like season 1, but still somewhere between good and amazing.

Yeah, maybe season 2 was kinda.. slow. I agree with the rest of the people on that. Sorry, but I didn't read the comic books, so I don't know how different the tv series and the comic books are.

What I love about this series, is the cast. They do an amazing job. Also, I loved that they casted John Noble (Sam Butcher, the father of Billy Butcher) who both John Noble (Denethor) and Karl Urban (Éomer) played in my favorite movie of all times (The Lord of The Rings)."
8.0,20 July 2024,"It can't be overstated how good and fresh the first 3 seasons were. Even the 4 season still holds its own, just not nearly as well. The political parallels to current politics/news is uncanny and the symbolism borders on prophetic based on when it was created and when they got released.. For those review bombing because of the fourth season, i would ask y'all to be a bit more patient. Some of the decisions they made in this season were unfortunate and for sure a bit of a grind to get through without some eyerolls. However, i'm still quite excited for the next season based on the last episode. I hope the creators are paying attention to the critical feedback and don't just ignore it. If they can manage a small course correction back to what made the first three seasons so great, this show will by far go down as one of the best shows in the last decade."
9.0,17 June 2022,"Season 1 was fresh. It felt brave and free, took risks.

It was really a oasis in the dessert of ideological driven, moneygrabing soulless entertainment that Hollywood has turned into.

But alas, as the series grew in popularity wokeness has crept inn from the shadows and sterilised this once magnificent freespirited series. Now its an philosophical dead end, and all of whats left is the exterior of it desperately trying to keep us hooked with ever the more over the top violent action, and crazy scenes. Which are amazing, and at times hilarious but are not in of it self the most important.

I give it a 6 because of a great first season, and because of some very creative amazing scenes (through the whole series), and high quality production wise. Acting is also pretty good, and many of the characters are well written.

Would have been a 8-9 if it had not given away its identity to identity politics."
9.0,16 June 2024,"This show just drags and drags and drags until the show some whacky nudity and violence. That's the hook. Characters are bland and have basically stayed the exact same for four seasons now. After four seasons you would think there would be at least at little character development but no, not in this show. Homeland should have died in season 2 because his character is just old and predicable. Season one was fresh and exciting but after four years of the same thing you're better off just watching something else. Don't waste your time and watch Invincible instead. I just don't think they knew where to take this series after they deviated from the source material."
8.0,5 September 2020,Season 2 is not so good. I enjoyed season 1. S2 Episode 1 was slow. I watched it and made it halfway through episode 2. For me it is just not living up to the first season. To each his own. And I hope everyone enjoys season 2. It just didn't keep my interest. Thanks
7.0,7 July 2022,Delivered what viewers needed. Extreme level. 💥 Performance was absolutely amazing. Toni starr was astonishing Creators have done an awesome work with the vfx. Its so fun to watch. Story is getting pretty much intense in each episode And totally it exceeds the expectations 💫💫
1.0,30 June 2023,"If i can brief this show in one sentence it will be ( Excellent acting and script) .. really welldone everyone . I enjoyed this show to the very last episode at season 3 and hope there will be more ... entretaining and yet dark.

Just be patient with the 1st episode at season one .. and as i said the acting really nailed it. I loved each character even the short time characters.

This show will hook you. You will find it so interesting that you can't stop watching it.

I think it deserves it's place at the top 250 TV show at the history and i hope there will be more seasons soon.

I also wish the actors have awards for it."
9.0,5 July 2024,"The Boys is an amazing series and has been pretty solid for the past 4 seasons. The story is very solid as well. But I wouldn't give it a full 10/10. There are a few aspects of the show that does get annoying after a while.

1. The over sexualization of everything in the show and I mean literally everything. Without saying too much... the amount of sexualization you will see in this is a bit too much. It's okay to have a few here and there but be prepared as in this show it will be almost everywhere.

2. America = Bad according to these Hollywood writers lol. You may see a running theme in this show where anyone who has an American flag are pretty much 'evil'. Although that is the theme of Homelander I feel like the way they depict the typical patriotic American is far from the truth and it is important to remember that if you are to watch this and believe ""wow that's how Americans really are"" or ""wow that's so true for a certain demographic of Americans"" is very far from the truth. It's always good to remember that Hollywood writers exist within their own echo chamber as well, surrounded by like-minded peers. Consequently, their portrayal of certain demographics or political groups may be exaggerated or skewed. Remember it is Hollywood. I can certainly tell you lots of stuff portrayed in this about a certain demographic or political isle of people is just not true.

Overall Good show I do recommended it!"

I hope to see more of Homelander and Firecracker, please!!!

I hope to see them in The Boys Presents: Diabolical season 2, please!!!

I hope for Homelander and Firecracker have a relationship, please!!!

If there is a relationship, it will blow my mind.

Firecracker manipulating Homelander by using his obsession with breast milk.

It is more than loyalty... It is Firecracker in love with Homelander.

Firecracker is attracted to Homelander, which is why Firecracker trying to please Homelander... Firecracker has feelings for Homelander.

After finishing season 2, I must say I don't understand the hate on season 2. Both seasons were great. This show is a lot of fun with dark humor & action and has a refreshing take on superheroes, our superficial society, and even politics. It will never disappoint you on anything. Best story with best acting."
9.0,12 September 2019,"This series is a new twist on the current genre of Superhero movies. The premise is that things are not always what they seem to be, and the Heroes, like everyone else, are not perfect. Unfortunately, the series is plagued by poor acting, poor editing that fails to provide the necessary continuity for the viewer to be able to understand the sequence of certain events, and an annoying (and loud sound track). The special effects are very good. The end result is a very mediocre but somewhat entertaining product that does engage, but not to the extent of binge watching. Amazon is trying hard to find a breakout success in its streaming lineup. This is not it! The only Oscar or Emmy this might win would be for a Series with the DUMBEST ending ever! Let's see what the second season brings!"

6.0,10 August 2019,"I've always been the type of person that only watches Marvel or DC superhero movies or shows. In my mind I always thought no other company can top them (or make a show or movie as good as theirs). But I was wrong. The Boys is one amazing show with its great story telling, action, comedy, and character development. 10/10 a must watch!"
1.0,27 July 2020,"The boys is different from several series and movies that we have seen as heroes, it is something new and surprising, it is just fantastic and animal."
9.0,31 July 2022,I liked the show i really did but I just don't see all the hype i mean the story is nice and the characters too and the story is nicely written but when I open my tv to watch the I was expecting a 10/10 may if I went with lower expectations I would've appreciate it more.
9.0,31 August 2020,"I really enjoyed. Superheroes are not my thing, but this anti-superhero. Good acting but Keith Urban's accent is awful. I did not realise he was supposed to be playing someone British, I knew he was an Aussie so I thought it was a unusual Aussie accent. Not for those who are easily offended, Keith urban gets some great lines. The dolphin and lobster jokes were the funniest bits."

9.0,30 September 2024,"Im a superhero fan, I love the marvel and DC films and always search for new Super-titles from other studios as well. I started watching this thinking it was gonna be another 'Kickass' or somthing.

Boy was I wrong.. the first episode very quickly and intensely sets the scene of the entire show. Its dark so be ready for that. I do love it though.. the acting, script, and overall concept is great. The basic premise is how supers would be in our reality as oppose to the films we know, where the heroes are humble and pure. In our reality celebs are jerks, perverts, its all about the money, and silencing innocents is what the corporate giants do on a regular basis. So that. But more blood and disturbing images throughout the show. Good watch."
8.0,21 March 2020,"All around just a great spin on superheroes. The show is rich and has depth as well as the superficial appeal of normal superhero shows. The characters are interesting and complex, and the world is an intriguing dystopia not so different from perceived monopolistic powers we fear in private corporations.

This falls somewhere between an 8.5/9 in my book. I was pleasantly surprised by this show."
9.0,21 August 2019,"I didn't want to watch this show. I only watched it because I was reccomendednit so many times.

The first episode in and I was completely hooked. Karl Urban absolutely kills it. His performance is fantastic and the dialogue he is given to work with? Fan- effing- tastic! He reminds me of Brad Pitt in this performance. I dont know why exactly but I am not complaining.

This show has dark humor and it is funny yet uncomfortable- I LOVE IT!

Watch this show before the next season comes. It took me 3 days to get through the 8 episodes. I cant wait for season 2."
8.0,14 March 2023,"Not your usual super hero show, The Boys starts great and pretty much stays that way. It's gory, sweary and ridiculous but there's always a surprise and twist even if the plot doesn't need it. The actors do a great job except Billy Butchers cockney accent which is terrible.

After three seasons it should have ended with the big fight scene but it appears that they'll drag it on for more seasons, not sure it needs any more, just finish on a high. The special effects are excellent, you can see where the budget goes and they're are some truly cringe worthy scenes, it's not for children. Well worth a viewing, enjoy."
8.0,20 October 2020,"The first season is one of the best show I've seen. It got all the perfect formula for a great TV shows. Great soundtrack, great dialogue, great casting, great action scene, and most importantly great storyline. All the characters have some meaning and goals to achieve that make us rooting for the good guys, and also still emphasize with the bad guys. But oh man Season 2 is so wrong in many level. The story seems forced, and it feels like all the character running around with no purpose. Homelander still of of control, and still have an anger issue (no character development). The other 'The Seven' seems powerless all the time. And the worst part is, Butcher who used to be a respectfull and smart leader, in season 2 he's become a stupid, annoying, Mr. Know it all, cocky, hard-headed, and heartless. He keep on risking the life of other people just to get his revenge. I really just hate everything about season 2, but still watching it just for the sake of seeing how they going to take down Homelander."
7.0,31 August 2024,"I was looking forward to the 4th season. Unfortunately the 4th season changed the show from a dark comedy into political propaganda. You can't watch 5 minutes without a political viewpoint from one side being pushed on you instead of telling an entertaining story. The poison that destroyed Star Wars, Marvel, and many other beloved shows has infected this one making it unwatchable. If you have a warped worldview of 2 political parties were one is the perfect savior of everything and the other as evil from the deepest and darkest depths of hell with no entertainment then this is for you, or you can watch MSNBC."
5.0,30 July 2019,"Starts off great, middle few eps dip a bit, but then finishes on a high. A refreshing take on the supe genre. Looking forward to more of the same.."
9.0,24 August 2022,"The Boys is one of the best television shows I have ever seen. I do like superhero movies but I've always felt like there's something missing. This was what it was missing. The diversion of the genre is genius and has a ridiculous amount of production value. It's rare to find a show that is this balanced, albeit perfectly balanced, on every level."
9.0,2 February 2023,"Not only is this show funny and witty, but there is a legit plot to this show that just keeps you on the edge of your seat every single second. You cannot finish an episode without pressing ""next episode"" afterwards. There is not one character made in this show that someone can hate... every character is likable and they develop each one of them. This is a top tier show to start watching immediately, especially as the new seasons are coming out. I couldn't name a favorite character, favorite episode, etc... they are just simply all amazing and this show is just brilliant and awesome as a whole. Watch if you want an adult superhero show!"
9.0,8 January 2023,"This series is a great turn and depicts more realistic personas of superheroes. Season 1 was fast paced and action packed ...I'd actually give it a rating of 10. Unfortunately season 2 is way boring as ahi Til the last couple episodes; season 3 is ok. What sucks is the movies within movies and side stories that I don't think build on anything. Tell the story and move on. That said, the characters and their backgrounds are decently built overall; some main characters should just be deleted like deep...he's a useless character. But the back telling can bounce a bit so is best to watch it all. Not for kids."
9.0,26 April 2023,This is very good. Shows us the real superhero business. It also tells us how companies like marvel and dc use their superhero in movies. One of the key thing this show tells us thAt giving one person too much power is bad. Often times in real life we talk about whether we should have democracy or dictatorship. It also tells us the negativity of having a superhero as a kid I always wanted to get a superpowers but after watching this show I rethink my wish. It is diabolical like you see karl urban say multiple times in the show. But please be warned it has a lot of gory scenes if you don't like gore this show might not be for you.
9.0,5 August 2019,"As good a comic book adaptation as you're likely to see. In most instances dark source material is overly sanitised for a more mainstream audiences appeal but somehow this hasn't been the case with The Boys. The first series still maintains much of the shock value of the source material without feeling shocking for the sake of it. Well acted, directed, great CGI and nice pacing. Looking forward to series 2 and beyond."
8.0,2 March 2021,"One of the best series I have seen! A stellar cast ripping out their best performances episode after episode . Strong writing supported by thorough direction! What a gutsy show ! It's not for all but for those who get it , there is nothing like it ! Waiting for season 3 !"
8.0,8 September 2021,"Brilliant series, not for kids. Action packed and a different take on superheroes.

Well worth watching."
7.0,16 September 2020,Loved the first season the second season on the other hand is lacking substance and is quite frankly boring at times. Think the writers needs to go back to their desk. Also release the while thing at once wth
5.0,19 May 2020,"One of those where after watching, you feel like you need to wash the stench off of you."
9.0,16 September 2019,"Original show with great plot line, characters are immersive"
9.0,24 August 2019,"Really interesting and fun show, I wasn't sure at first but stick with it, it gets so much better. And the fact that Karl Urban looks mighty fine certainly helps...but seriously it's sweet at times, exciting at others but overall a really good and as I said a fun show."
9.0,11 March 2021,"I was never familiar with The Boys comics, but I am a fan of the show. The story of how real people with real ideas and emotions combined with god-like powers act with contempt and corruption is a welcomed fresh take on the genre. There's no need for one-dimensional villains. All the focus is on the superheroes because they are also the supervillains. For some characters this allows an incredible amount of development. Sadly, a weakness of The Boys is that it doesn't develop ALL of these characters, and wasted screen time is given to the flatlined. I was most interested in The Deep's arc going into season 2 because it was not a typical one. He wanted redemption. He wanted to be good. He just sucked at it - it's hilarious. However, he might as well not have been on the show...ever. He's gone nowhere and has practically never even been a part of The Seven as far as the time where the show starts. When The Boys fleshes out characters well you have outstanding stories and brilliant acting that gives you Butcher and Homelander. When it fails you get The Deep and A-Train.

When the characters you can't help but love are on the screen it is pure entertainment and increasing depth. Anthony Starr is unbelievably unhinged as Homelander. He's the most deranged villain since Ledger's Joker. A truly disturbed psychotic that you cannot wait to see what he'll say and do next as he's fearless and unpredictable. He never disappoints. Likewise for Butcher. Karl Urban is in the role he was born to play. Never a wasted moment and every line is nothing but sweet, vulgar music.

Though the show suffers some repetition (Homelander is evidently very easy to bribe or blackmail and Starlight is incessantly hopeless) it is a great show that reflects what would happen in real life. Ordinary emotional and mental trauma suffered by unordinary people with extraordinary abilities leads to deliciously evil and disgustingly gory TV...as it should be."
9.0,5 March 2021,
9.0,26 May 2020,This show is genuinely good if you dont get offended with gore and some anti-feminism..it is both dark and dumb at the same time.
9.0,8 June 2021,"Really love this show!

One of the best TV shows to come out in recent years.

Waiting for season 3!"
10.0,10 September 2020,"Watching on Apple TV and season 2 has no hardcoded subs which requires you to hit pause and go in and turn on the subtitles whenever non english dialogue is spoken.

Furthermore - season 2 so far is very much a slow burn, set up the plot for the season kind of feel, so I think it was a massive flaw to drip feed the release of the episodes one by one.

Season 1 - 9.5 out of 10 Season 2 - 8 out of 10 (at episode 3) And the project manager who made all the above dodgy decisions should be sent back for training."
9.0,27 February 2021,"We're use to super heroes = good and villains = bad. This show changes that narrow perspective.

I either liked or disliked all of the main characters. That's a good thing. The writers/actors/directors did their job well.

Definitely intense for some viewers, but a good show if you're tired of recycled super hero movies and TV shows. Expect a lot of cursing, graphic violence and sexual situations during this show."
7.0,31 July 2019,
2.0,5 June 2022,"I really liked the first season of The Boys, I was still moderately enthusiastic about the second season but by the time I'd reached the third, well, I feel I've probably had enough.

Good writing not gory sensationalism, is what defines a decent series. The Boys has always had both but when one overrules the other, which is what I feel has happened with season 3, it gets tiresome, fast.

I was, quite frankly, bored by the first three episodes of season three. For me, it lacked the direction, pace and sense of urgency, of the previous season. Perhaps in an attempt, to balance this out, we get lots of pretty cheesy and at times, downright ""yukky"", gore. Mixed with outrageous over the top comments, that really do nothing, I can see, to enhance, this series.

As it stands, I'm on the fence about whether I'll take this any further or walk away. My instincts, tell me to walk away, so that's the more likely outcome.

In summary, season one's a cracker, two's still has some punch but season three, to me at least, feels like its spark has been extinguished. Buried as it is, beneath gore soaked, cheesy visual ""death"" gags, that might, at a stretch, amuse a gormless teenager.

5/10."
8.0,23 February 2021,"So great, what a watch. Would recommend. A nice twist to the super hero genera"
10.0,6 June 2020,I put off watching The Boys because I thought it might be a cheap ripoff of the MCU. How wrong was I? I loved this series from start to finish (and now can't wait for the next series). The series is dark and has great special effects. Well done Amazon
8.0,11 October 2019,"I want everyone reading this review to stop and go see the boys. This is a tv show that completely flips the book on the superhero genre and shows us the more dark side and realistic take on superheroes. If you have wondered what superheroes might seem like, this is the show that fullfils that very thought. From the characters to the dialogue to the story itself, there is not a moment in which you are not glued to the screen waiting to find out whats going to happen and homelander was just something else entirely. This is a must see for everyone that has watched anything to do with superheroes!"
9.0,1 August 2019,"Puts a great spin on the superhero genre with great story, action and sfx. Probably one of the best shows I have watched this year."
9.0,7 August 2019,The real power of this serie is his originality. The actors are really good and from the first to the last minute of the season you just can't expect what will happen. I want the second season as soon as possible because i did more than enjoy it. I trully recommend it!
9.0,21 September 2019,This is a story about mega corporations and how there steere governments.
9.0,26 July 2019,
9.0,24 July 2024,"Initially, I enjoyed the series. It started with a strong concept and engaging plot, but over time it has evolved into something less coherent. The characters, who were once smart and relatable, now often make irrational and stupid decisions. This shift has transitioned the series into a mediocre one, similar to what happened with shows like Vampire Diaries, Originals, and The 100. It's disappointing to see a series that started off so well decline into something that requires the audience to turn off their minds to enjoy it.

In the beginning, the storyline was captivating, with well-developed characters and intriguing plot twists that kept me hooked. However, as the seasons progressed, the writing seemed to lose its direction. The once sharp and intelligent characters began to act in ways that were inconsistent and illogical, detracting from the overall quality of the show. It feels as though the creators are more focused on creating sensational moments rather than maintaining a coherent and compelling narrative. This decline is particularly frustrating because the series had such great potential and started off so promisingly. Now, it seems like a shadow of its former self, demanding less thought and engagement from its viewers."
7.0,2 August 2019,"Can't get over the buzz around this one. Karl Urban is cool, I would watch him in anything. But this show is mostly very very average. Tedious and the ridiculous interspersed with the occasional entertaining moment. It just does not grab you at all. What is up with this site and the glowing ""reviews"" for mediocre stuff."
1.0,5 August 2019,
9.0,10 August 2020,"By far and away the best Amazon original programming. Season one was exciting, enticing and alluring in an oh so bad way. Terrific performances all around, stand out performances by several members of the cast but everyone does a great job and contributes to their part.

You will not regret watching."
9.0,13 July 2020,The series contained some violence and frightening scene and it worth watching your every second. The series continues on a world of super hero are they bad or they good? You have to watch it to find the answer.
8.0,1 August 2019,"The most realistic, adult, and by far, enjoyable super hero rendition to date. Can not wait for season 2."
8.0,7 June 2021,The performance of the butcher and homelander characters are mind blowing.
9.0,12 August 2019,Great take on super heroes. Bring on a second season.
9.0,6 September 2020,One of best superhero franchises ever imo. The humor is biting and so in line with the current crisis of our collective right now. The new character additions are taking the show into a darkness that was always there but not as threatening. I revel in the ugliness of the supes but also in their brokenness. Some of the lines are so obviously from the mind of Seth Rogan that it brings a smile to my face. I love that I hate Homelander as much in this second season but pity him even more now. Ultimately I feel gratitude for them building a team of writers and actors and crew that have produced one of my favorite shows ever.
9.0,26 July 2024,"I've seen 4 seasons of The Boys. I love all 4 seasons. I don't get why some people hate season 4, which I think is excellent.

Some people say S04 is too political. Maybe, but I didn't pay any attention to it - if it is more political.

Some people say S04 is too slow. Maybe it is slower than the previous seasons 1-3, but I think it's not that slow.

Some people say S04 has bad writing. I completely disagree. I think the writing is just as good as any seasons.

I think all 4 seasons have good writing and everything else.

Looking forward to season 05, which is the final season. But hopefully Gen-V will pick up where S05 ends."
9.0,27 July 2019,This is how you make a Impact for a first series with defining moments of what if a super hero really has a dark side and hold no responsibility to there actions that will drop your jaw.The plot build up the twists each character has a part to play.Series two well that's going to be interesting to say at least.
6.0,24 October 2020,"Actually entertaining AF - but it like most TV shows if feels unfocused.

I watched the first season, all 8 hours, and I still don't see what the point is besides being asked to spend 8 hours, plus another 8+ hours, plus another 8 hours, following a bunch of scumbags.

I hate that season 1 ended on a cliffhanger. Again, 8 hours of programming and you can't even make a salient point at the end? Seriously? Ugh. Who am I rooting for? And again what's the point?

Look, if I wasn't a grown man with a career, interests, relationships, I'd totally be onboard no questions asked. But I can't justify the investment of time for what the show ultimately delivers.

I was feeling Anti-hero fatigue before I started watching this show and it's not making me feel any different.

It's well written, fun, and original in parts. I was entertained enough through season 1 but not enough to invest in another 8 episodes: Life's too short."

8.0,5 August 2019,I normally have a hard time getting into TV shows but this one just sucked me in from the get go. It's seriously so well written and such a clever take on supes and how they act. I seriously reccomend this to anyone who likes hero stuff or just anybody looking for a very good and dark show
8.0,27 July 2019,Story pick up nice in the middle it is bit boring but the end is quite suprising. Action is very good. Billy and franchie role were the best whst i liked.. Must watch for comic book lover.

8.0,24 August 2022,It is a series that knows its identity and leans heavily on it each season. The world in which he lives continues to grow and evolve without losing that identity either. The cast is also giving some of the best performances here.
7.0,4 December 2020,"Just keeps getting better and better, I'm so invested in this world, I'm conflicted on whether to like homelander or hate him. The violence is so awesome, this is everything every superhero film/Tv show should be blood, baby's with laser eyes, exploding heads and lots of c bombs. This is one show you do not wanna miss, I'm so pumped for season 3 bring it on!"
4.0,26 July 2019,"Season 1 doesnt have a good conclusion, just when it was getting interesting it ends. honestly if they compressed all the good bits into a movie with a good ending it would be perfect. as series its ok."
10.0,5 June 2022,"I get that The Boys writers are exploring all the ""what ifs"" left over from the Avengers franchise. I watched episode 1 of season 3. I knew it was going to be gross, It was pretty freaking sickening. I give it a rating of 1 for gratuitous blood baths and gross ... it's just gross. I ain't watching it no more. Real life is sickening enough."
10.0,21 January 2024,"Thanks for making something watchable and enjoyable. I wish more shows would be this bold and unapologetic. Best writing, you never know what to expect, except that it'll be good. This show has no limits. Feels good to laugh again, and not get some watered down pc version of something that so many producers and lawyers have had their hands in that all that's left is soggy rice with an extra helping of pandering. Not this show. Sort of like tropic thunder meets breaking bad. Amazing cinematography, the sound track doesn't stand out too much. Very clever the way they comically and subtly incorporate modern eye rolling scenarios, and characters."
10.0,7 September 2020,"This show is super f'd up...but in, like, a good way. Think of disturbing, sociopathic superheroes, and lots of gore. There've been a few times I have covered my field of vision with my hand because it was just too much. The characters are really well developed and it is an intelligent, completely unexpected storyline."
8.0,28 December 2022,"An amoral Justice League, corporate-backed and stage-managed to the high heavens; fertile ground for satirizing the superhero industrial complex. And good lord, does ""The Boys"" push all sorts of limits. Everything from celebrity to fascism and propaganda is gleefully skewered. It's hyper-violent, dark as hell and massively entertaining.

A pretty reliable rule of thumb is that if it's got Karl Urban in it, he's definitely gonna be the MVP (even garbage is instantly palatable when he shows up) and that was my expectation with The Boys. But honestly, everyone here is great and I can't think of a weak link. Even the corporate goons are first rate. That said, Antony Starr's Homelander (y'know, Superman but an asshole) has rightfully become the face of the show, and his performance here cannot be understated; he is incredible.

My curiosity gave way to a full binge of the first two seasons, and I couldn't wait for the third; and now I'm chomping at the bit for season 4. These people are so hateful and self-absorbed . . .

And utterly fascinating."

10.0,30 July 2019,Why pretend to be English when yr accent is New Zealand? No one is fooled ? Quite a violent vivid show but very watchable between fingers at times.
10.0,15 August 2022,"The boys is one of the most unique shows that never really goes off track there's almost no fillers every scene is a buildup and has meaning, the boys also includes scenes that took place in real life something like the Snyder cut release to the political drama the boys has it all. The boys isn't your typical superhero movie to where the heroes win, although it somewhat had resemblance to the Dc's injustice storyline the boys is unique in its own way. The boys are actually a group of completely normal humans with a goal of taking down the supes mainly the ""seven"" Or specifically homelander. The boys deals with a lot of plot drama it includes drama from vought which is the company that owns the seven and produces profit by marketing the characters and this drama might seem unnecessary but as said every scene does build up to importance. The story telling isn't easily predictable which gives it a fresh look. The vfx is great especially since they deal with a ton of blood, gore and weirdly unimaginable scenes. The boys kind of judges itself in a way how homelander reacts or scripts a dialogue. Overall the boys is very well thought out series and is incredibly executed in all of its seasons it is definitely is a must watch there's almost no flaws to talk about rather than how much disgusting few scenes can get. I loved the boys."
7.0,31 July 2019,"This show was surprisingly good and very enjoyable. A dark twist on a superhero story, imagine a watchmen TV series. Some great characters, Butcher, Homelander and Starlight had the best stories. It's dark comedy meets action and the special FX were top quality. It's one of the best."
3.0,3 August 2019,"We're not all perfect, but Elisabeth Shue and the cast make this fun and enjoyable to watch."

9.0,7 November 2020,"Not perfect but pretty great, the show is paced well and have a real comic feel to it. All charters are like a piece of the puzzle who created a good whole even if some are a bit flat. In short it's a cross over of heroes and the DC universe but twisted."
9.0,10 August 2024,"The Boys is a standout series that delivers a thrilling and subversive take on the superhero genre. Its success is largely due to the exceptional performances of its cast, who bring depth and intensity to the show's dark and satirical narrative.

Karl Urban is electrifying as Billy Butcher, infusing the character with a gritty edge and raw emotion. Urban's portrayal of the anti-hero with a vendetta against corrupt superheroes is both compelling and multifaceted, making Butcher a standout character in the series.

Antony Starr is equally impressive as Homelander, the sinister and psychopathic leader of The Seven. Starr's chilling performance captures the character's terrifying blend of charisma and malevolence, making Homelander a truly formidable antagonist.

Jack Quaid brings a more grounded performance as Hughie Campbell, the everyman drawn into the chaotic world of vigilantes and corrupt heroes. Quaid's portrayal effectively anchors the show's emotional core, offering a relatable perspective amidst the chaos.

Erin Moriarty delivers a nuanced performance as Starlight, a superhero grappling with the dark realities of her industry. Moriarty's performance is both vulnerable and strong, making Starlight a compelling character who navigates complex moral dilemmas.

Karen Fukuhara as Kimiko provides a powerful and emotional portrayal of a silent but fierce warrior. Fukuhara's physical performance and expressive eyes convey a deep sense of pain and determination, adding depth to Kimiko's character.

Laz Alonso and Dominique McElligott also contribute strong performances. Alonso's portrayal of Mother's Milk adds a layer of complexity and vulnerability to the team, while McElligott's performance as Queen Maeve provides a compelling mix of strength and internal conflict.

Claudia Doumit offers a standout performance as Victoria Neuman, the ambitious congresswoman with hidden agendas. Doumit's portrayal adds layers of intrigue and danger to the political machinations within the series.

Jensen Ackles makes a notable addition to the cast as Soldier Boy, bringing a rugged charm and complex backstory to the role. Ackles' performance injects a new dynamic into the series, blending humor with a darker edge.

Aya Cash delivers a memorable performance as Stormfront, the extremist superhero with a menacing and controversial agenda. Cash's portrayal is both captivating and unsettling, adding a provocative layer to the show's exploration of power and ideology.

Colby Minifie shines as Ashley Barrett, the PR executive navigating the treacherous world of superheroes with a mix of ambition and anxiety. Minifie's performance brings a unique blend of humor and desperation to her character.

Giancarlo Esposito further elevates the show with his role as Stan Edgar, the shrewd and calculating head of Vought International. Esposito's commanding presence and nuanced performance add an additional layer of menace and sophistication to the series.

However, while The Boys excels in its character development and dark humor, some parts of the show can be overwhelming. The relentless edge and provocative content, while often incisive and entertaining, can sometimes feel excessive. The show's intensity and graphic elements might be too much for some viewers, making it a challenging watch despite its many strengths.

Overall, The Boys remains a gripping and audacious series with a stellar cast. The performances are consistently excellent, adding depth and intensity to the show's biting critique of superhero culture. With its engaging narrative and standout acting, it's a must-watch for fans of edgy, character-driven drama, even if its provocative style can occasionally be over the top."
10.0,12 March 2023,"I want to start by saying I am not a big super hero fan. I ""like"" the hulk and I ""like"" superman but all the others, not so much. The Boys --- I love.

I saw a snippet of Homelander on youtube and I thought this doesn't look like a normal superhero show. So I got season one. Its a great show and the writing is spot 'on and something hard to find these.... ORIGINAL. Its NOT a remake, reboot, rehashing of another show, story. The cast is awesome, the chemistry is really good, especially Butcher and Homelander. I feel all the cast is good but these two, their acting abilities are top notch. They really sell their character and you get to know them. I have only watched season 1 so far but I have seasons 2 and 3 lined up."
9.0,6 August 2019,
7.0,3 January 2021,"The Boys is a fun show that will have you laughing often, commonly this laughter will be through the show's satire on American life and celebrities, as well as on superheroes. The show takes some recent world events and makes them somewhat part of the story, #metoo, the political landscape of America, and other real-world events sometimes seem to inspire the storytelling within the series which many viewers might appreciate. The Boys, however, does have a few issues, the first being that often there are little consequences for some of the characters' actions, this happens many times where the audience expects a lot of blowback for a character's actions but all possible repercussions are ignored, which, at best can be immersion-breaking and at worst be a succession of plot holes. Another issue that the series seems to have are the characters, most of the characters are very unlikeable, in many cases, this would be deliberate, however, unlikeable characters are so often on screen it makes watching the show sometimes frustrating. This issue is somewhat reduced by season 2, but the problem is still there."
9.0,16 June 2022,"I have watched till episode 4 of season3. It is probably the best of all the 3 seasons, especially due to the extraordinary performance of Homelander. This is a must-watch for any superhero fans."
8.0,5 September 2020,"Its good to see a change to the normal superhero saves the day story, a very binge worthy programme, eagerly waiting the next episode"
8.0,3 August 2021,"This show is so highly regarded and so highly spoken of by a lot of people, and I feel like it's an overreaction. Now, don't get me wrong, this show is entertaining to watch; I feel like every little detail is highly praised by a lot of people. From what I've seen, people make this show out to be much better than it is. Every little detail is brought up as another reason why this show is the best show they've ever watched. It's odd and, well, very ridiculous.

I think that it has to do with the themes in the show, including the way things are written to mirror the real world, as well as more minor details that get people all excited, for some reason, using them as a way to express how great this show is. It doesn't make sense to me. Another thing that I think is one of the reasons that people think makes this show the greatest show they've ever watched is that this show reinvents the superhero genre or something to do with the superhero genre, and I don't understand that.

To me, these reasons seem very shallow. None of those things should matter. None of those things should play a factor in whether or not you enjoy an episode of a show or the show itself; whether or not you think an episode of a show or the show itself is great; the level at which you enjoy an episode of a show or the show itself or think it's great. None of it should matter so much to where you'll not like an episode of a show or the show itself as much as you would've if things like that were present, to where it has such an impact on how you react and feel, and your outlook. When I see people reacting so strongly, positively or negatively, about stuff like that, I think it's ridiculous that they seemingly matter so much to them. Because, for me, it's only a matter of whether I enjoy what I watch.

Speaking of which, another one of those reasons that I've seen people provide as to why they love the show so much is that it's way better than the comic book series was; that they liked various aspects that the show did or made a lot better than the comics did. I can understand that reason, but that still shouldn't elevate the show higher than it is. And I think it does for a lot of people, as does the themes in the show, the way the writers write some things to mirror the real world and on-going situations, the way that this show reinvents the superhero genre or whatever that assertion is all about. I don't understand that way of thinking.

Personally, I enjoy watching this show. There are instances where the writing is lazy, convenient, or contrived; instances of inconsistency. And there are plenty of moments that come across as ridiculous but may not completely fit within any of those categories. But I never had that big of a problem with them. There were only a few that I caught, and they didn't bother me; hell, the ones that I caught may have explanations that make enough sense and aren't too convenient. There were more instances like that of which were revealed to me through other means, but they still didn't bother me that much.

The only thing that's an issue with this show for me is that the main plot and subplots aren't written in a captivating way, most of the time. I'm still entertained enough while watching episodes that feel that way, but it's something that I wish wasn't the case so I can be as entertained as possible. Other than that, I have always been entertained by this show. I don't think that aspect will change, thankfully. It's the entertainment value that matters the most to me. And while I don't understand the high praise or reactions to practically every little detail in the show, it's not my problem. This show has always been entertaining to watch, and that's good enough for me."
9.0,8 October 2020,"I loved the first season, but now I struggle to just make it though its so boring and what happened to Karl, he was great, now its like he just not acting anymore. The rest of them were always bad actors but the show was so much fun I didn't care. I just can't believe how bad it is now after such a good first."

9.0,15 February 2024,"There nothing to not love. It's amazing to me how close to reality this show is while having superheroes galore. Yes most are self absorbed POS's that are idolized like a lord and a movie star at the same time. Also Jack Quaid is a perfect clone of both Dennis and Meg so if you are looking for that deep 80s and 90s stunned or happy face that melts a screen homeboy inherited it. I do also love how the superpowers seemed to have been invented from random rolls off an RPG maker. Characters are more like DC than Marvel as the superpowers list can be Superman or Paperclipman in terms of levels. Overall 10/10 for me. Hilarious, serious and full of deceit."
9.0,16 November 2019,
9.0,28 July 2019,Amazing show! I am so ready for the next season! All of the characters are great! The storyline is absolutely amazing! I didn't think it would be that great of a show but I was so wrong
7.0,26 July 2019,"I know this was made from a comic book / graphic novel, which probably is bad for the fans of said novels. However, if you've never read the books you'll probably find the story very relevant to the times we live in. It makes interesting viewing. It's still a little preachy, but there are things that need to be kept on the front page to try and stop them from perpetuating. The writing is quick, interesting and holds a pace. The actors are top-notch. The only problem I have is the very dodgy Karl Urban 'cockney / London' accent. It rolls between a pantomime Ray Winstone and plane Australian. I'm sure they changed other things from the original work, they could just have changed this too. He's a fine actor, he just didn't need to try to do the accent. On the whole this series continues the trend of adding pathos and comedy to the superhero genre: worth watching."
9.0,29 July 2019,Well done. Keeps you wanting more. Hands down nailed it. I binged in one day.
9.0,27 July 2019,I really don't like Amazon shows but this is a whole different level. Only 5 minutes I was cracking up.
10.0,28 July 2019,"Just so many - wtf, did that really just happen moments ...."
8.0,3 August 2019,"When I found out they were making a TV show out of the notorious comic series, I was pretty excited. I really needed something fresh in the superhero genre to break the monotony of the family-friendly movies of today.

And boy does this show deliver. The acting is excellent, special shout-out to Tomer Capon for his performance. The story and the character differ noticeably from the comics, but that's not a problem at all, in fact it's better because it gives a fresh spin and you don't really know what's going to happen even if you have read the print.

The only problem I have with the show is just how tame it is compared to the comics. When I saw the TV-MA rating I expected this to be a festival of debauchery, cruelty, violence and blood and gore. And while it does have plenty of these it pales in comparison to the source material.

Still, it's an excellent show you should really check out if you are looking for something different."
10.0,2 October 2020,"I really enjoyed the first season of The Boys. I liked watching the psychotic Homelander basically steal every scene he was in. I also enjoyed the aspect of how the boys which are normal humans wanted to get rid of supes that due to their fame and fortune have gone into a depraved lifestyle and how they are often very hypocritical.

Then season 2 arrived and it was all thrown right into the garbage can. Instead now we have multiple arcs for the various characters going on at the same time all getting just a bit of attention without a real general story that puts the pieces together. Oh and let's not forget how where in season 1 the political ideological stuff was mostly kept in the background and kinda subtle now in season 2 it's pushed more and more front and center with each episode and all of it relates to current modern day politics.

I can't stand it anymore. Could we maybe just have some cool and interesting stories without some writer trying to push their ideological believes down our throats? PLEASE?"
10.0,7 September 2024,"So an adult show ( not taking itself seriously at all ) with Super ""human"" ( though some ""Supes"" consider themselves not human but Gods ) non Binary Superhero/Villains, as the characters are more complex so not just 100% good or 100% evil as each main character has both evil & good in them so makes each character's arc more interesting to see.

( Too many other Super Hero TV shows or Films have heroes that are binary so one side is too good & the other side is too evil so boring ).

Of course Superhero shows for young children to watch ( U or PG ) need to give clear guidance on the difference between right & wrong, where adult shows like ""The Boys"" can make fun with adults being mature enough to understand the difference between right & wrong.

The show does question throughout the morality of what being a human is & whether vengeance or forgiveness should be given & how each can either perpetuate a situation or possibly help resolve it. Again this is not a binary issue as sometimes one way work better depending on the circumstances ( however it is good to make the viewer think ).

Unfortunately in the show some of the writers to get their own personal political ( humour ) views across make peripheral 2D ( Binary as in 100% Good or 100% Bad ) to try to make their political joke work in their own personal favour, which is both disingenuous & therefore is a false point of view ( which then alienates some of the audience which is very stupid to do ). Better to always give both sides of a debate & then let the audience decide for themselves which they prefer then.

Generally though the show just tries to be funny & put in jokes to gloss over any writers political opinions ( which sometimes works but also sometimes doesn't work ), so makes the prospect of Series 5 being the final season the correct choice ( as it's time for the show to finish up ).

Because the show keeps devolving into a show that doesn't take itself serious at all, with it's humour, it works, so as long as the audience can accept how farcical it is, you can enjoy the dark comedy ( well mostly ).

Some of the scenes though are shockingly gross which again can be either shockingly funny or off putting ( depending on the individual audience member watching ) as don't watch while eating your food at home unless you have a strong stomach ( as what's gross & funny to some people will be gross & want to make you throw up to others ).

Overall I think The Boys is much funnier than gross ( in my opinion ).

What makes this show entertaining to watch is it does reveal some thoughts on real life ( whether you agree or disagree ) so therefore can be thought provoking to a basic level only which helps make the show interesting ( even with it's plot holes that take a star off it 's score ) as in general you can kind of allow the show's ridiculously rollercoaster script to get away with a lot more latitude because it is a ""SUPER FARCE"".

The question is if you can allow yourself to accept this is obviously not a serious attempt at a Super Hero TV drama Show, as if yes then as an adult it's worth a watch as chances are you enjoy the entertainment in the main as the actors generally do a good job with their characters.

So Karl Urban, Jack Quaid & Anthony Starr as the 3 most important characters all do 10 out of 10 with their acting & the rest of the cast are generally good to very good ( 7 to 9 out of 10 ) in supporting roles.

I will say though Giancarlo Esposito is another 10 out of 10 ( as he always is & as expected ) + ( unexpectedly ) Elisabeth Shue, Simon Pegg & Nicola Correia-Damude for me also put in 10 out of 10 also.

As I always enjoy seeing supporting cast members giving it there all.

Tomer Capone & Karen Fukuhara have great chemistry together & though I'd give them 9 out of 10 for their individual performances which is still great, as a pair they deserve a 20 out of 20 when together.

Like I say the rest of the cast are all still very good to great ( 7 to 9 out of 10 ), as everyone in the audience will like who they prefer like I do.

Watching a Superhero TV show though where ""normal"" humans can survive & compete with ( sometimes defeat ) Super ""people"" who have Super Powers, can sometimes be rewarding to watch however after a time the odds of them surviving each time becomes so slim it starts to get ridiculous, though in a ""SUPER FARCE"" we give a lot of latitude."

7.0,11 February 2024,"There's not much more to say about The Boys that hasn't already been said. It's just an awesome show! It's quickly become one of my favorite new shows in years! I binged the entire first two seasons in just a few days when they first came out and rewatched them before Season 3 came out. I was expecting a slight drop in quality for Season 3 because Seasons 1 and 2 were so great, and there is a little drop, but it's still a very good show! It takes everything you loved about Seasons 1 and 2 (the violence, humor, heart, craziness, character development, etc.) and takes it all to a whole new level! This show has such an original take on the Superhero genre that is both exciting and hilarious! I can't recommend this show enough! Just a warning though...once you start watching, it's hard to stop. Give yourself enough time because you'll want to binge it as quickly as possible!"
5.0,7 June 2022,"Realistic superhero stuff with an actual story & no overuse of cgi, characters too

Great viewing , I'll never watch a stupid marvel offering again., just started watching season 3 & the quality is maintained."
10.0,9 September 2020,"I haven't seen a lot of the show, but what I have seen has failed to grip my interest. The dialogue just feels so incredibly contrived. If you try to bring some sort of cinematic gravity to every single line, you end up with a string of non-sequiturs instead of conversations that make sense. As far as I've seen, the writing is cumbersome and puts me off."
9.0,6 January 2023,"This show delivers in every way possible. It is worth the watch. Drama/suspense, love, comedy, gore, dark humor. It has everything you could want in a tv show these days. It just makes it even more entertaining since it revolves around ""super hero's"". It takes an interesting approach that the heros are the bad guys and the people seeking revenge are the good guys because they see through the heroes for who they really are. It takes a more realistic approach than marvel or dc ever could because the super hero's are basically just celebrities out for their own best interests and egos. I won't spoil anything else here but why a 9/10 instead of a 10/10? Just a personal opinion here but Jack Quaid can get pretty annoying after a while. I enjoyed all the characters in this show including his (I'm just now starting season 3) but from season 1 to season 2 he is really starting to annoy me... but again personal opinion. This show as a whole is GREAT!!"
10.0,7 September 2019,"Spotted this on Prime. Quickly IMDB'd it and thought yes. Four episodes in and it must be said this is quality.

Haven't been glued to anything so much since Breaking Bad.

They better be making more seasons. Plenty more to be imagined and realised with so many possibilities for new characters and situations. Definitely some characters you wouldn't want to lose here too.

The cast in general are superbly placed with scripts very refreshingly written.

Just watch it. Even if you don't like superheroes."

8.0,16 November 2022,"Karl Urban sounds like Dick Van Dyke in the original Mary Poppins film . The Boys is a good show but what spoils it for me is Karl Urban's appalling British accent . It's comical! . So when he's trying to be verbally threatening and abusive , it's laughable.and he sounds s.tupid . Also the cockney phrases he uses are ridiculous , nobody speaks like that! And he uses them in the wrong context! . And his intonation is wrong! It's terrible ! It's a big show with 4 seasons , so I would have thought that they would have had an excellent voice coach. . But clearly they haven't . I'm shocked that the director accepted this terrible British accent from Urban ! Karl Urban is good actor so I'm surprised that he accepted that his accent sounded British cockney . They should have let him keep his native New Zealand accent. The show would have been great if the main male lead playing a 'tough guy ' didn't sound like a comical character in a Disney Comedy movie."

10.0,18 September 2019,"Dammit, Jim, I'm a doctor, not a British superhero hunter.

This dark take on the super hero tale, presuming what a corporate influence on super heroes would look like, is extremely refreshing. I've been getting sick of the oversaturated bubble gum cinema of the family friendly super hero, and this is anything but. It's a new spin on an idea that has stood the test of time, and I'm excited to see where it goes."
8.0,3 August 2021,"Not everything everytime goes by our optimistic imagination and this show puts its take on it. The MC isn't some Bruce Wayne type smart or powerful like Superman, he's average bloke fighting his way through in rather overpowered corrupt superheos world in which theyre idolized as saviours."
8.0,13 May 2021,"I'm not a huge Marvel movie guy. After the first hundred marvel movies came out I couldn't tell what the difference was and what the point would be to try to catch up.

10.0,6 January 2020,"Take Deadpool and The Incredibles, and marinate in a bath of The Punisher, add a pinch of Dexter and serve on a plate. Yes!"
8.0,1 August 2019,"Everywhere you look these days, it's all about superheroes - tv, cinema, comics, toys, cosplay... Every person on the planet has heard of Batman or Spider-Man, these fictional vigilantes are so embedded into pop culture that it's hard to think of a world without these characters. Some websites and fan fiction even show we're at the brink of worshipping these ""gods"". When one of these superhero films becomes the highest grossing film at the box office and we get conventions dedicated to these group of talented individuals, that's where The Boys would step in to shake things up. What would a universe with superheroes actually look like in this day and age?

The Boys is one of the most relevant TV series made in a while. Seth Rogen, Eric Kripke (Supernatural) and Evan Goldberg created the series, which was originally a comic series written by Darick Robertson and Garth Ennis. These 'supes' (short for superheroes) have publicists who write apologies for the multiple mistakes these caped crusaders make, and believe me, there's plenty of those. Accidentally running through normal citizens or not caring enough to save a by terrorists taken over plane, these situations are daily business and some of them are even set up by media outlets to raise their social media following. They look like your usual superheroes, fake and all smiles in your face, but when you look beneath the surface this group of entitled brats are nothing but monsters with too much power.

When the ordinary Hughie Campbell (Jack Quaid) loses his girlfriend in a very bloody way in the hands of speedy superhero A-Train (Jessie Usher), this shakes up his simple life and attracts the attention of Billy Butcher (Karl Urban). Billy used to lead a squad, ""The Boys"", to keep an eye on these out-of-control superheroes. While this all develops, the cheerful and starry-eyed Starlight (Erin Moriarty) gets recruited by The Seven, the world's most famous superhero team. Her team members are the fishy The Deep (Chace Crawford), silent killer Black Noir (Nathan Mitchell), femme fatale Queen Maeve (Dominique McElligott), the invisible Translucent (Alex Hassell) and their leader Homelander (Antony Starr), who looks a lot like the grown up version we recently witnessed in Superman-goes-bad film Brightburn.

Billy's band of misfits fell apart when his wife tragically passed away after a range of personal events. He's ready to bring the Boys back together, to fight evil and to expose the biggest conspiracy that could end the world of ""supes"" once and for all. Mother's Milk (Laz Alonso) and Frenchie (Tomer Capon) need little convincing to come back from retirement, but soon find a new member in force-to-reckon-with The Female (Karen Fukuhara). The Boys isn't just a superhero-tale, it's comedy is so dark and realistic, Marvel Studios could never show this true side of what their heroes are up to behind closed doors. Eyes getting lasered out of skulls, superhero-orgies and lots of guts flying everywhere. Nothing is too crazy for this team.

The world we live in is ruled by pompous people as authority figures, with too much money and time on their hands. Every day we wake up with another celebrity scandal or politician screwing things up. This is exactly what the writers of the show wanted to stay true to, and used this idea but replaced it with superheroes and put them in a position that makes them almost untouchable. Almost I said, because this is about fighting back at those who lost touch with the real world.

The cast shines in every aspect. Antony Starr as borderline psychopath Homelander makes your blood boil, while Erin Moriarty is bright and bubbly kicking ass and standing up for herself as Starlight. Karl Urban stands out as Billy Butcher, shooting at everyone who blinks at him and shouting every cuss word you could possibly imagine, while talking about the Spice Girls *chef's kiss*. Not to forget is Oscar-nominated Elisabeth Shue, who plays the icy and mysterious Madelyn Stillwell, Senior Vice President of Superhero Management at Vought. Her character rules the world with Homelander, smiling at the faces of helpless victims.

The Boys is awesome, explosive, gruesome fun that punches you in the gut when you least expect it. Just when you think you've seen the craziest stuff happening on screen, just wait until you watch the next episode. Good news, The Boys has been renewed for a second season, so why haven't you watched it yet?"
8.0,18 October 2021,"I could write a long review about how it incorporated the whole superhero justice league thing. But in reality it all about the adult side of politics and what it would actually look like at corp level. Plus Hughie's character development is nice

This show is INSANE."
10.0,10 October 2019,"Dark, hilarious, twistY, twistED, and utterly refreshing. If you're getting tired of the overly cartoonish heroes of DC or the never-ending CGI fest of Marvel (I still watch them, but it's a bit too much), this show will come as a tonic. It takes a completely different and much deeper look at superheroes and the people around them. The characters are all flawed and believable, brought to life admirably by a cast devoid of huge names (Urban and Shue are as famous as they get). Don't expect crazy CGI and epic battles, just great tension, dark humor, and a few nice twists. Binge it, you won't regret it."
6.0,6 May 2021,"This came as a surprise. This is not your typical superior boring story. This is not for kids. It's full of corrupted, money hungry, heroes and deep human connections. Full of gore and violent scenes. Story is interesting. Ending is strong. One of the few superhero series that is universally good."
5.0,26 October 2020,"I thought the first 3 episodes were good and was enjoying it and then we hit the Spice Girls pep talk and Kimiko and from that point it became awesome. It is great fun and constantly suprising. My only two negatives are the constant use of the C word - not because I am shocked but because it becomes boring - yeah okay you went there, but do you have to do it all the time? And Butchers accent is dreadful, who was his voice coach? Vinnie Jones? It would have been much better if he had used his natural voice and all the other characters kept saying he was an aussie, which as a Kiwi would drive him nuts. In fact if he ever does kill his nemesis the last line of the entire thing could have been - ""I'm not a ****** australian, I come from New Zealand"" BANG! But watch it, it's great."
8.0,4 May 2020,"1.This show don't have only white and black characters and they aren't one dimensional. That's first good thing ,which differs from many marvel and DC movies or TV series. 2.that's interesting universe and we have some good plot twist and universe getting more interesting.in the end of the season we have some emphaty to bad characters. 3. "" The Boys"" is realistic show and he tells truth about media, corporation,popular people and psychology of society. It's also funny, enjoyable and worth to watch."
8.0,3 May 2020,The story is very new.the super hero are using their superpower to save the world in eyes of the world but there is a dark side of the story. A group of people who are having skills are against the people with dark super power. There is romance action thrill. The main lead is very amazing personality does not give any belief and is so true in the real world.
8.0,29 September 2022,"Season 1: 8.5/10 Season 2: 8/10 Season 3: 6.5/10 (but that may be too harsh, I seem to be in the minority)

Season 1 was great; it had heart, good pacing, and showed a lot of potential. You cared about the characters, and the show took risks that I've never seen other shows pull off. Mostly intense violence, but also the impact that the violence caused on our characters. It wasn't senseless violence; but forewarned, there is plenty of it in this show.

Season 2 was good, but it's rating is likely inflated because it was coming after a good season 1 and it didn't fall flat. There was still promise and potential within the show.

Season 3 was overly stale and formulaic. Here's the formula: shocking gory scene; shocking sexual scene; Homelander acting crazy but never even doing anything; redundant friction between Hughie and Butcher; and on-the-nose attempts at portraying woke BS as satire, but it fell real flat for me. Pacing was off, it was often boring, and honestly nothing really even happened. We are nearly in the same place we were at the end of season 2. A big MEH for season 3."
8.0,5 October 2020,"Wow, I thoroughly enjoyed season 1, but as with many series(Stranger Things, True Detective, Narcos, Happy, Lost) it came downhill in Season 2. Really quickly. The first few episodes are just melodramatic talking and suddenly I realized that a show about super heroes had almost zero 'super heroing' and all conversation. If this was character development fine, but it seemed like time filler. Secondly, characters should 'grow' with their environment, meaning when you spend a season facing impossible odds and over come them, you are not the same person in the beginning. Here the characters are making worse mistakes then they would have made in Season 1, which means there are new writers, or they got really lazy.

In a lot of ways, many of episodes look like 'cut scenes' from the first season and someone hack together additional scenes to make it seem like a season 2.

Very poorly done."
10.0,12 November 2020,Wow.... Just wow. This is a show you thats so good you cant explain it well enough to do it justice! Everything about this show is special. There are small details that come in to play later on and there is so much going on. The satirical comedy is brilliant honestly it's some of the best writing in years. Give this show a go if even if your not a superhero fan i promise you wont be disappointed.
9.0,28 August 2019,"""The Boys""

I thought it would be standard superhero parodical series just with blood and little powder of violence. After 30 minutes of the first episode, released how dead I was wrong...

This show is not parodic version of Justice League, it's a grounded in reality satire. Very well balanced script (except women characters) and great storyline, interwoven plots and well thought out characters. Casting - a clean shot. Superheroes which has a great human frailties and quirks make acting performances so believable. And that's the appeal of this show.

8 out of 10"
10.0,12 September 2019,"Funny, fast moving, dazzling and great plot twists! My only disturbing thought is that the moviemakers could have pushed the naughty bits a tad more. Don't worry it's all graphic but I still wanted more... Karl Urban is awesome btw and most of the characters play to their strengths. Will definitely be keeping an eye on this franchise"
7.0,13 August 2019,"I wasn't sure about this, especially when I heard it was a prime original. But my God, they've done it. A pilot that grips you, and every episode from then on is just a thrill. Karl Urban has always been a favorite, but here, he just has so much fun one can't help but join him in it.

The violence is graphic, the sex is gratuitous, the themes are perverse, the language is disgusting, the show, is absolutely amazing.

If you aren't easily offended, I can do nothing else but wholeheartedly recommend that you go and watch this show. Like, right now. A word of warning however, it'll be over before you know it and you'll be left on a mighty comedown until we get some more of this utter gold."
4.0,18 March 2020,"Hey, season 1 beautiful this is not a comic book series for the faint of heart, this is the way a comic book should be done, showing it's characters faults & irredeemable qualities and most of all unapologetic attitudes, this series is a keeper if they stay true too the source material."
8.0,3 May 2020,The green hat that finally reversed made the anger that insisted on the eight episodes seem to be nothing. This is not important. What is important is the irony of the collusion between capital belief and mass consumerism. The people watching this episode are desperate! What is the significance of individual resistance?
9.0,23 May 2020,"The Boys is fresh. I know that sounds like a Rotten Tomatoes critic review but this was pretty refreshing. Casting is all great and all of the powers are really cool. I think this sets up a lot of really cool ideas and characters that I'm excited to see where it all goes. Homelander is a super compelling villain and Vought itself is your typical giant corporation. I think this show deserves a lot of praise because this is the first thing I've seen that shows the true affects that superheros would have on the world because yeah, lets face it. Countries would try to use them for good, but they also aren't about to send them to war like dropping a nuke."
10.0,11 February 2020,"I have followed the career of Garth Ennis for over the last twenty-five years. His gritty, dark humored brand of work on ""Hitman"", ""Preacher"" (especially), ""The Punisher"" and many others have always suited my taste. While I'm not so sure ""Preacher"" translated so well over to television on AMC I have to say ""The Boys"" has exceeded my wildest expectations! The acting is superb. The directors try to stay close to the source material. The plot is constantly moving forward and the characters are ""Deep"" (pardon the lame pun). I cannot say enough about how well they have done with this series. And it's all owed to one man's genius, Garth Ennis. 10/10 stars"
9.0,5 February 2021,"I have to say, I was somewhat sceptical about this one. But a friend recommended it to me and I started watching. And boy, oh boy, was I in for a surprise.

The first scene with A-Train got me really glued to the TV and I couldn't wait to see more. The plot really well written and the idea behind the show really came to life. I have to be honest, I have never seen a show like this one. Every action had a reason and you could relate to why the characters were doing, what they were doing.

I liked every single episode. So far, that I binge-watched the entire first season.

But theeen... came season two. Somehow they lost it. I don't know if they picked up other writers, or whatever happened, but the series lost its soul. Funny to say that, since some of the characters were actually ""finding their soul"" through religion. The plot was dragging along and I could litteraly see every single ""plot twist"" and ""surprise moment"" coming from miles away. And the characters felt like they stagnated in one place and they themselves didn't know, what was coming next. They did try to mix it up with some provocative topics, but they just fell flat on the ground and never got up again.

The performances of some actors were really great. Especially Antnoy Starr (Homelander). He really carries this entire series. Sadly they lost Elisabeth Shue (Madelyn Stillwell). I think she was one of those, who stood out. The other ones are kinda flat and undeveloped characters.

I really hope season 3 will be better, because it would be a shame if this show goes down as one of those, that could've been great but didn't live up to its potential."
9.0,20 July 2024,"The first couple of seasons were excellent....but season 4.....unwatchable nonsense. I don't like feeling spoon-fed a political message in my entertainment. There are so many ridiculous things and insane people around these days. I watch fiction to escape.

The Boys by has definitely gone way down the tubes. The characters have become tired and predictable and almost transparent. Ugh....the only one worth watching for is homelander.....he is funny.

I'm currently on season 4 episode 7....it's like a slow death. Butcher is so cheesy with the Australian colloquialisms. It's so cheesy. Such a waste of Karl Urban's talent lol."

8.0,13 April 2020,"You have to say that this is a combination of the dark wind of the original cartoon, and it is better to fill Cesrogan with all kinds of bad tastes and satire complaints in his head.

You can see familiar shadows in this world at a glance.

Although there is no justice league here, they have a team of seven, namely, the Motherland (Dachao), Queen Maeve (WW), the Deep Sea (Sea King), the locomotive (twinkle), a ninja (the snake eye of GIJ?!), the invisible and the female star.

They exist more like stars than superheroes.

To be at the top of a hero's career, you don't have to save the world, you don't need to have superpowers that no one else can reach, you just need to pass the interview.

All of these greatest superheroes belong to a supercompany called Walter.

They are the ""products"" launched by this company.

Your itinerary, your look, everything you say in public is carefully planned, you have the entire crime forecasting department behind you to set a line for you to fight criminals, and your public relations team ensures that you wash your ass at any time and after you've done something wrong.

You are saviors in the eyes of ordinary people, and interested religious groups constantly claim that superheroes are. God's darling is the angel he sent to save the world; your approval rating is high on perfect planning ~ downloading social media. Next, wherever you go to meet you are cheering and applause; your surroundings can bring tens of billions of dollars a year, and every superhero movie starring is comparable to MCU~.

The biggest stars in the world are the superheroes; the biggest business is the superheroes; the closest to the gods is the superheroes, and they are like the gods among us.

GOD AMONG US.

Yes, despite the power of superheroes, this is no different from our world. Consumerism, flow control everything, ordinary people lost in huge bloated. In the flow of information, the head is empty, but also looking forward to some kind of illusory power to save the tragic life, few people think about what kind of darkness is hidden behind those fanaticism."
7.0,3 February 2020,"Never before seen, amazing cast, excellent visual THE best new series I have seen in a long time!"
4.0,14 September 2022,"An amazing and bold take on superheroes who, rather than the conventional view of being noble and selfless, are very human in their fundamental desire to take advantage of their skills and use it to be as selfish, commercial and authoritarian as they can manage.

The cherry on top is how unapologetically forward the show is with a display of gore, language and a beautiful mix of real parallels from our society interwoven into this piece of fiction.

Unfortunately, after the first two seasons, it's evident that the show's writing has moved from creating creative content to focussing on its own longevity. The 3rd season serves no purpose but to set itself up for more seasons, and it's hard not to feel disappointed by the irony."
8.0,5 September 2019,"Well written, produced, directed, acted. I wasn't sure where this was going but I was very much surprised at what direction this series has taken. Let's hope the original team has the same unique perspective in S2."
9.0,18 September 2020,"What I love the most in this show is that there isn't your usual good and evil. Everything mostly is grey. Okay, there are a very few exceptions where the scale definitely tips to one side. Just like in real life. And for me, this is what makes it enjoyable.

The gore and violence is just spot on for this movie. Not too much, just enough to set the mood for the show.

I gave a 8/10, first of all because quite often characters seem to behave/do things out of character, for the convenience of the plot. Second because at times movie is still pretty cliche. But 8 points is a very good rating on my book, so definitely recommended!"
8.0,5 August 2021,I truly liked the first season but the second one was on the OKAY side.
8.0,22 October 2021,"The show is just unique, amazing, entertaining. It has a different take on superhero shows that I personally love, what made it even better is the amazing acting by the cast, just perfect."
9.0,2 May 2024,
8.0,15 June 2024,"I waited a long time before watching this because I don't like waiting for a whole week per episode in case I really liked it. Although in this case it wasn't going to be a problem.

I felt this way as soon as I finished watching the 1st episode but I decided to give it a chance and at least finish the season hoping it might finally blow me away like it has so many.

It didn't. My initial thoughts sadly didn't change at the end of the first season. That it is extremely overrated. Its true selling point is the wanton gore & debauchery. Without it, it would've been just another superhero show to get cancelled early.

Its story isn't anything to write home about. I get what the show is: a parody of Superhero culture, but the story itself is just not interesting.

I also watched a video titled ""how The Boys ended Marvel"". I'm as critical of Marvel as anyone, and I see that both Captain Marvel & The Boys debuted in the same year.

However, Carol Danvers didn't need nudity, over-the-top gore or an atrocious english accent by Karl Urban to gross over 1 billion dollars worldwide. I can't help but flash back to Brie's ""neck"" and ""beard"" comment which triggered so many worldwide. I keep thinking that the only reason this show is so popular is because there's so many of ""them"" in the world.

Sure, it has its standouts. Antony Starr is most definitely a highlight, but he does have plenty of experience with portraying dual natures - if you're familiar with his stellar work in ""Outrageous Fortune"" 20 years ago portraying twins Van & Jethro West. Jethro, a cold-hearted upstart lawyer with an unhealthy mommy fixation (also seen here). And Van, who suffered brain damage as a little kid, is a much kinder and simpler young man with a heart of gold. And a stoner for life.

Unfortunately he's only one character, and that's where the standouts really end. The rest of the day-to-day cast is filled with a legion of side faces that don't really go anywhere, do much of anything or are all that interesting.

When speaking of ""The 7"" it's really just Homelander. You got a masked Swat guy, an invisible guy, black Flash, Discount WonderWoman who only has one face and doesn't amount to anything, and Fish Guy who's momentarily relevant only in the first episode because he's used as a plot trauma source for the doe-eyed newcomer who has to learn that the world isn't just fluffy bunnies and roses.

And ""The Boys"" themselves? Other than Karl Urban's tiresome faux-English accent and his cartoonish overacting, you got the perpetual-bamboozled-faced Jack Quaid, a mute rabid girl and 2 other dudes who serve as the stereotypical bickering elderly couple.

The writers also ruined the mystique of the Supes when they revealed their origin so early. They should've kept that under wraps for at least one more season. It completely took away their aura of invincibility and made everything else that much more predictable.

Ending Marvel? I extremely doubt that. Watch the series once out of curiosity if you have to, but don't let its overall rating fool you. It's nowhere near that good."
8.0,28 March 2020,"Popular beloved =1:Frenchie 2:MM The Attachment :Becca was weird , I was nervous Overall it was great"
8.0,7 January 2023,"I've had big expectations about this show, because I thought that is going to be exactly that kind of show, in which the good guys (the superheroes) fight the bad guys (the villains) and of course, they win. I couldn't have been more wrong, especially because ""The Boys"" it's not about a desperate attempt of superheroes to save the world from evil, instead this show takes a much more realistic approach, about what is going to happen if superheroes had really existed.this series has mind blowing story line with an great actor, they all contribute really good role in the series. Nice movie with great concept."

9.0,2 October 2021,"A refreshing look at how life would be if super heroes really existed. Think how bad our movie/sports/pop stars are right now and how greedy and manipulative corporations are, but now imagine giving them super powers and see how much mayhem would ensue. Exceptionally casted with some very good performances. I just hope they can keep it up for a long time!"
9.0,4 September 2019,"Great story, especially during the golden age of Superheroes-on-screen, with loads of memorable scenes, fun gory moments, shocking material, engaging drama between characters, a fantastic show that does what many modern viewers look for, and that's an R-rated version of what's popular in today's movies and tv. Pretty funny too.

Unfortunately the writers have to muddy it up with their own biased, liberal, anti-religious, pro-feminist agenda. Can't have an evil female superhero, and can't miss the obvious hate-speech against religion in several scenes throughout.

Aside from political bias plaguing the script, it's a blast. Entertaining throughout, just prepare for the occasional nod to the typical rampant in-your-face liberal bullspit.

Edit: It gets worse after season 3. Oh my goodness, it's like the visual manifestation of every hardcore liberal's dream. Just nonsense after misguided nonsense. Screw the writers. Bunch of one-dimensional freaks."
9.0,11 October 2020,"I liked season 1, fun and interesting. I think the writer was trying tooooo hard. The whole story became non-sense. By the way, please just remove the seaman, Deep. Story about him was not funny, nor interesting at all. In fact, it was really boring and writer put a lot of time to this character. Unfortunately, I don't think I will be watching season 3 if it happens."

8.0,5 May 2024,"Blatantly entertaining! It has everything a human could ever want in a show. The action's intense, the gore is even more-so. It's more real than any other super-hero type entertainment out there, I think. I know I'm late to the party with my opinion but thought this would be a good place to enter my first review on here. The engagement that this show locks me in, it's much like seeing one of the first Star Wars movies or the first Spiderman movie from the early 00's. Definitely haven't come across too many other shows that pull me in like this has. I'd honestly give this a ten but not sure it reaches that level. May change it in the future, we'll see."
9.0,9 August 2019,"If you like superhero movies, and you like Mystery Men but want something a bit darker and grittier then I highly recommend The Boys, available on Amazon Prime or... some other way of getting it. The only downside is Karl Urban's attempt at a British accent. I spent the first 3 episodes wondering why people kept making a point of offering British stuff like tea to an Australian. The I realised he was trying to do a east end accent. Other than that, maximum stars."
9.0,7 October 2019,
9.0,9 June 2022,Just started season three and it's sliding in the political correctness garbage direction already. Still pretty good show for now. I'm sure before it's over this will be nothing more than a platform driven to hate white Americans. Let's hope not.
10.0,11 August 2019,"First off I should start with what I THOUGHT this show was about based on the trailers I watched... I thought this show was about a group of D-list super heroes that decided to band together to take down the A-list super heroes that have gone bad and I was really excited to see it. Well I was wrong. It is about a group of non-powered humans who hate super heroes and are trying to find proof to take them down by bumbling around and putting themselves in danger (which sounds like it would be funny but it isn't). As it turns out pretty much ALL super heroes are bad and the private company that runs them is worse.

That being said, the actual story line wouldn't be totally without potential, but that potential was completely thrown out the window. This show has no real plot line that I can follow just lots of hints about conspiracy and darker things than the already gratuitous awful stuff they do pack the episodes with. None of it seems to propel the story forward or explain anything. It is filled with dark, evil deeds that seem to have no purpose to the story other than shoving down your throat how bad super heroes and their company is. It is not remotely entertaining, in fact it is really boring. I got through episode four in the hopes that it was all leading somewhere, but when all I had was more confusion and disappointment I stopped watching."
10.0,6 January 2023,"Man this is such a step up compared to the comics as of right now after the end of season 3. Probably one of the few shows that does a better job than its original counterpart.

Plot/Story: 8.9

The concept, the idea of ""bad"" heroes has been done multiple times but for a whole universe that is quite deep and expansive compared to most others have never been done before. Each season was bigger, better, more explosive, but it always stuck to its recipe. The intro, the buildup which was the longest and most important, the climax, and then the conclusions. The pacing was well done for the most part with resting periods after each grotesque, adrenaline pumping scenes. The consistency was there with a few minor hiccups and flaws but overall amazing writing and character development. Its bitter, sweet, funny, and VERY violent. No deep philosophical thinking or any deep themes, just a very good series that I enjoyed very easily from the gecko

Characters: 8.2

The heroes, the villains, I mean they were all well done for the most part. Each one of them were unique with their own stories and defining personalities. They felt human, they felt real..

Overall well done for the most part just had a hard time connecting with most of them other than 1 or 2 characters.

Visuals/Sound: 9.8

The directing, the sounds, it was really ridiculously well done. Watching the series I could see that they put a lot of effort into it. The directing, the cartoon animation which was so wonderful and unique, the use of IG, the news, etc. Also the set designs and costume designs were well done also.

Overall quite an enjoyable series.

Memorable: Sort of Rewatchable: Quite likely..."
10.0,2 September 2019,"Unpridictable storyline that may look simple but keeps on bringing both sides of coin in front of u in a very fascinating way.

Infact dark side of heroes are shown in 1st ep. So other 7ep. Takes u to different situations that is very cool to see. If u want a fun series just go for it . It's not too serious , not too harsh and in between their are some funny helarious stuffs that never let the show drop it's frame...."
10.0,30 August 2019,"The first I have watched from Amazon Prime, and boy, is it a blast. Amazing, amazing, amazing..

KEEP IT UP!"
7.0,1 November 2019,A fantastic cast harboring memorable performances. Perfectly complimentary soundtrack and a story that's a step off the curb. The Boys brings a much appreciated twist on a saturated market and a unique departure from its comic book counterpart.
1.0,23 December 2021,"Due to being away, it took me a while to watch the last episode of the fourth season of The Boys but I have watched it and here is my review for the fourth season of Amazon's acclaimed show The Boys. The premise of the season sees The Boys attempt to finally kill Homelander after he starts to use his powers in public to cause fear.

Main Character Karl Urban is once again back as Billy Butcher and I really like his character this season. After taking Temp V last season it is clear that Butcher is dying and doesn't have much time left and Urban really sells that. He is more brutal this season and trying to achieve his goals before he goes and Urban kills it this season.

I have always believed that Homelander played by Antony Starr is one of the best performances in any medium and this continues here. Homelander goes through so many emotions this season and I just love watching his mind work and I can't emphasise how great Starr is in this show.

Supporting Characters Over the last few seasons A-Train played by Jessie T Usher has been one of the more interesting characters and this season really gives him plenty of screen time to further flesh out his character and he nails it. You see the conflict in him and that he actually wants to be a hero and not just Homelander's pawn.

On the contrary is a fantastic performance by Chase Crawford who plays The Deep, he becomes more committed to Homelander's cause and you really see the violence come out in him and Crawford plays this sleezy bad guy so well.

But I do think some of the characters get treated poorly this season. Jack Quaid plays Hughie and he goes through the ringer this season, his story does feel a bit disconnected from the main plot and Quaid is given very little to do and I just didn't care too much about him.

Erin Moriarty as Starlight is kind of insufferable this season, they do plenty of things to make you really not like her character but I never really felt any real redemption for her and I just wanted to see her get taken down and taken off of the show.

There is a huge cast and new characters such as Sister Sage, Firecracker & Joe Kessler are fantastic but characters we already had such as Frenchie and Kimiko are really misused and are actually pretty annoying.

Story The overall story is pretty interesting, it shows The Boys and Butcher going to extreme lengths to try and take down Homelander. With Homelander really trying to hit his endgame and put supes in charge of the world. It is showed really well and I really like how the stakes have been risen for the last few seasons of the show. But, similar to previous seasons every character has to have their own individual stories and some of it just sucks, too much is going on and certain plot elements just aren't very interesting. But the show has a fantastic ending which has me excited for the fifth and final season.

Script The show is still really well written, there is the combination of humour and drama here. The show is as outlandish as it has been before and this season it definitely leans into the politics within The USA but I always believed the show has made fun of elements of US politics so it has always been there.

Style The show has kept the violence in their action and it just works for The Boys and the crazy elements makes it stand out to other shows of somewhat similar ideas. It is paced well enough despite the amount it tries to cram in and I think it was really fun weekly entertainment.

Overall Overall, The Boys Season 4 is one of the weaker seasons of the show but it is still a great watch for fans of the show. With the next season confirmed to be the final. It has me excited for how they are going to give this show the send-off that it deserves.

Rating - 8/10."
9.0,31 July 2019,"Its great writing excellent acting... great all around except they keep showing unnecessary like somebody getting out of bed naked and they show it, we don't need to see that we know people have butts and such

8.0,27 November 2019,"This is the kind of show that I just couldn't stop watching and I actually got kind of angry when it ended and I realized I'll have to wait til next year for season 2. The acting and writing is Superb in this show. Antony Starr as Homelander is the best performance of the year in television and film. His ability to switch between moods that are completely different is something to behold. The concept and story is brilliant and intriguing and I loved the look they decided to go with, it really added to the realistic feel of the show 2nd favourite show as of now"

Homelander is ace"
1.0,7 September 2019,"This is a great TV show, based on even better source material. It's a little bit disappointing they've loosely based it on the comic, as I feel it's a little deeper with the characters, but all written media is like that I guess.

The acting is brilliant, funny and dark. Karl Urban is the loveable rogue, and Antony Starr the hateful villain. Both put in a great job portraying their roles as the opposite side of the same coin.

It's a decent take on the usual superhero story, where there are plenty of Supes but not many heroes."
10.0,18 December 2021,"Formed by a group of victims of Super Heros ""The Boys"" are looking to take both the Super Heros and the corporation that runs them down. It is the flaws in every character that make this show a must see rather than the stereo typical hero and villain formula. One cant be ready for the graphical display of how a normal human would actually fair against a Super Hero, mainly as the viewer is given little warning. Not for the weak of stomach."
10.0,5 September 2019,"We all know why we want to watch this series. We all know the current craze with superheroes but we somehow realized that they are always portrayed as perfect character's with grounded morals. Yet, this series argues that this can't be further from the truth as power absolutely corrupts.

I'm always fascinated with the theme of power and it goes to show as I also thoroughly enjoy Watchman, a similar vein to this series.

This series is fun, albeit a little predictable, but the over the top and wacky scenarios make this more unique than every other superhero series out now. I thoroughly enjoyed season 1 and I can't wait to see what else they have in store for us."
10.0,18 October 2024,
9.0,22 September 2019,"For years I've been a superhero fan and I watched almost every superhero show there was till I had enough. I think we all can agree that superhero movies and shows dominate the film industry. The moment I saw the Boys I thought "" here we go another superhero series"" and I was not interested. But I gave it Chance and it was THE superhero show I needed. Because it's realistic and not a fairy tale where the good heroes fight the bad villains. We get the opportunity to see supes from another angle."
10.0,3 August 2019,"Firstly, I could not be happier for Karl Urban; he and the whole cast do a very good job here. I'm down to go at least 3 seasons with this lot - from the get go.

This tale of the pursuit of personal vengeance gone awry has just enough complexity, humour, and human nature for me to let the dodgy superhero costumes fade into the background.

The script is good, the sound track is good, performances are believable; the cinematography is really good.

As a competitor to The Umbrella Academy, I think this is a very good contender and could actually make for a very interesting take on many of the things we love to hate; the Military Industrial Complex, Corporate Greed, Political Corruption, Irrational Enmity between People, Star Crossed Love - you know all the things that make life interesting.

The superhero aspect is probably the least interesting part of the equation and It felt as if they chose as the vehicle just because it sells, which is in itself not a bad thing.

Very binge worthy and I am glad they put it all out at once so I could do exactly that - binge away."

I really felt invested in the main characters and grew to love/hate some of them for their stupidity & revengeful acts.. Always love to see a writer not scared to kill off some characters. With some top notch action shots & creative deaths it really kept my eyes peeled to the screen.

Couldn't stop watching it! I actually finished it in a day, hungover on the couch."
9.0,7 February 2020,"I must say I was skeptic about this series, but after many people talked about it, i decided to give it a try and i loved it since episode one. It's a nice change from the the regular super hero series. The plot is good with some dark humor and action to it."

9.0,27 July 2019,"Started watching this show yesterday and its really great. The acting is very believable, the effects are incredible, and the story is very interesting."
10.0,1 June 2024,"This is some graphic violence with intense dialogue regarding a group of superhumans. Superficially they act as heroes but are truly villains and though many comic books show the dark sides this is the first hit live action i've seen execute this well.

The critical part of an anti hero story is showing and having the internal struggle of being who they are and accepting it. Though most of them show a 9/10 performance, Anthony Starr's Homelander is above and beyond.

The team's backstory and development are very well done showing how they came to their current and what motivates them to do what they do. And frankly very few dull or dragging moments in this show.

I think it deserves 10 stars because it actually pushed into a boundary that most superhero media doesn't go often. It creates a sense of fear, belief that if superheroes were once human this is exactly how they'd behave making this a new journey. Not a typical 21st century ""marvel/fox/dc"" superhero or antihero which is why it deserves an extra star to address the vulgar, ugly, practical side of what having superpowers can mean.

Be warned this is hella graphic, showing everything you could imagine with CG or prosthetics absolutely NSFW/Kids/conservatives. At first I actually stopped watching midway through the first episode because it was breaking so many social barriers but got through and enjoying it ever since.

Strong story, strong characters, and great storytelling in this show. Seth Rogen also makes multiple guest appearances LOL Sir Cumsalot. Overall it sparks great emotional response and hard to stop watching. Definitely looking forward to more Gen V or The boys in the future and hope it continues."

10.0,27 September 2019,Not a huge fan of super hero stuff but this is a refreshing take on the subject. The Boys succeeds because it gives a well fleshed-out set of motivations for each character.

I hope more of Homelander and Firecracker, please!!!

I hope to see them in The Boys Presents: Diabolical season 2, please!!!

I hope for Homelander and Firecracker have a relationship, please!!!

If there is a relationship, it will blow my mind.

And Firecracker manipulating Homelander by using his obsession with breast milk.

It is more than loyalty... It is Firecracker in love with Homelander.

Firecracker is attracted to Homelander, which is why Firecracker trying to please Homelander... Firecracker has feelings for Homelander.

Homelander is everything to Firecracker."
10.0,27 July 2019,"I'm just mad I have to wait 1 year for more! That last episode is pretty awesome, and I just want more Maeve."
10.0,26 July 2019,"Great fun show about how power corrupts and everything costs... There are lots of geeky references, action, splatter gore and humour. The major downside is Karl Urban's horrendous accent (how did they let him get away with it??) but overall a fun watch for when you need to switch off."
10.0,4 June 2022,"I generally DESPISE most of superhero tv/movies, but have been thoroughly enjoying this for 3 seasons.

1 point off for the incredibly dull character and acting(!) of one of the main heroes (Starlight, Erin Moriarty)."
10.0,27 July 2019,So close to real life if it wasn't for the fact it's based on super heroes. I started watching the first episode and couldn't stop got to episode 8 now super excited for episode 9 to come out and I'll be a regular watcher lol it's just that good.
10.0,8 July 2022,"Overall this show is a solid 9/10.

This show just knocks it out of the park with all the pokes at modern pop culture and type the amazing development each and every character gets. Season 3 had some of the best episodes in any comic book show including Daredevil. Bravo to the creators of this show for creating such a work of art👏."
10.0,24 July 2024,"The Boys is one of the best Superhero shows I've ever seen. While Season 1 was the best season of the series, Season 2 and 3 were also both very good and absolutely worth watching. Season 3 was fantastic show ! It takes everything you loved about Season 1 and 2 (the violence, humor, heart, craziness, character development, etc.) and takes it all to a whole new level! This show has such an original take on the Superhero genre that is both exciting and hilarious! When I first heard of 'The Boys', I thought it would be your standard superhero series, but when I actually watched it, I discovered I was dead wrong. After 15 minutes of the first episode, it was impossible to stop watching. It was a more believable take on what the world would look like if superheroes were flying around today, with characters that were unforgettably unique. There were times when I thought that the 'good guys' were the 'bad guys', and times when I thought the 'bad guys' were the 'good guys'. But in the end, I found that there weren't any 'all-good' or 'all-bad' characters, but 'all-human' characters, sometimes with more-than-human abilities. It's a super series, definitely worth your time."

10.0,11 July 2024,"There is nothing new in the fourth season. I was waiting for the boy soldier to return, and every time I watch an episode I hope for his return, but there is no hope in this season. I only liked some scenes in Butcher. I watched this entire series, but this season is boring. The ridiculous things that appeared in this season are many more than in previous seasons. The season no longer attracts you to the fun scenes, and also this season has little action. It must be like previous seasons and return. Soldier Boy returned to the series. News spread about him, and nothing but false news about Soldier Boy's return."
7.0,27 July 2019,"Awesomely done, fulfilling storyline, unique, and one of the best shows I've ever watched."

10.0,27 July 2024,"I am obviously a fan of the show, otherwise I wouldn't have gotten to this season in the first place!

Now... season 4 of ""The Boys"" keeps up its dark take on a twisted superhero world, absolutely nailing the sharp critique of today's America. More than any before, this season really captures the craziness of the current U. S. scene, blending real-world issues into its story with spot-on accuracy!

This season is a perfect blend of hyper-realistic satire and dark humor, providing a scathing critique of contemporary US society through its alternate hero-universe lens. The fearless exploration of political, social, and cultural issues makes it a strong reflection of today's environment, all while delivering the thrilling, often shocking entertainment we already expected from it. By holding up a mirror to the real world, ""The Boys"" provokes our thoughts about the society we live in, making it one of the most relevant and compelling series of our time.

Needless to say... a must-watch!"
10.0,27 July 2019,
10.0,25 June 2022,"Now I actually do like Marvel and DC but frankly I've just got bored with Avengers and pretty much every other Marvel film. They're predictable, good always wins, the humour is meh.

The Boys takes superheroes we are familiar with (but re-christened), and turns them into more realistic (being powerful probably would turn you into a dick), violent versions.

I love this show, it's action is exciting, the casting (Anthony Starr stands out in particular), is fantastic and the depravity know no bounds. You'll also get a good number of laughs too.

The Boys is a rollercoaster of a ride."
10.0,27 July 2019,
10.0,7 October 2020,It's fun in how they portray superheroes as a corporate product. They are more concerned with ratings than saving lives.
10.0,28 July 2019,"Dark, different and so good. If you get tired from superhero stuff whatch this one. You need to be 18. So many twists, some scenes not for week hearted"
9.0,10 July 2022,Nice story for season1 and amazing acting by homelander well done. But The actor Who plays MM probably one of the worst i've ever seen.and the starlight is the lamest super hero i think . It seems ilke even ashley can beat her in 1 v 1.
9.0,6 October 2022,"The first 2 seasons were great. After that, they completely sacrifice story and depth for just for shock value and sex. Season 3 could literally take place in 3 episodes. It's so sad to see writers run out of ideas and just throw in semi pornography to hide their lack of talent. I wouldn't even recommend starting to watch this show due to the direction it ends up taking even in the story. It just ends up being a nonsensical porno mixed with a weird snuff film that makes absolutely no sense at all. People are saying this is a great alternative to the MCU and DCU, but it really just as much a waste of space as they are but somehow manages to be worse than either."
6.0,6 October 2020,Amazing combination of darkness and fun. The character portrayed are upto the mark especially billy Butcher amazing acting.
3.0,8 July 2022,
10.0,18 June 2022,"I really enjoy the storyline and the creativity of this show. It is was keeps me coming back to watch the next episode. However, there is one thing that separates this show from other great shows. In my opinion, there are not enough ""likeable"" characters in this show. I can't seem to find myself REALLY rooting for any character. Clearly, Hughey is the character that we are supposed to be ""rooting"" for. But as I progress through the show, I find myself rooting for him less and less. I don't know if this is just my take on the show, or does anybody else agree? I still give this an 8/10. Don't get me wrong, it's a good show."
9.0,24 June 2022,"Not that I hate the superhero madness the last 10 years, but this unique take on what happens after a superhero battle. How it affects ordinary people is never shown. This show blasts past that and takes you exactly at the place. This show is also a parody for the actors in your real life. We see them as our Idols but most of them do a lot of shady things in reality and is covered up for them. I feel this show does the best to Mock superheroes, actors and questions how we are manipulated. I love it."
9.0,15 August 2019,"This is one of the best shows of the century. Truly has everything, from amazing acting, to a fantastic script, and great cinematography. The bad reviews (although there are very few as this is close to a masterpiece) are simply politically aggravated nonsense. Saying things like ""too violent"" or ""there's sex"" or ""it's anti-religion"". Those distinctions have absolutely nothing to do with making a show good or not, and certainly doesn't warrant giving a show a 1 star review. Sickening."
10.0,8 October 2020,"This show has the best

1. Plot 2. Characters 3. Acting 4. Premise

Of all Shows in 2020.

The acting of Homelander and Butcher is outstanding and also the best of 2020. It brings a breath of fresh air to the hero overload that Marvel and DC brought over the last decade."
10.0,4 October 2020,"This show is amazing, and I'm surprised it got through all the censors. I love it, on every level. Brilliant satire on the superhero movies and on American consumer and ad driven society. But also incredibly funny thanks to Karl Urban. The red pill blue pill scene made me wet my pants it was so funny. So enjoy."
10.0,25 September 2020,I gave this show a chance 2 days ago and i have completely binge watched every hour episode of this show! now im so excited for episode 6 to come in a few days
10.0,20 September 2020,"Season one is great. Exciting, unexpected scenes, a lots of ""wow"" moments. Unfortunately, most of the negative reviews about season 2 is true: boring dialogs, lack of excitements and about ""Deep"" .. forget it. Five episodes into season two, I have no motivation of continue watching it. Please re-make season two for the sake of new viewers."
9.0,13 September 2020,"Season 1 was ""GREAT"" but something happened to season 2. Different writers? Storyline change? Don't know so far up to episode 4 it just hasn't stuck. Don't believe the reviews that give it 10 and say things like ""breath of fresh air"". Too corny to be real. This is a great show but seems to be going down with every episode."
6.0,1 September 2020,"Anti hero squads.

Against hypocrisy , for the real justice.

Very characteristic.

Unique story.

Fun.

First hero action drama in this year."
1.0,23 May 2022,I love it the gore and the realistic approach the makers did by making the superheroes selfish and stuff soo yeah I recommend it thanks for reading bye.
10.0,21 October 2023,"The Boys is a show that dares to challenge the conventional superhero genre, by presenting a dark, twisted, and hilarious take on what happens when the heroes are not so heroic. Based on the comic book series by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson, the show follows a group of vigilantes who are determined to expose the truth about the corrupt and powerful corporation that manages the superheroes, known as the Seven.

The show is not for the faint of heart, as it features graphic violence, gore, sex, and profanity. But it also has a lot of heart, humor, and satire, as it explores themes such as celebrity culture, corporate greed, media manipulation, and moral ambiguity. The show does not shy away from tackling relevant and controversial issues, such as racism, sexism, homophobia, and religious fanaticism.

The cast is phenomenal, with Karl Urban stealing the show as Billy Butcher, the leader of the Boys who has a personal vendetta against the superheroes. Antony Starr is equally impressive as Homelander, the leader of the Seven who is a twisted and narcissistic version of Superman. The rest of the ensemble is also great, with Jack Quaid as Hughie, the naive and sympathetic protagonist who joins the Boys after his girlfriend is killed by a superhero; Erin Moriarty as Starlight, the newest member of the Seven who struggles to maintain her ideals in a corrupt system; and Laz Alonso, Tomer Capon, and Karen Fukuhara as Mother's Milk, Frenchie, and the Female, the other members of the Boys who have their own motivations and skills.

The show is also visually stunning, with impressive special effects and action scenes that rival any blockbuster movie. The show does not hold back on showing the full extent of the superheroes' powers and their consequences. The show also has a great soundtrack that adds to the mood and tone of each scene.

The Boys is a show that will keep you hooked from start to finish, with its unpredictable plot twists, witty dialogue, and memorable characters. It is a show that will make you laugh, cry, gasp, and cheer. It is a show that will make you question your own morality and what it means to be a hero. It is one of the best shows of 2019 and a must-watch for any fan of superhero stories."
10.0,28 July 2019,I didn't have high hopes but was addicted from the first episode.
10.0,4 October 2020,Scratches a lot of the same itches as early Game if Thrones did. Equally as brutal. Top 3 favorite shows ever. Having. To wait for the weekly release is frustrating in the moments after watching a great episode - but the excitement built up by waiting is worth it.
10.0,4 July 2022,"All I can say that sums up this show is ""peak""

I could go on for hours talking about how perfect every aspect of the show is but I'll just say WATCH IT IMMEDIATELY."
9.0,21 June 2022,"I know, I'm late to the party... but I'm really enjoying The Boys, it's f-in diabolical! It's over the top, ridiculous and violent... even more than I expected and I'm loving it. Karl Urban and Tony Starr are amazingly cast, they both hit it out of the park. Still not quite sure if I like Urban better as Butcher or as Dredd... but both parts are absolutely made for him.

I also catch myself thinking regularly that Eric Kripke should be involved in a future Deadpool movie, he has that sick sense of humor and violence that would absolutely perfectly fit a Deadpool movie.

An absolute must watch for anybody that likes the more ""mature"" superhero movies."
10.0,9 October 2020,The Boys is a fantastic show. You need to watch it.
9.0,10 June 2020,"Setted in a world where superheroes are superstars, which public image and activities are controlled by a mega corporation, that takes major decisions for them. The face of the company are these 7 heroes: as any other job, they needed to pass an interview, they have a contract and need to respect some PR policies. I was honestly expecting a funny parody about superheroes movies, in fact some costumes are clearly inspired by famous characters from Marvel and DC, but in reality this series is much more. It is a deep analysis of our society and what people can do in order to reach their goals, disregarding completely any law, any common sense and any moral, especially if they become famous. This is perfectly represented by Homelander, a manipulative and egocentric person and his other colleagues, that in order to cover their mistakes, will take controversial decisions.

A group of men called The Boys, will try to stop this abusive behavior, in every possible way. What I really appreciate is that superheroes this time are villains and humans, are the real heroes, how to turn cards in an efficient and creative way. It is the most original stuff that I have watched regarding superheroes since Watchmen and The Dark Knight Trilogy by Nolan. Don't get me wrong: I like MCU movies, but they never really push boundaries, Marvel and DC decided to realize ""family friendly"" movies lately, and that's okay, but after you watch a couple of movie from the MCU or from the DCEU, you basically watch all of them, because they are always the same thing, so when finally networks do something different, I am always happy.

Let me be clear: this is NOT a series for everyone and there are many, many sequences that are really hard to watch and process, so approach this series carefully. Of course there is the right dose of comedic moments, but most of them fall under the black comedy humor category, and may offend someone. The series will is composed by 8 episodes and they just flew away. Never felt bored once. Even if you don't like superheroes, I would give it a shot, The Boys might surprise you."
10.0,13 August 2019,"...But the writing has frequent low points, and every scene feels stretched to fill the timeslot, so to speak. I wanted to like it but I found myself flicking forward on the PS4 controller multiple times in each conversation without missing anything important. I blame the script and directing mostly.

(Who sits on a small bench right next to a total stranger, in the middle of a wide open grassy park, and then holds an emotional cell conversation?)"
7.0,29 July 2019,"It's dark, funny and completely not what superheros should be. With the whole squeaky clean marvel drivel (which is quite literally just copy and paste every single film's plot with a different hero) this is the antidote. The acting is sublime, the script is tight and the direction, cinematography and production has instantly made this this show classic for a long time. Really looking forward to season 2, well done to everyone involved in making this"
3.0,31 July 2019,
10.0,3 August 2019,"Anyone else hating Homelander, he's like Joffrey and Ramsey combined.

Karl Urban is like Jon Snow, Dany and Jamie, the leader of the boys, you can't always tell if he's a hero or just out for himself."
10.0,18 July 2024,"In multiverse where Marvel has us caught in an endless cycle of releases failing to capture our interest arrives this show. It overcomes hero stéréotypes while reflecting our world as a whole. I can't wait to see what else Season 5 can draw parallels to.

When watching Gen V last year, I thought to myself, how is a spinoff better than the original show?

Turns out I just hadn't seen the original show. Season 4 has been a game changer and I can't believe this is the time they choose to end it.

Even with multiple spinoffs coming along, I still feel The Boys will always hold a special place in the universe."
10.0,26 July 2024,
10.0,19 July 2024,
10.0,16 May 2024,"I initially watched this series alone, but later recommended it to my partner. As we watched it together, I noticed numerous subtle hints and elements in the storyline that I had missed during my first viewing, which significantly enhanced the overall enjoyment. Unlike Marvel's more fantastical approach, this series offers a more grounded, realistic take on what it might be like if superheroes genuinely existed. Additionally, the show places significant emphasis on character development, showcasing a diverse array of personalities that seem to be very carefully crafted and are integral to the narrative."
10.0,14 October 2020,"Everything in the show is great, the boys gang are so funny, strong, interesting. You'll just love watching them. And a bloody masterpiece!! So much blood in the show. They'll show you the other face of the superheroes and fame life . And good cinematography. If you like bloody series and action and wanna laugh , Just watch the boys . Believe me you'll like it. One of the best tv shows I've ever watched and one of the best this year!!"
10.0,31 December 2019,
10.0,29 December 2022,"I got hooked with the concept of evil super heroes run by a company mixed with politics. So, it started pretty well.

Unfortunately, the show gets worse and worse. The storytelling has huge holes, the character building is mediocre, the violence gets annoying. I kept on hoping to ger another turn but the spiral kept going down. The characters of 'the boys' even started to be more and more annoying. There's so much without sense, it's hard to look away and play it down by fiction.

I m shockingly disappointed after finishing the third season today.

If the show would be a character, it would be 'Deep'."
7.0,15 October 2020,THE MOST PLOT TWISTS THAT I HAVE EVER WITNESSED IN LAST EP OF S2!!!! 10/10!!!!
1.0,10 August 2022,Watched The boys on Prime Videos and after a long time saw such an amazing series based on comic.. It's basically the story of how the world will work in reality if there are people with superpowers & how it will affect people's life & politics. Anthony Starr(Homelander) & Karl Urban(Butcher) are soul of this series... All 3 seasons are equally amazing... Be ready for lots of Mature content... But worth watching... WELL DONE.
8.0,28 June 2022,"Season 1 Review: 'The Boys' is outright manic, violent, howlingly hilarious & a scathing commentary on American Society, all shown through currently world's most trending genre, Superheroes. A world where Superheroes are celebrities & are managed by Corporation, Some Boys want to get revenge on them for all the atrocities thay have committed. This show explores corruption of humanity at the elite level of society, from toxic corporate culture, insane consumerism, business lobbying, dirty side of celebrity life, sexual exploitation of starry eyed newcomers, creation of wars to keep the arms trade going, powerful people with god syndrome. The dark comedy is absolutely top notch, with scenes so epic & disgusting it will surely make our parents faint. Everyone gives solid performances but Karl Urban as Billy Butcher & Antony Starr as Homelander are just ground breaking. Homelander is undoubtedly one of the most sinister villains ever portrayed on screen. Every scene he comes, I have this unsettling feeling that he is gonna do something horrific. The CGI is really good for a show & the music is great. There are so many great dialogues & characters are well formed, although some events happen very conveniently. Its one of the most fun shows out there & heavily bingeable. Dont Miss It."
10.0,31 July 2019,"I actually had NO expectations for this one but I read the plot and got a little interested. Binge for 2 days and is so stunned how good the show was, best this year so far."
10.0,28 July 2019,If you are into The Superhero genre START WATCHING RIGHT NOW!
10.0,28 July 2019,I love this show! My favorite characters are Hughie and Mother's Milk !! They were consistent and characters were awesome! Yin to Yang so to speak!
9.0,13 June 2022,"Best tv series I've ever seen in my life very unique and good story line and action.

Superheroes are often as popular as celebrities, as influential as politicians, and sometimes even as revered as gods. But that's when they're using their powers for good. What happens when the heroes go rogue and start abusing their powers? When it's the powerless against the super powerful, the Boys head out on a heroic quest to expose the truth about the Seven and Vought, the multibillion-dollar conglomerate that manages the superheroes and covers up their dirty secrets. Based on the comic book series of the same name."
9.0,17 May 2022,"The best superhero series i have watched. Where to begin , completely diabolical yet funny series where humans are shown more mature than the supes who may or may not be nerd. The political desire, Corporate game and capitalism , gullible and deity.

Have to congrats the show creator for a wonderful script , screenplay, character arc and actors. I literally binge watched two season with two days leaving all my chores."
10.0,18 August 2020,
8.0,14 July 2022,"Season 1 was Good, Season 2 was just OK, and Season 3 is unnecessarily depraved and disgusting. Too much gratuitous sex and violence and not enough story for me. I'm out."
3.0,26 May 2020,If you like action pact super hero tv or just some dark comedy you'll live this show. Not appropriate for minors because With ultimate power comes...
10.0,29 July 2019,It was the best series ever I watched . If you haven't seen yet . Don't wait so long and enjoy this beautiful show .
9.0,28 July 2019,"I enjoy watching this tv series, im already waiting for season 2!"
9.0,11 October 2020,One of the best shows to come out recently.. hilarious and insanely vicious. Brilliant absolutely perfect.
9.0,9 June 2022,"The Boys remains one of the streaming era's top-notch productions because it's satire doesn't pull its punches or criticism of modern (pop-)culture, it is brutally honest about the 'absolute power corrupts absolutely' philosophy, and its mixing-and-matching criticism of Marvel and DC's Avengers and Justice League archetypes alike make this show a real treat for longtime superhero fans, as well as less genre-centric tv audiences too.

The world-building is some of the most seamless, the characters are like inverts on the Good Guys vs Bad Guys' Thugs routine: except The Boys themselves are like more like self-commanding thugs than flunkies for the likes of The Joker and some such; The Seven are like the completely corrupted versions of Justice League in the Injustice video game, and their opposition are totally powerless in stopping Homelander unless they themselves play dirty like the people (Supes) they hate so damn much.

The Boys is still great stuff; three seasons on and it's still got a lot of bite and critiques to make about the world today. It's also Amazon Prime's flagship series for sure. That last note MAY be a controversial one in light of The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, but I haven't seen it to compare the two programs fairly (yet).

The Boys is like an antidote to all the superhero cliches we're getting accustomed to, and it's still a 'refreshingly cynical' antithesis to Marvel Studios' and DC Entertainment's stuff. It's like the third one of an unofficial 'Big Three' of superhero entertainment: Disney, Warners and Sony/Amazon (thanks to this and Invincible).

The Boys is still going strong; the characters are as deep and morally-grey as ever, the stories get more intricately detailed and delightfully contrived, and the world it's making feels just as fleshed out as any other shared universes on-screen.

This show has become a hit for a good reason: it's a 'full-spectrum' kind of experience that hits all the right chords for the viewers wanting something truly special in today's expanding streaming world."
8.0,3 October 2020,"As title says, best show on just now, good acting, excellent graphics, good story, if your on the fence this is a really fun show, give it a try"
10.0,9 August 2021,"Broadly this series narrates how superpower could become a great abuse and those having it could use it to their benefit. With great power comes great responsibility but what happens if the responsibility is written off.

Its quite action packed, quick and eventful. Especially when you see how ordinary humans try to put a check on superhumans. In some scenes the leverage they put against superhumans don't sound convincing enough. As well there are some fight sequences between super heros which are thrilling."
9.0,30 July 2019,"Absolutely loved this take on superheroes, well worth the watch. You will not regret investing your time in this show. Can't wait for season 2."
10.0,22 February 2020,"Lets start with the premise that this is an Eric Kripke joint. He is one of the last show runners who wants to put forward and entertaining thing without concern for brainwashing people. Kripke usually has a high concept idea and about 20 good shows, only for things to start falling apart. Shows like Timeless and Revolution are prior works. So he provides the same showing here.

High concept is the game here. What if super heroes existed really? Well of course, like modern day super heroes (doctors, judges, rock stars) they would be corrupt and both controlled by and protected by a corporation. The first 5 or 6 episodes of this show really knock it out of the park. Following a normal human hurt by them and a super hero who is joining the elite group of heroes only to find out that all her heroes are corrupt.

The ending, however, seems to have been needlessly put off so that we could have a second season. The final two episodes are not as tight as the first ones and the natural climax seems almost put off. But still the overall series is quite strong.

Definitely something to watch."
7.0,1 August 2024,"I remember watching the first season and thought ""Wow"". Innovative storytelling. Someone finally answered the question why is it that superhumans are generally heros or want to help humankind. The characters and storyline were interesting. What happened? I agree with several commenters who pointes out problems with seasons 2 ans 3, however, that ia normal. Not everyone will appreciate the story runner's efforts. Its okay for people to disagree about a story, it happens with the best of written tales. This is why we have book clubs and formats like IMDB so we can discuss these things. But this is different. This isnt just a matter of a difference of art appreciation. This is disgusting. Season 4 is simply downright horrible!!!! Seems like a group of sickos were hired, put in a room and told to try and outdo each other, and then some network thought that this would sell as imagination and story telling. It's NOT!! It's lousy and simply pathetic. Unwatchable! I tried to give it a chance thinking the stupid, senseless violence would be enough and we would get to a story. I even thought that i could just fast forward through the gross violent stupidity, but there's so much, just doesn't stop. I'm done.

It's so bad that I will not finish the season and in fact, Prime is now on my streaming chopping Block."
10.0,26 August 2019,Didn't expect much from this but it is outstanding! Well worth a watch!

9.0,17 November 2020,"Brilliant,One of the best tv series ever. It's sth new"
10.0,29 October 2020,"I love this show. It has been so long since I saw a show (or movie for that matter) as good as this. I have Marvel/DC fatigue, when the premise of this show was explained to me I had to give it a watch. It delivers in every way: The acting is fantastic, it's action packed, it's entertaining. You can see the obvious critiques it's making about the current superhero powerhouses, *cough* Disney *cough*, and it does it in a such a witty, un-annoying manner. Real life issues are tackled in the show and even with the addition of superheroes, it's still as scary as reality. I've never read the comic books before so this is a review from someone who is only familiar with the show, even so, I highly recommend it. Especially if you're like me and are over the Marvel universe takeover from the last decade. I cannot wait for season 3."
8.0,10 August 2019,"Yeah that's it, this is what you need to know, you can guess what will happen in the next scene but wait, their scenario is just better.

Unpredictable is the key that most tv show lacking."
9.0,12 October 2020,"This show gives you your super hero fix with a dose of reality. Humans are flawed and often morally bankrupt. The line between good and evil is often blurred and The Boys does a great job expressing that. You will be shocked, disgusted, fearful, and joyous throughout the entire 2 seasons. Best if Binged."
10.0,13 September 2020,"As someone who has never read the comics, this show is still really good -- weird and refreshing."
6.0,7 August 2022,It's a good show. You would really like it. The Boys are very dangerous so be careful.it has drama action emtion.it is very engaging story.so you would definitely like it trust me just go and watch it.

Great effects and acting is dead on. My only issue is with Simon Pegg, I just wish they would have let him use his English accent, it would have set a better tone with his character. Over all a definite 9 all day."
10.0,2 July 2022,"First, let me just say that I watched this series from within minutes of its launch.

If I were to sum The Boys up in one phrase, it would be ""shock and awe."" It's a ""WTF did they really really do that"" kind of show. And it's mesmerizing.

I have a vision of the writers collaborating in a smoke-filled room and frequently determining that a scene has to be rewritten because it wasn't offensive enough.

There's so many reviews from people that Just. Don't. Get. It. And it shows from what they write about it. Liberals are shocked. Conservatives are offended. Both are completely missing everything that's epic about this show. These types of reviews are almost as entertaining as the series itself, and are a testament that the writers had goals, and that they exceeded said goals.

The writing is solid. It's shocking, and spares none, whether human or living creature, and even a few inanimate objects. That so many people don't get it makes it even better.

Solid casting too. I can't think of one poorly cast character. I wasn't sure about the addition of Jensen Ackles, but his lines... I laugh just thinking about some of the antiquated things that Soldier Boy brings up.

Zero complaints from me so far.

Happy viewing!"
8.0,12 October 2020,One of the best shows on television! This is exactly what we needed and can't ever get enough. Ready for Season 3!
10.0,9 October 2020,One of the best series I've ever watched. I watched all the episodes in a few days. Great trip and now I can't wait for the third season.
10.0,5 August 2019,"I binged this , it was over too quickly for me , thats really my only critical point. Aside to that this is an acid tongued rollercoaster of antihero blood guts and dark humour goodness Vrs the ideas of your favourite sup's. It takes that idea and warps them into the narcissistic corporate social media driven now. Some bare-wicked turns from the main cast. The soundtracks even decent."
10.0,22 October 2022,"Gosh I love this show. Despite its unnecessary crudeness and gore, it's such a good show. I like to see the dark side of what it would be like if superheroes existed. I mean if you really think about it, superheroes wouldn't be heroes at all, they'd mostly be exactly like they are depicted in this show. I want to say this show is perfect despite the aforementioned but my gosh it get so political sometimes. I'm a moderate but even I can see that often they try to demoralize Christian's and conservatives, painting them as weak and brainless, falling easily for anything. It's funny cause that side says the exact same about the left. I hope there is a day where politics are no longer a central part of film, but at this point there is no hope. I just can't give it the 10/10 it deserves because of this."
9.0,20 September 2020,"I love this anti-superhero show. It is dark, and shows us what might happen if deeply flawed humans had super powers.

It is not all about the special effects though. The acting is superb and the cast is phenomenal. Good guys and bad guys alike.

It gives you characters that you will love to hate, and people to root for (who aren't perfect)."
10.0,2 August 2019,"Eric Kripke and other people behind CW's Supernatural really tanked what could have been a 10 rated show. It suffers from the same writing flaws, out of place campiness, and shallow character development.

Generic and cliched dialogue with characters, directing and editing makes the plot predictable, and episodes never quite execute or go deep enough into the interesting world and dilemmas.

Casting is mostly good, but the performances often fall short because of the writing and directing.

Still has potential, but they need to upgrade the writing otherwise I fear it's going to go the route of Supernatural and other CW shows that started with great premises or source material but never lived up to the potential."
7.0,18 July 2024,"The Boys features a compelling premise, good effects, colorful characters, and an outstanding performance by Antony Starr as Homelander. However, it seems that a dozen adolescent school boys have been substituted for skilled script-writers and are feverishly competing for shock effect. Viewers expect brutality in an action series, but this show has traded substance for unrelenting and violent exploitation of the anal orifice. Occasionally a professional online reviewer will be critical of the show's political messaging, yet there is little complaint about sickness overkill. This fact, along with the many high viewer ratings, must mean The Boys is exactly what the people want. Somehow that is disturbing to me."
1.0,4 November 2020,"Everything you need...it's all there..... Amazing Series..... Very Adult though.... Can and will Top GOT.... It really show what will happen to humans when they have more power .... Political, Business or even literal Power...... Amazing Casting , Acting , Writing , Producing , Directing...and Everything.... IT'S PERFECT...!

And It's a Must See....!

I Love it..."
8.0,11 November 2023,The boys is a fantastic show that does not fail to entertain you for more than a few minutes. I found the show when I started to feel bored of all the marvel content and found this show to be a breath of fresh air. A fair warning it's not for the faint of heart but uses its violence to prove a point and to illustrate emotions and events. I am only on the first few episodes of season 3 but even when no one is fighting and they are just talking it feel amazing and the tension that they can make you feel is exuberant and I truly look forward to season 3 and for later on next year for season four.
10.0,29 June 2022,"Everyone is not squeaky clean, and when you're with superpower, every flaw will be magnified. This show really expose that.

The writing is good, the acting is good, SFX is nice. Perfect combination of all things creating a good series.

Punching ""left"" and ""right"". Good series."
10.0,29 July 2019,"The Boys is one of the best superhero shows. Period. Fans of both the genre and good shows need to check this one out. It's hilarious, packed with great SFX & VFX, and doesn't shy away from creating complex characters. Not everyone is the Devil nor is everyone a saint.

I usually don't watch trailers, but I just had to get a preview of this, and I wasn't let down. Well worth having Amazon Prime. The only thing I missed is more cynicism & brutality as well as jackass anti-heroes (yes, even more than what we already got), but the whole concept was executed marvelously. Can't wait for Season 2."
10.0,29 July 2019,"Edit: Thank you fanboys and hired cheerleaders / claqueurs for your ""not helpful"" marks, I am wearing them with pride. Going down from 6 to 5 stars with my rating. Now back to the original review: There are not many things in ""The Boys"" I didn't see in ""Powers"" (2015). Does anybody even remember ""Powers"" ? It was a real groundbreaking dystopian Superhero show where the ""Powers"" (here they are called ""Supes"") already are out of control, godlike, abusing their power, manipulating the media, using (or creating) drugs, have a fan base that finances their company....but aren't ""man-made"". Of course, if superheroes aren't an evolving species, or created in an energy accident, there has to be a scientist with a German name who experimented on humans...(greetings from Painkiller Jane !) So, for me, ""The Boys"" is a show that isn't very creative. It is, though, well-made and well-played, especially by Anthony Starr (Homelander). The plot, although, is paper-thin and has a summary that is only a few words - People in power are dominating powerless people. The humor is rather grim or absent. There are a few scenes which could be funny if someone where there who had a sense of humor, but those scenes are merely tending into bloodbaths. Any half episode of ""The Tick"" is more funny than the complete Season of ""The Boys"". If there is something funny with bloodbaths, then maybe this show deserves 8 or 9 stars from all people who tend to give bloodbaths 8 or 9 stars, but I do not. I give 8 or 9 stars to exceptionally and creative scripts and dialogs, which this show doesn't have - mostly. And I give 8 or 9 stars for being surprised and getting excited by a show, and honestly, I wasn't - mostly. Mostly I was disappointed, often bored, and sometimes curious."
10.0,29 August 2020,"A good look at a ""dark"" Justice League scenario. What if Superman was a psychopath? What if Aquaman sexually assaulted women - and fish? What if Wonder Woman was an enabler? Etc. The show is funny, violent, heartfelt, and at times even scary. It does fall into the same traps many streaming shows have. Too many one dimensional characters and too much dialogue instead of characters with depth and a tight script. However the villainous Homelander is just fantastic. Every second he is on screen the story shines. Def enough going on with The Boys that I eagerly look forward to S2."
10.0,10 September 2020,"This is one of most AMAZING series ever created. It is gripping, dark, full of action, intense and most significantly well written. This series has some of the most astounding and remarkable characters. CANT WAIT TO KNOW THE FREAKIN ENDING !!!!!!!!!!"
10.0,5 September 2023,"'The Boys' follows Hughie Campbell (Jack Quaid), William 'Billy' Butcher (Karl Urban), Marvin 'Mother's Milk' (Laz Alonso), and Frenchie (Tomer Capone) as average guys hellbent on taking down Supes - or super powered humans - and righting the wrongs they cause. At the top of the Supe heirarchy sits Homelander (Antony Starr) - an invulnerable megalomaniac with laser eyes and flight - who despite being propped up with positive PR, is constantly letting his god complex and inferiority complicate the image of Vaught International, the business brand of superheroes.

This series is excellently shot and wildly amusing! So much of the show is unexpected, to the point where even when the plot seems to be heading in a direction, the execution is shocking. The acting and direction are fantastic as well!

Definitely worth a watch!"
9.0,19 August 2022,I love this series having watched it keenly.i love this series because it is so entertaining i recommend people to watch it. It is so entertaining and educative. Thank you to those who have watched it.
7.0,7 February 2021,"Nice to see a series where it is not the standard story of superheroes saving the day. Many of the characters are well thought out, i'm a real fan of both Frenchie and Kimiko.

It is a pity that especially in season 2 political topics have the upper hand. In my opinion coming down too much on these topics does not do a movie or a series any good. Constant reminders of antisemitism, racism, sexism, and feminism feel like they were added after the story had been fully written - as though they were added last second. I've rated the series 7/10 but if they took it easy on the politics that could have been 9/10."
4.0,19 August 2022,
10.0,9 March 2021,"Yes, you read the headline right. *Mild spoilers*

The Boys off the jump grabs your intention immediately in Season 1's pilot episode and from then on it's a heck of a rollercoaster ride filled with surprises. Have you ever been at a rollercoaster park on a slow day and the person working the rollercoaster let's you go again without you having to get out from your seat? That satisfying enjoyment in getting another go is comparable to The Boys Season 2. As you start season 2, stakes are high and that is displayed immediately in a natural way that feels like a nice warm welcome back. From then on flow of each episode never spikes or twists, it is always comfortably right and eases in viewers well. Without going into detail as The Boys already has 250k+ reviews, I can say that once you finish bingeing season 2 you'd be left with wanting more ASAP! The ending is very well-rounded and tells a complete story (aside of certain conflicts) that is always satisfying when having to wait another year or more to be able to watch new episodes again. I compare The Boys to Breaking Bad because even though both shows could be argued that they are one of the best TV originals of all time, there are still flaws that are proudly embraced.

Season 2 episode 7 falls perfect for an example; ever watch a show where characters find themselves progressing through a conflict and before they can execute their plan of action(s), an unexpected turn of events befalls them? This was expected at some point in every show, it's just the matter of execution on if it's done right, The Boys seemed to consist all story arcs to face their ""the all is lost"" moment within the same episode. Being that the show is almost finished however (as it is second to last episode), the ""all is lost"" moment seems easily forgiving which may question some viewers why were they even included in the first place? Aside from this and the final scene that included a heavy surprise twist that throws off the ending's rhythm, overall The Boys is to say a controversial dramatic masterpiece.

(Reviewed by an unbiased reader of the comics version; please do not base this review off comic accuracy.)"
10.0,11 February 2020,"This is one fantastic rollicking great series. Dark, dark humour and fantastic creativity.

A little like the movie Bright, it paints the non idealistic side of Super Heroes and I loved it.

Honestly, I am not an Amazon Prime member, but having watched this, I will definitely become one for Season 2!"
10.0,8 September 2020,One of my fav series. Brutal new view of how heroes really could be. ...but on the Hulu release format. That is lame.
10.0,18 March 2022,"Love this series, all the actors nail it, and i hate to say this because karl urban is amazing as Billy butcher but.......... 10 years earlier an i recon Andy serkis would of been the absolute right choice, accent wise and everything wise, people forget hes a cracking actor and not just the motion capture king."
10.0,27 July 2019,"First, this show is not suitable for younger audiences.

Now, for the demographic it is intended for the Series thus far has done well establishing backgrounds for its characters, with room for further depth, development, & investigation that will aid in bolstering the scope & immersion of it's own Universe in future seasons. Many of the characters have developed a deep & comprehensive pathos, which helps blend the story's fiction almost seamlessly with our own Universe, despite a few unavoidable gaps. The story, per its own synopsis, revolves around a world where Superheroes exist, but in conjunction with Corporate Enterprises, & it does a decent job depicting how that would realistically work within the confines of an unreal reality.

I would highly recommend watching it to any who are on the fence, I look forward to many more seasons (Barring the stream-series Curse that seems to be sweeping across platforms at the moment). If the series grows next season, I will happily amend my rating from an encouraging & solid 8 to an exemplary & powerful 9, but for now it's just a well done series, with solid acting, based upon very good writing, & blended extraordinarily well so that you or I can connect with the characters they feature."
10.0,10 September 2023,"""You seem to be confused about want kind of company we are. We are not a superhero company. We are a pharmaceutical company. And you are just bad product""

This is a not a superhero show. This is a show about corporate america, religion, politics, racism, warefare and drugabuse. This is what happens when humans get ""superhero"" abilities. And when the strongest of them all gets a dumb following.

All/Most of the characters and acting are good. Ten stars for Antony Starr portraying homelander. He deserves an award for his performance for transforming into a tiran that everybody hates and fears.

9/10 because some plotlines and characters are just annoying and add nothing to the story (the deep) and the extreme violence, blood and gore are often not necessary.

Looping forward tot season 4!"
9.0,28 July 2019,"Absolutely amazing! I have never been so quick to watch the next episode since breaking bad and stranger things! Such a breath or fresh air with great characters and a fantastic story. including humour, shock and damn right craziness! Love this series definitely one of my favourites from now on!"
10.0,25 December 2019,"Back in 2012 or so I'd read an article that this was going to be made into a movie / tv show. I'd never heard of it so read a bit about it online (actually read the entire synopsis on Wikipedia) so I eventually decided to buy each collected edition on kindle. It's one of my fave graphic novel series and the show does not disappoint.

Anthony Starr as homelander is absolutely perfect, Karl Urban as Butcher, again excellent. I can't recommend this show enough, all the cast are brilliant and the writing is superb. Absolutely brilliant work guys can't wait for season 2"
7.0,29 October 2020,
1.0,4 August 2019,"Wow.. just wow!!! There are no words for how amazing this show is. Keep in mind that this tv-series has no attachment to other super hero universes. It´s obviuos that they have taken lots of ideas from different heros and made their own version of supes!

This series is intended for adult audience! And i freaking love it!

Please do more of this!"
10.0,25 September 2019,"Yup, The boys it is. Nails the performance, each and every character portrayed is excellent. The script hold grounds to the subsequent superhero vibe and human connection. The grudge, dark humour and a baseless ending, is all that up for supe. It could do much much better in season 2, as the start is marvelous."
10.0,3 December 2020,"The boys is a diabolical series with its own class in terms of shock value. The directing, script, acting, costumes, lighting, colorization, special effects are all terrific, and would put a lot of films today to shame.

The characters have depth and with many flaws, their goals and motives are clear which makes it easy to root for them or not. The psychologically disturbed leader of The Seven - Homelander played by the wonderful Anthony Starr is both terrifying and fun to watch, anytime he walks into a room with other characters, you can't help but wonder if they will walk out alive. He always grins, always puts on a friendly face, but is also sinister and has such an unstable mind. Anthony Starr deserves some recognition for his performance. The cunning leader of The Boys - Billy Butcher played by Karl Urban, is also another interesting character, he is fueled by personal vengeance against supes most especially Homelander. Throughout the course of the series, we see him, along with the rest of the Boys, achieves his goals of eliminating supes for good. He is vengeful, foul-mouthed, yet charming and has a quirky, off-beat sense of humor but that's all what makes him such a compelling character.

It's a whole different take on the superhero genre. it's dark and twisted, as it is shocking and hilarious. The dialogue works, humor works, drama works, the script's witty and the plot's intriguing and always manage to entertain. If you're tired of recycled storyline of most superhero movies these days, like I am, I highly recommend The Boys!"
10.0,29 June 2020,"First of all the acting is top notch!! Homelander scares the crap out of me ! The rest of the cast are also incredibly good but the actor that plays homelander is amazing . This series gets some really really bad reviews because it's extremely brutal but this ain't a kids show or the avengers ( which i love ) but it's the boys something way more mature and real , yes it's realistic everything has to do with money and power just like it's happening today . Anyway this show is original , is violent , is super funny and super dark . It's nice to see something so different than the typical saving the world thing in superhero movies and series . I can't wait for season 2 of this awesome show !!!

CREATIVITY : 10/10 ENTERTAINING : 10/10 ACTING : 10/10"
9.0,22 December 2021,"The storyline is straightforward and done so well you wonder, why hasn't anyone done this before. An Ozzy doing a cockney accent is always going to be funny but the twists and commitment to character are awesome.

Gory & unique, the story comes at you so fast (wink), it keeps you glued from the Pilot. It's hard to say a superhero film is realistic, but honestly, this is what it would be like if ""powers"" existed."
10.0,2 August 2019,I f..ing love it! I f..ing love it! I f..ing love it!
10.0,10 September 2022,"I feel like this show pretty much shows us how Superheroes in the real world would actually turn out to be.

I was hooked after 10 minutes into season 1. Season 2 and 3 were really strong as well, but the show has become a little more predictable as of late. Still amazing though!

The entire cast is so amazing that my favorite character often changes from week to week if not scene to scene. I am especially impressed with Anthony Starr's transformation into Homelander and his facial expressions in character. He gets my vote to play any mentally or emotionally troubled character in anything ever. Truly GIFTED.

Jensen Ackles joins the cast in season 3 and if you are a Jensen fan (especially from Supernatural) then you NEED to watch this show."
10.0,27 November 2020,Truly something amazing. Something that has not been done before in the superhero genre. The characters are deep and touching and the storyline is engaging. There is nothing to say for this one but praise in every aspect. The acting for Homelander is particularly enthralling. One of the best TV shows I have seen.
10.0,4 September 2020,I loves series one and season 2 could have been even better but it ain't anywhere near as good. Seems To have got a touch of the woke brigade about it and ruined it.
7.0,9 May 2022,"Ten minutes or so into the first episode, the show presents the most horrific and traumatising thing I have ever seen. We don't need this kind of gratuitous suffering, violence and gore to tell a story. It's completely unnecessary, disturbing and I switched it off immediately. Why can't we just have decent stories any more?"
1.0,3 August 2022,"Going into this series, my first impression was a parody of comic books superheroes or a typical superheroes series. But ""boy"" what it turned out to be. This is what Batman keeps talking about in the animated series about superheroes going rogue."
8.0,29 March 2021,"Okay I just recently watched this show from episode 1 season 1 all the way to episode 8 season 2. It was highly addictive and I sacrificed a lot of sleep but it was worth it. It is such a fun show! What a dark take on super heroes.

I loved seeing Elizabeth Shue in this as a baddy. Her character is ruthless.

If you don't like a little gore then this show is not for you. But if you do then do it. A must see!"
10.0,24 September 2021,The best R rated show top action and top bloodbaths. Love it and hope they don't cancel it.

9.0,16 August 2019,"It was one of the most enjoyable shows I have watched in a very long time. Throw out Walking Dead and GOT. The Boys episodes did not fail to deliver every single time - there were no dull episodes, each one was awesome and left you wanting to see the next one. There's deception, corporate politics, espionage, murder, brutality, backstabbing, and, of course, plot twists. Highly recommend."

10.0,24 March 2021,"This show is so cool and refreshing!

Not at all what I expected. After I started watching the show I have read a little bit about the comics as well I must say that this seems so much better in so many ways.

Funny and interesting with a dark twist of the Superhero franchise, Great acting throughout, great writing (especially given the background), Interesting characters. I cant believe how they managed to package a superhero-parody into something that both have dept and seriousness yet still is funny and splatter raw at the same time.

I just love how they portrayed Starlight (Good hearted and naive yet somehow bad-ass and powerful at the same time in one stunning package - Starlight has so much potential and I hope they will let her evolve even more)

In addition of all the other great actors... Erin Moriarty, Karl Urban, Eric Kripke, Jim Beaver and now also Jensen Ackles in season 3? Wow, this smells true ""epicness"" long way, cant wait for season 3! :)"
10.0,21 May 2021,It was the best series ever for mee If i could give more than 10 i'd already! 😍😍

10.0,9 July 2022,"The best show since The Wire. Thought provoking, funny, action packed and sadly very true to life when it comes modern day politics and media manipulation. Couldn't get enough and can't wait for season 4."
9.0,7 August 2019,"This is in my top 3 favorite Tv shows of all time!! I know that seems like an exaggerated review but I'm so serious. The writing is Fantastic! They masterfully create a super hero with drama, suspense, and they even throw in a perfect amount of comedy, exactly when it's needed. I honestly went in thinking this was gonna be a cheesy knock off of the DC universe but I was WRONGLY mistaken CHECK IT OUT"
10.0,9 September 2021,"Is the first episode of the first series , the best opening of any box set? Just rewatched brilliant!"

Great cast!"

4.0,3 October 2020,"-Once again a plot for a miniseries being dragged out by the master of squizing all the juice out bit by bit.

-The cast is great and are the only reason, that the most straight forward and predictable plot is wort a watch. But only for a season.

-This series feels lacking and really basic. For people to watch and not think about it. Showing blood and sex doesn't make the plot more complex or mature.

-If you are looking for something with more substance i would suggest that you check out the source material)"
10.0,9 July 2022,"Lots of cool moments and scenes in the show, interjected with a jarring slanderous ""mirror world"" portrayal of reality's political topics, media reporting, and historical events..

The actors do a GREAT job! Jensen Ackles is awesome as Soldier Boy, and Karl Urban deserves this spotlight.

The political takes, though, are kind of like ""Fan Fiction: How I Wanted Politics to be"", in blatant stark contrast to the supposed ""Politics: a satirical representation""."

Just Perfection."

9.0,18 May 2023,"I call this a ""superhero series"" ironically. The reason for this being that the series centres on a bunch of corrupt superheroes. They are corrupt to varying degrees, with some more noble than others. There's a corporation behind them with sinister intent. The series revolves around a bunch of ""boys"" who are hell-bent on taking this corporation and one particular superhero down, Homelander. The acting in this show is nothing short of impressive. There's some great special effects in here. The action sequences are pretty gory and violent and the show won't appeal to everyone because of that. I'm on the edge of my seat for the next season."

9.0,4 August 2019,"Saw a couple trailers for this show, didn't really pay attention, but liked the idea of antagonist super heroes. Spun it up on a lovely hungover Sunday and I could not be more impressed. The Boys does an amazing job of engaging the audience, developing each character, and playing with the balance of comedy and drama. Amazon struggled with their original content, but has recently put out top notch productions they should be proud of. Looking forward to more original stories 👍🏻"
10.0,19 September 2023,"The Boys is surprisingly an amazing show, It's fun, violent, deliciously filthy, black-humored superhero genre deconstruction. What makes ""The Boys"" so special and unique is its premise based on the Comic Book it gives the unorthodox concept for Superheroes. A very well-written show with a good sense of pace along with so many boundaries pushed. Both the seasons are gripping from start to finish, despite falling into few cliches. The action sequences are wildly entertaining, effing brutal, and sufficiently gory. Dialogues are fantastic, Direction is great, Cinematography is good, BGM is brilliant.

Performances by the entire star cast are phenomenal.

Season one sets/acts as a base and throughout the episode runtime there's Never a single dull moment, the story is perfect for its genre. For the 2nd season, my expectations were high & yet they were surpassed as some fresh new characters are introduced wich immediately grabs your attention and keeps you hooked till the very end."
10.0,30 July 2019,"I wasn't sure about the concept. I was slowly losing interest after the opening scene. Then 0:05:41 happened. Possibly the greatest 1 minute of any series this decade! Afterwards, I binged watch the entire season."

7.0,18 February 2021,"While most superhero projects are color-by-number snoozefests, this one thinks way out of the box and comes out winning. The CGI was amazing, and the music was on point."
10.0,14 August 2019,"We love to love superheroes, but these are a different kind! Incredible acting all around- Homelander could not have been cast better!

If you don't mind swearing, gorey scenes and laughing at inappropriate things- this show is for you."
10.0,2 January 2022,One of the best superhero series. Thrilling plot. Interesting concept. Gross action . It gives us a clear view of what will happen if superheroes turns out to be evil. Its worth watching. You must give it a try.
10.0,5 February 2020,What more to say top 5 show of the year 2019 super r rated not for the weak stomach
10.0,4 September 2022,"Just loved this. It takes the superhero genre and stick a bomb right up your preconceptions and turns it wildly upside down. It's a binge fest... Look out for Bobby Singer and Soldier Boy from Supernatural with more surprises in store. A bunch of commercial superheroes fighting to keep their 'brand name' from being destroyed by some really 'peed off' anti superheroes. Funny, graphic and above all adult its got everything in just the right amounts. Karl Urban and Anthony Starr are just phenomenal as the lead protagonists, .. Both of them grab your hearts, then kick it out to touch, while at the same time have you grinning like a Cheshire cat. I loved it."
8.0,29 July 2019,I did not expect this show to be good! Jaw dropping!
10.0,17 September 2019,"Heavily misbehaved superheroes, plenty of gore, profanity, and violence make this film a follow-up to 'Deadpool.' The character 'Homelander' deserves recognition as one of the best supervillains since Nolan's Joker."
10.0,14 May 2023,"The Boys

This show has stayed true to its intoxicating and darkly beautiful formula from its first episode. With as much nudity and as much gore and as much violence, The boys tells its story of flawed and messy heroes, showing how superheroes would fit into the real world, with all the collateral damage they leave behind in the name of being saviours (when they're being saviours). The plot is unpredictable, and almost always circumvents every notion preconceived. With elements that push the boundary, The boys will make you feel squeamish, giddy, angry... A myriad of emotions it'll surely elicit."
10.0,19 April 2021,"A few years back I was starting to gain some interest in superheroes. I had just begun to watch Marvel and DC movies. Then one of my friends suggested me aboutThe Boys back when season 1 had just begun. I wasn't very much interested in in Amazon Prime so I thought should give it a try when I get time to do so. And when I got the subscription this was the very first thing I saw.

The Boys is set in a dystopian society where superheroes a something of a cultural identity. Unlike Watchmen where people were shown to have lost their interest and superheroes because of their existence in the real world, people in The Boys absolutely adore the superheroes. They watch the movies, buy their toys, read their books, and do everything with way more passion than we do for superheroes. Homelander is given the same reputation as Superman, and is worshipped like a demigod. The truth, however, is completely different.

Nowadays it has become a trend to show that superheroes are flawed people. They also have many wrong habits and tend to make mistakes. But this show takes it on a completely different level. Superheroes are not interested in in doing their job of serving humanity at all. Rather they are owned by corporations like Vought, who use them for marketing purposes and for selling the dream of becoming a superhero by injecting children with Compound V as kids. And the gullible people do not question this as it has become something of a taboo to speak against these gods who live among us. The only people who dare to speak against them are The Boys, a team of misfits led by Billy Butcher. In the beginning of the show they are able to take out Translucent and use his dead body to taunt Homelander.

Starlight is is one of the members of the seven who actually wants to serve humanity but is tried to be bullied into submission by The Deep, A-Train and Homelander. I really like how all of them get their comeuppance, do I feel a little bad for The Deep. In season 2 he was shown to have been bullied as a kid and that is word changed his personality. This is something which clearly states how false Vought's propaganda about having the happy life of being a superhero is. Homelander is also shown to hate faking his origin story just for the entertainment of the people. A-Train was also a bad guy but helps out in season 2 and can also be excused for being a drug addict.

Season 2 introduced Stormfront, and I really like how they showed her to be the forward thinking member of the The Seven and ultimately her true personality was slowly revealed. Finally she also got what she deserved and everything went back to normal. I am really hoping that season 3 also turns out to be as good as the other two and the series doesn't drag on for no reason other than cash grabbing, because in that case they would just become what they are fighting against."
6.0,2 May 2022,"Smart, funny, well written, well acted. An incredible treat in the void of Superhuman garbage that is MCU and DC! Loving the action, the drama, the comedy. Superb!"
2.0,5 September 2020,"It was to be feared... We had an amazing S1, with a great and original ending.

But it seems that perfect ending didn't left much room for creativity in S2. So, besides some great CGI, we are back to something that comes from the ordinary, seen 100 times elsewhere, predictable, that doesn't always make sense.

For instance, it's easier to kill time and fill much of an episode with a useless and irrelevant discussion, than trying to build a solid script that keep us interested from beginning to end.

(based on S2, eps 1,2,3. To be updated...)

Give S1: 9/10 and S2: 7/10, that makes an average of 8/10."
10.0,9 November 2020,"This a tv series with full of violence, action, vengeance and superpowers. In a world with human and super humans the struggle continues.

The first season of the series was quite exciting, even with the stereotype superheroes. Because this season had a reason for everything and everyone driving towards something. The script has crafted with moderate care, characters had a backstory. Superheroes were clearly abusing their position and power and that is why human started to stand up against them.

But the second season was quite opposite because of the sloppy writing. Most of the superheroes became part of good guys. So there was no extreme reason to go against them or their organization. Even after fulfilling their purposes the main characters keep on going doing extreme things. The writer spend little time to establish a motive for characters and keep creating storylines with new characters which led to nowhere. Also because of the weak script, actors' performances seemed somewhat novice and a bit pitiful to watch.

First season recommended. Second season not recommended."
10.0,13 September 2019,"Yep! Spot on with Clinton, Chenney, Bush, Obama, and Trump and I'm a Trump supporter. We're all being bufdooned!"
10.0,7 March 2021,"The Boys is an expert deconstruction of superhero stories, with an appropriately wintery view of institutional power, be it corporate, governmental, religious, or caped. Yes, it's cynical and ultra-violent, but what distinguishes 'The Boys' is its sincere fascination with its characters' anxieties, compulsions, and human failings"
10.0,29 July 2019,"This is the best superhero series I have ever seen, I mean we all watched Jessica Jones .... Luther ..... Dare Devil ... But this one is unique."
10.0,27 October 2020,Its has to the best grey shade superhero movie/series to be released in recent time both s1 and s2
10.0,9 January 2021,"The series is original in most ways considering it dealts with super heroes.

The show is an alegory of today's society and the division of society between the regular people and the untouchables so to say.

In second season this is way more aparent, along with the influence of social media, influencers and political influencers, what does democracy mean etc.

To be honest it gets a bit overly political in season 2 with Trump at its core. Did not appreciate that tone but the show managed to keep it relevant in all aspects and no matter the time period.

What I liked: the cast, the storyline, the plot twists, the humour, the dialogue and pacing. Also Frenchie and Kimiko.

What I didn't like is specific:
-not that I did not like it, but Jack Quiad character is often referred to as ""the kid"", he is only 28 and somehow they made him look 40. If you check his Instagram acc, he really does not look as old as in the show.

A must watch."
8.0,3 August 2022,"""The BOYS"" What can i say,it is one of the mf series i watched, over all it contains lagging between scene and seasons but its more then worth a watch more over the acting skills of leading characters are too good especially ""HOMELANDER"".loved it....!"
10.0,19 August 2022,
6.0,26 October 2020,"One of the best series I have seen this year. Amazing pace, amazing actors, amazing story line, amazing production. I can't wait for season 3."
1.0,11 January 2020,"This show is gross and poorly written. The dialogue is terrible and there's so much unnecessary gore and filth that I felt like I needed a shower after watching. This is the kind of show that masquerades as ""art"" but it's just cheap and nasty."
10.0,15 October 2020,"I'm up to date and so far has been great, action packed, violence and lude behaviour all good entertainment for adults.. I really hope the quality continues into the next season and they keep it fresh.."
10.0,4 July 2023,"""The Boys"" is the perfect antidote to the flood of never-ending superhero films and shows. With its biting humor and gritty realism, this Amazon original series offers a refreshing reality check for fans tired of the same old formula.

In a world where superheroes exist, ""The Boys"" dares to ask what would really happen if they were controlled by profit-driven corporations. Say goodbye to the squeaky-clean heroes and hello to a group of self-centered, arrogant, and downright unpleasant characters. It's a delightful departure from the typical superhero tropes.

This series doesn't hold back. From intense violence and nudity to an abundance of colorful language, ""The Boys"" isn't for the faint of heart or the younger audience. But if you're craving a series that turns conventions on their head, this is the one for you.

What sets ""The Boys"" apart is its exceptional cast. Karl Urban's portrayal of Billy Butcher is a standout performance, and Antony Starr delivers a chilling performance as Homelander. The characters are complex and well-developed, making it easy to become invested in their journeys.

With a healthy dose of dark humor and unexpected twists, ""The Boys"" keeps you entertained from start to finish. It's like Watchmen meets Breaking Bad, with a touch of sarcasm and a big middle finger to the Disney superheroes. Amazon has hit a home run with this series, and it's a must-watch for anyone craving a fresh and entertaining take on the superhero genre.

""The Boys"" proves that Amazon is capable of producing top-notch original content, and with this show, they've firmly established themselves as a contender in the streaming world. So grab your popcorn, buckle up, and prepare for a wild ride with ""The Boys."" Just remember, it's not your typical superhero show, and that's what makes it so damn good."
10.0,28 July 2019,"If you are aware of Garth Ennis you will know that the guy is a genius. The Boys is the most witty and original comics of all time and I'm delight to see so far the TV show has lived up to hype. The humour is as dark as Stieve Wonders shades, it graphic, at times gruesome, it's a crazy rollercoaster of a show.

There is nothing else like it!"
10.0,1 January 2021,It has a bold and gripping subject. It deserves the praise.
9.0,1 August 2019,That went to fast need some more! Great show. Liked the cast alot!
9.0,19 September 2019,A great take on the super hero concept. Acting is solid and the story line is interesting.
10.0,19 August 2019,"Be prepared for an epic ride into a world where the super heros are damaged, selfish and even pure evil. Where the protagonists are also flawed in a quest to uncover the truth. This is what we were all thinking watching the Avengers. One of the best shows I've seen in a long time, almost GOT good."
10.0,7 August 2019,"An absolutely amazing show - fun, gritty, violent. A wonderful twist on the super hero genre. Almost the perfect show, if only Mr Urban would stop trying to do a London accent. It is horrific. I'm from London and I'd go so far as to say at times it's worse than Dick Van Dyke. Stick to native or go American... Or get more voice coaching. He is great in this, but that accent kills every scene."
7.0,5 February 2020,"It's a good series with many actions and sub stories.

However, there are huge holes behind all and yes, it's a superhero serial, but it threats the overall credibility.

In any case is a good product."
2.0,18 July 2022,I want marvel and DC to be like this someday. 10/10 for this series. I don't know why this series is so amazing. It's just amazing and I hope they keep making series like this.
8.0,16 August 2019,I'm sure the writers are fans of the anime manga MhA. I most definitely recommend this show. Not intended for kids obviously.
10.0,10 August 2022,
8.0,30 April 2021,No need to say thousands words for praise this show. It's perfect. I finished whole seasons in one sit. Antony Starr is killing. People should give Oscar to Casting agent.
10.0,2 September 2024,
9.0,19 July 2020,"This is by far the best superhero story being told at the moment. I am a fan of some of the MCU and DCU but the stories are a bit samey and PC. They Boys take the superhero genre in a new direction and show realism that probably would happen if superheroes really existed. The acting is excellent from all, combined with the amazing special effects and the banging music this is one amazing TV show. I am so excited for season 2, as is my girlfriend who hates superhero movies, yet loves the boys. I hope season 2 is as good as the first, if the trailer is to beloved it will be."
10.0,8 August 2020,"Brilliantly original take on superheroes. Some great character development with some interesting background characters that I'm keen to see where they go in season 2. A great cast, some wonderful performances and the script at times is genius. The special effects are also excellent. I'm pretty sure it will offend some people, so if you're easily offended, don't watch it. Otherwise, enjoy quite possibly the most entertaining programme ever, certainly in the superhero's genre."
10.0,15 March 2020,"I binge watched this in two days and it is one of the best shows I have ever seen. The writing is spectacular, from the one liners being delivered outstandingly by every actors and the quick interchanges in conversation. Everything is shot really well, and some of the moments are gruesome and hard hitting. I felt an instant connection with the main characters from the get go and the show does spectacularly well at maintaining that balance throughout its course. This is a much needed change to some of the mind numbing shows out there today."
9.0,8 October 2020,
6.0,17 September 2019,"In my opinion it's all bad, tries too hard to be Watchmen. Only good about it is Karl Urban.

Poor writing, poor directing, the team are so into themselves. Pass. I find it's the worse thing on TV. Sorry I won't be convinced."
5.0,30 December 2022,"The Boys is the best show for me which can depict the real life monopolies and behind the scenes reality in any field of the Society. Our politics, religion, companies, organisations and media plays a very major role in developing the narrative about how we look the things in our real world. And knowing this, it's sad and also very good that how this tv show amazingly exposes everyone of them without creating any social issue, in the form of entertainment.

Definitely we should watch it It's for any person who is growing up in the society where every other person tries to blackmail people and tries to gain any sort of position."
10.0,22 August 2022,
9.0,1 May 2021,"If you ever wondered what it would be like to have a real superheroes like the ones we see in the movie. This show is an answer. Only unrealistic thing in this tv show is superhero powers. Those heroes you see here are not fighting for justice but for personal reasons. It is a sci-fi show that represents a REALITY as it really is.

It's like super hero tv show for adults."
10.0,16 August 2019,"Unlike anything I have Ever seen. Funny, entertaining, action, critique to society and good acting."
8.0,31 July 2019,
10.0,11 February 2021,The anti superhero's series... very well cast and extremely well filmed! The dialogue is amazing and keeps you cracking up through out. Loved how they wrote this story cheers to the writers and Director! Well done.
8.0,27 July 2019,"Would have prefer better ending, it made little emotional whole story and they Make all that emotions useless at the end,"
10.0,13 May 2024,"This is a compelling series which is well made, doesn't oppress too many political statement with strong characters. It has surprising twists and keeps you entertained.

I must however say that I often despise watching certain scenes because I completely oppose the actions of certain characters and the outcome. Not many fictional entertainment drives me to that. I must therefore say that it's not for the lighthearted or people with moral standards that have emotional difficulty separating reality from fiction. I'm still gonna have to plow through new series when they come out to hopefully finally see justice or to bury all of it in my mind and hope to one day forget I ever saw it. In all honesty, putting the emotions aside, I still have to give this high points."
9.0,4 July 2024,"I don't normally enjoy over the top gore, but this show is just too good. I see a lot of complaints about bringing in politics, but all stories reflect our own lives and world in some form. If they didn't, they wouldn't work. It's called narrative fidelity-look it up if you want to know more.

This show is commentary on superhero culture, and to do that, it HAS to incorporate reality. Homelander is based on Superman and Captain America, neither of whom are evil, but it incorporates the idea of what patriotism is in comparison to nationalism, and that's meaningful rhetoric.

So many people feel uncomfortable with the ""politics"" in this. But maybe what you're uncomfortable with is being forced to face that in real life, you're the villain. Not the hero.

Stories convey various truths. That's their job. This one does it well."
6.0,22 June 2022,Were the comics as try-hard and pathetic as S2&3? Because got damn has the quality content ever fallen off a cliff since the penultimate episode of S1.
2.0,16 July 2022,"Season 1 was very good and season 2 was decent. Season 3 is downright horrible. Weak writing, predictable, gore is about all it has... They started to go woke too and just took a near show and ruined it so fast."

10.0,27 July 2019,This is a really good show. Good characters and a complex plot to build on.
10.0,28 July 2019,Wow great film . Only so far seen E1 and E2. Best series so far this year to watch. A must watch for all super heroes fan see a different view of the super heroes been as a bad guy.
9.0,2 August 2024,"""The Boys"" is a masterclass in deconstructing the superhero genre, delivering a gritty and unapologetic take on what happens when superpowers fall into the wrong hands. The show's exploration of selfishness is compelling and multifaceted, providing a stark contrast to the idealistic portrayals of heroism typically seen in pop culture.

At the heart of ""The Boys"" is a cast of characters driven by their own self-interests. The so-called ""heroes"" of the show, The Seven, are a corrupt and self-serving group whose actions are dictated by their desires for fame, power, and wealth. This selfishness is personified in Homelander, whose terrifying blend of narcissism and megalomania creates a chilling antagonist. His lack of empathy and relentless pursuit of his own agenda underscore the dangers of unchecked power.

The show doesn't shy away from portraying the consequences of this selfishness. The collateral damage caused by these ""heroes"" serves as a brutal reminder of the human cost of their actions. This is juxtaposed with the motivations of the titular Boys, who, while flawed, are united by a desire to bring justice and accountability to the superpowered elite. Even so, their methods and motivations are often tainted by personal vendettas, highlighting the complexity of human nature.

What makes ""The Boys"" particularly engaging is its ability to balance these dark themes with sharp wit and dark humor. The show's satirical take on corporate culture, media manipulation, and celebrity worship adds depth to its critique of selfishness, making it not only a thrilling watch but also a thought-provoking one.

In summary, ""The Boys"" offers a riveting and unflinching look at selfishness in its many forms. It challenges the notion of what it means to be a hero, presenting a world where the lines between good and evil are blurred by personal ambitions and moral compromises. This makes for a show that is as intellectually stimulating as it is entertaining."
10.0,11 August 2019,"Wasted acting talent thanks to awful direction, script, and editing. This show is incredibly cheesy and not in a cute way. I love anti-hero stories such as Deadpool. I enjoy satire like Team America: World Police. But this production is just not enjoyable after giving 2 episodes a try. I really wanted to like it because of recommendations and because the plot seems promising. But this production was very poorly executed. I'm unclear why the masses on IMDB are rating this series a 9/10. But then again, there was a time when Suicide Squad was highly praised by an audience with incredibly low expectations.

If you enjoyed the 2016 Suicide Squad film, and/or The Umbrella Academy series on Netflix, this may be your cup of tea."
8.0,26 July 2019,This is just one of the original and fantastic ones ever made. Fantasy mixed with politics and all. Binge watching it.
10.0,24 June 2024,"Funny it's taking this long for right wing follows to notice they are taking the piss of right wing followers!

Homelander is pretty much trump! Loves to create chaos and has no idea what he is doing. It definitely shows how divided a country can be. Which to the rest of the world America couldn't be more divided then it is now. Which is extremely sad considering most countries did look up to them in the past.

It's definitely worth watching and I hope it continues on afterwards. Ignore all the idiots with there 1/10 reviews. They are trying to wreck are great show. If it's not for you go watch something else!"
7.0,5 July 2024,"**The Boys** is a darkly satirical take on the superhero genre that brilliantly subverts the traditional heroic narrative. The show, created by Eric Kripke and based on the comic series by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson, follows a group of vigilantes aiming to take down corrupt superheroes owned by a powerful corporation. With its sharp writing, complex characters, and unflinching commentary on power and morality, **The Boys** stands out for its audacious storytelling. The performances, particularly by Karl Urban as Billy Butcher and Antony Starr as the menacing Homelander, are exceptional. However, its graphic violence and mature themes might not be for everyone. Overall, it's a gripping, thought-provoking series that challenges conventional superhero tropes."
2.0,4 July 2022,"3rd season not as good for me, though it certainly has its moments. The characters that keep slowing it down are Hughie and Annie Highlighter, or whatever her moniker is; there is no chemistry between them, and all Hughie says to anybody is ""I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry."" I wouldn't mind seeing him get head popped."
10.0,5 October 2020,Seriously. they must have aoc writing this mess. it is unwatchable.
9.0,4 October 2020,"Yeah, no thanks. Why even bother... This is not 1990 and I'm not watching cable TV."
10.0,1 July 2022,
10.0,16 June 2024,"...but then there's The Boys. If you ran Watchmen through a meat grinder and stitched it back together using razor wire thread, the abomination that emerged would either be awful or The Boys. This show nails everything that cynics hate about the MCU, DCU, and comic book superheroes in general. From the way it dissects the narcissism that would come along with superhero status to the way it brings normal human beings to the foreground and makes you care about them more than you do the supes, everything about The Boys is high quality. The entire cast is top-notch and the writing is brutally on point, not afraid to point fingers and never pulling punches. Great show."
10.0,11 June 2022,The usual one scoring moaning reviewers yet again going on about mindless violence and gore and shock value. Yes that's what it's supposed to be. And that's why the rest of us watch it. It's great and anyone who knew anything about it wouldn't moan after watching. Get a grip.
10.0,28 July 2019,"At the peak of superhero commercialization where every studio from Marvel, over DC, Netflix Amazon Prime and others hops onto the money-train ""The Boys"" is a critical take on superhero-commercialization under the premises that superheroes actually exist.

It's a stories without heroes, everybody has their own motives and even the shining heroes of society have their own dark sides and personal issues (and God complexes) outside of the all the spotlights and glamour.

""The Boys"" is not a light-hearted superhero story for children but a philosophical, yet action packed examination of a dystopic superhero-society. Its unique premises is supported by great acting, camera work and fitting music, making ""The Boys"" arguably one the best superhero series ever made."
10.0,29 July 2019,"I was hooked after the midway point of the first episode. The Boys presents a world where superheros have gone ""corporate"". The individuals ""brand"" has become all important and public images are scripted by PR departments. Character issues are ""spun "" or covered up to remain popular with the public. The ""boys"", in one way or another have been exposed to the hypocrisy and more seriously, the corruption surrounding the ""industry"". I especially like the shades of grey between good and evil that we are presented with.This is not just another black & white superhero story I consumed and immediately forgot.

I'd like to add that I was also pleasantly surprised that Amazon Prime could deliver such quality. Quality media seems to be coming from all over the place these days, giving us consumers more variety than ever..

And...... a great season 2! It is the rare series that can follow its initial success and deliver entertainment at a high level like this. I'm hoping there is a 3rd season in our future."
9.0,28 July 2019,"I need some sleep... binging on awesome shows can be addictive.

I hadn't read the graphic novels this show is based on and as such I can't draw a direct comparison. However, its funny, gory, derivative and hard to stop watching.

While Marvel has the secret sauce for effective superhero movies, The Boys basically takes a big dump on DC and Marvel and takes joy in doing so.

The corporate angle is surprisingly logical and relevant in today's climate. Yes there are some major christian overtones but again, not surprisingly different from a big swathe of the United States.

As a big of an easter egg, if you are from Toronto or the Hamilton area, you will recognize a lot of the scenery given it's filmed here.

It has the dark tones of The Watchmen with the humor of Deadpool.

Can't wait for season 2."
7.0,5 September 2020,"This show is absolutely amazing. My wife and I got hooked immediately and binge watched the whole first season, then on the day the second season came out we watched all three released episodes, and are now dying for more. This series shows what happens when ""super heroes"" go wrong. Lose the name heroes and just call them supes, They aren't fighting aliens, gods, or beings from another dimension, they just obliterate normal people. This is an absolute must see, and will become Prime's flag ship program."
4.0,6 August 2019,"I didn't expect a show like this from Amazon. The Tick was already pretty good, but nowhere near on this level. I read the source material a couple of years ago, and all changes that were made are completely understandable. The original had very homophobic undertones and seemed to revel in sexual violence against women. Yet I liked the idea behind the comics, and this show really manages to make it work. There is still plenty of gore and adult themes, but it doesn't leave the same bad aftertaste as some of the comic books. I was particularly impressed by the quality of the special effects and the finale left me excited and impatient for more. Highly recommended for adult viewers with a strong stomach."
10.0,6 May 2022,"Having watched the beginning of season 3, I understand the three eps we were given in the first drop--so that fans at least see Jensen Ackles in action a bit.

But I wonder why the press blitz if he's just a traditional guest star as far as screen time (and not an addition to the main cast.)

The character seems pivotal, true, but I feel like Kripke has used a sort of bait & switch advertising, especially including him in this last press junket.

And that he underused a good actor who could have averaged things up a bit.

And of course like most fans, I watched the up & down quality of the first two seasons to prep.

The first season, broad frat style humor which was pretty effective if you like that style. The second, an abrupt course correction, weighted with ""messaging"" that felt false for the sudden change.

Hopefully it gets better, though professional reviewers I read (again in the press blitz--hope you like clicks) thought season 3 was messy.

Given the lack of screen time and the early reviews, I may wait and binge at the end.

Thanks for the interviews and photo spreads, however. At least they were quality stuff."
10.0,2 October 2020,
10.0,27 July 2019,Absolutely love this show wish it were more episodes
10.0,27 July 2019,"First off: If you're expecting a show you can watch with the kids, unless those kids are over 18 this ain't it.

That said, this was a pretty good show. The acting was incredible; these were well-developed characters that when combined with the acting were nicely believable, even with all of the weirdness. These are definitely also pretty examples for what would happen if supers existed in the real world, from the noblesse oblige and pure arrogance of the characters to those that were just amazed that they had powers.

Just because: Homelander was way too much fun. That guy was just pure evil. Maeve was also pretty good, as she could from jaded to sensitive; she was arguably be the best-developed character of the show. The Deep was also pretty good, especially when he was out of his depth (pun intended).

The plot twists were deserved; not only were they hard to predict but they were built up prior to their showing. Sure, there were some predictable points, but that's fine as those were based off character development; they were a natural evolution of the character in question. The real plot twists worked pretty well, up to the dreaded final reveal, although I dislike the end.

The special effects were exactly what were needed. While I would have liked to have seen more use of powers, especially in non-combat roles, overall the effects were pretty good. There's a lot of blood, digital and otherwise, but it works within the context of the show. You just don't expect to see a lot of niceness and that is definitely the case here.

There was some really nice world-building, especially as you were able to see what would happen if supers were real. You had challenges between supers, drugs for supers, and what would happen if supers got into religion. Again, while I would have liked to have seen more non-combat use (such as in construction and medicine) this was done pretty deftly.

The only other major flaw was that The 7 were an obvious pastiche of the Justice League (Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Aquaman, Dr. Light). While this allows it to make some interesting points, none of them haven't been done to death elsewhere. Even Translucent only works to show how dark the world is, and is quickly killed when the point is made.

Nonetheless, this is a pretty good show and definitely recommended. I wish it would have ended differently, but it definitely the way it should have. Definitely worth the watch."
9.0,24 July 2024,"I have seen almost all this series, I criticize it harshly as a spectator who does not swallow it whole. I see that many times they exaggerate so much bloodbath and explicit sex in scenes that can be handled in a more moderate way and one that another about acting of the seven such. I see it as a crude copy of the most popular comics, the settings are not very flashy, the costumes seem like a plagiarism of several superheroes from both MARVEL and DC, it seems taken from the eighties with a low budget and the morbid is what stands out. I see that no time was spent in pre-production on scripts.."
8.0,1 December 2020,"Good story, watchable, but way overrated I felt. The acting is dreadful. The casting director should be fired. Yes yes, the kiwi guy who can't do a British accent, but then the Israeli guy who makes a complete mess of the French dialogue. The guy playing homelander is reminiscent of low grade 1970s adult movies. It's a pity Amazon couldn't have invested more in this. Could have been so much better!"
10.0,8 May 2024,"I went into this show expecting a run-of-mill, Disney+-esque narrative, but I was pleasantly surprised now that I am on Season 3. The show delves into some very mature themes, and the way that the corporations are run in the show draws comparisons to current political issues happening in the States today! I was absolutely not expecting this from what I believed to be a traditional superhero show. Karl Urban and Anthony Starr are both masterful as well. Nothing but the highest praise for this show.

Edit: I just found out Jeffrey Dean Morgan has been added to the Season 4 cast, I can't wait to see what they have in store."
9.0,22 May 2024,"I think homelander and the butcher did an amazing job . I am no expert but i would think dark comedy is hard . The entire cast nailed it on this one . It was dark but with lighter great writing moments . Not to silly like the Thor movies but still adult and fun . I was a big fan of the banshee series as well. And most people think Hughie over acted . Not really , he did great . He played a sap . Thats what saps do . If he was annoying he did his job great. To sum it up great fun. A ten . Also , Elizabeth Shue was great . Who remembers the karate kid right ? I wanted to be homelander for a minute lol. All in all a fun show and a little different than the boring usual."
6.0,20 May 2021,"Good show. But the WOKE poison is all over the story line and characters. If you can watch it and not be annoyed by the constant reminders that straight white men bad (and Make America Great) are BAD, everyone else good... you'll enjoy The Boys. And the underlying MAGA-esque theme is nauseating. Booooring! We get it. Hollywood hates the America IS great story."

10.0,3 November 2019,"The first 4-5 episodes are truly amazing. One of the best shows of the last few years, and a really interesting take on superheroes.

However, after episode 5, the series strangely plummets into average content. Bad and redundant dialogue. Boring plot points...etc.

I guess most of the 10/10 ratings were given right after the first few episodes. It's impossible not to notice the hard change between the first and second half. And the season finale cliffhanger left me quite... indifferent.

10/10 for episodes 1 to 4. 3/10 for episodes 5 to 8"
9.0,19 September 2020,"A good show with an engaging and well-paced first season.

The weekly release schedule had plagued the second season. Unfortunately this show is not content-heavy enough to engage audiences on an episode to episode basis, however, it still deserves praise for being an entertaining take on the superhero genre.

Don't be fooled by the 1/10 ratings as fans were angered by executive decisions and also don't be fooled by the 10/10 ratings which were consequence of the divide within the fanbase. The show deserves neither. Though it is a fun experience and I recommend you give it a go!"
9.0,12 July 2024,"I've had big expectations about this show, because I thought that is going to be exactly that kind of show, in which the good guys (the superheroes) fight the bad guys (the villains) and of course, they win. I couldn't have been more wrong, especially because ""The Boys"" it's not about a desperate attempt of superheroes to save the world from evil, instead this show takes a much more realistic approach, about what is going to happen if superheroes had really existed.

I'm saying that I had big expectations in the beginning, because I thought that it would be the same usual show with superheroes and villain, that is most likely to find everywhere. In the first couple of episodes l've been a little bit disappointed, or rather shocked, because like I've already said, ""The Boys"" describes what the MCU never did. Of course, the movies and shows from Marvel are destined to other public's category, but this show is tough. It has all you could not expect from a TV series with superheroes. It has violence, gore, nudity, astonishing CGI effects and a very unpredictable and solid storyline. In the end it seems that this one delivered what I didn't expect it to and I am pleased with that. The show is definitely worth watching."

9.0,6 July 2022,"The Boys is surprisingly an amazing show, It's fun, violent, deliciously filthy, black-humored superhero genre deconstruction. What makes ""The Boys"" so special and unique is its premise based on the Comic Book it gives the unorthodox concept for Superheroes. A very well-written show with a good sense of pace along with so many boundaries pushed. Both the seasons are gripping from start to finish, despite falling into few cliches. The action sequences are wildly entertaining, effing brutal, and sufficiently gory. Dialogues are fantastic, Direction is great, Cinematography is good, BGM is brilliant.

Performances by the entire star cast are phenomenal."

A friend nagged me into watching The Boys.

So glad he did, this is absolutely brilliant, as another reviewer said 'Karl Urbans accent finds itself after a few episodes', but the story, utterly brilliant, who's the bad guys? who's the good guys? everyone?

Dark, funny, gruesome, refreshing, original."
10.0,3 November 2020,Nice series but with average script overrated series it does not have anything for which it should be given 8 or 9 rating but overall it is decent with unique story
10.0,29 June 2023,"It's a pity that precious eyes, time and soul are wasted by watching such stupid content. Violence, violence and violence by portraying the most disturbing scenes and the lack of a noble and impressive content. I respect the fans of this genre, but this series and such series will not help us and our children to build a better world and a guaranteed tomorrow. I really wanted to give this series a score higher than 2, but despite all the efforts that the production staff, director, and actors put in to make it, I think a score of 2 is much more appropriate for such a content. Thanks to imdb and The Boys series."

1.0,19 September 2019,"Never thought it could be as good as it is,I couldn't find myself bored thru out this whole show I loved it!"
10.0,27 June 2022,"Having all the super hero films and series we get these days, it is easy to get bored of the never ending array of poorly made, poorly scripted and cgi reliant dullness that pours out of studios.

For those of you that feel like me, The Boys is the perfect antidote to that. It's extremely dark, violent, funny and manages to highlight everything wrong with society, while not pushing it in your face.

The casting is great and the story keeps you engaged, this for me was mostly down to the fact I actually cared about the characters. Through season 1, the development is huge and that sets up what was a fantastic ' no holes barred ' season 2.

If you haven't, give it a try. You won't be disappointed!"
10.0,7 October 2020,"If you want to see exactly how a TV show mirrors the life that you live in - that shows humanities greatest flaws and strength, watch this show.. The supes in the show is just a metaphor. Those with absolute power corrupts absolutely, you don't need a superhero to understand that."
10.0,3 October 2020,
9.0,20 August 2020,"I like the realism, the concept, but there is way too much talking and not actual action. It's mainly a drama. I didn't care much for the romance either, a tad too boring. The main two conflicts of our two protagonists are okay. The main villain is brilliant. It has some comic moments but not really great comedy as a whole. I would say there are some very shocking and original scenes, some hilarious, some outrageous. It's not really that dark of an atmosphere. Has highs but i thought most of it was just okay. I also really thought the badassery was missing from the boys and we just don't see enough of it from the supes."
10.0,13 October 2020,"I was really excited for this season, given how good the last one was. This one had good action and humor. The many exploding/smashed heads throughout were entertaining. The acting was overall quite excellent.

They lost me when the the episodes started increasingly cramming down your throat the ideology of CNN and MSNBC (conservatives = evil racists). An example is the writers taking an idea like having a secure border and tying it in with nazism. Moronic, false narratives clearly coming from writers with their own political agenda to spout. Not what I'm interested in when it comes to entertainment from film or television.

As much as I was into the season, it got to the point at about episode 6 where I just couldn't finish the series. Season 3 definitely won't be happening for me."
9.0,6 May 2020,"One of the greatest series I've ever seen. Shows the idea of the superheroes as being a bad person in other's eyes very brilliantly. The comic-to-screen, was superbly presented. Acting was top quality. Effects are all out insane. Story is captivating. I see this show continuing for a while"
10.0,9 October 2020,Just when you think the show cant get any more violent or messed up suddenly something happens that's exceeds expectation. Cant fault it
10.0,26 June 2022,"Its 2020 we've been broadcasting television for 100 years and the boys offers a new perspective of an established genre, new concepts,new stories and new humour all while pushing the boundaries of what theyre allowed to do. The boys should be the next star trek with an entire universe of artistic ideas to break down boundaries and prove that MA rated television can bring in the ratings with unlimited story writing potential."
7.0,26 June 2022,"Such a refreshing break from all the superheroes we are getting sick of. This is not your usual superhero shoe and definitely not for kids but man it's so good. Characterisation is amazing, screenplay is binding. You want to se more and more. With each season it becomes better. Keep'em coming."
1.0,28 July 2019,This can serve as two different things the first being a justice league spoof with a dark twist and the other being an actual reality that would occur if super heroes were to actually exist
10.0,22 June 2022,"I mean i feel Amazon did us a great service by service by bringing us The Boys, i mean just the fact that it's not your regular superhero tv show even makes it more fun to watch. Superheroes tend to leave lots of destruction in their wake and most of the time we barely see the aftermath of their actions let alone take responsibility for their actions, no one holds them accountable and innocent civilians are left to suffer, after all it's meant to protect them. Such hogwash. I can't say for a fact that i've seen homelander in most movies or tv shows but his performance is top tier. Kudos to Amazon and the entire cast as well as production team!"
10.0,29 September 2020,"Absolutely brilliant. The Concept, the momento, the plot, the acting and the emotional journey The Boys will take you on. You begin to hate the bad guys with a passion and love the good guys and root for them to win."
10.0,16 June 2022,"Brilliant series. Good juxtaposition against Marvel and DC. Just find it jarring that Billy Butcher accent is all over the place and definably not English. Is his accent what the American producers think we speak like in England, Ant wait for series 4."
8.0,10 October 2020,"Just finished watching Season 2 and can confidently say that it was the best ""superhero"" themed cinema since Dark Knight, better than whole MCU. Not because it's funnier but because it's more relevant. In fact, ""superhero"" aspect is secondary to excellent satire of both American/western sugar-coating ""right-wing"" and virtue-signalling ""left-wing"", as well as their beloved neo-feudal corporatocracy. The only thing that I find silly and misguided is portrayal of corporatist media as an actual neutral party instead of the collection of propagandist oligarchical mouthpieces and memetic trend fire-fanning opportunists that it is.

I also quite enjoyed Butcher's ""British"" accent that so many Brits seem to despise for its ""fakeness"", yet have no problem with ceaseless mockery of ""accents"" for every other language, such as joke of a ""Russian"" accent from Season 2.

This is how we in non-western world see America/NATO/OECD and hear British."
9.0,2 July 2024,"Not really the ""solution"" to Marvel/DC if it's just as shallow of commentary on the world like modern Marvel is. It literally just swaps a couple names and inserts some Gen-X understanding of political stereo types to sound hip. ""Alt- supe"" ... ""Supe-lives matter"".

Get real. A little gore and high stakes are fine. This is an edgy rehash of lame modern politics and bad parodies of regular super heroes. For every heavy, well-acted moment, it's ruined by forced comedy like a Marvel flick and stupid moves by villains that forget they have powers when it matters to prolong the the bad-planning of the tension. The show ""Invincible"" has a similar problem.

Season 1 is pretty good, but season 2 and season 3 have a lot of cringe with even more edge, bad fights, and bad writing. It's a show that's good for memes, because even the fights are almost CW-tier. Two people on par with Wonder Woman and Superman fighting in an office are gonna do more than just dent some cabinets and break dry wall. Or if a car full of people is blown up and crashes to the ground, someone is going to be dead, not just walk away. If you're gonna be a $200 million budget show, at least make fights look decent."
9.0,26 June 2022,"This is definitely a show that some scenes you just can't un see!

It's violent, lots of profanity, scenes that just go way over the top and the action is tense.

After all the marvel and D. C. this is just what you need to ramp it up. If your a fan of these then this is definitely not for you.

Brilliant, the writers are not afraid to go that extra mile!"

10.0,5 July 2022,"I've always loved superhero movies and shows, but this one just takes the absolute top for me. It's like the Avengers but satirical and on steroids and not only focused on the ""heroes"".

All of the actors in the show are incredible and so talented. I sometimes get so into it that I forget that I'm watching a tv-show. I'm currently on my fourth rewatch since I got a dear friend into it, and I could easily rewatch it more times.

I would give it a 11/10 if I could."
8.0,24 June 2022,"This show is absolutely phenomenal in the way that it tells a story. It feels like an extreme amount of creative effort & care has gone into the making of this show.

It has an extremely interesting premise which it explores thoroughly with care, every scene feels like it's contributing to something important, no moments feel wasted.

Each character has such a beautiful personal story going on within the fictional world & all of these little isolated story arcs are eventually tying back into help smoothly further the main storyline which always ends up going somewhere extremely interesting.

I think the entire film industry should be taking notes from the people who are making this show happen & I think this show deserves to be winning some god damn awards!"

10.0,4 October 2020,Season 1 was great. Entertaining and something new. Season 2 gradually went downhill becoming woke propaganda. Wish Hollywood would learn. Tired of great shows that push the bounds going back up the same old worn out narratives.
10.0,18 June 2022,"A great series which reflects so much of modern society, celebrity, mass media, REALITY TV, advertising and the oligarchies which are modern democracies. However, I have never heard such a poor cliché version of a cockney accent. I do realise so much of this is tongue in cheek and indeed very funny but each and every line from Karl Urban as Billy Butcher just isn't. Shame as it really does let the whole series down."
8.0,25 September 2020,This is a beautiful blend of cinematography and story. Explores so many contemporary issues and is so funny and engaging.
9.0,1 July 2022,"The Boys is engaging, chaotic, and rampant with gross out tongue-in-cheek humor that only makes you want to continue watching more.

It manages to parody or deconstruct the idea behind superheroes better than the original source material that often drifted into unnecessary edginess for the sake of it.

Everyone of the cast shines in their roles, especially Anthony Starr and Karl Urban who manage to bring their respective characters to life which can be pretty disturbing at times.

Funny, well written, horrifying, and exciting are all words that come to mind when watching The Boys.

I highly recommend it. 👍"
6.0,30 September 2020,"This show is the best thing on tv right now. It's unexpected, moves quickly, and best of all, unpredictable. If you're kind of a control freak and like to think you understand the overall goal of a show, then this show isn't for you. If you like shows that lead without letting you know the direction you're following, you'll like this show."
9.0,4 June 2022,"It's vile , bizarre , disgusting, outrageous, unpredictable and other adjectives such has those mentioned and I

ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.

It's fresh and definitely original and not for the easily triggered even after 3 seasons it can still make me clutch my pearls ( so to speak) and breathe in deeply."
10.0,8 June 2021,"This show is super cool in premise. In reality it's gore more gore, sex and more sex, gross and more gross. I guess that's what people want.

It could have been just as good without all that. Who am I? Right? God Bless America."
9.0,22 June 2022,"The boys is the best series about Superheroes of the 2020s. When others like marvel, dc is going woke, The boys and Invincible gave me hope again. They focus on the story, the philosophy problems of people with greater power. There is something that we really have to concern about, you know. Marvel has failed me, but this gave me hope again."
10.0,4 October 2020,"Like everyone else has mentioned this season is released weekly for some stupid reason. However, what I haven't seen mentioned, too much, is the straight up decline in quality this season. The Characters are flat, one dimensional and predictable. The story is meandering on as they introduce a new character, plot point, or idea only for it to be rendered a unimportant in the same episode or the next. It's obvious they are going to try to milk this show for everything. But most disappointing is the use of vulgarity, violence or gore for no reason. The first season was a smart subversive take on superheros but this season has become like a modern comedy trying to be as outrageous as possible to make people laugh with no real thought or wit to it. I guess I should have known since the comics quickly had similar problems as well. Modern Movies and television just seem to lack the creativity and soul of old. I don't think I will watch any further as it seems to be a complete waste of time."
10.0,8 July 2022,This series is done so well it just leaves you wanting more. The characters drive the plot and they all have meaning. The actions scenes are well done and the story engaging.

10.0,6 September 2020,"Absolutely baffles me how this doesn't get as much hype as any other Tv show going on in the world, right from the beginning your gripped and you can't stop watching it. Shame they couldn't bring the whole of the second season out at once but never mind. Definitely a watch you won't be disappointed by."
8.0,26 July 2024,"Well...it was bound to happen. This season ending, that kept a lot of open plot lines for the last season of this Anti-Heroes masterpiece of a series. It was a sick, disgusting and intensive joyride on one of the most hard-core contents that the small screen can offer his viewers. I couldn't wait for each and every episode and yes...they did it one more time.

It was a season of learning the characters' arc and set them for one word: ""forgiveness"". Each and every one of the characters got her own depth, for the sake of getting a better view of the wider picture. Sometime it went just great and sometime not so much, but the show didn't derail from its course, not even once and got us into the road to our own actual hell.

The Trumpism is getting its head high in this show and you can see that Eric Kripke got his targets ready to ram into Trump's ass. No matter what is your political stand is, you can still understand that what you see in this show might be what, someday, everybody will get, from this side of the other.

The show is still written remarkably and almost flawless, the acting and gore got to all kinds of next levels and this show will always make the maximum efforts to make you sick to your stomach, just to make sure that you are not losing any interest in it, due to the content. It has a lot to say about each one of its characters and also to add some more.

It has The Boys that are leaderless and sometime torn apart between the need to do what's right against doing what they actually want - each and every character get to say something meaningful for several occasions, during several episodes, but they sometime pale...when talking about the gang, which awaits on the other side.

The gang is led by the best villain in any superhero cinematic universe and a villain that seems like he is trying to breaks his own glass ceiling, but manages to stay in his safe place. In this season Homelander is discovering that he is aging, he is hurt from the people who did him wrong when growing and faces two characters that doesn't dance to his tunes, not all the time...and both are doubting him seriously.

All will lead to the final season (and probably to another ""Gen V"" season in between) which pull the curtain on one of the best TV shows that television had to offer for last decade or something from this scale. When the world of superheroes slowly going into oblivion and getting very tired from itself, this is the only show that justifies the remining of superheroes days of glory."
7.0,19 June 2022,"This series feels super cool in real voice than dub.

So i recommend to watch this series in real voice And not in dub.

Also, the acting in this series is fabulous especially of homelander and how he frequently changes his expressions and also butcher is also super cool guy who always thinks of possible outcomes(THIS IS WHAT I THOUGHT)and both these guys are fabulous.

Overall i want to say that WATCH THIS NOW IT IS A COOL SERIES which makes fun of all agendas."

10.0,28 July 2019,"I started off only intending to watch a couple of episodes to access how good the show was. Five episodes later I found myself unable to stop watching! This show grabs your attention within the first 10 min, and never stops. The characters have depth and separate voices, and the plot is intricate, but not convoluted! This is the Justice league for adults This is what we pray for when we look at a new program. I can only hope the finish is as promising as the beginning! Thanks and more please!!!!"
10.0,17 September 2024,"The Boys is a dark and satirical take on the superhero genre that stands out for its subversive approach and gritty storytelling. Set in a world where superheroes are corrupt celebrities controlled by powerful corporations, the series explores themes of power, morality, and vengeance with a raw and unapologetic edge.

Storyline and Characters The plot centers on a group of vigilantes known as ""The Boys,"" led by Billy Butcher, who seek to expose and take down corrupt superheroes who abuse their powers. The series balances intense action with sharp social commentary, presenting a cynical view of heroism and the consequences of unchecked power.

The cast delivers exceptional performances, particularly Karl Urban as the relentless Billy Butcher and Antony Starr as the sinister Homelander. The character development is deep and complex, with each member of the cast bringing unique depth to their roles, whether they are a hero or a villain.

Direction and Production The direction is bold and fearless, with the series pushing boundaries in both its narrative and visuals. The dark humor and graphic content are used effectively to enhance the story's impact and highlight the absurdities of a superhero-centric society. The production values are high, with impressive special effects and well-choreographed action sequences.

Final Thoughts The Boys offers a fresh and provocative take on the superhero genre, combining intense drama, biting satire, and a critical look at fame and power. It's a gripping watch for those who enjoy a darker, more cynical twist on traditional superhero stories."
10.0,20 July 2024,"The Boys used to be an awesome show. It came out at the right time when the world was completely oversaturated with the superhero movies. First two seasons were great and full of entertainment. Can't say the same for the next two seasons. Story is going nowhere. Season four is a complete disaster. If they focus more on the plot and characters rather than politics they could have saved the series going down the drain but its too late now. Nothing good can come after this dumpster fire season four. The stage was set after the first couple of seasons but it all went downhill so fast, it's a shame."
10.0,4 June 2022,"His Supernatural days brought a whole new level to the ways a body can be folded, spindled and mutilated, not to mention how much tissue & blood can be spewed about but The Boys on Amazon has given him the ultimate unfettered platform with which to go take it to the limit and beyond because now sexual depravity can be added to the mix. Personally, I could well do without that and some of the over the top blood and guts. Being a senior citizen who has always enjoyed well done good vs evil stories I was intrigued by this show because I thoroughly enjoyed Supernatural as well as other superhero shows and could watch them with my grandchildren but this show, that's not possible. Anyway, I gave this show a 6 because it does move along, the acting/characters are watchable & I'm also looking forward to seeing Jensen Ackles again. (""Eye candy"" isn't just for young people, lol) However the occasional ""woke"" politics being thrown in is annoying and tedious & the blatant hedonism is off putting to say the least. How I long for the days when we could just be ""entertained"" and not ""indoctrinated""."
9.0,4 June 2022,Love everything about the series. Clean crisp acting with drama and comedy mixed in. I am sure Ken and Karen will be disappointed but this is the best woke series to date and hopefully many more years to come! Thanks.
9.0,5 June 2022,"There is nothing more irritating than seeing perfection unfold on your tv screen, because then there is nothing to critique!

This show has surpassed any and all SUPERHERO shows by light years. It is gritty, dark and blood fantastic to watch Ego-manical Super heroes get crushed!

Really like Ms. Maisel and Sneaky Pete but I think this show has really showed me that amazon is really in the game now. The production quality was some of the best I've seen. The acting was A-list and I loved the story. Some people think it doesn't have a lot to say about our culture but I would strongly disagree. I think this show is a extremely well-done absurd satire on what superhero's would probably be in our product centric culture. Really glad amazon had the balls to do this right and not water it down.
10.0,28 July 2019,"Really good, twisted, unorthodox... Though sometime predictable. Can't wait for 2nd season."
9.0,14 August 2022,Totally Thrilling action scene and story telling just falling love with the boys series. The story between homelander and willy just loved it woah just like Deadpool vibess.
9.0,5 September 2020,"This must have been so liberating for the writers. Oddly enough it transfers directly to us, the audience. Just when superhero movies and such seem to have run their course, this series is willing to step back and take another look at the basic elements, super powered people involved with ordinary people. In a lot of ways, this is core philosophical stuff and I very much appreciate the lighthearted way this program explores the issue."
10.0,29 May 2020,Very good entertaining show that puts a spin on the whole super hero genre. Look forward to Season 2.
10.0,19 September 2020,"The Boys hide somewhere talking about how screwed they are. Meanwhile Homelander descends into creepy madness somewhere else. End on a predicable cliff hanger.

Rinse repeat every friday.

Don't say I didn't warn you."

9.0,7 September 2020,"You know you are in the presence of a great series when you browse through the reviews and you have quite a few very low critics by both ultra conservatives and ultra liberals disgruntled the series hurt their feelings.

The series is top notch (granted I don't know the comics, so I'm not establishing any comparison to the original material here). Great acting all around, specially from Butcher (that guy is perfect for the role). Great story with a lot of nuance. Courageous writing in this day and age.

Minor down. Homelander could take a few more episodes to reveal his true character, the surprise would be welcome."

2.0,8 October 2022,"I would give it a solid 10/10. It was a really good show and it became even better as the seasons progressed on. Season 3 was the epitome of it. Soldier boy was an amazing character and the actors pretty much did a brilliant job overall. Must watch show for anyone and I would totally recommend it.

9.0,22 July 2020,"Legion still holds my top spot but The Boys comes in at a close second place. It's dark and gritty and yet still borderline goofy in places but that goofiness wears of when you realize how terrifying it would be to have these powered individuals living among us, particularly Homelander who comes off as an obnoxious, spoiled child but that's what makes the idea of him so scary, an individual with immense power who is just as emotionally unstable as all the rest of us. This was the first I have seen of Dennis Quaid's kid but he's quite good in it and so is everyone else. I'm eagerly awaiting season 2 to see if they can keep a good thing going or possibly even top what they've already done.... and perhaps just to watch Elisabeth Shue defy age for yet another year!"
10.0,27 July 2022,"Before i began to watch , i was thinking it's just another super hero verse, specially seemed to be parody of the Avengers and JL, something like watchemen, but, i just found it's something absolutely different, grabbed my attention just at the begging of the first episode, unlike many other successful tv shows that takes several episodes to make you interested, of cours so addictive and never boring up to now. Very unique in depiction of untold facts of today's world. Wonderful scenarios, so realistic psychological character details."
10.0,23 May 2020,"Really good. Good characters, good plot, humorous, engaging. Very enjoyable."
8.0,30 July 2019,"Great show, highly recommend it. Also Karl Urban is awesome in nearly everything he does, and most of the cast, do an extraordinary performance. The baby laser scene is campy, in the preview, but so worth it, in the finished scene."
10.0,22 September 2020,"Over eight episodes, ""The Boys"" offers plenty of surprises. Some come through unexpected and exaggerated bloodshed - which, considering the regular rollout of graphic violence, it's a credit to the writing and editing teams that so many of these moments are still shocking - while others are rooted in well-orchestrated plot twists. Season 2 gives casual fans plenty of entertainment value, even if the episodes run long, as well as plenty to chew on during the downtime; if you thought Season 1 did a good job twisting Homelander's pristine red, white, and blue image into a knotty mess better fit for our current administration, just wait til you see what he comes to represent this year. Rarely has ""the American way"" been stripped so thoroughly of its historic infallibility, and rarely have those who demand unquestioning loyalty to the flag been so justly put in their place.

Yet an expanded critique doesn't keep ""The Boys"" from stumbling into past mistakes. One of the nagging issues with Season 1 was that both its main characters were given purpose by the untimely deaths of their wives. Hughie and Butcher both lost their partners, and it pushed them to join and form this titular team. While last year's finale made the effort to reverse half of that issue - revealing Becca (Shantel VanSanten) is alive, as is the son she had after Homelander raped her - Season 2 somehow sees more of the same problem. ""Fridging"" is a term that first gained infamy in comic book circles, and its growing notoriety led Kripke to say he wanted to specifically avoid killing off supporting female characters in order to motivate men. To say who, when, or how many times he breaks that intention would be spoiling things, but it's prominent enough to put a cloud over a few razor-sharp feminist speeches.

""The Boys"" is still an imperfect beast, but it gets so many parts right - I haven't even talked about the skilled stunt work or expertly staged action scenes - that you're likely to get caught up in its gorging satire. Performances, moments, and specific lines will sneak up and level you. And most of the time, it's when you're in need of a good leveling."
8.0,28 July 2019,"I read the graphic novels back in 2006-2012, own all 12 books. It blew my mind then and I have a strong feeling the series will do the same. The TV series is flowing large parts of the graphic novel whilst twisting in modern day issues and ideology. I am so glad that they have managed to get Simon Pegg in the series, made me so happy! It's a shame he isn't the Scottish Hughie but he is there.

The thing is the reviewers who havent read the graphic novels have no idea how the story is brilliantly fu*ked up and definitely changes the idea of what 'superheroes' have been depicted to be. Changing the narrative to self serving, egotistical megalomaniacs with humankind being the last thought on their minds. It gives the 'superheroes' a human touch in relation to the 7 deadly sins.

All I have to say is... OMG watch it. It's amazing but make sure you read inbetween the lines and figure out this huge political statement it is making. Get the graphic novels too 😉 as I don't think they are 100% following it just aspects which is amazing!"
10.0,29 July 2019,Turning the superhero genre on its head absolutely loved it!
10.0,22 July 2022,"I have been watching the show since it premiered in 2019 and have been following the show since. I liked the tone of the show and liked how the show held nothing back showing gruesome and dark scenes that can hit so many emotions for different people.

It's a complete contrast to our modern superhero films in which they are safely digestible and full of light-hearted humor.

So when I say that this season has some of the most disgusting and funny scenes I mean it. I love that the show tackles what people and celebrities would do if they had real superpowers. And I also like how the characters are played, deeply flawed and relatable(Aside from the superpowers of course)

if you liked the last two seasons you'll like this one as well. Don't jump into this season fresh though watch the other two seasons so that you'll be caught up on everything that has happened up to this point."
7.0,28 December 2020,"One of the best shows of all times! Smart and deep writing, unexpected, great acting and direction! 🔝🔝🔝"
2.0,8 September 2020,"Apart from some dull moments, it's an awesome series. Sometimes the plot becomes too slow for my liking but overall well executed graphics and plotline."
10.0,31 July 2022,"The Boys is a deeply, profoundly fresh take on the superhero genre... because the superheroes may be the real bad guys. That sounds simple enough, but the execution of the series gives us a story worth experiencing, because everything is turned upside down into the absurd.

Alongside that other show that casts doubt on superheroism - The Umbrella Academy - The Boys operates in a unique space in today's cinematic world: taking a real big and seasons-long piss on all the super-nonsense out there. And as if it means nothing, it waves it's magic hands on societal issues just as easily, being painfully dismissive at all those stupid people swept away by today's politics.

Yet even if I offended you just now, forget about me, this show is worth the watch. It's visceral, funny, endearing and right on the money. It's also, fair warning, extremely bloody. Yet the gore serves a purpose: making us laugh at loud. The blood is so absurd at times, it just becomes too funny.

Man, did we need this show. And the actors and actresses know it: they play with utter glee, enjoying the fact they are messing with the audiences' heads. Heads that in the show, play quite the prominent and explosive role. In its vileness, it's the breath of fresh air we did not know we wanted.

If you can stomach the gore, you're In for a treat."
9.0,30 July 2019,Since there are so many superhero series people of all ages with powers. So thinking this would be the run of the mill series like all the others was I wrong. At the beginning you realise this wasn't the case. Never has a series just left me stunned in a good way. I would think gosh did they really do that. Plus there was moments I couldn't stop laughing because it just keeps surprising me. One thing this is not viewing for kids. Way too violent for them. Cannot wait for season 2.
10.0,18 July 2022,"Just finished watching the first three seasons. Took me a month and that may not be the ideal way to view this as there is soooo much going all the time one becomes a bit numb to it all after a while. I do not like superhero movies very much anymore so this more ""realistic"" take on what superheroes might really be like is refreshing, an odd word for something as violent, gory, sexual and downright bonkers as this. There has never been a TV series remotely as outlandish as this one with truly incredible special effects and many far, far from kid worthy. I can't really pick out one cast member as being better than another, but a slight majority of this rests on the shoulders of Karl Urban, Jack Quaid & Antony Starr and they are just an example of a superlative cast. Starr's character is clearly based on the Trump phenomenon and the character is hilarious, pitiful and awful. There is so much here it's impossible to even know what to write about, but suffice to say if you want to see something totally original and you are not squeamish or easily offended, nor too young, this is a must, but you might want to take your time. There was so much to absorb in those four weeks that I was glad when it ended."
10.0,5 August 2022,"It's funny, it's well written, casting is great, and it's interesting. This could be seen as an extension of Watchmen in the modern corporate environment. It's more of a sequel to Watchmen than the new Watchmen show HBO put out, only much more funny than Alan Moore's preference for edgy.

That said, my rating and review are for season 1 only. After season 1 this show goes right down into the gutter of identity politics and becomes very unfunny or interesting."
10.0,8 July 2022,Characters make choices that don't make sense. They realize that homelanders so. Will be more powerful. Don't they. Started of so promising. But. At this point. I'm giving it a 4. Garbage writing has taken over. This show is a perfect example of what happens when it stays too long. Such as Lost. It's obvious the writers are trying to compare this to people in the real world. And. I just saw an interview where the creator stated that. Saying that Homelander is his version of trump. Why. I watch shows to escape reality and not be fed it. I am so tired of crap like this. As far as the more and sex. That is to detract everyone from the horrible writing. Season three accomplished nothing. Prove me wrong. It is sad how bad this show got. And. How quickly it got so bad. Absolute trash at this point. They keep adding characters to detract from the fact that this show is going nowhere. Plain stupid.
10.0,7 August 2019,"If you are tired of the super hero genre that has been stretched to Infinity (pun intended), then this one is a breathe of fresh air. If super heros really existed, this version depicted here will be far more accurate than the altruist demi god we are use to see. Corporates and marketing would step in big time. I binged this over 3 days and i have no regrets. Watch this."
10.0,30 July 2019,Amazing and hilarious. This is the best show I've seen in a long time. Also better than most marvel movies. Just my opinion :) Can't wait for season 2.
10.0,19 September 2021,"The best superhero show out there. It's a realistic and refreshing take on superheros, but also idealization of people in general and corporate virtue signalling. The very first episode already hits like a train. From then on, it's an exciting and addictive ride. Only downside is that you will never see Marvel, DC and co with the same (innocent) eyes again."
7.0,16 August 2022,"This is one show that combines an excellent story line, high budget effects plus unforgivable gore and makes it all work together so perfectly.

Just finished season 2 and can't wait to see what season 3 will unfold."
1.0,23 July 2022,"I love the idea about this series , usually superhero's in all movies and series are shown to us as a good justice seeking people, this series show to us what if these superheroes were as bad as the worst criminals it shows us the other point of view of how superheroes could be a bad thing."
10.0,29 July 2019,I think this is one of the best shows I've seen in a few years. I became hooked pretty instantly and watched it within a couple of days. The characters all have an interesting story and the special effects are great.
10.0,23 March 2023,"The boys is one of the best super hero shows to come out in recent years.

The show delivers some of the cleverest critics of the modern reality of the entertainment industry, and everything surrounding it.

The characters are super fun and likable, each one with there own past and motives, all done exceptionally well by the actors.

Talking about the actors, we have to talk about Antony Starr, who absolutely steals the show as Homelander, and is able to execute all the little details and intricacies of the character perfectly.

I haven't finished the show, but I am still very confident that the show wont mess up the 3rd season.

Highly recommend to check out the show, just make sure your stomach is ready because this show can get really gory."
10.0,20 January 2023,"My favorite character is butcher o man what a amazing perform by karl urban his face expression and soldier boy and homelander and butcher fight sequel truly is masterpiece I truly loved it I more wanted to seem tham in upcoming season everything in this show is amazing story, cgi, acting, action, and brutality and i wanted queen mave in upcoming season his performance is really amazing every episode of this show is great my favorite episode is Herogsam not for that 😂😂 for fight sequel in last in season 3 character development of every character is really good I really excited to seem the boys to kill many more superheroes in season 4."

10.0,1 September 2020,"I remember someone suggesting me this show quite a few months ago and its just now that i've binge watch season 1. Overall this show is amazing and came out better than i expected it to be, an anti superhero show which is quite unique and opposing the traditional super hero movies with a great story line and narratives. P.S. cant wait for the next season coming out day after tomorrow! 🔥"
9.0,28 June 2022,"The Boys is something very rare. A program that is entirely its own. Sure, it takes advantage of the current love of super hero based stories, but it has its own unique twist on the norm.

The Boys is gritty, dark, exciting, and packed with action but still finds room for a sense of humor in its story and characters. Sometimes the visuals and grit go a bit too far but that is just a part of its uniqueness.

The only negative I have regarding the series is that they never give the audience enough episodes per season although what you get in each episode supports the concept of quality over quantity.

Definitely NOT for a young audience, The Boys always delivers for fans of action and/or super heroes."
10.0,28 July 2019,"Blood, violence and vengeance. Brutal TV show adaptation of the comic with great acting. One of the must see of the summer... You won't regret it!"
7.0,13 October 2020,"Anthony Starr is an under the radar actor who's really exceptional. Whether is dual roles in his first series in New Zealand, the anti-hero in Banshee, or the Narcissist superhero Homelander, he's always exceptional. Can't wait for season 3."
3.0,7 September 2020,"The best tv series atm. Season 1 was brilliant Season 2 better visuals, obviously more money has went into it but the story isn't that interesting so far. But I'm only a few episodes in and if I remember correctly season 1 took a few episodes to get going. So far season 1 9/10 season 2 7/10"
10.0,14 February 2021,"This show simply does not have a dull moment.casting team deserves an applause for bringing on some great talent under one roof.Character build up is so smooth,dialogues are very well written,background music is commendable, backed up by some superb performances.Deserves to be binge watched over and over again."
10.0,26 August 2023,"After each episode in Season 1, I was like that was fine I guess I'll keep watching, but by the end of Season 3, I was hungry for more.

I'm not really into superhero movies and shows, so the only reason I check any of them out is if they promise to be different from all the standard cookie-cutter MCU movies.

The Boys promised something different, something that subverted all the tired tropes. And Season 1 delivered that. It was as advertised.

But just subverting superhero tropes is not enough to keep me engaged. Anticipating something to be different and then seeing that it is different is almost like getting just what you expected, and where is the fun in that? So like I said, I was barely hanging on through Season 1, but the season finale left off in a rather interesting place, so I figured I'd check out Season 2. And here's where things start to get good.

Season 1 spends its time subverting all the superhero tropes and giving you some good laughs and shock from them, while subtly touching on some larger issues. But then Season 2 delves deeper into the stark reality and consequences of those Season 1 issues, so that what first seems like just taking the piss out of superhero tropes, soon becomes something way more complex and layered than merely poking fun at superheroes.

Through Season 2 and 3 the underlying themes take center stage as the story shines a light on something far more terrifying and seemingly more inescapable than evil superheroes. And this is the heart of the show - the reason why it's a must watch. Not because it's a show about superheroes, but because it isn't a show about superheroes at all. It's a show about something else entirely. A very real danger that threatens all of us. A threat that hopefully will be dealt with very soon..."
10.0,28 July 2019,"Brilliant series, very well done, great acting and shows what life could be like with real life super beings that range from being ar*eh*les to almost sociopaths that maybe started out good but egos, corporate greed and knowing they are almost invincible going to their heads. And why wouldn't it in some respects? Best super hero series I've seen to date. Keep them coming like this please!"
9.0,26 July 2019,"An interesting ""Watchmen"" knock off with a well-rounded plot that substitutes gratuitous gore in place of tangible human emotion."
10.0,16 September 2020,"While season 1 was ok its not until you watch season 2 you realise...this show is like any American tv drama such as desperate housewives or sex in the city...only has more Fbombs and spandex!

Ffs, its just boring man."
9.0,22 May 2020,"If there really were superheroes, this series would depict them perfectly. Marketing would definitely be the norm. The cinematography is outstanding and unlike mainstream tv, the soundtrack actually fits the scenes and doesn't drown out the actors dialogue. Speaking of the actors, there were some outstanding performances by Moriarty, Urban, Shue and Alonso. I wasn't all that impressed with Allen or Usher, but the rest were good to great. The directing was spot on. Don't be frightened off by the maturity ratings. I didn't find anything all that offensive. I've had worse things said to me by thirteen year olds, and the nudity seemed to consist of men's butts and women's bare backs. Give it a go."
10.0,6 August 2019,"This show is awesome!!!!!! Reminds me of the comic ""Powers"", only on episode 3 and already stuck!"
10.0,25 July 2020,"I guess this is the best superheroes series have i ever watched. this was so different from any of other film or series that I have ever seen, but this was the best. finished it in one watch. the storyline is so good and amazing, casting is good, actually really good. but why the hell the picture was so dark like the hell was going on there i can't even see there faces properly evrn on full brightness on phone. that was really frustrating. other than that i really loved it"
6.0,22 August 2022,"When I first watched this show I described it to others as what would really happen if superheroes existed. However Butcher using a laser eyed baby as a weapon takes away from the realism just a bit.

Great show which is satirical and pokes fun at not only the superhero genre but also includes takes on important sociopolitical issues. It's extremely bizarre, fully self aware and insanely messed up, but keeps you absolutely hooked into the world of Vought and the Boys. Antony Starr deserves all of the praise for his fantastic portrayal of one of the most well written villains out there.

Crazy gory and at times hard to watch, but it definitely keeps you on your toes because it's not predictable or like other shows that revolve around superheroes.

The first season worked as a relatively contained story and might be the best season. Two and three keep managing to up the stakes but that's what makes it lose its grounding a little bit. It will be a tough task to contain it again for season 4.

Definitely one of the most interesting shows out there and a worthy addition to the otherwise oversaturated supe genre."

10.0,16 March 2023,"Well what can I say... wow.

This has to be one of my favourite all time series'. It never fails to surprise me and what's better than a series about corrupt superheroes and a vigilante group of the most diabolically funny people ever.

It is not a spoof, it is genuinely well thought out, well presented and most of all it is unpredictable. Not once have I been bored or guessed where it was going to go, I can't praise this series enough and don't worry I won't spoil it for you. Give it a watch and you will see what I mean, the best bit is that they have created such a good plot that your favourite characters won't even be the ones you are rooting for."

9.0,29 July 2019,
8.0,12 May 2024,"At its heart this show wants to be Watchmen, the controversial movie helmed by Zack Snyder. But instead of leaning into the heroism aspect of that movie, or the conflicting morality of what heroes can do vs what they should do, this series pushes the boundaries on social metaphors and asks the question: what if super-powered individuals were morally corrupt test tube experiments? The plot delves deeply into those queries, and embraces the horrific things superhuman people can do when they're not held accountable.

While season one had some good things going for it, there are enough disgusting visuals and plot points to drag it down. I'm a Karl Urban fan, and Quaid is excellent in his role. But the depravity of the ""supers"" is beyond the pale. The Aquaman placeholder is a serial rapist. The Superman wannabe is a serial killer and engages in stuff that no one should have to look at.

I've got a family member that liked this show (at least season one) and even he had to admit that the gross out deaths (that get amped up in season two) and the oppressive sexual perversion stuff was over the top.

It's a sad statement of our times (or at least who rates stuff on this site) how many people rate this a nine or a ten. How can anyone watch this stuff and not feel disgusted? I don't care that it's supposedly drenched in satirical metaphor. It's just gross.

I can't believe there are so many reviews rating this muck a 9 or a 10. That is crazy sad.

I weep for humanity."
10.0,29 July 2019,This show is not like any other superhero film/show. This is an amazing break from the marvel movies (which I am a huge fan of). It gives a great perspective on a different side of superhero's that we are not used to. I would highly recommend this show.
10.0,7 August 2019,"The Boys has a searingly profound take on how our culture would treat 'Sups' in a modern era. It's hilariously funny in a dark and clever way but it's also, unexpectedly, believable. This is the most enjoyable series I've watched this year!"
7.0,25 July 2020,The only good superhero related content we're getting for a while.

10.0,2 July 2024,"To be fair I loved the entire show, been a fan of seasons 1-3. Season 4 started a bit slow and weird but soon enough turns to be amazing like the rest of the seasons. The mockery of politics today and in the world in general and the use of sups to do it is so good. All the characters we loved are also growing into their potential. I was really doubtful The boys could deliver after such good previous seasons but so far so good!

Don't let the haters get to you, this series is amazing and one of its kind. I urge everyone who loved previous shows to go and watch it and see for yourself then comeback and write the review it actually deserves."
10.0,29 June 2024,"Such a fantastic, gory, raunchy, thrill ride of a show. Does a great job of showing how terrifying it would be if we actually had superheroes walking among us. And how scary it would be if they would start to believe they're better than us, which they probably would.

It pokes fun at some things that are happening in the real world, and that has turned some sensitive, hateful people off. But what doesn't with them? Because they're babies, they've been ""taking action"" by giving the show 1 star ratings all over the Internet.

The fact is this is one of the best shows of the decade. You only make enemies if you're doing something right, and this show absolutely is."
10.0,16 June 2024,"I love The Boys so much! I've een watching it since the start and, for me, it's far better than any superhero movie/programme I've ever seen. Yes it's very gory at times, lots of bad language but it's so appropriate and fits together so well. The acting is superb and the Storylines can be almost shocking. Antony Starrr is pure evil and Karl Urban has a heart of gold. I wish Chace Crawford as Deep would get more stories and lines because his character is brilliant! He's very deadpan and it's almost like the actor and character have no clue how funny they are. Not for children, it's like superheroes for adults. Watch it!"
9.0,20 June 2022,"Honestly didn't think I could be surprised by television anymore- ""The Boys"" proved me wrong. Enjoyed the first two seasons, but I believe season 3 has really elevated itself into becoming one of the greatest shows out there today. Though not for the weak of heart!"
10.0,9 October 2019,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning

SEASON ONE

In a world where the identities of prominent superheroes are known to the public, with their own marketing teams and PR representatives, behind the scenes many are not as scrupulous and heroic as they portray themselves to be. Homelander (Antony Starr) tries to portray himself as a virtuous Captain America type, but is arrogant and immoral behind the scenes, with more than a few dark skeletons in his closet. The brash A-Train (Jessie T. Usher) is reckless and ends up killing the girlfriend of young Hughie Campbell (Jack Quaid) right after he proposes to her. This sets him on a course for revenge, when he teams up with the gruff Australian Billy Butcher (Karl Urban) who has his own score to settle. Meanwhile, the young, beautiful Annie January/Starlight (Erin Moriarty) becomes disillusioned at the murky world the people she looked up to inhabit.

The superhero craze, which began in the early 00s and shows no signs of letting up, has morphed from something aimed at the pre-teen crowd, to something grown adults have come to have a subversive fondness for, intent on exploring the deep, dark inner turmoil of the tortured heroes, or what they serve as some kind of subliminal metaphor for, blah blah blah...And so we have this part light hearted, part dark and brooding Amazon Prime series, that takes a wildly counter cultural approach to the genre.

Regarding the aforementioned grown adult superhero love in, of all those blamed for this trend, British actor Simon Pegg is one of those whose name most frequently pops up to get the blame, so it's fitting here that he has a supporting role as the unfortunate Hughie's dad. But he's largely forgotten in the background, leaving us with the lead stars to really carry the thing. Starr has charisma and presence as Homelander, matched by Urban's dark, brooding turn as the man who's eventually revealed as his nemesis. Usher is really the token black role as the immoral A-Train, while Moriarty is a quiet revelation as the innocent, unassuming Annie/Starlight, with an alluring beauty that does her no problems.

It's an original and clever idea, that's biggest problem is that it is just never as engaging, effective or funny as it could be. But it's certainly got buckets of potential, and if this series doesn't really blow your socks off, there's loads of hope for Season Two. ***"
9.0,24 August 2019,"I am tired of all that violence and how women are always sexually assaulted for gratification and story plot. Why are the only two female heroes written as rape victims to be sexually abused for the ""job""? Am I supposed to enjoy watching it? It just ruins everything and it's disgusting"
10.0,22 July 2024,"Brilliant Series,Weird,Brutal,Funny all in one The Best Show,i have ever seen...i absolutely recommend watching this,it does have nudes in but,it's like here and there,It is age 18+ 🔞 so i don't recommend letting your young kids watch this,unless it's the adults permission,i hope in the future they will make more and it must not be stretched out and boring,if you guys running out of ideas,maybe make more bad guys,and leave the good guys where they are,we came far,We on Season 4 Episode 1,Hope you guys keep us updated,if there will be a new season or episode,DON'T end unless its Necessary......"
9.0,28 July 2024,"Just wow!

I just finished last episode and I'm dreaming such a great finale but While I love the show but this season is least my favourite.

I think this season should have been only 5 episode I'm not complaining or anything I'm still think it's a great show but it could be better I'm so excited for final season of the show I hope we get best ending for characters I know it's not easy job for writers to complete every characters story in 8 episode it's very hard i don't how they going to do that but I'm still thankful for not getting filler episodes like this season.

Overall the boys still is my favourite show (we'll see)"
6.0,5 September 2020,"Addictive TV, each episode is non stop drama or action. There are no boring bits. Brilliant"
10.0,20 June 2023,"The Boys is an absolute triumph of a series that shatters the conventions of superhero storytelling, delivering a gritty, exhilarating, and thought-provoking experience like no other. From the very first episode, it hooks you in with its unapologetic blend of dark humor, jaw-dropping action sequences, and deeply complex characters that leave an indelible mark on your psyche.

One of the show's greatest strengths lies in its fearless approach to dismantling the notion of heroes as infallible saviors. The Boys presents us with a world where superheroes are nothing short of narcissistic, corrupt, and power-hungry individuals, carefully manipulating their public image while indulging in immoral activities behind closed doors. This stark contrast between the public facade and the truth behind the capes creates an atmosphere of suspense and constant tension that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats.

The writing for The Boys is a masterclass in subversion. The plot is intricately woven, with each episode building upon the last, leading to a crescendo of shocking revelations and unexpected twists. It fearlessly tackles themes such as corporate greed, media manipulation, and the corrupting influence of power. The moral ambiguity of the characters adds layers of complexity, forcing us to question our own notions of heroism and villainy. It's a testament to the writing team's skill that they can simultaneously make us despise and empathize with these flawed and damaged characters.

The cast of The Boys is an ensemble of phenomenal talent, delivering performances that are both riveting and nuanced. Karl Urban as Billy Butcher is a force to be reckoned with, infusing the character with equal parts charisma and rage. Antony Starr's portrayal of the Superman-inspired Homelander is nothing short of chilling, expertly balancing an air of superiority and deep-seated insecurity. The entire cast, including Erin Moriarty, Jack Quaid, and Chace Crawford, bring their A-game, creating a group of characters that feel authentic and fully realized.

The production values of The Boys are second to none. The action sequences are visceral, intense, and often brutal, showcasing the sheer power of the supes while never shying away from the consequences of their actions. The visual effects are seamless, enhancing the already gripping storytelling and immersing us in this dark and twisted world. The attention to detail in the set designs and costumes further reinforces the show's gritty realism, making it feel like a plausible reflection of our own society.

Moreover, The Boys has an uncanny ability to balance its dark and twisted narrative with moments of genuine emotional depth. It explores the intricacies of relationships, trauma, and the lengths people are willing to go for their ideals. The character arcs are compelling and evolve organically, allowing us to form deep connections with these flawed individuals. It's a testament to the show's emotional resonance that it can tug at our heartstrings even amidst the chaos and carnage.

In conclusion, The Boys is a genre-defying masterpiece that raises the bar for superhero storytelling. Its relentless subversion, impeccable writing, stellar performances, and top-notch production values make it a must-watch for anyone craving a fresh and audacious take on the superhero genre. Brace yourself for a wild, thrilling, and emotionally charged journey that will leave you questioning everything you thought you knew about heroes and villains. Prepare to be blown away."
8.0,24 June 2022,"This is currently the best show on tv. Anthony Starr deserves an Emmy for his role as Homelander. He is absolutely terrifying. One of the best bad ""good"" guys of all time!! Karl urban and jack quaid are absolutely fantastic! But Starr steals the show! If he doesn't end up with at least an Emmy nomination, it's an absolute travesty. Watch this show!!"
9.0,14 August 2019,"The plot was exceptional. The cast fantastic. Every fit well with their roles, i love the whole idea and homelander is crazy. This is a great show and very enjoyable. Thank you"

10.0,12 August 2019,
10.0,10 July 2022,"The third season even though no better than season 1 and 2 was decent enough but the very last episode that would of pulled in the last 7 episodes they screw it up with inconsistency , made no sense , made the whole season pointless and were all over the shop. Very disappointing ending."
9.0,14 September 2020,"Fascinating, it shows the real goal of the governments. Great acting, wonderful script!"
6.0,21 May 2022,This movie is literally the best super hero movie ever. The action and story is just amazing. I like the fact that the superheroes especially Homelander kills bad guys instead of handling them to the police always as we see in other superhero movies.
10.0,28 September 2020,I love this show. This is not for the young and weak at heart. What makes this show so fantastic is its FRIGHTENING at how closely it depicts the world today! There are so many hidden gems. And the Supes?? Hilarious & Dysfunctional. Please give us season 3 NOW!!!
9.0,14 February 2024,"This series is taken from a comic of the same name, it is very different from the comic, and the good thing about this series is the difference in the behavior, speech and performance of this superhero, which makes the series different and the series for the fifth season.

And I hope that the fifth season can end this series well so that all fans are satisfied with this.

And I must mention the actors of this series, who are all well chosen for their roles, and I hope that this series and the world in which the series is set will be made into more and spin-offs So that we can all enjoy the world of boys."
9.0,11 July 2022,"Yeah sounds strange I get it but hear me out, if superheroes would exist, and they would be human as well, do you really think they would not abuse their powers, wealth, and fame. Just think about that. And now then why haven't we ever seen any superhero movie or show in which the hero is an actual human. Without exception they are ""good"" people with almost impeccable ethics, bravery, altruism etc. Not once do they do something completely of character. This series is a much needed reality check to what it means to be a superhero and a human being at the same time."
10.0,27 July 2019,"I've always been a fan of The Boys, having read the graphic novels by Garth Ennis multiple times. The series is great but way softer than the crude graphic novel work with the story line being more like an adaptation rather than a TV screen transfer. Still enjoyable though"
9.0,29 June 2022,"I'm not usually into super hero things but got it recommended to me... i love how these ""supes"" are villains and not hero's. I love dark humour and this has it! I've read the bad reviews and I just think why you watching it to complain? It's funny violence, you need to take it not so seriously. Great show!"
9.0,9 October 2020,"Just wanna say it's been too many years since I have not watched a show so perfect in so many ways, writing,history,dialogues,humor everything, one of the best tv show for sure"
10.0,2 July 2022,"No more info really needed. I like the show - could do without quite so much graphic...everything, but I like the show. But the politics are positively backwards."
9.0,23 September 2020,Season 2 just awful. a struggle to get through im done
6.0,15 May 2020,"I started watching this thinking; 🤔""This could be great if done well"", and DAMN after the 1st episode; I grabbed some snacks, and settled in to binge watch. If you're undecided, give the whole 1st episode a try, you won't be disappointed.👍🏻"
5.0,13 August 2019,"I've seen lots of complaints about this being a super hero that was supposed to be for kids. Folks, ya don't show a TV-MA show to your children! Plain and simple! If you do, you get what you get. The show itself is very well written and just goes to show what can be done with excellent people behind a great idea. Amazon really gets it right and I really can't wait for season 2! I'm not going to give any spoilers, so I'll just say that if the DCU wants to get their things up to par with what audiences expect, they should hire Amazon to take care of their movies."
9.0,18 May 2020,A really amazing show. I like how it shows what superheroes really would be in such a capitalist society.

10.0,8 September 2021,"This series has made me think absolutely everything that the word ""superhero"" means, simply a modern gem which is not for all audiences, everyone should see it I guess."

7.0,27 July 2019,"So what happens when Superhero's need corporate sponsors? They have to think about the bottom line. And how do you avoid being exposed to the public when some one finds out your secret? You have some one else do your dirty work. But there is always some one willing to reset the balance and that's where The Boy's come in. From the first episode where you're already getting a good idea of the character of the supes as The Boys call them to cheering in the second, this is a fun romp which I hope Amazon brings back for more. I've now got another series besides The Expanse to watch. Let's here it for The Boys!"
1.0,27 July 2019,"Just wow, what an amazing show. Can't wait for season 2."
10.0,12 November 2019,"An original superhero show? I'll give it a try but I had low expectations. What I watched was quite simply the best show I have watched in 2019.

This isn't just a basic show about superheroes. it's a critique of large capitalist companies. It highlights discrimination in the workplace. It has a darker edge that was completely unexpected, that was both thrilling and laugh-out-loud funny.

Karl Urban was an absolute delight. A hilarious, sweary, sarcastic, bitter, grieving man. He played the role to perfection.

I don't want to give away any spoilers, so all I'll say is watch and support this show. It will subvert your expectations of what a comic book show can be."
10.0,11 January 2020,"I wanna start by telling anyone that's not seen this to go and watch this now. The boys is amazing in almost every way, but let's start with the negatives. Some of the dialogue is a bit dry, some of the one liners said by the characters fall flat, it's could either be bad writing or poor execution fro, the actor(I doubt it though). Homelander season 2, he wasn't nearly as great in the first season, mainly because stormfront stole his thunder,no pun intended. The first seasons homelander was one of the most menacing and villainous characters ever on tv, it drops a bit in season 2 when people stop being scared of him, he is not as heavily featured as he was in season 1 which I hope they change for season 3. Some parts also get a slight bit repetitive or may seem a bit slow but nothing major. That's it for the negatives. The positives: I don't know how the writers do this but every character in the show feels like a main character, every memeber of the boys and of the seven are in every episode and feel like a key part of the story. The acting is great, Karl Urban in the role of Billy Butcher works so well but come no where near to Antony Starrs performance as homelander. He really completes the character and is the reason he is such a good villain. The story as well is amazing, every character has a backstory and something to add to the plot. The comedy is excellently timed, the action is brutal and enjoyable, the costumes are absurdly bright for a dark show. This show cannot and will not be Beaton by any other. It's incredible! Please watch this if you haven't already, you will not regret it. 10/10 I rest my case."
10.0,30 July 2019,"What would happen if there were super enhanced people, worshiped by the masses they protect, but who are flawed like us all. This series may be more honest in the portrayal of these characters than any written until now. And, if you look deep enough it is almost an inside honest appraisal of actors who are in essence the closest people we have to heroes. But while actors have less evident flaws and keep those things hidden to let their roles and out front deeds make them shine, these super heroes are covering their misdeeds in very similar fashion as written.

This is a refreshing take on popularity and the super hero fad of the time. It is surprising and well written. The effects are very good, as is the acting, and they provide you an insight into the problems and strife that befits the roles they play in a world buying into the mass hero worship.

It may not be a nine by the time the first season ends, but this certainly is a story worth watching for anyone caught up in the Marvel and DC universes, and anyone who likes a good twist on that story."
9.0,30 July 2019,Refreshing take on superhero mania. Hooked to it right from first episode. New item on binge watch list.
9.0,30 July 2019,"I just had to create my first review for this amazing series. This is great fun whether you're a huge superhero genre fan, or starting to feel 'franchise fatigue' set in. I'd recommend this to anyone really who likes intelligent, funny, and (very) adult subject matter, even if they would typically avoid caped hero antics.

Some fans of the source material may not like some of the changes to characters and the rearranging of the timeline for certain plot points. I was skeptical after reading the comic and seeing how Preacher was adapted for TV, but I finished this first season thoroughly satisfied and eager for more. The acting, effects, and story-lines are all top notch, with Antony Starr and Karl Urban completely owning their roles. Jack Quaid's character looked like he had been changed the most from the comic, but this turned out to be another non-issue. Another engaging performance and can't wait to see more of him as Hughie and other starring roles!

One of the most common gripes with the Netflix Marvel shows especially was their pacing, and filler episodes. Only 8 episodes for The Boys initially was disappointing, but there are no 'fast forward' scenes in any of the episodes. Everyone involved here hit this one out of the park - we need more content like this."
9.0,12 July 2022,"While it cannot compete with the Watchmen graphic novel (ignore the movie and show), it does hit the mark in certain episodes well, in others, just goes for shock value which degrades the subtlety but gets people reacting so fair enough. The more two dimensional (erm, sadly most in the Western world these days) will see it as a polemic which I am not sure it is, although I can see how cursory viewing might suggest that (the Fox News-like segments etc). Maybe be grateful we are in a society where we can discuss this freely and indeed take sides. Opps, tangent. Anyway, fun for the most part with some decent acting, again for the most part."
9.0,11 August 2019,This show was amazing from start to finish. I reccomend everyone watch it.
9.0,26 October 2020,"I just finished watching season 1. You certainly can not watch this one with the entire family. That said, the series is very cleverly written.

Unlike many other series where after 10 seasons some basic questions haven't been answered, this series regularly provides you with relief and satisfies your urge to know; yet keeps you craving for more. I really enjoyed the dialogs and the variety of social and political issue that this series tackles.

However, I'm not a fun of nudity, unnecessary profanity and gory violence. The writers of this series are amazing story tellers! Coupled with the great cast that they've compiled, they can certainly do without all of that nonsense; hence, I gave it 8 stars."
6.0,5 August 2019,"I've just finished watching it. And briefly is fantastic. Balancing humour and great acting with action, drama and jeopardy in a super hero show is tricky as DC proves yearly. However Amazon have really nailed it with this programme. Gripped all the way through. Can't wait for series 2."
1.0,25 October 2020,
9.0,13 January 2022,"Definitely a must see if you want to see some great comedy mixed with some amazing action and the true darkness / Reality of superhero's gone bad!!

When you think things couldn't get more chaotic it ramps it back up making it a very enjoyable experience and a great series to come out of amazon.

I your worried you wont like it I advice you to watch a trailer as they will give you a bit of the gist but wont reveal much about the show but defiantly enough to get you interested if you like superhero's and want to see what there like ultra unhinged this is the show for you."
8.0,24 March 2021,"Awesome, realistic, well written and completely realistic !

Make more shows like this"
10.0,10 May 2021,Good Show. I saw the both season of this show. If jgkvhvohobhghfxkdkchphhh. J lhjl jbj hi kbbob ki kjphob jb kl. O.
9.0,31 July 2019,There were attempt like this before but none quite got there.
10.0,11 September 2020,"A good for show, very ironic in a good way.

In my opinion it should not banalize killing any animals, especially endangered species. Nowadays topics like that must be taken very seriously."
10.0,17 September 2019,Stop what you're doing and binge watch the Boys. One of the best series I've seen in a long time. Can not wait for season two
10.0,9 August 2019,"Very entertaining, sci-fi, dark and comedic. Very well done. However Karl Urban...terrible portrayal of a Brit, just be a kiwi!!! I've never seen such a terrible British accent and over the top stereotypical 'slang'...truly awful. Good job it has everything else going for it."
10.0,16 August 2019,The Boys is a twist on every superhero movie and tv show. If you love crude humor and lots of swearing you'll love it. Most of the dialogue is very cliche except for all of the swearing which takes you away from the other dialogue and entertains. The story is really intriguing and will keep you hooked.
7.0,21 October 2019,"This series combines so many things and mashes it together, making a very interesting, shocking and unique show.

Cinematography: Very good camera angles and stunning views. C.G.I is actually insanely good for a t.v show, It looks better than some AAA movies I've seen.

Acting: I love the acting in this series, they are very believable and each unique character has their own unique personality that you end up getting attached to. There are plenty of badass acting scenes but also soft and dramatic scenes that are all done very well.

Story: The story is very very unique. It reminds me of avengers mixed with the dragonfly or epic movie, except done exceptionally better. The plot is good in a way where your shocked, excited and interested in seeing what's next each episode. The series has a really good mix of characterization, drama, comedy and action, which makes you really get into the show.

Overall impression: I'm very impressed by this series, I would give it a 9.7 out of 10. It is very unique and done really well, i cant wait for more episodes. No wonder why so many people like this show, I would definently recommend it."
1.0,22 December 2020,Season 1 was exceptional I honestly can't find a fault but season 2 has seemed to of lost its heart
10.0,5 April 2021,"Don't get me wrong, I really like this show. I have watched every episode of the first two series and will continue to do so when the third season launches later this year.

So, first the good. Great premise - bunch of superheroes ('soops') grown lazy, complacent and corrupt, policing a version of contemporary America. 'The Boys' of the title are a group of ill-matched vigilantes who seek to expose and generally fight back against the crimes and casual violence wrought by the superheroes.

'The Boys' are led by Billy Butcher played as a screen dominating tough guy by Karl Urban. And yet...and yet...time to address the elephant in the room. It's his accent.

What it is that Mr Urban is essaying here is anybody's guess. I actually watched the first two episodes of season one convinced his character was meant to be Australian. Thereafter, his vocal contortions have taken in South Africa, Zimbabwe, south east London (occasionally) and some notional mid-Atlantic zone normally associated with cheesy radio jocks.

To compound what is a heinous crime against English dialects, the sloppy scriptwriters have even made gross errors with (UK) English vernacular. For example: 'lost your bottle' used in context of the plot to mean losing one's temper actually means losing the courage to do something. Losing your temper would be referred to as 'losing your rag'.

So, Karl Urban is the new holder of the worst 'British accent' in a TV series or film, finally taking away that particular accolade/ stigma from Dick van Dyke in 'Mary Poppins'"
8.0,2 September 2022,
10.0,16 July 2021,"After the constant churning out of superhero films in recent years this series comes as a welcome relief, not to be taken too seriously, extremely violent and hilariously disturbing at times, a welcome change to the super hero/anti hero genre.

9/10."
8.0,16 October 2020,"Deprived of imagination so capes!. Over the top action, gory and fetish sex scenes. Evil folks with super powers? and good people with huge cursing vocabulary. Seth rogen is making a lot of money through smoking dope but the problem is, we're not high. Make something memorable instead of this recycled garbage, which is in abundance nowadays."
10.0,27 July 2022,"I liked the first season and a half or so but the last season completely lost the plot and went full woketard.

I'm not interested in having politics in my entertainment but ""The Boys"" decided to cram in as much politics with a heavy handed slant in one direction as they possibly could. They also forgot the entire point of the series towards the end. I hope they stop making the show because it's just getting dumb/bad."
10.0,22 March 2021,I like the storyline and characters... Season 1 was amazing... Season 2 would be amazing but the ending ruined the full mark..
8.0,19 March 2021,"I absolutely love this show, it's a way more realistic view on superheroes, but seriously guys... what is up with the headhunting? Not an episode goes by without a few heads popping like pimples :') but next to that, I love it. Good acting, good story - a bit slow sometimes maybe- and very realistic special effects -especially with the heads, very creative ;)-"
10.0,1 August 2019,"I was asked what kind of shows I like, I said, ""gritty, honest, clever, sci-fi or fantasy that exposes what we don't want to see or discuss - With humor, art, and emotion."" He suggested this show, and yes I like it. If you like it, please try The Watchmen, Doom Patrol, Sherlock, and the modern Doctor Who series."
7.0,8 August 2019,"This show is awesome, it's just what I needed, a fresh angle on superheroes, not that I'm bored with Marvel or anything, but this show shows a more dark and realistic world where ""superheroes"", exist.

It's has very decent acting, and the cast works very well. I really like the story, it's not campy or wierd, but shows how insane a world might be if superheroes actually existed.

I'm more than ready for season 2.

Anyone even the slightest into superheroes themes, and especially those looking for a darker version, should not miss this show.

It's easy to think of this show as something closer to Watchmen, rather than Marvel.

I think it's very unfortunate it's only available on AmazonPrime, since this show would have far more vievers if it was available not netflix aswell.

Don't dismiss this."
1.0,8 August 2019,"Loved this, from the casting to the writing its just so well put together. All the characters are brilliant in particular Karl Urban who plays Billy Butcher. This is Funny, violent and NOT one for the kids. This is not the run of the mill superhero movie. Watch and enjoy you wont be disappointed."
9.0,31 March 2021,
10.0,14 September 2021,"This wev series is based on practical life , what if superheroes does really exist.

Do they will really help the mankind?

You will get all the answers in this web series.

Must watch. Its better than Marvels and DC's superheros movies accept Dark Knight."
9.0,1 May 2020,"The Boys just blew my mind with its unique but engaging concept as I haven't seen its trailer before watching the season I thought its just another superhero season but it surprised me in a good way. They tried to show the different side of superheroes that we have never experienced before and it was quite horrific too if they go on a different path and try to harm humans, mind blowing."
10.0,17 July 2024,"The first season of The Boys was unlike anything you had seen on TV. It was subversive, dark, rebellious and funny. It was Punk. The show's heart was Billy Butcher, ferociously waging a war against The (Super)Man. Power corrupts, the show kept reminding us, as it mercilessly pilloried power misuse, celebrity worship and corporate hypocrisy.

But with every season, the show lost a little of its integrity, originality and freshness even as it chose to drag the story out over a few too many seasons. It felt like they had exhausted all their original ideas in the first season and kept copying them in the subsequent seasons. Only Soldier Boy's backstory and revenge arc had some of the same feel to it.

By its fourth season, The Boys has turned into run-of-the-mill hero vs villain story with little to distinguish itself.

Ratings by season: Season 1: 9 Season 2: 8 Season 3: 8 Season 4: 6.5."
10.0,17 April 2020,This shows just lives from gore and violence. Is this giving you the next kick or fix? Jumping from one dark show to the next to get satisfaction by watching others explode or die? Most younger audiences don't even see how violence increased in the last 20 years in movies and shows. Negative programming of your brain reaches the next level with this show. This is just sick and perverse.
10.0,31 August 2019,"The concept is unique. It's a jab at popular Superhero genre, not particularly making fun of it but showing realistically what would happen if someone had that kind of powers."
8.0,16 September 2019,"I have not been surprised in a Movie or Series in a long time now.

I was genuinely surprised and excited by this.

I just binge watched the whole Season 1 and I have to admit this was some amazing writing and level of cinematography especially for a TV Series.

This is absolutely Fresh Original and Great!"
10.0,15 August 2019,Never mind GOT etc. - this is the best show ever!!! Hope they won't mess it up!!!!
6.0,4 May 2021,"Forget everything you think you know about superhero movies. This series turns it all on it's head, taking a darker turn on the superhero genre."
1.0,4 September 2020,Season 2 is really awesome. It's really funny and action is great and the plot is getting darker and darker and its exceptional.
8.0,30 July 2019,"Bravo! I used to like superhero movies when I was younger but now it seems like they're just making them left and right so I got tired of them; plus they all seem the same. This is a very refreshing new kind of super hero show. Well written, great use of music, directing, acting is great from the entire cast (rare to me in super hero shows).

There are a few moments where you think it will be a bit predictable but then there's a little twist right around the corner. The twists aren't absolutely major but they are just the right amount of surprise you need to keep you wanting to see what else happens.

Any show that I want to watch a second time from beginning to end is a great show in my book. I hope there is a second season and I hope it's as good as the first."
9.0,21 March 2021,"Great show, you will notice a lot of low scores come from people that don't like season 2, and they have horrible spelling. These are right wingers who feel targeted because a cult was called out, and Nazi's were depicted as bad people. They don't like that reality, it hurts their feelings.

The Boys is a great alternative take on superheroes. Good plot, realistic to what would happen if we actually had Superheroes in America, instead of the popular Superman crap we see on tv. Capitalism is always the true evil and it gets exploited here again on the show. Fun show, great production, great actors, great plot."
10.0,6 March 2021,Started watching this series at the start last year. The first season had me hooked the entire idea of the super heroes being the bad guys was an amazing idea and the execution was just as good. Altough season2 takes some time to start it never slows down when it does and is an amazing ride too
10.0,30 October 2020,The series starts off amazing... then quickly dries out. The writing is all over the place and so many random things happen in the good guys favor just to move the plot forward. Loaded with plot holes.
9.0,21 August 2019,"I started seeing this series because it was rated at 8.9 on IMDB, I thought it was really good, but it's absolutely bad. If superheroes are selling themselves for money, why don't they use their superpowers themselves to get the money they want? Why would a person with superpower, such as flying, superhuman strength, have to rely on corrupt entrepreneurs to make money? It makes no sense at all. Why represent superheroes as people so devoid of morals and virtues? As if the world didn't have enough of these kind of people? It seems to me that the need to produce content eventually generates garbage. It's unfortunate that so many people are complimenting this crap and giving it a high score, that's simply unwatchable. If the future of TV shows is this then we are lost. It's also unfortunate that very good actors like Simon Pegg, Elizabeth Shue and Anthony Star have agreed to participate in this trash , it's outrageous."
10.0,31 July 2019,"Great show, dark story and a welcome poke at the current glut of hero movies and shows.

Can't take it too seriously or get offended. It is an 18 in the UK.

I am however deeply offended by the awful accent by Karl Urban. Worst cockney since Don Cheadle and Dick Van Dyck."
10.0,10 May 2021,"Season 1: 9/10 Season 2: 7/10.

Season 2 was pretty good nothing against it just not as shocking as the first."
9.0,22 August 2020,"I am late to watching this but I am so happy I did. What a great series and I cant wait for the next ones.

This has superheroes in, so if you love superheroes then this is the show for you."
7.0,29 July 2019,"If you love superhero shows movies watch this, even if you don't love superhero shows, watch it. Great job amazon studios, keep making shows, movies like these."
5.0,8 September 2019,"If there are any anime lovers out there, and if u ever watched ""My Hero ACademy"" (MHA) than this is for us guys who love it. A world where many humans are born with super powers, and where being a super heroe is normal? rings a bell?

The story flows great, the characters are awesome, and the special effects are top notch, what more can a fanof MHA wish for? Definitely recommend it, also if you never watched MHA, this is gonna grip u by the balls.."
9.0,28 July 2019,"Takes a different turn from the comic, but it's just so good. There are laughs, scenes that are really hard to watch (trigger warnings, there are rape scenes) and gore. It holds up a real black Mirror to life, reality and comic tropes."
10.0,11 March 2021,This show is better than Marvel & DC movies and TV shows. I am very excited to watch the Season 3.
9.0,11 August 2019,No need for the long review just watch it this show is GREAT!! just wow
9.0,2 August 2019,"It's definitely watchable however after the first episode which deserves a 10 the rest do not. It's not the acting that's fine for the most part except Keith Urbans awful cockney accent it's trash he should of just used his own Aussie acvent I have no idea why they told him to do it, if the part required a brit why not just use a British actor instead there's plenty out there that are as good if not better than him. Most episodes are fillers, not much happens and the supes are pretty naff to be honest. But each to their own. I'm not saying it's bad it's just not that good."
8.0,16 September 2020,Did they get new writers? disappointed thus far with the direction of the show.
9.0,18 September 2019,"Not much to say other than.. Watch it and don't read any spoilers. It's hilariously dark.. great acting.. good FX.. well filmed.. script.. music.. it has it all.

Compared to some of the recent series coming from Netflix (i.e. The I-Land) the quality Amazon has put out with this show is astonishing."
10.0,5 August 2019,"This show comes from a comic book series. Though when you see them, you can't help but be reminded of Marvel's Avengers ... even the tall skyscraper headquarters. However, what's interesting is that this is not really an action adventure. It's more of a drama / mystery.

The series has more to do with abuses of super-powers, corporate greed and collateral damage than anything else. It's really refreshing to see this new type story - however, it take a while to get truly engrossing.

The story starts off interesting but then lags for a few episodes. However, it really takes off near the end of episode 5, when a big secret about the drug Compound V is revealed and it keeps going till the very powerful end sequence in episode 8.

Definitely worth watching if you can sit through a slow start."
10.0,31 July 2019,"I had high hope's for this, based on the trailers, and it's even better than I thought it would be. NOW I HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL NEXT SEASON! Fantastic show!"
6.0,19 October 2020,"So, I gave this a try after reading the concept of ""Anti-Superhero"" or ""Superheroes went rogue"" or ""Bad- Superheroes"" and I must say I am not disappointed at all. This right here is a great concept and creates a different Universe than the usual Marvel/DC super-heroics which we are so hitched to. The storyline keeps you hooked most of the time, even in the dull phases (only a few) you are wondering ""What next"". The plot is amazing, the characters are breathtaking, worth noting is the fact that every character has their say at some point in time. ""Billy the Butcher"" and the ""Homelander"" owns the show but there is much more to look for than these two. Both seasons are amazing and full of entertainment. Amazon pulled off a stunner, to be honest. Give this a go, not for the reviews, but to see something different than the usual so to say Marvel/DC plots."
3.0,7 September 2019,I would like to see him in judge dredd against the predator in the mega metropolis.
10.0,8 April 2020,"This was the best superhero TV series I've ever seen. I enjoyed the Boys more than the DC Avengers movies. Shocked, surprised and horrified constantly, the plot and characters are incredible and it's gritty! 10/10"
9.0,25 February 2022,"I enjoyed season one and season 2. Season 2 was weaker than first season in terms of plot line and motives. But still the characters are awesome. One thing I don't like is the acting from some characters. However, it's a different spin on superhero show/film where marvel and DC have become very formulaic. I am looking forward to season 3."
10.0,18 May 2020,Watchman as it should have been. One of the top series.
10.0,11 November 2020,"Great themes, sweetly played out with humour, real drama, menace and pathos. But as an English person I'm finding that Urban's truly appalling non-accent, along with his uber corny delivery (especially in Series 2) are really getting me down."
9.0,15 September 2020,One star from me. Too much gore. The writing seems off. IMO drugs affected the writing and production. There is a lack of depth.
9.0,17 July 2021,"What can i say? Just watch and enjoy the madness. And I wish they actually make ""dawn of the seven"" movie, can't wait for season 3."
9.0,20 August 2019,"I saw the first episode and I was hooked! It is quite literally a satire of life today in the US and quite possibly many developed countries. It features politics, humor, raw inappropriateness, life, god, religion, hypocrisy, philosophy and much more.

If this show offends you, warning, warning, it said what it features in the first ten seconds, it warned you of what was coming and viewer discretion was advised. My only worry is how to prevent my kid from seeing this but other than that enjoy it! I think the people who complain of the ""Immorality"" of the show are probably hypocrites anyways and are lying to themselves.

It really helps you think of the dangers of ""power"", not just super powers but ""power"" in general. What if you could....would you really help others the best you could? Could you stay moral?

I love the french guy, the butcher, MM and Hughie. They work so well together. They play off each other's strengths and I can't stop watching. I really, really, really hope this show continues and Amazon doesn't fall prey to the ""mainstream"" conservatives, and hypocrites who deny that this show is damn good! Do not end this show after ones season, please! It's my Compound V from the daily grind!"
8.0,13 March 2021,"Okay, I thought ""The Boys"" would be stupid, but after seeing the whole first two seasons, it is a solid two season series. Part of me wants a third season, but part of me says why, and then I do see possibilities for good and for tedium. It has believable (for fiction), complex characters, some laughs, and lots of special effects (a bit bloody, but it's what it is) along with suspense, surprises, and action. I like it. Original with good actors."
7.0,15 March 2021,"I was a bit sceptical on the beginning. But once I've seen first episode I new this is what I was waiting for. Because most of super hero movies and series are made like for the children. This show is unique, funny, brutal and clever at the same time. Performance of all actors was absolutely superb. Whole story very intriguing and without holes. I liked it this series so much, that I binge watch whole 2 seasons in one sitting.

This TV series is one of the best series I've seen in my entire life."
4.0,13 August 2019,This show exceeds expectations!! Only issue I had was not collecting all the The Boys cups from Carl's Jr!
10.0,10 August 2019,
10.0,2 November 2020,This web show is great and it is very excited . After every episodes it gains suspense . The whole cast of The boys has done an excellent and outstanding work . The acting department is too good. The reason why am I not giving 10 stars just because of excessive nudity. This show has very much nudity
10.0,25 August 2019,"You need to watch this show You can't die without seeing this series Brilliant characters Billy the Butcher sounds kiwi, not British, but still love him to bits

Epic epic epic epic Adult rated Perfect combo of gore and perfect cgi and acting Everything is just pure genius"
10.0,21 November 2020,"Without any spoilers, the show's first season is really fresh and interesting but towards the end the charm started to wore out and the second season was downright boring and poor. Another show with a great idea and no clue what to do with it beyond one season. If that's the case, make it a 1-2 season and give it a full closure, not drag it on by all the dirty tricks on the book."
10.0,4 October 2020,Season 1 was great but this new season has become nothing but lazy writing and cliche driven drama. Very disappointing.
9.0,28 July 2022,"This is a show very unusual and original in its ideas. The graphic content distinguishes it from all the DC/Marvel stuff which makes it the sole of its kind. There is drama , love , hate and payoff. All the good ingredients to a good story . The characters are all likeable and they seem properly motivated and all seem to be 3 dimensional. I have some issues with it though. There are some concepts that are very and I mean very overused, like blackmail which actually gets quite boring quite fast and really shows some lack of writing variety and relying way to much on one way to solve problems. One other thing is that the producers want to drag it out as long as it takes and I fear it is going to have so many seasons that it is going to be like the case with the walking dead. My biggest issue is that it is too ""American"" and it depicts a lot of religion stuff, forcing nazism somehow , terrorism , war and patriotism and forgetting that any other country exists in the world. Still I think it is a solid 8/10 with a lot of room for improvement."
10.0,11 December 2020,"Season 1 was superb, especially liked the humor. I missed the same humor in season 2, it took itself a little to serious i think."
7.0,15 April 2020,Original theme with some really well developed character writing
1.0,15 August 2019,"It is SO refreshing to see a series that just won't bend to the era of the 'easily-offended' we're currently living in. I loved that the series was so ironic, so persistently and just couldn't take itself too seriously, compared to other superhero themed media (looking at you Marvel and DC). I was hooked from the first episode and within a matter of days, I had finished the series (I sadly had to work or I would've watched the entirety in no time). The only issue with this series is that I enjoyed it so much, it has ruined other series for me. What the heck do I watch now? :("
10.0,17 October 2020,Anthony Starr is fantastic and makes this series. A great watch.
10.0,27 December 2019,"Just finished watching The Season 1. It was totally great and I entirely relished the show. So excited for The Season 2!

First of all, «The Boys» is not just that another «S» series, implying that they're in good faith, all saint and blessed, as it has been a tendency for now. The show's aim is to prove it all wrong - to paint the «S» in a bad light and to reveal who they really are. Sure, they might have some extraordinary and, in fact, tremendous abilities. Nevertheless, having such a «gift» doesn't necessarily mean that the person who's got it, is doing right.

«The Boys» is definitely more focused on human beings, rather than the superheroes - the latter got about 25-30 of total screen time. Meaning that, the show is much more of «a human in the world where there are superheroes», rather than «we have a supe, let's make a story based on them». «The Boys» sheds a new light on, in particular, a superhero (-es) based series, showing it (in) the way you never expect them to behave.

Having said that, «The Boys» is an outstanding title with a cunning plot. It's the new kind of experience of watching a superhero cinema; a bit more realistic, and reasonable, in a way."
8.0,15 November 2021,"Going into this I knew it would be a subversive take on the superhero genre but that's basically it. I really enjoy fresh takes on such an oversaturated genre, but I typically do not enjoy shows/movies that are very political, so at first I was very unsure about if I would enjoy this show.

Thankfully I was very surprised: the writing, acting, pacing, directing, and subversions of this show never cease to surprise me. When I see Homelander on screen, never knowing if he is about to snap, I am just smiling at how well his actor is pulling off such an effective and hate-able villain. The Boys themselves are all great in their own ways, with realistic flaws. Speaking of realistic, the way this show handles the ideas of trying to take down such a large business and organization is always done so well. There is basically a point in every episode that I would never have expected but it never overstays its welcome. Just an excellent show, shows like this make me happy knowing that there really are some talented people out there that care about the content they are making.

Edit: I just finished season 3 and wow. Amazing! This is one of my favorite shows of all time now, up there with Breaking Bad and some other near perfect shows. Why? I love everything about this show: I am invested in every single character, whether I love them or hate who they are, I always want to see more. The writing is stellar, always throwing in twists but also always staying clever and to the point. The show has amazing pacing, I am never bored watching The Boys. This new season has to be one of if not my favorite seasons so far. Soldier Boy is such an interesting character, the temp V stuff has been wild, and I literally cannot wait to see where this show goes next, amazing stuff!!"
9.0,18 July 2021,"This is a complete different type of superheroes tv show.

Nobody is a hero, there is just flawed, corruptible and vengeful people with or without powers, each one with a story that led them to this situation.

Incredibly well done.

A very good surprise."
10.0,18 September 2020,"The second season is boring. You have killed the series.

Season 1: 9/10 Season 2: 2/10"
10.0,31 August 2024,
10.0,2 November 2020,"I liked the show from the beginning when the story unfolded showing supes and their real dark sides. Unlike any other show where superheroes are shown to be ever righteous, this show has a different concept which I'm sure most of you're gonna like. Go check this out. I don't want to give any spoilers here."
10.0,28 August 2020,
7.0,18 March 2020,"Okay. Wow. Went into this thinking this would be another silly comedy about superheros. I mean, look at the poster-the man with the laser eyes. The trailer was just as goofy. Mega surprised. I loved every character, binged on it, and came out of it wanting more.

A genuine surprise. Hoping for a second season."
10.0,26 February 2021,Interesting concept for a show and awesome soundtracks.
10.0,15 October 2020,I really loved the show. It is totally different from usual superhero stories. And I am eagerly waiting for third season.
9.0,7 August 2022,
8.0,8 April 2020,Best superhero type show I've ever seen. Shows truly what might be if they're were actual humans with super powers. Loved it
10.0,10 August 2019,Thanks for a spectacular ride! Looking forward to the next season.
10.0,7 October 2023,"It's a good show. Great premise, great cast, great effects but for me it's ruined a bit by the puerile gross out moments, usually involving the Deep. I haven't read the source material and I appreciate they have probably been included to stay faithful to said material but they ruin it a bit for me. A couple of them are just plain disgusting and I don't quite get what their purpose is, I appreciate some of them are there for comedy purposes, but I don't really find a variety of sea creatures being hideously mutilated in various ways that funny.

I find it a bit hard getting over Karl Urban's ridiculously over the top Jack the Ripper cockney accent, too.

All my moaning aside, I still do like it!"
9.0,13 September 2020,Don't wast your time with junk. Read the comics and you will have a better time. This is total junk.
10.0,18 May 2021,"This show is truly amazing, from start to finish it is consistently enjoyable, it has a great plot and it really just works. It may be satire, but it's also a solid entry in the superhero genre, it's so good that it literally got review bombed for having a weekly release schedule because fans wanted to see what would happen next. Although it's probably best not to watch it if you don't like blood."
6.0,28 November 2020,"I was looking for something new and by accident found this. Guess what it's a second day and I'm already in season 2, so you can assume how good it is. While jokes, action and all sort of storyline things are very individual thing. You can't deny QUALITY of visuals and how juicy it is sometimes.. Gosh that flesh of meat or open bone is looking really good :D"
1.0,28 July 2019,"A cynical look at corporate greed, media stereotypes and super heroes. And if that sounds like strange combination, it is. Surprised Amazon made a series like this as it contains some fairly dark adult themes so it's certainly not for everyone. Recommended whether you like super heroes or not."
8.0,21 March 2020,
9.0,7 August 2019,"I'm not sure what to even compare this to, but OMG this was excellent TV"
10.0,19 June 2024,"It seems to me that Hollywood is making Homelander resemble Trump. Am I wrong?

The man seems so much like Trump to me. All the chaos Homelander causes and just sits back and watches it unfold, just like Trump.

It's a good show and I like but just delving into the undertones and likeness of the two people.

Seeing how the world would be if superheros actually existed is a change on the typical superhero movies. The heros are shown to be flawed, just like us, and deal with conflict within the group--much deeper issues than your typical superheros.

Not for kids!!! But definitely a good watch!!"
10.0,10 July 2024,"A fantastic take on the superhero genre that has gotten better each season. Graphic? Darn right! Political? Yes, and that's what makes it so funny. All those who complain that the writers and directors are ""shoving their political views down viewers' throats"" are missing the point.

They are shoving the viewers' own extreme political views down the viewers' OWN throats! They are exposing how absurd and ridiculous the far right has become the past several years and that is great satire! It is holding a mirror to the extreme views of too many people in this country.

Its just too bad that point is going right over their heads."
8.0,27 July 2019,"It's right in the title, and well it's the prominent theme. I'd give it a 7 had it not been for that"
10.0,3 July 2024,"Very good show, with way too much unfitting humor and too much time spend on uniteresting characters. Very good show because of 90% of the writing is great. The effects are top notch, the actors does an amazing job and plot is very exciting. A lot of twists and turns that competes with some of the best twists in GoT. The world is very much filled with a-holes, which makes all characters feel real. The show is very much worth a watch.

The not so good is mostly the humor, which I weren't much of a fan of. Most of the humor is slapstick and gross, some of it lands for me, but 70% of it didn't, and some of it seemed out of place. The show is also a bit too repetitive and some episodes coulda been 10-15 minutes shorter. We don't need 45 scenes which shows character X is a douche, 20 scenes is fine and then let the rest be pure character development.

All in all a very good show."
10.0,18 August 2022,"First season was easily a 10 for me. I mean it really sucked me in, nearly in every way. Superheroes that were really terrible people, the gore, the humor, even the love story were all so well done to me. Then the 2nd season happened, and they bring in the Nazi superhero. Came out in 2020, so not sure how I'm surprised anymore, but still wanted to write this as the first season was just so incredible that I'd recommend anyone at least watch that. If you love all the social justice ""woke"" stuff, then you'll probably love season 2 and the start of 3 also.

I made it through season 2 I'll add, all of it. I watched the first episode of season 3 and saw they were sticking to the social justice thing so I stopped there. Also please know I have no issue with equality in hollywood or a diverse cast. Honestly to me its all about the story and characters anyway. This took an incredible season 1 with all of those things, along with a diverse cast, and threw it all into a blender for the sake of social justice movements. It completely took it away from the story.

Please please please stop making every single thing, even if it's about nature or something completely unrelated, and find a way to throw social movement topics into it. The shows and stories are being ruined by it all. There is room for some shows/movies to do this and that should happen, but not EVERYTHING. Anyway, enjoy season one anyone still reading!"
9.0,13 June 2024,
6.0,28 May 2024,"Just an amazing show. Everything about it is top Notch... The acting, the casting, the writing, the effects. Just fantastic, and if you think about it, quite realistic in the sense that why are traditional superheroes all White hat, wearing upstanding, good guys? Imagine taking a random sampling of even the people that you know personally, and giving them superpowers. Would they all be up to saving the day? Unlikely. As an aside, if you like the boys, I recommend the movie Brightburn. If at a minimum, Antony Starr and Karl Urban haven't or don't win Awards for the parts, they play, something is wrong. The same goes for the actors that play Frenchie, Kimiko, Queen Maeve, and a number of others in the cast. Especially Starr... I am of the mind that he was born to play this part!

If I could give 11 stars, I would do so!"
3.0,20 June 2022,"This is show is gem I love it with core of my heart logical, suffocating at times emotional and wonderfully created.

Homelander is in every human Being I feel this many times watching this gem."
10.0,2 July 2022,"The series is beautiful, especially the scenes that contain the character of Humlander and Butcher. The actors are great, especially the scenes with Butcher and Hemholander, one of the greatest actors ever."
10.0,1 July 2022,"One of the most well written plots. Characters have a backstory, character developments, realistic personalities and are cast just perfectly. Can't believe they made a show so awesome that plot twists can have you screaming. Superheroes with all sorts of real troubles in their way and hidden agendas. A true delight to watch."
10.0,11 July 2022,"One of the paramount reasons all Marvel TV shows are not reaching fan expectations has been the enormous success of the irreverent, delightfully deranged ""The Boys"" series on Prime, that has redefined the entire superhero genre for a significant section of OTT audiences. Season 3 rides on the coattails of the fan-favorite characters developed by Seasons 1 & 2 and adds its own sheen by taking the stakes higher, the violence gorier and the tensions between the characters to astronomic levels.

We follow the journey of a vigilante team called the Boys, led by the now cult-favorite ""Billy Butcher"" (played with some aplomb by Karl Urban) as they look to keep a check on the morally bankrupt superhero team knows as ""the Seven"", headlined by the megalomaniacal ""Homelander"". Why Anthony Starr's depiction of this character isn't buried with Emmys and Golden Globes is beyond my understanding, such is the tour de force performance he has churned out season after season, not just in building up one of the most hated antagonists in TV history but also by adding layer upon layer of increasing complexity and moral turpitude to the character arc as the audiences progress deeper into the story.

While staying within its superhero alternate reality, writers Craig Rosenberg, Anslem Richardson, Geoff Aull and co. Subtly drop in relevant political commentary into their narrative, painting scathing critiques of authoritarianism, the rise of neo-fascism and vilification of mainstream media. ""The Boys"" tells us the story of the other, uglier side of superheroes and enhanced humans and is perhaps the best depiction of the quote ""Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely"".

Jensen Ackles is the new face in the cast this season, and makes a strong early impression as the legendary ""Soldier Boy"", the superhero that started it all and a clear parody of ""Captain America"". Without the use of high end CGI and special effects that Marvel has access to, creator Erik Kripke has made a strong performance oriented superhero drama series that is disturbing yet diabolically ingenious and one of the most addictive, engaging and binge-worthy series I have seen on TV in recent times. Highly recommended!"
10.0,1 July 2022,"Absolutely everything about this show (writing, directing, pacing, acting, casting) are simply amazing. Near perfection. With one notable exception: what the hell is up with Karl Urban's bad attempt at a cockney accent? Why didn't they just let him be a Kiwi or an Aussie? Fortunately, it doesn't ruin his character's effect in the show. He's pretty awesome. The whole show is awesome. But when he starts to sound like Johnny Depp doing a half-drunk Jack Sparrow, it does tend to grate on the nerves."
10.0,3 May 2024,
10.0,16 August 2024,"I am changing my rating today and I am rooting for the villains now. I don't like them, but I dislike the ""good guys"" in show even more.

When I first started watching this show, I enjoyed it. It was not great, but it was good. Too much ""shock value"" for my taste, but the story lines and arcs were great.

I am on the opposite end of the political undertones of this show, but I am used to this coming from the TV and film industry. I simply disregard it and just follow the stories.

Come season 3 - the show lost its only draw for me. The storylines became just political hatchet jobs without merit.

Season 4 became even worse. This is a poor and hateful caricature of the way the political left sees themselves and the way the see conservatives."
9.0,23 September 2020,"The Boys has everything you could want in a show. Action, drama, romance, violence, gore, and everything that could put a smile on your face. This is my first review and all i can say is after years of Marvel movies and this is a fresh break! The adult content is perfect and leaves my breathless."
9.0,12 July 2022,"I really really really love this show, from the characters, to the action, to the topics it touches, the way it parodies our world and the comics at the same time in a very intelligent way, its just great. Almost all characters get their own arc and evolution, the parody and critics they do to superheroes, corporations and politics is one of the closest we have to real life and my favourite part, which is the action, is super violent and gore, something I enjoy quite a lot. The gore could very well dissapear but its a nice touch and is also much less than in the comics. Overall, a great series that at this point, with their 3 seasons, hasnt disappointed at all, not even a bit, being fantastic at all moments."
7.0,8 March 2024,"The story is good and acting is great but while watching this show you feel like there is something wrong with the main character espicially i understand that he suffers from self confidence issues, but he is psychopathic and sometimes he care with the people opinion and sometimes he is not and its so confusing his powers is quistion mark i feel he is powerful but he is not in the same time and it is not about his mental health but according to writer's will the sex scenes is not necessary and with no meaning and not even funny or good this show is good and could be greater if just change little details."
8.0,28 July 2019,The only thing I can think of from giving this show a 10/10 is the superhero costumes. I thought they were a bit too cheesey and over the top. I thought everything else was spot on and nice too see someone other than Marvel or DC do a great job in creating superheroes or in this case supervillians.
9.0,9 October 2020,"This is a truly unique series. It has the perfect amount of violance, suspence and comedie."
8.0,11 September 2020,"Dark and hilarious, one of the best series out on Amazon Prime."
9.0,10 October 2020,"If you haven't watched this, watch it. The BEST TV show made in so so so long! Season 3, hell yeah!"
8.0,15 October 2020,"I'm convinced some people that are giving this a 1 out of 10 havent actually watched the show. I've just seen a review having ago at Netflix for season 2 being trash which it isn't its just as good as season 1 imo and also its not even a Netflix show its amazon prime.

Anyways I really love this show I can't wait for season 3 and people that are hating on season 2 I don't understand why as its just amazing."
10.0,5 July 2024,"I generally dislike the idea behind superheroes. I do understand people tend to love them, but they should think deeply about why is that. Unfortunately, psychology and psychiatry have both something to say on this subject, you might want to check that one up (or not..).

The general superhero premise is that they are good guys, who help common people and fight off supervillains. Unfortunately, that is not how such people would behave. There would be almost no ""good"" ones because power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.

The Boys is a good and refreshing view of such world. It is much more realistic in nature that usually depicted. In boys superheroes are spoilt, savage and don't care at all about others or human life in general.

The first seasons is amusing and nice to watch. Captivating, even. However, after about half of the season, they have watered down the show. It ends without real conclusion, and is increasingly stupid and illogical towards the end.

Season 2 turned into good superhero / bad superhero soap opera. I stopped watching after two episodes and do not intend to go further."
8.0,12 July 2022,"I love this show, it's brilliant. Some people like to moan about certain things with this show but please ignore them as this show isn't for SNOWFLAKES so If you're the type of person who is easily offended this show isn't for you, you should instead go watch a PC bore fest like catwoman and go back to sleep."
10.0,10 October 2020,"Can't imagine anyone other than Karl Urban playing Butcher. He's basically carrying the role. Same could be said for all the other characters, esoecially Homelander."
7.0,10 October 2020,"Probably the best TV show I've ever watched to be quite honest. It's funny, gritty, brutal and shocker. Everything I want in a show."
5.0,18 June 2022,"The degenerate 7 have always been a disaster, long before this crew, and they've always been covered.

The boys are looking for the weapon that took down Soldier Boy, the previous team leader and end up on Agent Mallory's door, Butcher's recruiter. She explains why she decided to move against Vaught and how Soldier Boy disappeared. Which leads the Boys to Russia. A temporary version of the V compound that gives superpowers falls in their lap, that Butcher and Hugh decide to use

Meanwhile, Starlight has to endure Vaught and Homelander's manipulations. And he's more unhinged than ever. Keeping her allies safe is a challenge. Is she up to the task and for how long ?

Special mention for Soldier Boy ! He will piss some people off. The creator and the actor (Texan) love making fun of the Confederate flag crew in all their splendour, I'm looking forward to watching this. So far so good. Soldier boy is Donald Trump's wet dream."
10.0,26 September 2020,"The new one is even more gripping than the first. It dives deeper into the realism of superheroes . When it comes to the performances then Karl urban is brilliant as always, jack Quaid is gr8 too, Erin Moriarty is extremely likable, special mentions tomer kapon and laz alanzo as Frenchie and mm respectively add lot of life to both seasons, Karen fukuhara has been given lots of importance in this season which is awesome, Maeve, deep and a- train I think are kinda dull but that doesn't stop me from loving this show , aya cash is a new recruitment who is not necessarily likeable but memorable which I like but on top of all of these stands Anthony starr as honelander who is naturally menacing in every single frame he is in and stands between villains like the joker, thanks , hans Gruber and agent Smith for me ofcourse."
10.0,27 July 2019,This is one of the best vigilante superhero series ive seen if you like watchmen you're gonna love this
10.0,4 October 2020,"Can't get enough of this series, Homelander the Superman without any morals or compassion towards humanity, makes for the best Anti Hero ever."
10.0,28 June 2022,"There's loads of clean super heroes out there living to be the best they can and saving the world.

The Boys takes the same idea and then counteracts this with them having egos and superiority complexes. The questions that are never asked in real super hero movies like what happens to those who die as collateral damage when a super hero intervenes. How are they held accountable for their actions?

The first scene takes in an accident where Hughie's girlfriend is killed by a superhero as he is heading somewhere. From here on we learn how little they really care about people and how they are self obsessed.

There's loads of shock and gore and swearing. Absolutely not for kids, it's so wrong in so many places. However it really is a great series with fantastic characters, captivating plot and some excellent ideas."
10.0,1 August 2019,
9.0,24 December 2019,"I have no problem with extreme violence or religion bashing, or just about anything else folks generally tag as ""offensive."" That's not the problem. It's just boring. The story is slow, the writing is lazy and the whole thing just drags along with minor unresolved conflicts that are not compelling but nagging and annoying. I don't understand why people like this, other than for the mild, cliched sexual themes. As has been suggested, there must be some reviews but it's still hard to understand how heavily weighted this is to the positive. Maybe it's a reflection of overall pop-culture deterioration. This product can serve as a historical signpost of that for sure. Otherwise, I couldn't make it past two and a half episodes."
10.0,20 September 2020,Totally worth watching Unlike all the super hero movies it's abstract thinking I've never read the comic but good one
10.0,4 June 2023,"I really love the concept of this show. In an over crowded genre this show really stands out. I love the characters. There are those you love and those your supposed to hate but love. I love how the writers push the boundaries on what's acceptable to show on a tv more and more as each season passes. There have been many, many ""did I just see that moments."" It is fun, it is crude, it is just pure entertainment at it's best from start to finish. I just love this show. Each season has improved on the previous one. I can't wait for its return for season 4. Surely deserves to start picking up some serious awards."
7.0,9 October 2020,"Two seasons of this show have come out so far and with each episode the show just ups the levels and gets better and better. Fantastic acting throughout especially from Anthony Star as Homelander, one of the best television villains in years in my opinion and the amazing and different take on a super hero world makes for amazing and refreshing viewing. I would even recommend this show to those who aren't into comic book adaptations as I've yet to meet someone who dislikes it! Can't wait to see where the show goes next but after season two upped the quality with new amazing characters and story arks I'm confident it'll only continue to grow."
3.0,28 July 2019,"After trying to watch one episode of 'Another life' , I quickly came to this , I binge watched the whole series in 2 days, just a great show i am already desperate to watch season 2. After some truly horrendous sci-fi it's great to watch something this good.

I hadn't read the comics prior to watching the show , since then I have and there are differences in the story and some of the characters."
10.0,13 August 2019,

10.0,17 October 2020,"The politics are taken to judge the quality of this show. The show is beyond good. The show is above any Marvel-hero-series. Watch it, enjoy it. Make your own decision."
9.0,18 July 2022,
10.0,28 July 2019,If you enjoy Watchman you'll definitely enjoy this. It's a 9/10 in my mind.
9.0,19 September 2020,"Pretty much pointless. There are no likeable characters. The supes aren't just normal people with flaws, they're horrible. Except for Starlight, who seems to have some convictions and is supposed to come across as genuine, but does somehow manage to come off more as the self-centered prima donna she's accused of being by one of the corporate honchos. The foils are, I guess, supposed to be the ones we care about, but there's very little there personality-wise. Hughie is dragged along by the current like a leaf on a stream. After the first episode or three, you get it perfectly well. The super heroes aren't so super. That single idea isn't enough to carry a whole series. And that is pretty much all there is."
10.0,26 June 2022,My first review...absolutely love this. Hands down the most entertaining series I have watched for a looooong time. What a great idea to put superheroes in a real life situation.. So funny idea and one of a kind never done befote.

8.0,7 May 2023,"This show (like the comic) is original and different than anything else I've seen. The visual/practical effects, storytelling, acting, and overall story is just fantastic. Each season gets stronger and you learn to love the protagonists and hate the antagonists more and more. There's a good mix of humor, violence, and chaos that keeps you wanting more. The character development is great, and each of the characters feel three-dimensional, each facing their own personal challenges battles within themselves each other. The practical effects and set departments have done a wonderful job on this show, making the gore, superhero abilities, and environment feel super realistic. I binge-watched all three seasons and I can't wait for the next one."
9.0,28 July 2019,"Marvel and DC meets Game of Thrones. This fills the void that GOT has left and gives an adult, realistic, class of supers. Just finished the 5th episode but had to stop the binge watch to give it the review."
9.0,7 June 2022,"The Boys is a show we watched the first episode when it first came out, then for some reason we didn't continue with it, I really can't recall why, maybe we had a lot to watch at the time. Any we started at about 8pm last night and as both the wife and I had the day off work today we just pushed on though to mid morning, and let me just say it wasn't an effort to do so at all, it's been one of the most enjoyable nights of tv I've had in a long time. I'm a big DC fan, so was great to see most of the characters we're rough copies of pretty much the justice league. Only moan, and it's a very minor one is Karl Urban's dodgy cockney accent, really needed a bit more work, I'd expect better from a New Zealander really. So now we have the first 3 eps of season 3 to watch tonight and we are up to date. Can't wait to continue the story."
10.0,29 March 2023,"The Boys tells of a bunch of misfit superheroes championed by the world until we find out their dark secrets. We watch the unraveling of their relationships as all the while, a rag-tag bunch of vigilantes try to take them down. This is quite the series - there's a lot of action, gore, comedy and drama in this visually impressive series. The acting and writing are top notch. The cast are world-class and do a great job of creating unique characters that will have you on the edge of your seats. I'm speaking of course to the likes of Karl Urban as Billy Butcher and Anthony Starr as Homelander. Their performances are nothing short of unnerving and perfect."
8.0,8 September 2022,"The creators may have planned to make the following statements. But, if they didn't, I am doing so. It presents lessons in: How to not be true to yourself How to live your life for somebody else's dream How to sell out and prostitute yourself for some carrot you think you want and need to have. Even the superheroes are prostitutes How everything is about ratings and being liked and well-perceived by a shallow public How corporate America is amoral, unprincipled, heartless and soulless The public's indifference to gore and violence to the extreme How much of the world is in love with comic book garbage involving superheroes. If they existed in real life they would abuse their power just as humans who have much power frequently do How people are not content just being who they are... They need to lose themselves in some alternate reality that is concocted by the media Follow the money How some people get away with murder A commentary on how decadent our society has become The smirk of evil Evil posing as good. Their secret identity is the devil.

""Everything comes with a price. "" We live in a world that worships celebrities... Which is goofed up Some of the powerful are controlled by the even more powerful Modern American society is like the mob in Rome when the Christians were eaten by lions for entertainment 50,000 people pay dearly to watch an event that only lasts for less than a second Even the superheroes are not happy... They're a bunch of jerks Public versus private persona It's all about getting leverage over key members of Congress and other areas of the government What is more important than anything is getting what you want... And that usually entails something nefarious It's a metaphor... The most powerful things are controlled by the government or special interest groups Everyone is expendable There is no honor among thieves The world is full of dark secrets Some disgusting attempts at humor that are not the least bit funny So many things are politicized for somebody's gain The most powerful is also the most evil Christianity in America has been perverted and turned into a racket and also politicized We grow up hearing the advice to refrain from discussing religion and politics with others... Religion and politics are quite similar. Both contain figures of worship... One of them is legitimate and the other is counterfeit Lies and hypocrisy abound They make a mockery of the sacred People feed on the profane as entertainment... They lust for what should not be lusted after People look to false gods to be their savior A lot of melodrama There can be a fiend in the family Carnage and Mayhem to a hypnotic beat calculated to stimulate emotions Some people of stature are really just infants More good material to make us numb... Numb to the nausea we should be feeling An indictment of the abuses and malfeasance of big Pharma Big grift... Like a Trojan horse... preying on gullible, stupid Americans Elizabeth Shue looks like The Mummy. How anyone could view her as sexy is beyond me These super creeps could easily find lucrative income streams outside of this big corporate monster Mortals at war with godlike super humans Gross Pornographically violent Everything is about selling a fantasy...

9.0,5 February 2024,
10.0,5 July 2022,"It is an amazing series in every way.

Amazing characters amazing story amazing world amazing comedy and amazing brutality.

No better superhero series out there."
9.0,19 May 2022,"This is a series that seems to take Marvel/DC as a starting point, but then mixes in the heart of Game of Thrones (at that show's height) sly, snarky corruption tropes, and violence. Daring then, but the premise works more often than not.

There's quality acting, writing, satire, emotion, and effects here consistently. It's never less than entertaining, at least going into Season 3 as I write.

Only loses a few points for me with a couple of weird side plot storylines and character niggles (e.g. A certain secondary character's 'church story', in the second season, felt often lightweight, odd and out of place for me); and for perhaps going over the top and outlandish at a few points, as time has gone on.

Yes, we know it's about comic book superheroes, but for me The Boys always works at its best when at gritty, small scale scenarios, rather than trying to ever build up anything to match (and struggle to keep up with) say the MCU's often now boring and redundant, ever expanding, timelines.

If it then maintains the overall quality, and enough small scale centring so far that its excelled on, season 3 is going to be a blast. Along with the Invincible series, Amazon I have to say seems to be leading the way right now with this when it comes to the best superhero themed fare on the screen. They're considerably ahead of the game, compared to Marvel/DC's/Disney's lame, current efforts in comparison."
6.0,18 May 2022,"An original take on the superhero genre with a beautifully hostile, unpredictable environment created by ego-driven temper-tantrums of a super-powered man baby. All backed by a well-oiled PR machine presenting him and his team as world saving superheroes to be adored and worshipped by the populace.

This is well done, packaged together with a deeply dark comedic approach, as The Boys, a group of normies, try to thwart the powered villains and the corporation that backs them. The story is beautifully character driven with each of the main characters fully fleshed out with world-impacting strengths and weaknesses. Despite numerous plot holes, the one thing that holds fast is the adherence to characterisation and inner motivations driving all actions for better or worse..

Following a fabulous season two, an eagerly awaited season three is about to drop. The follow over from two is excellent and sets up numerous mouth watering possibilities."
4.0,5 July 2022,"I love the series. Due to the sarcasm, in which each character plays his role and how they really are, they are behind the show business. See how they are without the perception that the public can see, that not everything that wears a cape is good. Thank you amazon for this entertainment."
10.0,30 July 2019,It is very well written with a different take on the superhero world. Characters you really develop a feeling for or against. The only thing I would change would be to have more episodes in the season.
10.0,15 June 2020,"The Boys is an awesome show, that shines because of acting, visual effects and musical score on the foreground and then on screenplay and storyline.

It has superb acting performances by most of the cast. The ones I loved more were Homelander, Queen Maeve and The Female (quite a natural performance)
It sets the mood in a very good and convincing way, but in the process gets many disconnections in terms of storyline, development and plots. That's the weakest part of the show.
It is superhero cheesy and has black comedy, while funny at times and making laugh, that is not enough, because the entire atmosphere of the show is all but funny. It's serious, grim and a little depressing.


What season 1 most of all needed was 2-3 more episodes, increased development and sense of dangerousness. That's not a theatrical show in which actors ""happily"" jump up and down together and die ""randomly"" together. Give it a purpose, a straightforward path and real brilliance.

If it's too late and the second season's already been shot, then, I guess we just have to wait and see if the writers understood the little minuses and worked, hopefully hard on correcting them. If not, we are set for another ""8"" episodes of CGI and action cheesiness."
10.0,19 September 2020,"Best ""hero""/anti hero movie ever! Perfect cast and cinematography, tons of dark humor and perfect satire:) A must watch!"
10.0,29 September 2019,"Anyone who thinks this series is as good as Breaking Bad or the Sopranos and can thus give it a 10/10 is either paid to post a positive review or they simply use a binary function of 1 = bad and 10 = good.

That said, the series is a solid 7.

Without providing spoilers, the series feels that it tries too hard to shock, to be vulgar, and when you realize Seth Rogan is a producer you can begin to understand the thought process. The story of bad people with special abilities who are posing as an analogy for whatever sociopolitical message the producers and writers want to preach isn't even remotely unique. This one has some quality actors who do a good job in their respective roles, but too much of it feels forced and comical. Too much of it is over the top ""shock you"" material. Sure there's some lead in with cutesy innocence that's shattered by brutal vulgarity, but they return to that well too often, and the same methods are used here that are worn out on all series that try to survive the cuts. ""I need to tell you something"" right before the reveal of information that makes the character reconsider their previous wishes to spill their guts.. followed by ""no, it's not important, we can discuss it later"".

The series is too predictable after the 3rd episode. Once you get the ""this guy good, this guy bad"" thing down, you can guess the rest.

I gave it a 7 because of the cast and the CGI. I don't care for Elizabeth Shue as an actress, but she does a good job here. The series strives to sicken the viewer, or arouse them.. depending on your fetishes."
9.0,15 June 2022,"Every storyline in Season 3 feels like it was written by cable news editors. Frequent scenes of intense gore are used to trick the viewer to thinking they are watching an action narrative, but it becomes painfully obvious around episode 3 that the show is a vessel for pushing political ideology."
10.0,26 June 2022,"Everything about this show is amazing. From the actors and their performances, to the script for each season. Everyone was cast perfectly. One of the best shows of all time in my opinion. It may not be everyone's cup of tea due to the violence, language and well everything. But, if you want something different to your typical superhero series and films, this is it for sure."
9.0,12 October 2020,Usually hate superhero shoes but when the first season of this came out i was HOOKED. Need season 3 to come out now
9.0,28 July 2019,Loved every minute of this show. Give it a chance and you won't regret spending your time.
7.0,7 August 2019,It's very good tv show I finished it in one day Best new series in 2019
1.0,5 January 2021,Must watch this series. It has a combination of many things which makes it very entertaining.
10.0,4 August 2022,"The boys is an incredible show all around. The plot is so special delivering a reality in how superhero's would actually be in real life. The characters in this show are great, homelander and butcher deliver the best performances imo giving some of the best acting this year. Everyone's acting abilities are stellar. Second best show of 2022 so far better call saul slightly beating it."
10.0,11 January 2021,"After finishing game of thrones I was looking for another show to binge watch in this quarantine period and after hearing good things about this show I thought I'd give it a shot, little did I know I would find a show even better than game of thrones Carl urban jack quaid Erin moriarty and Anthony starr put in amazing performances which warrant a watch on their own I found myself truly caring about the most evil of characters, truly bizarre."
10.0,28 July 2019,"All the characters play their roles so well, I feel like this is what superhero's would actually be like behind the scenes. The scene on the hijacked airplane really shows the true colours of the heroes. Give it a try you won't be disappointed even if you hate the superhero genre."
10.0,28 June 2020,"In my opinion the high rating could be due to recent frustration by fans of this genre, but with that said, this show is definitely good.

However, some aspects don't quite fit and it seems like they are trying too hard. Do we really need to hear any more about social media, PR, pressuring government leaders, blackmail, etc? Just focus on the us vs. them and leave the fluff out.

My other gripe is the accents, which just makes it hard to understand the actor's lines. Stop making me focus so hard, I'm trying to catch up on my social media feed...."
8.0,14 September 2019,"While the premise of a superhero spoof is a good one, I found the comedy to be petulant. It wasn't until I finished the season that I became aware that Seth Rogen is one of the three showrunners. I binge through the season, but it felt like walking through deep mud. It has the blood and gore of an adult movie, but the comedy suitable for teen Nickelodeon. Maybe if they replaced Seth Rogen with Seth MacFarlane, the show could have been more enjoyable and gotten more laughs out of me."
9.0,25 July 2020,"I watched this serial in two evenings, because I couldn't stop. Firstly, the plot is very interesting, it based on comics, and I really like that it shows adult version of superhero theme. Secondly, the cast is great, my favourites are Carl Urban aka the Butcher, and Antony Starr aka Homelander. Thirdly, the action is very cruel, with a lit of blood. So, it's great serial about superhero."
10.0,28 June 2022,A show that manages to not keep any episode boring the action is amazing and the fights Are never meaningless nor boring the characthers Are great and not a single one is boring or not interesting the show has a good plot and flow and is something thats worth a watch.
7.0,2 July 2022,It is asowe series must watch who are 18+ it is full of fun and it's not like a normal super heroes story it is totally different i love this series. 💥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

10.0,28 January 2021,"Wonderfully unPC comedic take on corporate America, I hope it runs to many series"
10.0,6 July 2022,"Sci-fi\fantasy entertainment, when done well, holds up a mirror to the world. The Boys is not a superhero show, it is 'the office' or 'the thick of it' but with superheroes. The Boys does this parody better than any current TV show and does it without being preachy or one-sided.

I suspect that many of those people whose affiliations and beliefs are being lampooned are even aware they are the punchline.

The writing is punchy. The acting from everyone is superb. The pacing is spot-on. Visual FX are measured and not overused or used as a crutch for weak storytelling. It is shamelessly for grown ups.

The Boys is the antidote to the saccharine, obvious, overly polished, souless rubbish being pumped out by the other streaming services."
10.0,4 August 2019,Good take on superheros. Non stop action to entertain. Definitely best TV show of the year. Just shows they are more messed up than the rest of us which in reality prob would be the case. Hail homelander.. what a character...Go watch brightburn too if you want more.
9.0,28 July 2019,If your into people with super powers But also not immune to the problems of the world this is the show for you!!
10.0,22 June 2022,"Homelander is Trump now. Great - let's all ooze over how big and bad he is and how dumb the fictional Americans are for liking him.

This could have been a countercultural show - the good guys are the bad guys and the bad guys are also the bad guys because anyone dealing with power who isn't guided by a higher good is doomed to become tyrannical.

Instead we are getting allegory for modern times...

Brilliant, original writing /s."
9.0,31 August 2024,The Boys was funny till season 3 but started messing each character in season 4 by showing them struggling with themselves or stuck with their past and has no meaningful story. The show is full of Gross and Shocks that's all (like sitting on a cake and s3x torture there are many such scenes). The show pretends to be diverse but actually forces its own ideologies by showcasing the villains trying to oppose them again and again. Its okay to have ideologies as it's human trait but not on the cost of good plotline and meaningful story. The Season is filled with each Heroes having their s3x kinks which is not even connected to thee story. The season is just surviving cause of previous season and Marketing.
8.0,24 August 2022,"A twisted tale of superheroes owned by a corporate company called ""Vaught"" where all superheroes have their issues to deal. This is I think the most realistic take on superheroes produced so far in movies or television shows.

The script clearly connects the ""misoginy"" , the ""sexual harrasment"" ""brandings""""personal crisis"" and ""corporat frauds"" and fits perfectly into the story.

This is a story where all characters have flaws. I have finished season 1 so far and definitely continue watching it."
9.0,5 November 2020,"This series attracted quite a bit of buzz with both season 1 and then even more so with season 2. I was not passionate about watching a gritty, mature superhero series that capitalized and focused on gore. However, I was wrong because there is a lot of character development and the writers take several risks with its characters.

I am a huge fan of Jack Quaid now. I would even say that he is a better actor than his father, Dennis Quaid. His character Hughie is the heart of the show. He seems to be a constant, the one character that has a moral conscience and desire to truly be good. One of the best attributes of Hughie is his kindness and ability to empathize with several of the characters, including Billy Butcher. Karl Urban plays the rough Billy Butcher who is on a warpath to avenge Supes who have wronged him.

Billy Butcher creates a team named The Boys. Each member has been wronged by a Supe, besides Frenchie who seems to have a certain knack for determining weaknesses of Supes. The focus of the series is Supes vs. The Boys, but using a cloak and dagger structure in the first season. There are no outright conflicts, but continuous spying or reconnaissance throughout the first season.

This is why in season 2, it is surprising to see backstory for certain characters. They even allude to a certain mystery regarding Hughie's mother that will most likely be solved in season 3. The audience does not actually ask questions about the Boys' past or even Supes that belong to the Seven. I inferred incorrectly that Hughie's mother had passed away, so I was shocked when I was wrong. I wonder what other secrets the writers could be hiding.

Season 1 is far more focused on building this new world full of superheroes. A lot of time is spent with Homelander, the leader of the Supes. Most of the superheroes are modeled after heroes from Marvel and DC; Homelander is modeled after Superman. He does not have the same positive qualities of Superman. He is a complete sociopath and mentally deranged. There are very many examples of this throughout both seasons. His teammates, notably Queen Maeve and A-Train, are also explored in season 1. The Deep and Black Noir remain mysteries in season 1, but they are featured more in season 2.

Another surprise is the high mortality rate amongst the characters of the show. The writers are not scared to swiftly kill off characters. Some of the characters they kill off I disagree with. I feel that there could have been a fascinating exploration of character dynamics, it felt like a missed opportunity.

Lastly, there are a couple actors that appear from Timeless and Supernatural. I know this is because of Eric Kripke, but it is nice to see. I do highly recommend the show. I am disgusted by the amount of gore depicted so I always had my phone near me so I could look at something else when visually repulsive scenes occurred. I suggest you watch the show and recommend it to friends! I hope that you watch it and like it!"
7.0,8 October 2020,"Best show on TV right now. Homelander is genuinely the most unsettling and unpredictable character I've maybe ever seen on the small screen. I'm totally invested in the rest of the characters, too. It is also relevant and clever. Oh, and there are heads exploding. Frequently. Which is splendid."
3.0,11 September 2020,One of the best series I've seen in a long time. A more realistic take on the superheroworld.
10.0,6 September 2020,

10.0,12 June 2022,"This show is a jewel.

I've never seen anything like it, the satire is incredible.

It truly critics the popularity contest that literally rules our world nowadays."
9.0,15 August 2022,"Modern day Animal Farm style allegory: both moral and political. Writers did an amazing job portraying our current life, social and political discords, moral dilemmas and so much more in the form of ""Supes"".

Vought is clearly the Disney+++"
9.0,11 September 2023,"There's nothing new with deconstructing the superhero genre. Doing it tastelessly makes it subpar. There's a distinct tendency for homoeroticism which doesn't bring anything to the table other than disgust.

The lack of imagination when it comes to characters being puzzled with their situation that really forces whatever suspension of disbelief you can bring to watch a genre which already requires plenty.

Establishing shots are too many and too slow with not enough payoff for them. They make their way to a painfully dull season 1 finale that doesn't tie-in with the season 2 plot in any satisfying way.

There's heaps of cynicism, hedonism and distaste in this production which seems to wantonly mock what it means to be alive and a human being.

You're better off rewatching Watchmen."
10.0,29 December 2022,This depicts what it will be like if actual humans were turned in the superheroes in real life not the heroic BS. It shows the power struggle and the human emotions and wanting to be in the spotlight Etc. But the last episode season 3 left everything I watch feeling pointless they literally had one job to do that for some reason didn't get accomplished it was so dumb they could have released did a better job of turning it around if they weren't going to actually do what we've all been waiting for them to do. It was entertaining thus far but there is tons of Gore and violence to the max and weird sex stuff just a heads up.
10.0,19 June 2024,"The Boys series stands out due to its compelling narrative, which subverts traditional superhero tropes with a gritty, realistic approach. It explores the darker aspects of superhero culture and corporate greed, offering a refreshing and often brutal critique of power dynamics and societal issues. The complex characters, each with their own moral ambiguities and deep backstories, add depth and engagement. The show's high production values, intense action sequences, and sharp, often dark humor further elevate it, making The Boys not just another superhero story, but a poignant and thought-provoking commentary on contemporary issues."
9.0,21 June 2024,"This series highlights what the world would be like if it were governed by superheroes, sadistic heroes who no longer take pleasure in saving and therefore start killing... the actors play their respective roles really well, no sense in this series it covers all the themes a series to absolutely watch... it deserves much more visibility the series tries to bring new things to each season which makes the series pleasant to watch. If this series has already won an award it is not for nothing.. can't wait to wait for the next seasons and the universe which is expanding more and more the boys is a masterclass I repeat the boys is a masterclass."
7.0,28 July 2019,"At least it has Simon Pegg in it, who Hugh was based on. And I kind of can't picture the show without his involvement.

It's not as Garth Ennis as I think it should be, it's not as vulgar and offensive and fun as he usually is, and certainly as The Boys was in print... but it comes really close to making that mark, and that is a breath of fresh air given the way that both comic books, and the movies they are based on are going.

Ultimately, it's still vulgar, offensive, bloody and funny, even if it could have been more.

And it's only 8 episodes, which seems a lot like they aren't trying to drag the story out just to add more, and that is also refreshing.

Ultimately, it's a cure for modern comics in a very late 90s British Invasion kind of way"
4.0,1 August 2019,"For example: In Episode 7, they were blown and ran into underground in a safe house, the young Romeo Hughie still kept calling Annie but got no answer. Hey, you guys didn't know they could trace back the location where you were hiding with your cell phone? And the other guy Frenchie still on his laptop? Jesus, this is the common sense even a guy like me would know when being hunted, the first thing you do is either dump your phone, or turn it off, or take the sim card out and snip it in half or whatever to make you disappear from the cyber space, still used your phone and got on line with your laptop? Jesus.....@#$?!"

10.0,29 June 2024,"The Boys is an excellent show full action, great character dynamics and more. Throughout the show we see how the boys is a parody of the super hero genre as a whole and also mirrors and symbolises real world politics. I will say, it's a great shame to see a lot of the fan base giving season 4 bad reviews as in my opinion is just as good as the first 3 seasons if not better, episode 4 was a masterpiece of Emmy worthy acting coupled with brilliant writing. The narrative season 4 is taking is in my opinion very good, mirroring the divide between real life left wing and right wing politics in the form of homelander supporters vs starlight supporters. All around s4 is continuing the greatness of the first 3 seasons and I hope it continues to improve as it has been thus far."
9.0,19 October 2020,"This show easily has the most unlikeable characters in a TV show ever, and I get that's the point with the Seven. But the problem is that this show is so black and white. The characters for the Seven are just bad. There is no complexity to it or anything, they are all just awful, unlikeable and people that just are painful to see on your TV. Would not recommend due to just awful characters."
9.0,11 July 2024,"The Boys started off with brilliant writing that turned the superhero trope on its head in a way that exceeds the excellence of even The Watchmen. Season 1 was simply fantastic. Season 2 was also great.

But Season 3 began to feel bloated as the number of characters grew and resulting storylines ballooned, causing the show to lose some of its focus and edge.

Season 4 continues this trend, especially in the first two episodes pushing main characters like Butcher and Hughie to the sidelines while spending too much time on lesser ones.

HIghlander, however, has grown with each season, and become more and more terrifying. Every single scene with him in it leaves viewers on edge, never knowing exactly what he will do next. Concentrating on his story arch, and building the others around the efforts to stop him would vastly improve the show and bring it back to its roots again."
10.0,2 September 2020,Predictable as usual with all thses. Bit of action then 4 plus hrs of boring character development and story to fill up episodes.
10.0,5 August 2019,"What I saw was unimaginative writing, mostly same old, same old. But typical Hollywood thinking, we'll just put some nudity and sex in and call it ground breaking. My eyes are rolling. Been here, done that."
10.0,11 June 2022,This show is one of my faves. Initially when i saw the trailer I just thought it's a cheap version of DC or Marvel characters. Boy was I wrong! Each actor has been perfectly cast in their roles but shout out to Anthony Starr who is simply terrifying! Season 3 has now begun at the time of me writing this review and the show gets better and better as you get to know each character more 10/10.
7.0,1 July 2022,The concept of this series is excellent. The way that this series humanizes this super humans (or superheroes) is incredible. The realism injected in a otherwise sci-fi context is what really sold me on this series.
1.0,15 July 2022,"Nice to see a great series without too much political wokeness !

Would highly recommend , great characters , great story building and a new modern take to a super heroes series Can't wait for season 4 to come out."
10.0,11 June 2022,"I haven't read any reviews for this here, but I'm guessing that many of them share my relief that this isn't just another MCU or DC Comics superhero series.

It's about time someone made a superhero show that's not only believable, but has a deeply cynical - and IMO quite accurate - outlook on modern corporate-sponsored life and late-stage capitalist dystopia.

Each of the characters is, in their own way, very relatable and complex. The writers and directors don't seem to be in a rush and yet they manage to cram in so much social/political/economic commentary that you really have to pay attention to catch it all. Quite an accomplishment given that it's also great as a standalone superhero soap opera.

I don't remember a character in any television show or film that I love to hate as much as Homelander. What a prick. And he personifies all that is wrong with our militaristic forays into the world at large along with all the ritualistic jingoisms, propaganda and lies we seemingly must be told in order to continue supporting it despite decades of unmitigated foreign policy failures. I mean really, Homelander is basically Dick Cheney with a cape and superpowers!

The other characters are also very good, despite a few of them taking a while to develop during seasons 1 and 2. To wit, A-Train and The Deep start off a bit shallow, almost placeholders to keep the plot going. But by the end of the 2nd season and 4 episodes into the 3rd, they are fully developed human beings and important parts of the story.

On the corporate side, Vought stands in as the evil mega-company with nefarious and secretive plans for world domination. It's all about money and power (and superpowers, no spoilers here though).

This series meticulously builds a backstory through references both subtle and explicit and by season 3 we've got a fully developed universe, alive and breathing.

Just as good, The Boys is one of the rare exceptions in superhero themed content where great CGI and effects are not over the top or used too frequently. That's not to say they're not awesome because they are. Just the right amount of blood and guts keeps it believable.

You won't have to switch off your brain to enjoy The Boys, quite the contrary. This is the grown-up superhero story for those of us who've become jaded and annoyed at the rampant class inequality and unaccountable powers that be which have totally captured our ""democracy"" for all intents and purposes.

Very highly recommended, but you'll absolutely need to start with Season 1 and not skip any episodes!

An easy 10/10."
10.0,9 July 2022,"One of the best series ever, everything is perfect , one of the best villians tooo, it s just tooo goood. You have to watch it, trust me worth the time..."
10.0,8 July 2024,"When I first heard about this show I saw it as just a silly knockoff justice league. After watching the first episode I was hooked. It's so much more than a knockoff. It's entirely its own thing and beats every single superhero show I've seen in my life. I love the clever use of dark humour and its ability to laugh at all political beliefs without truly causing unnecessary controversy.

Many shows experience a drop in quality as the seasons carry on, rushing to offer their starving fanbase new episodes so they can take all the money. Not this show. Banger upon banger. I love this show so much I went back a bit over a year later so I could rewatch all of it with my partner and now we're both waiting excitedly to view the new episodes together."
8.0,6 July 2024,"If you haven't seen this series yet then you are missing out. I love every season of this show. I don't care about the negativity from this current season, just enjoy it and have a good laugh. There are some scenes so far in Season 4 that you will definitely be laughing at for days. Great casting as always and Homelander brings his A game this season. Watch Gen V as well so you can get some parts of S4.

Hope we get another season at the very least. It's one of the most entertaining shows during a boring summer. I actually look forward to each week to see what they think of next. They never let you down if you like blood, gore, raunchy jokes about supes. So many good characters I can't pick just one to hype up. Imagine what super heroes are really like behind the scenes if not written as clean, classy, ""how can we help"" super heroes you see from Marvel and DC (which I like as well). It takes a funny spin on all the super heroes you are used to but it's not for kids lol."
10.0,12 October 2020,"Lots of pretty colors and violence and sex to keep the sheeple happy. Most of the characters are the mainstream American stupid that seems to drive most movies and tv anymore. A few act like they have brains, but most are just props for the lazy writing of the day that can only produce conflict and suspense by stupidly falling into one trap to the next."
10.0,8 July 2022,"The third season has gone too far with the shock factor in my opinion. The show has always had random heads exploding and such but this season is a bit much. It seems like the directors/producers have looked for any way to to be as gory and disgusting as possible and thrown it in. All this, before the weird sex and fetishes. It's too much.

I've been to war and dealt with bodies that looked like the victims in this show. I don't need to see that in my entertainment choices. No one does.

The story line is great but I cannot continue watching this series.

""Viewer Discretion Advised"" is an enormous understatement for this new season."

10.0,24 June 2022,This boys series is too good awesome fantastic I like the Willam butcher character...he is awesome fantastic..guy his acting is badass...are villian is also a good and powerful...
10.0,16 July 2022,"Season 1 was PERFECT!!! Season 2 was bad, but Season 3 is amazing again! Yes!!!!

S1: 10/10 S2: 4/10 S3: 9/10.

This is really what The boys needed. Still it has some leftist politics on it, that seems to be tge norm this days. I hope it runs off soon this politics in your face phase. But otherwise fantastic."
9.0,13 July 2022,"Oh my gosh. Once again The Boys reminds us that this show is very violent. Some scenes are so disturbing and nasty, I can't even look at the screen. I was amazed by Antony Starr's acting as Homelander. We can actually see his emotions just from his eyes. We have Solder Boy but I still think Homelander is still the scariest. This man is insane. We can finally see the fight between superheroes, yeyy.

I feel sorry for Ashley, she shouldn't have been involved in this crazy thing in the first place.

I can't stand any more violent scenes but well we'll have another season."
8.0,26 July 2019,"Probably because he tries really REALLY hard to make his voice deep and gruff. Cockney, Kiwi, Kiwi, Cockney, and back n forth it goes. Remember when he played Cupid in Herculese and Xena? That was awesome!

Anyways, very good show, does a good job of having the ""supes"" be the fantasy parralel of people in power, like famous actors, and athletes, who are trappend working under the thimble of huge and wealthy corporations. It basically takes such concepts and applies the narative's to those born with super powers.

Even though it is well written and doesn't stray away from the continuities, there is a main flaw, maybe I'm just being picky, but it's a VERY formulaic series, the motivations, story lines amd plot points are just re-hashed versions of what we've seen over and over again. Sometimes a character might throw a line out there and you can accurately predict where the story will go from there. Or maybe you'll predict it right off the batt. But that's modern screen writing, stick to what works they say.

Still, a great watch amd the gore combined with ""superhoroness"" makes it stand out from a lot of tv and I will certainly be hoping for another season.

On another note, Supernatural is coming to its final season, that makes me well sad.

10.0,11 August 2019,"I get that it's a ""cool new take"" on a superhero genre, but it could be so much better. Cinematography is meh. Acting is mediocre at best, with the exception of the awesome Karl Urban. In fact, most of the actors are totally miscast in my opinion. I just finished it yesterday, and I keep wondering if I wasted my time watching this. I'm really not sure. I'll wait for season 2, curious if it gets better. And that's the biggest issue with this show. It has so much potential, but it just feels corny and plastic and cheap. 7/10 for some plot lines, humor, Frenchie, Komiko, Karl Urban's acting and the music."
10.0,4 January 2021,"And thats a matter of taste and completely valid. I keep feeling that even though it's 'edgy', it will have a bigger chance to charm a younger audience, like below 30, then an older one.

It's edgy. It's kind of original. It SEEMS a bit controversial. It's violent. It's dark.

But that's it. For me, it was just really boring and uninteresting. The ONLY thing in this product that really was a bit interesting to me was the character Starlight. For all the rest I just felt like I was watching the latest Seth Rogan show. Full of edgy and 'original' stuff, yes, but oh so empty and superficial. Totally inhabited by flat and completely uninteresting characters.

I made it to episode 5 and I really had to violently DRAG myself there."
10.0,2 July 2022,"Def worth checking out, superhero movies r my fav. But this gave a new twist and it's amazing. It brings out the real life grit of the shadiness of human behavior in superhero's."
10.0,26 June 2022,"The series I didn't know I needed, this series has become one of my favorites. The cast is outstanding plots are good and unexpected. Antony Starr's performance should get all the praise."
6.0,10 October 2020,Talk about a wild ride. Strap in and hold on. This Rollercoaster of a show literally has it all. Definitely not for kids!!
1.0,7 February 2021,Season 1- From starting you gonna love this show. It's having a different concept plus I really like how good the plot is . Cast played their roles nicely. The climax was superb. So it's fair to give it 10/10. Season 2- This season was so entertaining from start. Plot was good too not like the first season. Some funny scenes was there too. But what I like most about this season was the climax once again. Really nailed it. 9.5/10
10.0,17 June 2022,In a world where there are people with super powers would they be heroes or would they abuse their power? The boys looks at a scenario where their powers are abused and how they might be taken down by ordinary citizens. And if you think the MCU has made a fortune from that franchise it doesn't take much imagination to envisage the commercial value of a company that controls(as much as they can) a team of the most powerful super heroes. Having powers doesn't make someone a hero by default. The characters have depth and the casting is perfect. Don't let Karl Urbans London accent put you off. Being from London myself it was annoying me a first. But I've always had a gripe with why thry couldn't just use an English actor but he pulls it off and Anthony Starr as Homelander is excellent. His fake smiles and charm are creepy when you see he's just a psycho with the powers of superman. I absolutely love this show. One of the best series I've watched in years. Hope there's a 4th season and beyond. Enjoy.
8.0,30 August 2023,"Just pure perfection. I watched it three times and every time it doesn't cease to surprise me.

( I will just fill the review to be able to post it )

then I need to discuss the way forward with the name of the season and the s to be sure that you are hitting rock bottom and the other hand free building is as well as you can and it is not the FW bug but I don't think so much is the best way to get the new game of thrones and the other one of the best movies in the path of the game and the other two days of the game and the other two teams will be a father in the first event at tarn in the first half hours."
9.0,10 October 2020,"I havent seen such a clever series in a very long time. I cant even remember when i saw a movie that would be this original. The characters are complex, flawed, funny and they wont let you be bored. Hands down, the script is fantastic, I cant praise the guys who came up with this concept enough. The choice of lead protagonists was absolutely spot on. The plot is unpredictable and exciting, and usually thats a miracle to pull off. The first and second season are terrific. Its absolutely worth watching, Im not a fan of superhero movies, but this is a completely different category. This is truly some high quality series. Highly recommend."
8.0,15 July 2022,"--No Spoilers--

It's no surprise that Marvel has been losing its touch since the end of Phase 3.

With cookie cutter plots and a confusing way forward, I needed a break from it.

I got recommended The Boys by a few friends and decided to dip my foot in the water and watch the first few episodes, a few hours later I found myself getting water and snacks to fly straight into season 2, and the finale of season 3.

Watching these heroes fall apart, making mistakes and being milked for money and ratings. The ""behind the scenes"" feeling this series brought me was perfect and I have never felt this invested into characters that I'm rooting for and against. This realistic approach to ""superheroes"" and what they would really be like in the real world.

Normally, the human characters in superhero films/series are nothing but roadblocks or an attempt to bring these films back to reality. The human characters are well written, have a purpose and you can feel how vulnerable they really are against the likes of Homelander. But they pull through, even barely but the human characters feel realistic and don't feel forced into the narrative. Having their own personal issues and reasons they're fighting these ""heroes"" which brings the audience closer to them.

Overall, The Boys felt like a breath of fresh air compared to most of the cookie cutter superhero films and series being released. Having a narrative where it leaves you wanting more and more, characters that have personality and interests and most importantly, amazing action scenes.

I give The Boys a 9/10."
10.0,15 June 2022,"It's a pretty good tv show. A surprise in a good way. I wish the writing was better at times, and the characters can be annoying, but overall a solid 7/10.

I'm not impressed with season 3. Too much trying to make the audience feel uncomfortable with each passing episode, rather than improving the story or characters. If it wasn't for episode 4, I'd rate this season 4/10 or lower."
8.0,11 November 2020,"Season 1 was brilliant in how the story slowly lets the characters unfold in time with the story (there's a sense that something massive is going to happen, something to change course of time as we know it, forever). Season 2 speeds up that pace, which is fine. But it's repetitive in its dramaturgical build-up, and when characters aren't threedimensional it just gets boring. Breaking Bad is an excellent example of a tv-show that needed time to develop the character's story arch, and they deserved it due to world class acting and writing. Hughie's attempt at portraying himself as the centrepiece of the story, the protagonist if you like, the one who battles with the morale aspect of it all, when all we see is just a whimp or a sad pathetic little cunt. The pay-off for watching him walking around making faces for 10 one-hour episodes straight, is not even close to enough considering how outright painful and frustrating it is to see him trying to master complex emotional distress for his character. Having said that, his ending for season 2 makes sense, as does the others, it tails off nicely, saves it by a thread, but there's not much suspense left to play on. Another character that became one-dimensional is Butcher, and the sad lacklustre attempt at trying to give him some depths by introducing his father and the backstory of his brother, why did we even need to know that?? So him hanging out with Hughie would make sense? Yeah sure, but did you really have to spend an entire episode on it?? Juggling around different character archs seemed to be difficult for the writers on season 2. and the show's strengths from the first season; explicit scenes thru blood and gore and sex and shocking fetishes - became the shows cheapshots for the second season. It didn't really have much more to offer. There's a lot complexity with surrounding characters that aren't allowed enough time and space. I honestly got mostly pissed off watching it all unfold as I was so fascinated by the first season. Hearing midway thru season 2 that they're doing a spin-off series to just makes me sick, and dreadding the upcoming spam of content from amazon that is just full of gory cheapshots. I smell a new superhero franschise that is literally DC comics on a budget, and that's a real budget."
10.0,20 August 2019,"You know how all the superhero movies try to present you with an idol that cannot even stain the cape with ketchup? Well, here the bits are flying all over the room and it destroys all commonplace foundations of how we accept the supernatural 'saviors'.

'The Boys' has made the groundbreaking move in the era of superheroes. Remembering all of those villains in DC and Marvel, this series provides us with something more human, which is even more vile than the psycho mind of Joker and company. Here, all deadly sins that are swarming the society corrupt the ones that should be pure and saint. That is a dark side that has not been been shown enough to us and feels so novel.

Intrigues are everywhere and new stories and characters are dropping at you like those fainting fans seeing Superman. The episodes are so pumped up that it makes you angry at creators for only making 8 of them. The impressive thing is that within eight hours Karl Urban managed to stick to C-word better that Samuel L. Jackson to his 'M'. Witty crackers and cool accent is supported by seducing frenchie Tomer Capon and masculine Laz Alonso. But I cannot forget amazing Antony Starr that still is kind of a mystery and keeps his shell hard and closed.

I am extremely happy to have found this series and am truly excited to see the second season. More R-rated adventures though the modern life Sodom and Gomorrah are lying ahead like an oasis for a dying desert wanderer and I cannot even imagine what pleasures are lying in the shadows of that retreat from pompous flicks."

BUT. Whoever writes Frenchie's lines, please stop using Google Translate... Use the services of a proper translator, or any French people. Because this isn't French at all. While Frenchie's character is excellent and sincerely well played, he just loses all credibility whenever he says something in ""French""... This is actually ridiculous and sounds really amateur while everything else is crazy good. Every French people watching your series is like ""what was that!?"" when he speaks, and you're quite popular in France.

Have you ever heard French people trying to speak English? Well that's exactly what it sounds like 🙂 So...please...GOD PLEASE...hire someone to write the French lines (no, Canadian French ISN'T French, it's almost a different language, like the slangest slang you can imagine: we wouldn't understand either). Then this series would be just perfect 👌😉

No offense guys. Love you anyway.

The clothes of the heroes like Homelander were very basic and unprofessional, and special and beautiful clothes like the Avengers should have been designed for the heroes. Also, the visual effects and creativity in the decoration of the movie scenes were not great, but the whole series is very good and also has an interesting and exciting story. But this movie with this story and good actors, if it paid more attention to the decoration design and actors' clothes, it could have more excitement and attraction for its audience."
10.0,10 October 2020,"One of the greatest antagonist of all time, never seen Antony Starr in any movie or TV series before but he nailed it so hard as Homelander, deserves an Oscar or even a greater award for his performance. To me that was the real art."
9.0,7 September 2020,BUTCHER is the best charceter in this show.A great concept by director.The script is cleverly created with great dialogue and supeeb acting.i finished whole ssn1 in 2 days.
10.0,8 July 2022,"I have heard that many people think that The Boys is better than all the series that Disney has released on Marvel, (I think they are based only on the fact that it is too graphic) the truth is that I do not think it is so I think that even Loki, and Moon Knight is better but even so The Boys is great, it has everything it made me cry, laugh and it gave me a lot of disgust but it's great. I look forward to the fourth season."
10.0,3 May 2022,"The whole series is incredible. I like the idea of the bad superhero or that fact they can't be perfect and they can die like anyone in the world. Because they are also just people. But they have some abilitie. I really like the blood and the random happenings.

I suggest this series to everyone. :)"
10.0,15 September 2020,
10.0,31 July 2019,"Was excited to see this show based on rating and reviews. I've never seen such high initial review for a show. But really 3 episodes in I just feel like tuning out. It's very caricatural writing and acting. Just feels like a waste of time watching it. And in the end it's still riding the bandwagon of super heroes. I understand it gets some teenage boys excited maybe. Even most of the humor falls flat. Still would be great to understand the high ratings, Amazon who owns IMDB??"
9.0,19 June 2024,
10.0,29 July 2019,"This is what happens when you go off the usual Marvel and DC comics: You find gems. And when you put a talented crew to make it a show, you end up with something you cannot stop watching until the last episode! Superhumans are humans. As humans, they can be good, bad, perv, stupid, depressed, junkies, hypocrites, etc. Putting on a cape doesn't make them gods. Collateral damage creates anger, vengeance. It was a hell of a blast, dark humor, twists, superb effects, great story. Karl Urban and Simon Pegg (Star Trek reunion?), Elizabeth Shue and the rest of the cast bring this one gritty tale home! Garth Ennis is one of the most talended (R-rated) comics writer. His materials should give production companies enough to give us TVShows to watch for a decade."
6.0,9 January 2021,Love it! I'm not a big fan of all the superheroes situation but this one caught me. The jokes made during the tv show are unique. You can relate to them and are not cringe. I recommend :)
1.0,16 December 2020,"This controversial and exciting take on the superhero genre is worth the binge. The show simultaneously tackles corporate America, racism, sexism and (anti-)heroism. It manages to reconcile many diverging viewpoints into action-packed episodes, while remaining character-driven. Top points for the gorgeous 6K cinematography."
10.0,20 November 2019,"I wasn't going to review this, until I saw Watchmen! Thank you for making an awesome and dark Superhero show. The Boys is what Watchmen should have been. The Boys is fascinating and addicting. Can't wait for more!"
10.0,31 July 2019,"This series caught me off guard as how the writers flip the super hero heroic plot & theme that we know and come to expect, and flip it with a totally different perspective. I really enjoyed it as it has an original take on the superheroic adventures we've come to know so well"
10.0,27 December 2020,Highly recommend. Totally different slant on the whole superhero thing. Quite fun. Can't wait for the next season.
10.0,8 August 2019,Basically injustice gods among us but with a lot more gore and a lot more unsuitable for kids content
10.0,14 August 2019,"Some of the acting is very good, some is pretty bad, but overall it's good.

The problem I have with this show is the writing is incredibly dull and simplistic. It's also gratuitously crude. I actually feel like this is written to appeal to children with no life experience, but then there are a half dozen scenes in every episode that just make that impossible because of the gratuitous sex and nudity.

So, who are they appealing to, mentally deficient, immature 20-somethings? I guess so, because that's the only group who could possibly continue watching this.

Now, after saying all that, it still doesn't rate a 5 or less. No, it's a good show worth watching.

But, after you realize all of this, you still end up constantly asking yourself why the writers were too stupid to see the truck-sized plot holes they leave in every episode, just because it's a cool story. I mean, I'm a master at suspending disbelief, but this is just too much to ask anyone.

So, in the end, I couldn't continue watching this past the 2nd episode. I liked it, but it just expects the viewers to be morons, and I'm not."
10.0,19 July 2024,"This show has lost all originality. It's annoying how every sup can now self heal and somehow they can be killed. How is this show ever going to move forward if the bad sups never die and can live forever, just like the almighty Homelander. The worst sup in this season was the ultra smart know it all. The writers have really lost what made this show so great. By introducing insignificant characters and super heros with abilities that don't really add to the story, makes no sense to me. I don't know if I can stick around for the season 5. This show is painful to watch as writing 690 characters in this review."
10.0,25 February 2021,Finding this series saved my life.. the most realistic superhero show/movie of real times
10.0,22 October 2020,"The Boys is an original show, but it's not perfect. It's got some bad dialogue and a mediocre plot, and it has some strong positives as well. The actors, characters, and drama are all convincing, and the show as a whole is very entertaining and engaging. Give it a shot."
6.0,28 December 2020,Fantastic series that delivers episode after episode It's what I think super hero's would actually be like in real life Totally recommend
2.0,26 August 2023,Amazing show very interesting. Because this is real superhero how they will be in real world. I was this show 2 time and I didn't realise it's so interesting how much all the decisions make by sup is based on statistics. I can like that's because everything is money now and that's more real. After the character development are insane every character have an beautiful character development and also homelander you can see his tragic back story and why he is like that. The action scene are perfect and they succeeded for the girl power moment in season 2 it's so cool I love it than marvel fail for this moment.
9.0,14 August 2020,"This show has it all! Acting! Story! Crazy! The most fun show to come out in a long time! Anthony Starr is amazing! Please see him in the incredible, not watched enough show, ""banshee"". I was totally engrossed in this show In the first 15 minutes. Watch it, you will not regret it!"
10.0,5 August 2019,"So good. I watched the whole first season in one day. But I also see lots of flaws.
The most important flaw is the lack of bright elements. Continuous dark things are shown to us one after another which drowns us. Even the scenes that seem to be bright are, in fact, dark because they show hypocrisy in the background. The colors are always dark and gloomy, most conversations are full of lies, and hypocrisy, selfishness, spite, hate, greed, and evil are given to us without breath. This rate is like 10% bright to 90% dark in the series and over time it drowns the brain. Such series should be at least 70% dark, 30% bright, or 60 to 40 is the best. In bright elements, colors need to be vivid and clear, and they should have something that makes us laugh; romantic, fun, childlike stuffs are needed. Also, balloons, festivals, dances, friendship, relatives... the nature, butterflies, the greens, the smell of the wet earth, the bounce of the blue water..."
10.0,18 July 2020,"Its has great production value, brilliant performances, Homelander & butcher are amazing, hevrythng great abt this show,, must watch"
10.0,29 July 2019,Best new series. I can't wait for season two. Very Entertaining. Total different take on Super Heroes. Highly recommended to watch. You will not be bored. Binged in one weekend.
10.0,9 September 2020,"I like the show except the swearing isnt funny, its just annoying. Not sure who thinks the F#&$s are funny or implying toughness but thats really awkward thinking. Make the cussing funny or make it bad ass... or expand the vocabulary. Show would have a widened viewer base if the language and placement of was tolerable.

Personally I really like the premise of yhe show and the actors are awesome... but alas...wife prefers to watch something else when I have it on and she walks in so out of respect, i go back to watch more later."
9.0,13 October 2024,"Season 1 of The Boys was outstanding. It was new, exciting, shocking, hilarious, and unexpected. Season 2 was entertaining, but slowly began to feel like more of the same. Season 3 started to go downhill in a big way, with poor writing, character arcs that made no sense, and absolutely zero plot progression. Season 4 is just unwatchable. I stuck through Season 3 because I wanted to give ""Gen V"" a try and figured I should be as up to date on the main story as possible before trying the spin-off. But nope...I give up. I feel like they should be giving me a paycheck to watch Season 4. Wow, how the mighty have fallen."
10.0,29 July 2019,Finally a great super hero show. Karl urban is great. Very well done. Can't wait for next season we need more episodes. Thanks again.
10.0,28 February 2021,"I enjoy many genres ... I loved Bridgerton.... I loved this. The best show of its type ever. Great story... cast... effects.

Highly recommended"
7.0,8 August 2019,"Not much to say. A MUST WATCH. Fantastic actors, absolutely amazing. Can't wait for season 2!"
1.0,9 July 2020,
9.0,28 September 2022,"This show was amazing, probably one of my favorites. But the thing that made me give it 9 stars instead of 10 was it needed to have just a little more action and superpowers involved. I love that Homelander can fly and he's really powerful and everyone has unique powers but it just needs a bit more action. In my opinion it's more of a drama type show, but i'm not holding that against it because it was still awesome, but if your really into just fighting and action, for example: Avengers, then maybe this wouldn't be the show of your liking. But in conclusion this show is awesome and you should definitely watch it."
10.0,31 July 2019,All I have to say is there better be more seasons.
9.0,10 August 2019,"Without doubt the best Superhero series ever produced. Great acting by the entire ensemble, perfect production and writing. Thank you, I'm loving it!!!"
10.0,9 August 2019,"The right way to do a superhero series It reflects the reality of the economy and entities to maximize profit by any means + superheroes that can actually kick the s**t out of people in a brutal gory way

MY TYPE OF SHIIIIIIIIIT!!!!!😍😍😍"
8.0,28 July 2019,"The first half of the season was really strong and had me hooked. The second half is where you start to see the dialogue, plot, acting and overall direction fall apart. Overall it's a fun watch if you go into it with low expectations."
8.0,3 August 2019,"Offensive, Vile, Paranoid, Violent, Perverse, Dehumanising, Base. For some reading these adjectives, this will be a positive review, ""Gotta see this, just love lurking around in the dark!"" For me this is an indictment against a growing trend in art to elevate the vile and stigmatize hope or goodness. This message is all the more dangerous when marked by good performances, a powerful production, and digested by an immature audience (and I don't just mean chronologically). Good and evil have been apart of the world's framework since the beginning, but, folks, when our creative communities slander and misrepresent good as evil and frame life as inevitable moral failure, they precondition our culture to see a future without hope or choice. I won't support this project and rank it as a 3 (vile) out of 10. {Super Hero Noir}"
10.0,10 January 2022,"Mammoth TV series. Wonderful series that gives continuous emotions and never tires, you always want a new episode, the plot is beautiful and the characters are all wonderful and characterized in a masterly way."
10.0,22 July 2022,"Best casting I've seen. It's disgustingly dirty but a beautiful at the same time. The deep is the best character 🤣 Nah but seriously I am obsessed with the character of homelander.

Homelander 👌 Butcher 👌 Soldier boy 🙌

Rapture..."
6.0,12 August 2019,"If everyone thinks is a good show and you don't. Maybe you are in the wrong, aye? That's all i have to say. Stop reading this review and start watching. Maybe keep your young kind's away from it though. :D"
1.0,26 December 2022,"Imagine a universe in which Superman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Black Panther, and The Flash were not independent contractors, but corporate employees managed by corrupt executives who are motivated by power and greed. Imagine if what you knew about your favorite superhero was all a facade, and that behind the scenes they were actually a terrible person concerned more about their public image and popularity ratings. Imagine that instead of saving lives they were taking lives. Instead of preventing crimes they were committing crimes. As powerful as they are, could anyone really stop them? ""The Boys"" may be the world's only hope to expose the truth and put an end to this dangerous enterprise once and for all.

This show is without a doubt one of the most interesting, addictive, and brilliant streaming service series to have graced our television screens in years. Mostly because there's nothing else like it; there's no other series it can fairly be compared to. The best way I could describe it would be like if House of Cards starred a corrupt Superman instead of Frank Underwood and he was being investigated by Walter White and Jesse Pinkman from Breaking Bad.

This show has everything: it's exciting, it's dramatic, it's funny, it's full of over-the-top comic-style gore, morally ambiguous complex characters, love, sex, violence, and plot twists for days. It's easy to develop a love-hate relationship with several of these characters. You'll go back and forth between despising them and having empathy for them. The series is thought-provoking to say the least. It invites viewers to not just merely judge a character's actions, but to consider their personal history which motivates them. This isn't intended to excuse the behavior, but rather, it is to simply understand it.

These are not one-dimensional characters that are ALL ""good"" or ALL ""evil"" (with VERY few exceptions); super powers or not they're just people capable of doing good or bad things (on a spectrum, of course). You'll find yourself questioning whether certain characters are innately good or evil, or whether circumstances outside of their control ultimately shaped and influenced the person they became. The multi-faceted ""human"" qualities these characters possess is what makes each episode and season unpredictable as to their outcome.

There is definitely an underlying theme throughout the story which is loneliness. Nearly every character is experiencing it to some degree, and struggle to form and maintain meaningful relationships. Each character has felt betrayed by someone they once trusted and have each suffered a personal loss. This isn't a mindless and meaningless superhero TV show. What it is, is a window into human nature itself and our desire to feel loved, wanted, and accepted by others. That, if we could just take a step back for a minute and look at who we perceive as the enemy, we may find there is more that unites us than divides us.

This is a series filled with complex characters that are actually interesting to watch and see how they develop over time. Their interactions with one another and relationships are also ever-changing. These are just some of the reasons for why The Boys is so compelling as a story and so addictive as a TV series. It's just so well-crafted, acted, and directed that the only bad thing about it is the waiting time between seasons. If I could rate this series higher than 10 stars, I would."
10.0,27 February 2021,Top tier TV. Amazing cast and really good cgi. Cant wait for new season
8.0,28 July 2019,I wasn't to sure about this show at all. But it's a Great premise and has some good stuff totally worth watching.
10.0,7 July 2021,"I loved it . After completing season 2 I feel empty and all I can di is wait. This is far better than what Jupiter's legacy is and to be honest it keeps getting better.

Literally all you have to go is patiently watch 1st episode and you will get clung to it."
10.0,18 August 2019,Amazon has given us another winner. This makes you think about the other Super Hero's in a very understandable way that is plausible in every aspect. A great team of actors gives promise to more more more.
10.0,29 July 2019,"The show has a great plot beginning with well written, complex characters. There were very few moments that lost my attention. The acting from almost all the cast is superb and you feel that they really embodied their characters. The production is great from the large action scenes to the small interactions and references. The plot twists were reasonable although somewhat predictable but only because everyone is expecting and calculating how a story will turn these days."
9.0,15 September 2020,"To preface let me say i am a very big life long fan of quality superhero stuff (DC primarily once i grew up). This show could have been something akin to the watchmen but with a truly original world. But what we got was another soap opera squandering its unique premise. The characters personalities are fleshed out nicely but once they do that its like the show just wants us to focus on their personal lives and struggles. WHY!?!?!? Sure a few characters might be interesting (Butcher in particular) but why not have the show be about their powers and the truly unique way they interact with their world because of them. But its more relationship drama and cliches that will have seen be played out in all other media that has ever been made before it. If you're not into it by the end of the first episode save yourself some time and just skip it. I wanted to like it, i really did.

Addendum: Season 2 is now airing Fridays? really?!?! in the days of streaming and online video. What is to be gained from starving your audience of content? Bone headed decision that i hope costs them their show."
10.0,11 October 2020,"This is what Supernatural should have been. With the gore, comedy and good twists. Never thought Kripke would be able to pull this off after Supernatural. Nice Job! Thank you."
9.0,22 August 2020,The first season was great full of new ideas and gives us a different taste of the superhero genre and an awesome cast can't wait for season 2.

1.0,7 August 2019,"I never write reviews. This show is so good, I want to tell everyone about it!!! Great imagery, edge of your seat storyline, good acting. Really makes you think differently about superheroes. Stop reading reviews and watch it now!! Are you a Spice girl?? I sure am!"
10.0,31 January 2021,"I'm not a fan of the typical superhero genres. My brother told me to watch this series and I put off watching it thinking it would be the same old. I eventually got two mins into episode 1 and ended up watching both seasons over two weeks. So so good. I'm a stickler for good acting. Everyone in this series is A game. It keeps you on your toes, so excited for season 3."
8.0,14 August 2019,So no words....other than brilliant. Well done! Character development was unparalleled...does a great job of bringing darkness into a superhero universe

9.0,20 October 2020,"The perfect blend of action, political drama and comedy."
8.0,5 June 2022,"You'll definitely like The Boys if you enjoy anything remotely fun about superheros.

Homelander is your main anti-hero character and you just can't get enough of his antics. He's a character that you'll probably start fanboying after a while, even though it does feel evil. The evil this guy portrays doesn't come from his actions alone, it's the perceived notion about him and the shroud that covers his actions. He is extremely obsessed about what he wants and a big time bully for all honesty.

Also, yeah, Stromfront is a reference to some weird side of the internet.

Also, Karl Urban plays Billy the Butcher and actually kills it with his accent. His acting is on point and once you find out why he does what he does, you start understanding the plot better."
8.0,20 September 2020,"Unbelievable - total disrespect for the graphic novels they were based on, could not care less about what anybody thinks or their supposed ""fan base"". They can all go eat a bag of dishes."
10.0,23 July 2022,The boys at the moment is the best show on television AND is a major improvement on the comics. Everything this show does improves on the source material. It doesn't go super controversial like the comics but it does enough to make your jaw drop and question what you just watched. If you want something pulled directly from the comics you will be surprised. They take a lot of liberty with this show when it comes to the source material but it WORKS. All the characters are great and Homelander is the best thing about this show. I would love a show just about him. Seriously if you aren't watching this show you are missing out!
10.0,25 August 2019,"This show was hyped up a lot to me and it had every chance to not live up to expectations. I'm not even a big ""superhero"" person, but I have to say, this show hit on so many levels. They took a very unique and interesting concept and transitioned it to the screen with perfect execution. The all new superhero's are not cheesy at all and some are, in fact, very dope. The violence throughout the season gets so creative and wild that it becomes almost comical at some points. I found myself laughing at some pretty intense scenes. But all in all, this is a must watch... and season 2 is gonna be lit."
7.0,6 August 2019,
5.0,18 October 2020,"This year had been horrible for the entertainment industry and the world in general. The boys is a breath of fresh air and honestly, I enjoyed season 1. It has to be the best season of the show. Season two however could use a little work. Character development stagnated after season one but it was good nonetheless. Overall, it's an amazing show and exactly what the superhero genre needs right now."
10.0,23 May 2020,"This is the story of a mercenary who is hell bent, on bringing down the Supe that raped his wife, caused her to go missing, and an average guy who lost his girlfriend to a supe. A self worthless man to afraid to ask for even a raise at his audio visual sales job. This is a story of vengeance, and of self perserviance. To bring down the corrupt ""Super Heroes"". Who claim collateral damage is not an issue."
9.0,11 October 2020,"It's one of a kind superhero show. Shows the darker side of the superheroes we admire. The Boys is an off-beat TV show where a group of extraordinarily ordinary individuals try to best the superheroes.

Anything more i say...will be a spoiler.

The Season 1 was awesome and ended in a cliffhanger.

Just go and watch it!"
10.0,18 September 2020,"This is the ""realistic vision"" of comic book characters that fan always wanted to see on screen. It's violent, it's smart, it's critical, it's funny. This show has everything, and the perfect cats."
10.0,28 July 2019,Everything I ever wanted from a superhero show and even more. I never saw anything like this before very courageous
8.0,1 June 2021,"The first 3-4 episode were great. Then it has been a slow and steady decline since. I was hopeful that the second season would breathe new life back into a promising show that was so good at the start. But alas, it just wasn't meant to be.

Idk where they went wrong. I dont have the time to care. I have a lot of hobbies so am very busy and stuff.

The story line potential is off the charts and I'm just left feeling like an empty vessel cut lose to drift at sea. Lost and without direction. Jeffery Bazos, how could you let this show turn into sometimes so amazingly underwhelming and disappointing? Thats not rhetorical either, Jeffery, we deserve an explanation.

7/10 because I did like it... but oh what could have been :*("
10.0,15 August 2019,
10.0,8 January 2021,Awesome! Urban is exceptional in this series. Best since dread.
9.0,14 August 2019,"Look, it is rare that we see a truly original series these days. The Boys is one of these. The cast is sensational and the story engaging and not the usual squeaky clean superhero genre. I was hooked from the first episode. Not for the faint hearted but if you have been missing the grit from movies like Watchmen you will love this series. I rarely give a 10/ 10 but in this case it is well deserved. I loved every minute and cant wait for season two."
7.0,22 September 2020,"I was mostly impressed by season 1. Murderous, abusive superheros operating under the protection of a multi-billion conglomerate is just good times. The underdog ordinary people in the resistance are all deeply flawed, but you can't help but root for them.

There is plenty of gore and WTF moments. if you're not profoundly disturbed at least twice per episode, you should consider seeking mental help.

Season 2 is nearly perfect. Stormfront's social media misinformation campaigns is timely and explains how the most insidious elements of our society spread lies to sow confusion and control the uninformed.

Highly recommended, if you have a strong stomach."
2.0,16 October 2020,"This is absolutely the super heroes show everyone wishes Marvel had the guts to do, it's just crazy how good this show is. If you don't like it something is wrong."
10.0,8 July 2022,"I found this series in 2019 and first of all I thought: ""meh, just another one superhero project, Amazon like others tries to join to comics adaptation trend..."" - and particularly I was somewhere right, but I have never imagined that film/series by comics could be like this one.

We just tired of Marvel/DC generic superhero projects, and 'The Boys' is some kind of a game changer. Anthony Starr's Homelander - perfect. Amost every his appearance in frame is a new templates for memes and gifs.

But as usual, producers tries to get maximum profit from the show. Seasons 2 and 3 finale are the same. The creators are stretching the series for as many seasons as possible."
10.0,12 December 2022,"EDITED FOR SEASON 4

When I first laid eyes on this show I just thought, ""what an amazing concept and execution"", how would super heroes actually behave in our current society? How come no one has thought of this before?

I am a fan of (some) of the super hero movie / TV show genre, but this is a breath of fresh air and one of the most realistic depictions of how society would actually be if such ""species"" existed.

It got me hooked from the start; it's entertaining, shocking, twisted, great characters and even though it gets a bit graphic / suggestive in many scenes I always felt (up until recently) that it served a higher goal, the shock factor of what these ""people"" are actually capable of doing and of course the analogies to the world we are living specially in the US, right on the spot .

The major villain is outstanding, I don't remember hating so much a character in recent years and also at the same time making the audience actually fear for whatever other character he is interacting with, given how unexpected the series is and how psychotic the character is, there is this amazing tension every time that he appears, amazingly done.

With that being said, I am feeling, having watched all 3 seasons, that the magic of the early ones is fading away... Within the show context for the most part I found that what happens is fairly realistic and based on how they build up and introduce the characters and the super heroes I would have already some expectation based on that and there are many parts throughout the show where it becomes a little bit foggy and questionable how people with no super powers manage to escape such extreme scenarios, I felt there was more than one occasion where the main guys and girls could easily be wiped off yet they magically got away.

And it gets worse in the last season, not only it becomes way more graphic and weird for no good reason but also the last episode had so many nonsense things happening I would even argue that the ultimate goal of the main characters could've easily been achievable based on the events that took place yet they seem to drag it out for another season... It seems to have become slightly more goofy and filled with a lot of actions that seem way of character for a lot of the protagonists. I was ready to give a higher score but I need to wait for the next season to see.

EDIT, SEASON 4 Well, I don't think this was an overall good season, it was okay, it had some good moments but if I had to put it in a few words: this could've been the last season.

Not because of the events that take place but because it was really dragged out. Most of what happens in this season could've happened in 2 or 3 episodes yet after a full 3 seasons they now decide to take their time exploring characters backgrounds, also they continue the trend from the previous season where the violence and the sexual aspects are graphic and explicit just for the sake of it, we get it, heroes are depraved that has been well established there's no need to continue to remind us with unnecessary grotesque scene, it just feels pointless.

The plot seems to have paused, Butcher is sidelined for the entire season, the feeling of these flawed group of people going against the untouchable power to better the world is just not there anymore.

It feels like a generic action movie with some good pop culture references, some nice political jokes and graphic violence.

At least they confirmed the next is the final season so I lowered my score because the show it's on a weird stage, but let's see the final season."
10.0,2 July 2021,"Just had to drop off my 5 cents, one of the best shows I've seen in years. So easy to watch, so interesting, unique humor, impossible to stop. Finished 2 seasons in 3 days, can't wait for more.

Season 1 episode 4 is the most cruel incredible absolute best episode of this show. If you're not sure if you like the show or not please bear with it at least until that episode."

9.0,5 August 2022,"It's an amazing show, a good mix of dark humour, action, philosophy and so much more. It takes you on a journey with characters that seem very real and you feel for them. The writing is excellent and so is the pace. The episodes are long but very well executed. A fresh required twist to the Marvel-DC universe."
10.0,29 July 2019,"If you like superheroes, violence, and R rated shows, this one is for you. It's so nice that finally, superhero uses his powers and you what they can do to ordinary people... amazing graphics! Very very recommended"
10.0,24 October 2020,"I would have given it a 10 but Billy Butchers accent is by far the worst accent I've come across since the original Mary Poppins. Please please please lose the accent and just let him use his native accent and lose the awful British accent he tries so hard to pull off but fails spectacularly. Stop stop stop, its ruining a perfectly brilliant programme!!!!"
8.0,5 September 2019,"What if beings with god-like abilities abuse their powers to push dark agendas? What if their actions, even if virtuous, have destructive side-effects on their environment? And worst, what if someone succeeds to instrumentalize them? What can mere mortal humans do against such injustice?

""The Boys"" is all about this very interesting subject. And it starts off with everything a series would need to tell a suspenseful, tragic and action packed story with a very original setting (at least to cinema/TV).

At some points, ""The Boys"" does succeed to be great. The way Not-Superman is displayed, for example, and the way he is being controlled by humans. The way the superheroes commit ""evil"" actions out of mere carelessness. The CGI is cool, the images are very dark and fit the setting.

But that's about it in terms of atmosphere. Every life-threatening situation for one of the protagonists is accompanied by a ""cool"" (better: goofy) punchline, every action scene ruined by some rock- or pop-music or other juvenile atmosphere-breaking track. Some scenes are meant to be satiric/funny but they just don't work. The result is a very strange patchwork of action, ""satire"" and tragedy, which just does not work for me.

Btw: if they had made it a comedy in the style of the ""hands-scene"" from the beginning, it might very well have worked, too. It is the mix that ruins the experience."
10.0,7 August 2024,"Really disappointing show, every season I give it a chance. But it's just the same thing over and over. They try to stop homelander he's too powerful they almost do it but they can't. Really weak writing and just the most needless, gruesome and grotesque violence, language and humor. They constantly call on these gross things for shock value and to stand apart from other shows but it's just nasty. I don't know why I have watched this far but I constantly get disappointed by this show. Save yourself the time brain cells and lack of enjoyment I suffered from the terrible show. It really is the same thing every season and it's so tiring. They can't come up with anything new so they just repeat the same season with new characters and slightly different storyline but it always ends the same at square one. Butcher almost does the right thing but is bad or vice versa and their ""genius plan"" to stop homelander fails and their backs are against the wall and new season. Oh yeah just the same thing again. Got to the point where I was just fast forward cause it was so hard to watch."
9.0,26 August 2019,"Boy what an impressive show! It had me hooked from the first 10 minutes of the first episode. The best way to describe this show is Deadpool meets Watchmen rated MA. Great actors and actresses with plenty of twists and action to keep you in the end of your seat.

Looking forwarded to next season!"

10.0,26 July 2022,"I think The Boys is a show that suffers from the scale on which it's trying to operate. It's got a lot going for it, with a very interesting plot and charming characters despite occasionally falling flat due to inconsistently written dialogue and a slight identity crisis."
8.0,18 June 2022,"Season 1 was fantastic, season 2 was good, season 3 like everything else in Hollywood - went woke. It's now a political statement wrapped up in a super hero show. BLM/Antifa good - white men evil. Yawn..... can't these idiots come up with something original? Also there is far too much Seth Rogan in season 3. He sucks and was never very funny - just high and stupid."
10.0,14 August 2019,"""With great power, comes great responsibility""...

Not in this universe!!! If you are looking for knights in shining armour, ready to sacrifice themselves for the greater good, check elsewhere. Those Sups are more vilains than heroes. Big egos and taking advantage of their powers, while their captain reminds us that the concentration of great power makes someone a tyrant, who commands by fear.

I feel happy for watching this series and sad at the same time, as I recognize that all these lies and misdirection of the people is not so far from the reality. It is really upsetting to acknowledge that those who seem like the good guys they are really the ones who pull the world downhill and this series reminds me that nothing in this world is like it shows.

If there is something I learned from The Boys, it' s not to wait from anyone else to solve my provlems, nor to put my hopes in ""heroes"" to save me. Let's all take our own action and maybe we will gain control of our future.

Can't wait for Season 2!!!"

10.0,15 September 2020,"A very original and different approach to heroic scifi tv show, although I have to admit the plot stretches quite unnecessarily, but it doesn't spoil the full experience. The only thing I don't understand in this whole TV show is what is the role of that Hughi. I actually see a place trough episodes for every positive or negative character, but I can't find a place for this one, literally if it didn't exist, it wouldn't even be noticed!"
10.0,12 November 2019,"I love this show. I was really exited about brightburn, and that kinda let me down. Then I saw this. Amazing action sweet gore, and even the occasional hot chick. And butchers character is the best one of all. His back, his motivation, and his voice and beard. I love the stars, and the feeling some of them have for each other. My only problem is the lack of action, which I'm sure they will fix in the 2nd season. But as I said. Great movie especially if you are into gore, nudity, and a good story and great characters"
10.0,8 August 2019,"Although I am a fan of the Marvel/DC universes, I was thoroughly impressed and overjoyed to see this trailer come across my email. This is ""reality tv"" superhero style.

What do you get when you mix ultra-capitalism at it's worst, the comedic and fantastic acting chops from Karl Urban AND Simon Pegg (Star Trek fans will love this returning duo amd it's so great to see Karl again), a cast of self-centered, raunchy, egotistical, potty-mouth superheroes, and a subtly maniacal ""superhero sales rep"" and you get what, in my humble opinion, is one of the greatest superhero television shows ever!

Many thanks to the writers for truly awesome and inspiring writing to show some of the truly heinous subjects that women are facing and shoving it right down our throats (pun intended). Adults need to see this and understand that the subject matter in this show is, in fact, both incredibly relevant but also empowering.

Additionally, the show's two main protagonists are a great and welcome balance to the chaos. Erin Moriarty and Jack Quaid are both wonderfully talented and do a fantastic job refocusing our interests from the ensuing madness to one of fun and frolic.

I could not recommend this any higher! Fantastic show, the ENTIRE cast was brilliant. Just remember...keep the kids AWAY!!! THANK YOU AMAZON!!!"

10.0,5 June 2022,"This show had potential, huge potential but now it turned out to be a big disappointment.

I will not go in huge detail because this website is owned by the same people that made this show so it will get censored into oblivion.

The only thing I will say is stop paying for it, stop buying from them stop supporting this."
10.0,4 August 2019,It is a great and a unique tv show. This is how tv shows are made good. It is a unique because in this superheroes are internally bad except one or two. It is a great tv show for mature audiences. Go watch it!

1.0,26 December 2020,"Better than LOTR, you should watch this... Acting, special effects, writing, characters all outstanding..."
10.0,18 November 2022,"The first season started off great, it had everything you could want out of a sci-fi superhero show... the acting is great, the cast is great, the CGI is great, the writing is great, the story is great etc... it shocks you and keeps you entertained and wanting to know what is next. One of the most intriguing shows I've ever watched and was excited for Season 2.

The second season, really fell off. It was so bad, it made me cringe at times. Lots of political stuff thrown in for no reason. Cringey characters. I don't remember much, and I don't want to remember much of it. Very different show than what Season 1 projected, and the response it got really pulled the show down in a way I did not think it would recover.

Alas, season 3 redeems itself completely!!! It's almost as if they took every complaint to heart and did everything they could to make it like season 1, but on steroids. Everything is better than Season 1, and the actors are more experienced and have more fleshed out characters, it's an absolute joy to watch this show. I could not recommend it any more than just WATCH IT NOW. Oh, and maybe breeze through Season 2."
10.0,8 August 2019,"I don't know how this flew under my radar but I'm glad I decided to watch this refreshing ,well written and brilliantly casted super heroes show . Hope there's a season 2 in the pipeline."

10.0,16 May 2021,"A great take on anti-heroes. I'd say this is probably the first take at a script like this. With multiple shocking moments to keep you gripped and a whole lot of drama, this show definitely deserves to be up with the greats."
10.0,1 April 2021,"Engaging first season, disappointing second season."
10.0,17 November 2023,"I liked this series but..

Superheroes in this series do not take part in much
missions, they are not responsible and well-trained.

They spent most of their time relaxing in their tower or
giving those 'kind' speeches on media and boasting their powers in reality shows.

They only care about money, their position n their fame
and are jealous of each others.

hence only some new characters are introduced per season.

this series like some real fights"
10.0,22 July 2022,"Season one was pretty good, good enough to watch season 2. Season two was slow and not quite good as 1. Season 3 is just the worst, it's all about abnormal gross sex, hate it! It's like you fired all writers and directors, and said he'll with a story line, let's just get as gross as we can."
10.0,28 April 2022,"I will be honest when I'm saying that I was hesitant to watch this show. I thought will be some lame comedic superhero template tv show. Oh boy did I was wrong. Quite a good show to watch. I can't say I like the gore and weird nudity at moments, but those things fit the narrative well. Butcher is heck of character, he makes the series great. The other are great too, but he keeps the party going. Good to see Giancarlo Esposito in yet another tv show, playing you guess it, a villain. There is something about this guy, he is really chill in his interviews, but when he play a role he is like another person. Corporate evil in disguise, ready to pull some trick on you, having a plan in advance. I won't be surprised if he plays major role in S03.

There was once very memorable element and that was the behind the scenes of Marketing and PR. The ""sups"" are just personalities that follow a script and must behave in the way their masters who pay them told them to do. It sounds very like every famous person in real life, just pretending, acting. That was very realistic moment in mostly fictional show.

Can't wait for Season 3, you saw the eyes of Butcher did we? I knew it, in order to beat them you have to become one of them."
6.0,25 October 2022,
1.0,24 July 2024,"The Boys is one of the best Superhero shows I've ever seen. While Season 1 was the best season of the series, Season 2 and 3 were also both very good and absolutely worth watching. Season 3 was fantastic. You don't even have to be a fan of superhero shows to enjoy this. It's violent, funny, thrilling, etc.. Everything you want in a good superhero show. When I first heard of 'The Boys', I thought it would be your standard superhero series, but when I actually watched it, I discovered I was dead wrong. After 15 minutes of the first episode, it was impossible to stop watching. It was a more believable take on what the world would look like if superheroes were flying around today, with characters that were unforgettably unique. There were times when I thought that the 'good guys' were the 'bad guys', and times when I thought the 'bad guys' were the 'good guys'. But in the end, I found that there weren't any 'all-good' or 'all-bad' characters, but 'all-human' characters, sometimes with more-than-human abilities. It's a super series, definitely worth your time."
10.0,27 June 2024,"Marvel should really take some notes from these guys, every single season has been crazier and crazier. They really know how to write in depth characters, writing is top notch, the actors are even better. I honestly can't think of anyone better to play Homelander, Anthony Starr you've done an excellent job! Karl Urban is also a delight to watch always doing something crazy. Plot is continuously interesting. Season 4 has been a blast and probably my favorite season so far, words can't describe how much I'm enjoying the new season.

This show is easily one of my TOP 5 of ALL TIME. A show that really stays in your head even after you've finished it. I love it!"
10.0,10 September 2020,Would given 8 but due to weekly release can't what kind of strategy is this in this unforseen times ..who suggested it ...release the episodes in one go

10.0,16 August 2019,"I'm at a loss as to why everyone here thinks this such a great series. It's simply written by a bunch of cynical narcissistic jerks who think they have created something special here. Well, they haven't. I'm just guessing we have an audience of spiritually depraved mostly male millennial's who wouldn't know the difference between Tolstoy and Garth Stein who somehow think this is a well written series. Why is it OK to somehow tie Christianity into this whole group of super hero's? Why not Islam, Judaism or Buddhism? I see through all of the poorly masked politically correct messaging that's going on here, nice try."
6.0,13 October 2020,"A breath of fresh air when it comes to superhero tv. Gripped from the get go and never stopped. Not once could you figure what way each episode would take you. You could definitely tell Seth Rofen had a part to play in this series. The acting was just brilliant, each character had their own story and role. Just a bit annoyed I've watched them all. Probably wouldn't be for everyone but if you enjoy superhero stuff and are sick of the run of the mill and have a slightly sick sense of humour, this will be right up your alley."

Please release the fourth season as soon as possible. Thank you from behind the scenes. I became a huge fan of this series and I live with it. I fell in love with the character of Billy Butcher. I want beautiful for him. Thank you for making such seriesAnyone who watches this series once will understand what I'm talking about. This series is very beautiful and there is no need to criticize. I don't recommend the movie. Anyone who doesn't watch it will lose their life. Really watch it to understand what I'm talking about."
10.0,6 June 2022,"I absolutely love this show. Very fast paced, funny, gory and unsettling. The only draw back for me is Karl Urbans terrible accent. I'm sure he passed the dick van dykes British accent school with flying colours but it grates after a while. Other than that, fab!"
10.0,26 September 2020,"So entertaining, it has everything, action, violence, drama, tragedy, and even a little romance. It is very very dark, but somehow it all doesn't feel like it's just there for shock value."
10.0,9 October 2022,"Alright, clearly, there is political messaging in season 3. What's interesting is that I think it's brilliant. I can't figure out whether the show is making fun of the right...or if it's making fun of those who make fun of those on the right. Well, I think it's the former, but stupendously disguised!

For instance, no one likes Hylander-whatshisface, but he became popular among a specific demographic during that one speach...that demographic I can only assume is lifted onto the screen because these men latch onto the likes of J. Petersons ""be a monster"" (but one under control). So they poke fun at that demographic for being so ""gullible""...while at the same time...admitting what's truly happening, right? Men ARE tired of apologizing for being men?

Ha, sounds...about right, yeah?

So we're supposed to think ""what stupid men for following Homelander""...but really we should think ""nah, stand up and be strong and lead, but not like that dick."" It's always a crossover.

Meekness is power under control."

It seems clear now, that no TV Station or streaming service has the balls to really realize a true Garth Ennis show. He is so much darker, deeper then the flat realization for the flat screen."
10.0,4 June 2023,"A nerdy friend of mine told me I have to watch this. This isn't the usual superhero drivel, he assured me. ""It's different,"" he said. WRONG. Just more of the same mind numbingly idiotic capering of dolts in tights and masks. The story is ridiculous and the acting extra hammy. I truly do not understand how tripe like this gets made, let alone watched by millions of drooling screensavers. I don't get the superhero derangement of Hollywood, except that it provides a convenient pretext for hacks devoid of talent to make money off the ignorant masses. I don't care about childish superheroes, even less about the politics of the simpletons who churn them out unceasingly. Needless to say, I told my friend never to bother me with excrement like this again."
6.0,20 September 2020,"I dont usually post anything on anything but this show got my thumbs up, it's worth a try if you are looking for a new show. It'll be worth it I promise. I won't spoil anything! But give it a chance :)"
1.0,18 June 2022,"It's s bit gory, violent, and 'woke'...yea, but great! It's attempt at being as truly and lively realistic to society today is the best part. The banter and profanity too!

If you are watching season 1 then you are going to watch season 2 automatically
although season 2 is not that connected with season but it hell of a ride

8.0,25 June 2024,
8.0,18 June 2024,"The Boys is so damn good! Amazon has been making good shows lately. What makes The Boys stand out is its fearless approach to storytelling. The plot is unpredictable, with numerous twists and turns that keep viewers on the edge of their seats. The show's dark humor and satirical take on corporate greed, media manipulation, and the cult of celebrity add layers of depth to the narrative.

The characters in The Boys are richly developed and multifaceted. Butcher and Homelander are such great characters. Karl Urban delivers a great performance as Billy Butcher, perfectly capturing his complex mix of ruthlessness and vulnerability. Antony Starr is chillingly and frighteningly convincing as Homelander, the psychopathic leader. The rest of the cast, including Mother's milk, French, Hughie and Starlight, also deliver compelling performances that bring their characters to life."
10.0,7 July 2024,"""The Boys"" is a daring and darkly satirical series that deconstructs the superhero genre with a fresh, irreverent twist. Set in a world where superheroes are corporate pawns and often morally corrupt, the show follows a group of vigilantes determined to expose the truth. The ensemble cast, led by Karl Urban and Antony Starr, delivers powerful performances, with Starr's portrayal of the menacing Homelander being particularly standout. The series masterfully balances gritty action, sharp social commentary, and dark humor, making it both thought-provoking and wildly entertaining. Bold, brutal, and unapologetically subversive, ""The Boys"" is a must-watch for fans of genre-defying narratives."
10.0,8 September 2020,"Can't help hating some of the casting choices. At least one star gets retracted because of him. He's just not a good fit, however good his acting is. Also too tall especially compared to Mothers Milk who's supposed to be big as the Mountain.

The actress playing Starlight is also not perfect. Not looking the part as well as over acting - annoying, or straight out a bad actress.

I also don't think The Female is played by the right actress. Too old looking.

Well these are personal annoyances. I hold the comic book in high regard."

9.0,8 December 2020,"I've been a fan from the start but after finishing the 2nd Season I feel a review is worth doing.

The cast is perfectly picked out all the way through, with an amazing amount of love for most of them in there own ways.

Karl Urban as Billy Butcher steals it for me, I've always found a foreigner doing a English accent entertaining and he does very good one, although it is played on heavily. But as someone who lives in the South East, i can confirm there are people who says what he says and the way he says it.

The superhero theme is massive today (which I am a fan of) but it's refreshing to see it in another light and that hero's aren't always what they are cracked up to be.

With loads of violence, swearing and laughs it is 100% worth a try if you are stuck on what to watch."
10.0,18 September 2020,"Excellent! Each episode flows to the next. Great acting and chemistry, writing, it has it all! There are only a few series that keep my attention, and this is one of them. Highly recommended!"
9.0,2 October 2024,"I really enjoyed the comics and found the story eye opening (not just because it is very mature in theme). I could see the creator was angry at the comic books industry with his very obvious portrayals of the big IPs and political landscape of the time. But it felt real and whilst the main characters were not good people, they were holding worse people to account and in the end nobody won.

I struggle not to judge this series based on the source material of the same name. I understand that there is a lots of things this story might not want to cover or just can't be shown. However, they have just thrown the source material out storywise now and that I think is a travesty, and smacks of them thinking they can tell a better story. They can't, and thus the story is filled with moments that miss the point or do not give characters their just desserts.

As for the casting, I think they did on the whole a good job apart from Huey. The actor simply can't depict the character, as he simply can't embody what the character was meant to be (Huey was meant to be a Joe everybody - I can't see this with this actor).

Karl Urban is perfect as Billy but he is a great actor so I expected that (his portrayal of Dredd was the same).

I can watch this series but to me it is just filled with missed opportunities at time when story telling has become so bland and uninteresting. This makes it an imitation in the end."
10.0,15 September 2020,
7.0,28 July 2019,"Best tv show based on a comic book, to date? It's probably at the top with Daredevil. Best news is they are already making S2."
4.0,29 July 2019,"The first couple minutes are ""what is this, so weird"" but it takes the right turn very quickly and it pulled me in and didn't let go.

Karl Urban .. i must mention him. He plays his typical badass character but in this case it is a master piece and everything just clicks. If he won't take any major trophy for this role I will be very disappointed.

Other than that, all characters are very thought off, the acting is spectacular and the music ... oh my god, the soundtrack is awesome.

This take on superhero universe is currently beating all superhero movies in last decade and I am waiting for season 2 of this epic story."
9.0,10 September 2020,"Gone are the boring clichés of.....superhero saves the world, while battling against evil enemies with contrasting powers.

The Boys is both unpredictable and fresh with a slight moral undertone.

A fantastic spin on the world of superheroes."
10.0,27 June 2022,"If you have never watched the boys you should it's an amazing show it has everything you might want in a show it has action, gore and nudity if you're into that 🤣 but anyways this show is amazing marvel and dc could never compete with this masterpiece amazing show."
10.0,10 January 2021,"I've watched all the seasons. Kinda hard to follow at first. I guess if your familiar with American comic characters, it all falls into place. You just have to piece the puzzle because it's made for the new generation. Great stuff."
8.0,24 August 2019,Waiting for season 2 bro.. Never see such a superhero series..

10.0,22 July 2024,"This is a show about AWFUL people doing irredeemable things all in the name of stopping awfulness. It's SO stupid but it's not a comedy, it's suppose to be taken a little seriously but The blatant hypocrisy is a very difficult to watch or make sense of.

The director or show creator obviously suffers from Trump derangement syndrome, and he bleeds into everything he touches. I want to watch a show that takes me out of the real-life divisiveness and awfulness but instead you get a show that exaggerates it to the nth degree.

To sum up, this is a show that wallows in a dumpster fire trying to pass it off as art."
7.0,17 August 2021,"One of the best series ever.

If you want to be entertained. Just watch this."

And Homelander is so.... Creepy, a maniac, with mental issue..."
9.0,8 December 2022,"Superheroic movies and series are real atractions. They're shot every year in a very big amount. There're prequels, sequels, everything at your preferences and wallet. The plot is as old as time: the battle between superheroes, who are certainly good and superheroes, who are evil or for the peace in the whole world and now we've got the Boys.

I khow the showrunner of this series by another famous series '""Supernatural"", tha was actually ruined after his leaving out this project. He can shoot, write scripts, which are full of unexpecred twists and jokes, choose actors for their roles and skillful people, who can turn any idea into a real sweet candy. Also he can choose a soundtrack and make out of an unknown person a real famous star.

The Boys has got an interesting plot full of blood, well-written dialogues, high-quality special effects and talented actors.

The Boys

The Butcher is very charismatic, ruled by anger and revenge, has real motives. The power of the team.

Hughie. Very uncertain at first, then a real leader of the team, ruled by justice. A conscience and the brain of the team, the canary.

MM. The family-man protecting his family.

The Frenchie. The former junkie with french accent. Kimiko. Frightened at first, willing to hurt everyone around to rescue her relative, than the part of the team, ruled by revenge.

Superheroes:

The Homelander, The real American superhero. The face of America. Hypocritical, ready for everything just for the money and fame. Unscrupulous, can frame his colleagues.

The Mave. Firstly, it seemed that she's a woman-copy of the Homelander, then she showed her other human side, it's really interesting to follow her story.

A-train, a flunkey, don't like him. He is in the team for fame and money and is afraid of losing it.

The Deep. A Flunkey number 2, don't like it. But hilarious and funny.

The Starlight. The most human out of all superheroes, the fighter for justice. The member of a team playing by her own rules, a secret agent. Love her.

The Soldier-boy, Oh, my gosh, I do love Jensen, he showed his other side, the acting (as well all the other cast, no-hate) is realy brilliant, it's super-interesting to look at him after the role of Dean Winchester. He's totally different here.

I really want to watch further, each episode is 1 hour-long and a lot of events happen per it, that thing makes it much more precious than other movies and series, that you can forget instantly after watching. The jokes aren't banal at all. The true masterpiece. I will go on watching it, for sure."
10.0,11 July 2020,"Such a great take on the superhero genre. It was awesome to see such a different side To these superhero's. Awesome story, great characters, funny and loaded with sweet violence and gore which I love. A+"
9.0,9 August 2019,"Superheroes, done before but not like this! Seen a few comparisons to Watchmen which is kind of understandable except this brings in the humour. It's like Deadpool took a seriously nasty twist, a few have slated the series (obviously didn't watch the whole thing or trolling for attention) but this in an ocean of superhero movies & Tv series really does stand tall."
10.0,3 October 2020,"Season 1's original take on superhero's was a slow grow. It takes a few episodes to get to the down and dirty, but when it does it is great dark comedy. The final episode is a climax with a very happy ending. Season 2 looses all that made Season 1 great, rehashing the same ideas and delving into ""serious"" romantic relationships dragging the whole season way down. If Season 1 is a solid ""8,"" Season 2 is barely a ""6."""
8.0,17 September 2020,"This show is one that I´ve never seen before, the characters are so well writen and thought about, you manage to either love them or hate them, for their true nature, but never making second thoughts of them, its not a normal superheroe show. Music, production, everything is so good it make it perfect"
9.0,1 July 2020,Found this little gem of a show while looking for shows to replace my regular exhausted shows. Premise sounded interesting so I thought why not. I was not disappointed. In fact my better half who does not like super hero flicks enjoyed it better than I have.
9.0,23 January 2022,"Ogirinal idea, great acting, good soundtrack, however something wrong with the pacing after season 1, episode 7. I've lost interest in how the story unfolds. Probably will give it a chance again in future."
8.0,8 September 2020,The first season was awesome but the second season is extremely disappointing and the biggest heap of garbage in the history of television. The writers need to be fired.

1.0,25 August 2020,"Simply awsome, Amzon prime really got the job done here a superhero show with a perfect plot, perfect execution, best cast, a great storyline on top of that exceptional production, directing The boys tells us what happens when you put in everything you hv got in a single show the result bieng a must watch show for everyone"
10.0,6 September 2019,"The acting , the scenes , everything was amazing . Billy butcher is the most badass character I've ever seen"
9.0,10 October 2020,"Season 2 was 9 stars easy, blew you socks off good. Violent for sure, gorey at times, but so many OMG moments. Season 1 was an 8 star season, started slow and worked it ways up. Kind of made a couple of major characters from the first season barely necessary in season 2, and the story didnt quite meld like season 1.

Still, looking forward to season 3."
8.0,27 July 2019,I thought it was a superheres saving people kind of series..but it's completely opposite and it's still good. Mocking all super heroes from DC is just fun to watch😂
10.0,28 July 2019,"Can mortals take down a pantheon of gods? Hughie is on a journey to find out after his fiance is accidently killed by reckless superhero A-Train, a member of the world's premier superhero team- The Seven. Hughie is recruited by occasional CIA contractor Butcher, who has his own agenda, along with Frenchie and Mother's Milk. Along the way he meets and gets along well with Annie, whose day job it turns out is Starlight, innocent but not naive newest member of The Seven...

Better deconstruction of superheros than Watchmen, Better zero to hero journey than Wanted (comic).

Big Budget, well cast, well acted, well written. Best superhero series I have ever seen.

Note, if this were a movie it would have a hard R-rating. The violence is graphic and messy and there are some very adult and disturbing scenes. Little nudity unfortunately..."
8.0,4 September 2020,Wow! Loving this show. Not my usual watch but thought I would give it a go and so glad I did. Great characters and great acting! Binged season 1! Watch and enjoy
8.0,14 March 2022,"Except for the awful, offensive crapfest of an episode about church, and the weird rainbow agenda push, funny stuff! Superheroes with no rules, had this idea in high school. Glad it is amazing!"
9.0,12 May 2021,"I did not like the series, I expected much better than that, but I did not like it because of the slow events at the beginning, the boring dialogues, the choice of music, not even good, and the comedy was not funny or even intended, but I was hoping that the series was better."
10.0,17 February 2020,"Wow, never in a million years did I think I would see a tv show where the superheroes are actually the bad guys in an R rated version. The series is very twisted and like nothing you've seen before. But because it's so twisted and well written that's what draws you right in to keep watching."
7.0,31 August 2024,The Boys was New and funny till season 3 but started messing each character in season 4 by showing them struggling with themselves or stuck with their past and has no meaningful story. The show is full of Gross and Shocks that's all (like sitting on a cake and s3x torture there are many such scenes). The show pretends to be diverse but actually forces its own ideologies by showcasing the villains trying to oppose them again and again. Its okay to have ideologies as it's human trait but not on the cost of good plotline and meaningful story. The Season is filled with each Heroes having their s3x kinks which is not even connected to thee story. The season is just surviving cause of previous season and Marketing.
4.0,9 July 2022,"Actors

1. Butcher. Excellent work. Dark 2. Homelander. 100% perfection on that character.

3. Soldier boy. Best character in the whole series. I wish they could bring him back.

4. Deep. Just perfect.

5. Kikoma. Sweet and fantastic work.

6. Ashley .yes. Good work

Rest I am bored with. Maybe franchise is ok."
8.0,10 July 2020,"Crikey, I had so many plans for my days off. Instead after watching episode one I was hooked. Watched all of the season in two sittings... fantastic Acton.. graphic violence, nudity, coarse language, and a ton of fun. Such a good series. Waiting for season 2"
9.0,15 July 2021,Never enjoyed a serie as much as this one. Even the mimics of the actors are great. It is a comic book coming to life. Also not very political correct. Which makes it even greater.
10.0,18 September 2020,"Incredible, I liked it, it has shown an undeniable reality of how superheroes would be like that"
9.0,12 April 2021,"""The Boys"" is unique, jocular, and most importantly a layered iteration of Superhero storytelling. A rudimentary example of an aptly incorporated satire that rests among the facets of black comedy & unfettered gore!

As a fervent fan of Comicbook movies, I was eager to see what sort of narration this show brings to the table! After witnessing two seasons so far; I can safely say, it is unquestionably a fascinating piece of art.

A Social Satire depicting toxic Celebrity Cultures & unmasking the dual-faced personalities that our so-called 'Idols' inherit. Politics, Religion, Race; pick any contentious subject matter and you would find the obvious trails in here. Looks like the makers knew exactly how to cash in on the relevant issues people talk over nowadays!

This kind of narrative might not appeal to everyone but if you can keep your conscience clear enough; it's quite worthy of your time I figure! Diversified characters and fairly eminent performances from the entire ensemble will help you during those proceedings. Specifically, two prominent names come out in front! Karl Urban as 'Butcher' and Antony Starr as 'Homelander'; two immaculate enactments that do leave a solid impression.

That being said, the Screenplay does suffer from recurrent phases of languor. Moreover a slew of brusque edits worsened the eventual outlook.

Therefore, it appears to be more prolonged than necessary. Albeit I gotta admit: Season one didn't have half the concerns the second one seems to bear!

Nevertheless, I look forward to its continuation!

Season 1 - 8/10 Season 2 - 7/10."
9.0,8 December 2019,"Truly an amazing season, cant wait for the next season"
10.0,17 September 2020,"In an age where superhero-related content is at an all time high, The Boys manages to break the cycle and bring a refreshing take on supes to a vastly overpopulated sector of entertainment. The Boys is flashy, crude, and never afraid to flip the superhero archetype on its head."
8.0,10 August 2019,"The creators of this show knew what to highlight. I would say the whole show is around the super evil mad powerful character of Homelander. It gives you that invincibility feeling and makes you dream. Human nature I guess.

A straight 10. Nothing like it and quite the original idea."
10.0,10 October 2021,"The series is good overall. It has interesting characters and it's a fresh take on the superhero genre.

Karl Urban and Anthony Starr especially do a great job with their characters.

However, the violence is very graphic and disturbing in most cases. At times it was too much for me. Another thing is that some story subplots, like Deep's story feel a little immerse breaking and drag too long."
7.0,27 August 2019,"Its ok... predictable in parts, fairly cringy in others. Had higher hopes in the first episode and kinda went downhill from there for me, only kept watching cuz I had already started. If they make another season, probably won't watch."
3.0,9 October 2020,"The wrighting, the acting, the jokes and the plot twists are all 100% but the 1 criticism I have is Billy's accent. I am British and I don't know whether It is supposed to be cockney or Australian or Martian so overall 9/10"
9.0,4 July 2020,"One of the best series ever made. The beauty of the show is the serious effort to show the human side of evil. Every villian has a story that help you understand how he or she got there.

Of course the visual effects are amazing, and the script is well written, and to top it off, action packed.

This review is for season 1. I wish to see season 2, but at the same time still traumatized by the mess of Game of thrones final season. If they cannot make season 2 as good as season 1, please stop and keep a perfect series as is"
10.0,25 September 2022,"As someone who was a big Walking dead, Breaking Bad fan, this really does show how you can make every episode count. You don't get the long drawn out plot lines only to have a pay off at a season finale. Every episode is like a season finale. Great acting, amazing writing. This really should be regarded as one of the best shows ever made. All the characters as very well written, not one of them is either completely lovable or completely detestable. I hope they can keep this standard up as it sets such a high benchmark, fingers crossed other TV shows will follow in the footsteps of this, to not be content with serving up a series with 80 percent filler just for one good episode. Don't miss out on this absolute gem of a series. As a side note is also has some really good humour to offset the large amounts of gore."
10.0,3 November 2020,"Not quite top flight entertainment, this series still manages to entertain with interesting characters. Silly sure but it doesn't take itself seriously and that's worth it's weight in gold."
9.0,4 September 2020,It is one of the best anti-hero series till this date
10.0,25 June 2024,"Ok, so I'm a bit too late at the party i started watching the boys since last year, and ive been hooked on it, because it was really good, its this new kind of superhero that mashes up satire and the superhero genre pretty well, its funny and compelling and what is the to say about why the boys is a masterpiece, so now season 4 came up and ive started noticing some negative reviews about the earler episodes and what i want to say personally is that people who say season 4 is complete trash are kind of exaggeraing it, even though in some ways it is kinda bad but its not that bad, there are some decent moments where it has that charm from the previous seasons but still though i felt a kind of let down in this story, Although personally i felt that episode 4 was pretty good for the season and comparing them to all the other episodes, it had more tension, but it doesnt save the series from the fact that its just getting old i guess, but the first 4 episode isnt a direct assumption that this season is the worst of the series, this is just the beginning, things are supposed to be set up so that there should be another bang, Another thing ive realized is that people calls out season4 for being offensive, i think thats a bad argument because from he start the boys had some spark of offensiveness in it so overall, the people who says its the worst of the series are exaggerating it a bit too much, and the people who says that is the best of the series, they're exagerating it even more, the creators decison to end it at season 5 is actually a great idea, there's still some things that needs to be tied up, and there's nothing stopping the series getting old.

So personally, i like the boys, even season 4 even though its boring at times, but i cant say if ts totally bad. And if youre a person who likes a show because its funny while also mildly offensive, then this is a good cup of tea."
9.0,27 June 2024,"Homelander's PR Quest: Antony Starr's portrayal of Homelander is riveting. From rage-fueled rallies to unnerving interviews, he grapples with owning his brand. The discomfort is intentional-topical and thought-provoking.

Character Development: Amid the satire, the central characters shine. Billy Butcher (Karl Urban) and his Boys aren't traditional heroes, but their arcs remain compelling.

Hopeful Moments: Surprisingly, this season introduces truly hopeful moments. It challenges the cynicism of the source material, offering glimpses of redemption.

Political Allegory: Through Homelander, the show mirrors modern political figures with authoritarian tendencies. It's a deeply political narrative that resonates."
10.0,13 September 2020,"It's a very decent series and I have so far watched 6 episodes in a row. Well casted and I'd probably say it's like superheroes for the rough around the edges types, that don't worship the Marvel universe.

One thing I can never get over as a Brit however, is an off-the-mark Mockney accent, although Urban gives it a decent go.

Not as bad as Charlie Hunham in Green Street, and I'm sure the North American audience cannot tell, but it still has an air of a modern day Dick van Dyke jolly holidaying with Mary..."
10.0,16 September 2020,How the mighty have fallen. Season 2 is slow paced and boring by comparison.
7.0,4 September 2022,"Love this series and it's edginess. The characters are awesome and I specifically love Starlight, Frenchie and Kimiko.

Acting is excellent for the most part.

I love how disturbing it gets. Often it takes me weeks to get over a visual or thought spoken during this series and wish I had never ever seen it although I am truthfully addicted to watching every episode and craving the next one to come out as soon as I'm done watching one. So even though some things I wish I had never seen or thought about it love the surprise element of it and that they are not afraid to get dark and dirty. Visuals are great and the special effects makeup team as well as post production studios are successfully making the audience flinch and wish some things they had never seen....but in the neat way possible."
1.0,24 August 2019,"""Art, like morality, consists of drawing the line somewhere.""

""Progress is Providence without God. That is, it is a theory that everything has always perpetually gone right by accident. It is a sort of atheistic optimism, based on an everlasting coincidence far more miraculous than a miracle.""

""There are those who hate Christianity and call their hatred an all-embracing love for all religions.""

""The Christian ideal has not been tried and found wanting; it has been found difficult and left untried.""

""These are the days when the Christian is expected to praise every creed except his own.""

""But the new rebel is a skeptic, and will not entirely trust anything. He has no loyalty; therefore he can never be really a revolutionist. And the fact that he doubts everything really gets in his way when he wants to denounce anything. For all denunciation implies a moral doctrine of some kind; and the modern revolutionist doubts not only the institution he denounces, but the doctrine by which he denounces it. . . . As a politician, he will cry out that war is a waste of life, and then, as a philosopher, that all life is waste of time. A Russian pessimist will denounce a policeman for killing a peasant, and then prove by the highest philosophical principles that the peasant ought to have killed himself. . . . The man of this school goes first to a political meeting, where he complains that savages are treated as if they were beasts; then he takes his hat and umbrella and goes on to a scientific meeting, where he proves that they practically are beasts. In short, the modern revolutionist, being an infinite skeptic, is always engaged in undermining his own mines. In his book on politics he attacks men for trampling on morality; in his book on ethics he attacks morality for trampling on men. Therefore the modern man in revolt has become practically useless for all purposes of revolt. By rebelling against everything he has lost his right to rebel against anything."""
10.0,8 August 2019,"I am a movie and TV show buff. I have seen thousands of hours over the last 15 years. Almost everything that has come out. One thing I love about good cinema is its ability to draw you out of the world and put you in a realm of belief. If you have ever read Ann Rice, she does a wonderful job of depicting all the horrors that go bump in the night, especially vampires into a realistic value. This was so well done because it gives you the satisfaction of how this is so extremely likely of what it would be like if ""super heroes"" were real. It plays off the average person's envy of walking with Gods. Raw, diabolical at times, funny at others. It plays with your emotions while also keeping you grounded thinking ""I would totally be like that guy"". The only reason it's not a perfect 10 for me, is because at few points the show is predictable. Other than that, writing, casting, acting, special effects, cinematography and audio effects were all on point. I cant wait for the next series! (Hopefully)"
9.0,11 November 2019,"Honestly, didn't expect to like this show as much as I did. Binged the entire series over a weekend and rewatched it with my wife.

It's possibly the best superhero show ever. Everything from the acting, writing to the cinematography are just top-notch. No glaring oversights. No sloppy scenes or acting. The writing is tight. Concept is original for a bloated scene and topic.

All of the leads perform really well and sell their roles through their acting. The writers add just enough mystique to keep you guessing and on your feet. The comedy aspect is more of a mature stance in contrast to Marvel's, whom also achieve this well to lighten the mood at times.

I'd even go to say that this shows debut was up there with the likes of Chernobyl.

If you like this series, give Titans a gander. Excited for television in 2020 with all of these fantastic series over the past few years."
9.0,5 February 2021,"First season, I don't think anyone (outside of fans of the comic) had any idea who The Boys were or what they were about. I like to watch movies/ tv with as little background knowledge as possible, so I can appreciate the shocks and plot twists as intended.

And Season 1 was full of twists I've not seen in a long time. This was like Heroes (2006-2010), but for a more mature audience. Not afraid to offend, with oft-colourful c-bombs dropped by Butcher and Co on a regular basis, to the extent where we (the audience) are totally de-sensitised to what should be offensive language. Perhaps used more sparingly, they would no doubt have more the desired reaction.

Anyway, solid start. 8/10.

Second season. Oh dear. TV shows (particularly superhero ones) tend to struggle in season 2 - a case of ""Second-Season-Itis"".

It feels like it's being spread out thin. But unlike how the writers' strike affected season 2 of aforementioned Heroes back in 07-08, there's little excuse for poor writing now. I can only presume producers are running out of source material, or trying to stretch the show for another 2 or 3 seasons.

The content in the first 7 episodes could have been packed into 4, but for show pacing. The non-stop action from season one has been replaced with talking - lots and lots of talking - and it's getting kinda boring.

There are still occasional shocks and twists, in fact some are bigger than Season one. But they are too few and far between. To compare, in season one, each chapter felt like they were getting to a point; progress was made in the plot. If you missed an episode, you would maybe struggle to catch up as there's quite a lot packed into each one. Season Two just feels like I'm watching the same episode, just tweaking the formula over and over. Butcher is the same potty-mouthed-tough guy in nearly every scene. There's little character development. MM, Frenchie, even Hughie - who you saw evolve from a softy pushover to being one of The Boys - could be analysed from any episode and you would not think anything major had happened.

On the positives, it's good to see some storylines for the other members of the Seven. It was starting to feel like the Homelander Show. Perhaps that's the point? Meh.

Anyway I give season two a 6.5/10, saved by some great action scenes and some great acting from the new cast members.

There's a great quote from season two, it was something like 'Remember what made you a superhero! Go back to basics!' The Boys need to remember this.

Overall I give it 7.5/10."
10.0,31 July 2019,"I have been excited to see ""The Boys"" since seeing the trailer. After seeing it, i realize, I thought it was going to be different. But I was surprised in a good way. Dark, gritty and gruesome are just a few words I would use. I think this is a modern, (if they actually existed) super hero TV show.

Most shows are afraid to show things that a lot of us debate in the comic world. I won't spoil anything, but themes like power and corruption, vengeance and greed are all showcased in this brilliantly written show.

Karl Urban is great, along with a great supporting cast. Action is not over the top, which I hope picks up a little more. But the story is really good. I was so bummed when it ended. I wanted more.

So again, if you don't like superhero movies/shows... you may like this one, its quite different."
8.0,29 August 2019,"This show is just brilliant. Well written, well acted, well scripted and well executed. A refreshing and original take on superheroes. This refreshing take is what makes the show quite intriguing."
9.0,9 August 2019,
8.0,30 March 2022,"As someone who does like watching superhero-based shows and films from time to time, The Boys feels like a breath of fresh air to me. At the time of me writing this, I'm just about wrapped up with the first season, and it is pretty good.

My favorite thing about ""The Boys"" is its concept. The idea of a team of super ""heroes"" being owned by a big, multinational conglomerate and a team of regular, superpowerless individuals who are trying to expose them as the monsters they are is a concept I've never seen done in a superhero series.

You have plenty of mainstream superhero films and shows where the ""heroes"" are seen as vigilantes by some, but seen as saviors by others (i.e., Captain America: Civil War, The Dark Knight trilogy, etc.), whereas the Seven, as they're called, are essentially gods to the everyman.

As far as the production quality goes, the cinematography, the effects, and the acting are all top-notch. Karl Urban's performance is a darn good one to say the least, along with Jack Quaid's.

Overall, The Boys is a well done subversion of the superhero genre, and if you haven't seen it yet, definitely check it out if you like the superhero genre."

It is so wrong in places but so very entertaining, language and gore are not for the young or squeamish.

Well done Prime, great to see such amazing contact from the new media companies with both Amazon and Netflix.. keep it coming, please :-)

Cannot wait for series 2 !!"
8.0,6 November 2022,"I was a bit shocked when I watched this. I wasn't expecting this series to make the supes violent and careless and that's what made this experience different. It takes a more dark turn on what heroes can be. They can be dumb, narcissistic, angry, desperate, make stupid choices without thinking and are still human. They are just an extremely enhanced version of everyone else.

I was stunned by the visual effects and detail the animators went through to design even the most private areas of the body and the guts. There are so many guts. If you decide to watch this with your kids I feel sorry for them and you because very episode contains substance abuse, sex, gore and guts. This is definitely made for adults. Don't watch this if you don't want to see the guts and head popping."

7.0,30 April 2020,"This series is just awesome, taking the piss of the super hero genre and doing this spot on. The only bad thing for me is billy butcher's ( karl urban's) wannabe cockney accent. Sometimes you can really hear the effort of him trying to be cockney, but most of the times it feels like aussie or new zealand accent. This, to me, is really irritating. I'm not trying to kick karl urban to the curb, it is not his fault. The director however, should have noticed this and should have pushed him more"
5.0,14 August 2019,"Seeing Antony Starr as Homelander in this completes the series, it's almost a cast of unknowns which is refreshing to see apart from Karl Urban. Think of Justice League but darker, a lot darker. The story is great and the production value and budget is something of a film!"
8.0,22 December 2019,Enjoyed it all the way.Great Story and hilarious funny.
10.0,18 October 2020,"This show is fucking amazing. Superhero being employed and on social media, it's interesting. And Butcher is just funny and great. The Boyz team is cool. SN 2 is just awesome. The Boyz squad is officially formed."
10.0,30 July 2019,"What a crazy fun show, makes me ready for the next season NOW!"
10.0,5 January 2020,Thought this would be another cheesy effort to jump on the superhero bandwagon but it's brilliant. Always twisting and dark it's a good look at what capitalism would do to superheroes. Really enjoyed it can't wait for the second season.
8.0,8 August 2019,Great series! This is how hero's really are. You can't tell me that people with God like powers are pure as the driven snow....nope. They are going to be as screwed up as much as the hero's in this show. I can't wait to see what Billy and Hughie are going to do in the second season and what Homelanders secret is.
10.0,1 September 2019,"I won't give any spoilers, but WOW! Such an incredible show, and so unique, too. I really wanted to give more information in this review, about my thoughts about characters, and their development, but I don't want to spoil ANYTHING. So, watch it- you're not going to regret it."
10.0,22 July 2020,"The main storyline, the acting, the production etc. It is all great, no doubt about that. For me personally i just don't need all the unnecessary sick, gross and weird scenes they had to put in here and there. It feels like they are supposed to be funny but it just doesn't work for me at all. Had they removed those and focused on the rest it would have been really good - a matter of personal opinion i am sure. Some might find that stuff funny. Also, forget about scenes that try to make me sympathize with a person who has already revealed himself to be a total dick... that is just wasted minutes."
9.0,17 August 2022,"This wonderful show went in my opinion from a subjective 9-10 out of 10 in the first season, to a solid 7-8 in the second, and to maybe 2-3 in the third. The storyline became banal, and is now as moralizing as so many other shows, rather than reflecting the complexity and ambiguity of life. The interactions became boring and predictable, the depth is gone from the characters. The show started out as a worthy adversary for Watchmen (the movie, haven't seen the show), and ended up in a pitfall of pointlessness and mediocrity."
6.0,2 August 2019,"I love this show - it's a great satire on the superhero universe, specifically DC, as most of the Seven are based on their characters (Superman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, The Flash etc.). I read the comic a few years ago but am not making comparisons; the tv show works perfectly well as a standalone. It's a delight to watch Antony Starr again after a long break from Banshee (I don't watch American Gothic so missed him in that), and he is suberbly narcissistic and cynical in his role as Homelander/Superman. My only gripe is with Karl Urban's appallingly bad British Cockney accent - his native New Zealand by way of Dick Van Dyke - which is a shame as his Billy Butcher really looks the part and has some great lines. Otherwise, for me, it would be a 10/10."
2.0,28 October 2019,Watched all episodes of season 1 what a fantastic series neatly presented by the creators. Karl urban kick starts the series along with Homelander Anthony starr neatly portrays his character terrifically. Every actor played their characters very well especially starlight played by Erin Moriarty and Hughie by Jack Quaid was beautiful. Must watch series in Amazon prime.
9.0,2 September 2019,"This show is absolutely a breath of fresh air. The acting is solid, the FX are excellent. It combines a plethora of emotions that radiate from these characters. I'm rooting for all sides it seems, and that's rare. A show like this is what I've been waiting for. It touches base on political scandal, corporate greed, revenge, religion, sexual misconduct, murder, terrorism, and love. I recommend this to all my friends who don't like super hero movies or shows, most of them have come back and been amazed. The show deserves a 10/10"
9.0,29 August 2019,"In a world saturated by the superhero genre 'The Boys' is the pallet cleanser you didn't know you needed. It's funny, shocking and at times touching and is anchored by the very believable perfomances of Quaid and Moriarty as the two lead protagonists. The narrative touches on very real issues if you're the kind that likes scratching below the surface, but if all you like is action and things blowing up then you won't be disappointed either. There's something for everyone. Even Karl Urban's heroic failure of a Cockney accent is not enough to distract from the stellar production. Cannot wait for season 2."
9.0,17 November 2022,
10.0,29 July 2019,"I loved everything about this except a few minor things. The last episode definitely should have been two episodes, it was rushed."
9.0,22 September 2019,"This series goes up there with Watchmen (the movie, I haven't seen the upcoming series yet). It's a fresh and gripping take on the superhero topic, but superheroes are used to tell the story of our society, where appearance beats reality and profit drives decisions. We'll acted, we'll scripted, this is a must-watch. Definitely looking forward to the next episodes (I take for granted there's going to be a new series, at least)."
9.0,1 September 2019,It's not often The show or movie better than the source This case it does Really looking forward to season two
9.0,9 May 2021,The whole is just magnificent!! All the characters are remarkable.
9.0,29 July 2019,"But its not my cup of tea!

I was sure this series will be very nice After i saw what ppl give for nice rated 9/10 Or 10/10 but for me its not more then 6-7/10"
7.0,6 September 2020,"Ok, the first season was different, interesting and clever. Evidently the writers had no idea about a second season because it is a total disaster at episode 3. Meandering, pointless and no story. Dwelling on the most boring character (the deep), who is pathetic at best. It really is that bad."
1.0,25 December 2019,"The Boys is the highly charged antipode that is much needed in the wake of the superhero tsunami that has engulfed our TVs and cinema screens in recent years. The idea isn't new. The comic book industry has flirted with the notion of highly flawed, corruptable superheroes that succumb to their own folie de grandeur, narcissism and egoism with the likes of Watchmen, Zenith and The Ten Seconders to name a few. Eric Kripke has taken Garth Ennis & Darick Robertson's comic book series and fully realised the world that they created. Karl Urban shines here as the brusk, manipulative yet deliciously droll Billy Butcher, while Jack Quaid almost faithfully concieves the nervous & skittish Hughie Campbell. For me though it's Antony Starr's diabolical Homelander that takes centre stage & is a joy to watch, even if he leaves you recoiling in revulsion. Kripke's The Boys is a pure sugar rush of entertainment and never before have I so wanted to watch a bunch of preened and perfect superheroes get spanked."
10.0,9 September 2019,"A great show to watch if you like a comic like setting. The acting is great and the visuals are amazing. The story is quite different than any other comic show, as the heroes aren't working to take down some villain, instead a group of regular guys are trying to get revenge on the Supers. The dialogue is pretty good, with most jokes coming off as genuinely funny. That said there is quite a bit of bashing on Christianity, but it doesn't distract from this still being a great show."
8.0,5 December 2022,
10.0,2 September 2022,"The Boys is really good, it's a outing to your usual marvel superhero movie where the superheroes all tend to the people and no one gets hurt, it gives you a realistic view on what will probably happen if superheroes come to real life.

The characters are all a solid 10/10, they have their distinct personalities and backstory yet they synchronize with the others extremely well, even the villains have their own traits that makes some people want to justify them as being good.

The storyline is a 9.5/10, the reason I'm taking half a point off is because of a little bit of filler content here and there that seems rather pointless, other than that the storyline is perfect, the ""twist"" that The Boys applies to the common superhero genre plays into it's storyline extremely well, I reccomend you watch every second of it.

The writing is another 10/10, each scene where a character is alone or with another character makes you be on the edge of your seat, you don't know if the two characters will talk normally or will kill one another, it compliments the story and doesn't play into cliche interactions that other superhero movie producers make so as to ""add depth"" to said characters.

The atmosphere is 10/10, the music doesn't feel pointless and rather than adding minutes to the episode, it acts as a break from the usual ""tone"" that the show has, each time a character interacts with another one the atmosphere plays into that conversation really well, making you feel immersed into the conversation yourself.

Overall, The Boys is a extremely good show, while it not might suit all audiences (especially because of the gore in it), it is certainly something to add onto your watchlist."
9.0,13 August 2019,"(SEASON 1): The show is great and I loved it. If I have to find some flaws they could be the slow narration that characterizes a few plot points and the lack of a real ending. I know there will be a season 2 but I feel like almost every important plotline is left open, instead I have preferred their conclusions and the tease for the future ones. ""The boys"" is a great show that I'd strongly suggest because of its freshness but also for its compelling story, a fantastic villain and the reflection on some moral subjects. So, go and watch it! Ps: the show is very violent and gory so be aware if that's a problem for you. However I feel like it's a bit over the top, similar to what can be found in the Deadpool's movies but slightly darker.

(SEASON 2): Season 2 of ""The Boys"" is an expansion of the first one. Indeed it has all the ingredients that made the first one such a good show and in almost every aspect this second season is even better. The only thing that this one does probably worse is the cohesiveness of the plot, that in same cases is more dispersive and less balanced. The season closes the main storylines but it leaves other interesting things for season 3. If you've liked the first one you'll probably like this one too. As I said for season 1: watch this show, it is a great piece of entertainment."
8.0,19 November 2019,It's like a good expensive whisky that you don't want to end so you sip it slowly....
10.0,8 August 2019,"Top Ten, a comic by Alan Moore, has explored this idea of superheroes that need to be monitored.

In a world where people have extraordinary powers, these powers can be misused. And a certain 'club' has to hold them accountable.

If you enjoy this series, I suggest reading Top Ten. Incredibly illustrated, with a great story line."
8.0,29 August 2020,"I'm fond of watching English movies dubbed in Hindi, but this isn't dubbed in Hindi and I watched first time full English web series without getting bored.This show is masterpiece man... Waiting for season 2"
9.0,30 July 2022,Such a SAD & depressing end (for now). So hopeless & what a commentary on the present state of Ah-Mare-Ka..............................................................................................................................
6.0,4 October 2020,"Further evidence society is sliding into the gutter. Debauched sh""te. We're certainly living in degenerate times. In my lifetime I've witnessed the steady decline in what is deemed acceptable viewing. Graphic violence, Sexual debauchery, full frontal nudity, Swearing the full pantheon is now mainstream. I worry for the future."
2.0,31 July 2019,"FIRST SEASON I think this is the best series about superheroes I've ever watched.

There's almost nothing wrong with it. The casting is perfect. The dialogue is perfect. It never gets boring. By the end of the season the drama is just epic.

It's good enough that people like it even if they aren't fans of the genre.

There are some explicit scenes.

SECOND SEASON Had to lower my review to an 8. The racism theme seems kind of underwhelming."
9.0,12 August 2019,"Shake up a different flavored oil vinegar bottle of the show Powers (6.7) 2015. Add a slightly different story twist, a little bit better acting and it's just the rated R vetsion of a litty show called Heroes (7.6) 2006. Seems like a new special ability show comes out every 3-5 years changes the formula a bit. Both past shows did well for a couple years then burn out, same for heroes 3.0 is what this should be called. ."
10.0,20 October 2020,"I picked it up this weekend just on a whim, thought to just give it a try and in my mind I would turn it off in 15/20 mins. Could not have been more wrong. Binged it within 2 days, with no purpose of giving it up. Exciting, enticing, engaging, eccentric and electric. Really well written, directed and acted. Don't wait up, pick it up."
10.0,26 August 2019,"I started watching this after I saw the poster and it appealed to me - tickled my interest. I was not disappointed and I'm glad I found this show! The show is amazing. The graphics are amazing. It's a show I never knew I needed until I found it. Be aware there is a lot of bad language, sex and violence, Not one to watch with the family."
9.0,31 July 2019,"I wasn't even impressed with the first trailer, so I didn't have much expectation. I just finished watching it last night, and I have to say this show is just amazing. I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Superhero reality check in effect. The premise that's been done plenty of times before but the talent behind this show Eric Kripke, Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen they all did an incredible job. It has its own style, It's fresh, the story is solid, liked the characters dynamic, also I thought the world building is really well done. I loved Antony Starr in Banshee, so glad to see him here after a long time. He's fantastic in this show. Karl Urban's character is my favorite, most of it was because of his accent!

Definitely one of the best series this year. It's such an entertaining show and I loved it. I highly recommend this show to everyone except for the people who can't stand cursing and violence, because there's a lot of it."
10.0,20 October 2020,"I didn't know what to make of this initially. I got frustrated by Billy's ridiculous NZ/Aus/London Cockney accent. But, upon further goggling investigation, I realise that his 'Cockwi' accent is actually a deliberate flaw to poke fun at the character. This refers beck to the original book it seems. I think Antony Starr (Homelander) is incredible as a 'baddy' superhero. And I'd never have guessed that he was a relatively unknown actor, outside of his home country (being New Zealand)! I look forward to seeing him in future TV shows. I have given 9/10 rating only because the 2nd series wasn't quite as good a the 1st. I appreciate that's pretty normal though. I'm loving this series and looking forward to the next season! Bring it on - The Boys should be back in town again soon!!!"
9.0,30 July 2019,"I really enjoyed this series, I binged watched over 2 days and it was great, I think it is what superheroes would really be like if they were in the real world. It's has action, comedy and romance and a great conspiracy, some great acting, Karl urban was great. Hope for another season."
10.0,9 August 2019,"Karl's look may fit the character butcher, but his accent is just......"

1.0,30 July 2019,"Smart, darkly funny, REALLY darkly funny, shocking, gory, cynical, and gritty. I can't wait for next season."
10.0,21 December 2019,"Saw this show because a friend recommended it to me. Fell I love directly. MASTERPIECE!All the actors are perfect in their roll.Great story,soundtrack...this show must get more recognition. It diserve more fame.Greatest I have seen this year."
10.0,3 December 2019,"Brilliant acting, characters is really fit with actors/actress . Now superheroes are freak and others are hero."
10.0,22 December 2019,"I just found video about many many people voted one star for this series and they say the series is trash and they shouldn't have watch it and some of them say it's superheroes and I thought it's like avengers and etc.let me tell you something this series is something you don't see everyday. it shows the dark side of superheroes and I think it's really amazing because we can see how power can change somebody and how superheroes actually working I think this is more realistic than every plot I have been watching. it's like hey this superheroes are amazing Justice league is awesome ,no doubt.(p.s: I mean the actual comics of Justice league and etc.) but you don't see this part about heroes that they are actually Killers. they are selfish, they are humans and they have flaws I think anybody that says this series is trash and stupid, they haven't seen the actual meaning of this series."
8.0,15 September 2019,"I started watching because of all the ads and good reviews/coments about the show, and I really enjoyed the first three episodes. As someone who isn't the biggest fan of Marvel, seeing all those assholes super heros was amazing, at the begining. When you're not that impressed anymore by the universe, you focuse on other points of the show, and well... The so called ""great acting"" is really poor , butcher and of course the amazing homelander (Frenchie is one of the worst characters I've seen on TV). The dialogues are average as well as the story, and the shots are pretty basic. And don't expect to have any kind of connection or attachement to the characters when you can't take any of their arcs seriously. Sure, the show isn't serious, but then why do you try to make us feel it is in those flashbacks and relationships ? Maybe I expected something darker, idk, but it just doesn't give me the desire to watch the next season"
8.0,23 August 2019,"The first season of The Boys (the second is already confirmed) had somehow attracted my attention although I'm not a fan of either comic books or superhero movies and here's why it happened. Despite it being a mere parasite on Deadpool's legacy it nevertheless brings something else to the table of this already tiring genre: a new look. The supes in here are violent, mean, abusive, offensive, selfish and arrogant and they do everything for their own benefit and not other's sake - they're above the law and they love it but as any other human being they have feelings too, their own dramas and moments of weakness. Undoubtedly the ""R"" rating has played its strengths for the series and all the gore, bloodshed and a whole bunch of swearwords do a great deal of justice to the show at its fullest. The characters are alive, have their backgrounds and you can easily empathize with any one of them all and stunning visuals along with a fine soundtrack are covering this nothing new candy into a flashy wrapper making you enjoy every single minute of the series. Already waiting for the second season..."
8.0,5 September 2020,"Great show, beautiful cgi, excellent cinematography, awesome characters on that last point hughie does irritate me a little. Action, Dark Comedy, Romance. With all the money spent on every aspect of the production of this show why was the Polaroid picture used in season 2 ep 2 look so fake. Like I can tell it was an image on top of card stock cut into the shape of a Polaroid. Just feels weird and glaring."
10.0,11 August 2019,
6.0,29 July 2019,This is a fun adventure! Highly recommend this show to anyone into superhero's but tired of watching the same thing over and over. This is refreshing. I won't spoil it! Watch for yourself
1.0,26 September 2020,"The story-arc of Series 1 was PERFECT, i.e. weak Few versus the strong Many. In Series 2 the writers completely lost the plot. Went to sleep twice in winding episodes that failed to hold my attention, but was wide awake when the Terrible Two (Homelander & Stormfront), now. white supremacist, bigots utterd a phrase that sounded remarkably like ""Make America Great Again"". Unwise and appallingly timed. The fans loved ""The Boys"" for its abandonment of partisan, identity politics, so it's catastrophic that Series 2 added to the above defects, suddenly found a couple more female Super-Heroes, but no more Super-Males, converting some of the struggles into mere hen-fights, with the males as mere spectators. Oh Xerxes!"
10.0,13 December 2019,"Ah man, this is what we all needed! The antidote for all the Marvel blockbusters that we got shoved in our faces the last couple years. No offence, it was great. For kids. And conservative adults. But it's too well behaved. Where's the sex? The blood? The gore? The rock&roll? Introduce; The Boys.

Yes, there are many references to all known superheroes in this thrilling new series but from a different point of view which makes it different then all the other superheroes stuff. Billy Butcher would say, with strong New Zealand accent; ""They're taking the p*ss"". And that's exactly what makes The Boys so brilliant.

Long story short; superheroes are the new popstars of the world, admired as gods, keeping their social media appearance and their likes higher then Bieber and the Kardashians, while behind the scenes they're a bunch misbehaving rascals. But hey, what would you do if you got superpowers? Can't blame them for blowing off some steam after saving the world day in day out, right? Well, The Boys don't agree. And that's where s**t gets real.

Yeah, just watch this stuff. You won't regret it."
10.0,28 July 2019,"The boys

Without any doubts this is best superhero TV shows right now. DC and Marvel does not have anything like this. Let's wait what HBO Watchmen will shows us, but for the now - we have a winner. Wildstom ""The Boys"" comic book has seen the world in 2006 and in fall 2012 was ended, with 72 issues total. And thanks God, Amazon has buy right for it screening. Not sure if Netflix would did a better. By compering different shows, as for me, ""The Boys"" very close to Justice League: Injustice. It no not so brutal like it was in DC and doesn't cover questions of what is the cost of justice and power, but the Show has only first season, so I believe if fans like what the saw in July 2019, Amazon will go deeper and will raise shows brutality. Shortly about plot, in the world where superheroes (Supes) are exist, all of them were legalized and all of them are working for Vought International. Transnational company with HQ in US, which: control, assign a missions, build a marketing strategy, commercialized and later known, develop a new Supes, around the world. Most popular heroes and those who bring more money to company are members of The Seven. Old materials Supes, who does not bring money are sent to 2nd leagues of losers. With great power comes a great responsibility but when your heroes are TV superstars with huge salaries and their actions could not be judged by any country and government, they turned into bunch of self-lovers jerks and jack asses. The first thing which you see it's how superhero team, almost recreate in some ways Justice League. Homelander - copy of Superman. Well, more cocky, narcissistic, with pseudo patriotism ideals. Leader of the team. The most powerful of all team members. Absolutely understructable being. Main antagonist.

Queen Maeve - reference to Wonder Woman. Probably best person who see true Homelander intentions. Previously she was in relations with simple woman, then move to Homelander, now alone. Have a problems with alcohol. From time to time trying to act following her heart and the ideals she was grow on. Almost every time when she's trying act right - encounter a resistance in the Homelander face. The Deep - analogue to Aquaman. And maaaaaaaan, writers together with Chace Crawford did an amazing job. That character has a problems with self confident probably because no one is really takes a seriously a guy, whose only power talk with fish. (Reference to Aquman in Robot Chicken ,maybe?) He has a serious issue with sexual life also. Vought knows that a dude is sexual abuser, but trying to cover this fact(spoil the entire 8 episodes). The Deep needs it's own series, because some of his intension are truly good but his actions are so dumb! A train - link to The Flash. The guy with drug-anabolic addiction. Earlier he was ""The fastest man alive"" and this title belongs only to him, but now world full of speedsters. And in order to protect his reputation, well, yes, he is usually on anabolic. Black Noir - you want to believe it is a copy of Batman, but No, It's analogue to Snake Eyes from G.I. Joe. We don't know a lot about him, only that he: never speak, good at martial arts & knives , parkour, ............aaaaand he is great piano player. If Susan ""Sue"" Storm-Richards aka Invisible Girl from Fantastic 4 was a man, he's nickname would be Translucent. One of the famous Seven team members. TV star. Most of the time use his powers to spy on girls in bathroom. Total jerk. Starlight - she is a newbie in the team. Almost at the first day on work she was abused by one of members. She is a light inside the ""The Seven"" darkness. I think her character has something with Supergirl and Stargirl, because she is also young and sometimes naïve, believe in all good, against all bad etc. One of series protagonists. Of corse there is a Vought International - VC president. But lets leave her story. I don't want to open all cards. Now let's go to our heroes aka simple humans. The Boys are team created by Billy Butcher, CIA agent who hates everything related to Supes. There are also: Hughie Campbell, the guy whose girl was killed by A-Train; Frenchie - specialist in bombs, weaponry and spy tech; Mother's Milk - former CIA agent, probably the voice of logic in the team; Kimiko - girl with inhuman ""abilities"", but lack of communication skills, previously was test pet of Vought. The show full of blood&meat, nudity, dirt language and this is exactly what you need from modern Superhero genre shows. It is not completely ""Deadpool"", but it is more combination between DC ""Doom patrol"" & ""Titans"" + Marvel ""Daredevil"". Entire picture of ""The Boys"" not full of grey paint and pain, even the opposite it is colorful and sunny. But behind bright colors of heroes costumes and perfect Hollywood smiles there is always darkness and dirty world of money, unlimited power and politic manipulations. For Marvel & DC fans this show is MUST WATCH without any doubts, fans of fiction & fantasy would love it too. My respect to Amazon Prime and all crew members who create this show. Overall 8.5\10"
9.0,25 August 2019,"I really like watching super hero movies, but The Boys is really something different. This gives us a little bit of the sinister side to a Superhero. Yes they save the world but also on their bad side they leave a lot the imagination. I have watched the first season and I loved it. Yes you have your superman, Aquaman and Wonderman type hero's here but their characters have a demeanor in which it gave me a WTF reaction which liked. If you are a Superhero lover watch it and see what you think. But all in all its good viewing with good effects and storyline. 👍👍👍"
10.0,23 August 2019,"Think about this as if a Marvel movie was directed by the guys behind Kingsman. Or you can think about this as Watchmen but with some jokes and a tone that is a bit lighter.

In other words, its a superhero series that goes deep it what it would really be for us as a society if we really have people with superpowers. How could we control them? How would this superheroes be, if they can do practically anything? Would they really be good guys?

Theres a lot of funny jokes, violence and gore, mixed. So you get that kind of movie-series where something brutal happends but you laught. Some other times, something brutal happends and you feel like crying. The Boys manages really well it dramatic and it funny moments.

The action scenes are in par with the ones of big superheroes movies and the acting is really good.

For me, this series is way better than anything I have seen in Netflix and its on par with some stuff from HBO. If you can, give it a go.

If you dont like stuff with superheroes (I actually don't), give it a go too. This is different to Marvel stuff. Its more mature, more smart and goes way more deep."
10.0,30 July 2019,"------------ AFTER SEASON II

Holy cu*nt i love this show!

It is been the third times i watch the seasons 1 and 2 times the season 2 I never ever seen something like this show. It is so crude and dark but SO good! I can't wait for season 3 to pop out.

Guys seriously RUN FOR IT !

------------ BEFORE SEASON II

I was waiting for a tv show like that for ETERNITY!

""Watch this tv show NOW, it's an order, or i will fly into your home burn your eyes and crush your head like a melon."" This is i think something the ""heroes"" will do on this show.

watch what Super powers and $$$ can done into our society if it was today reality and fear the worst.

Have fun watching what will become one of the best tv show of the century. Have fun saying to yoursel ""At last!"" Thinking, DC try but fell so hard to do. After that i assure you, even dardevil and punisher are for crying babies even if they are amazing themself.

This one is the best of what you can get when writers, actors, producers and CGI alltogether are talented."
10.0,7 August 2019,"This was grown up and amazing - like watchmen and many grown up comic books - the comics rocked and this does too - bring on the next series - fingers crossed this separates the ""marvel cinematic universe"" and actual comic book fans - this is like a Zack Snyder take on comics (basically the best stuff) compared to the children mcu stuff we are force fed - the boys shows us Zack Snyder is years before every ONE else! It ain't for mcu fans unless they are over 12 years old!"
9.0,11 August 2019,"Not gonna give any kind of in depth review, I simply came here to state the series reminds Me of the steelheart series by Brandon Sanderson"
9.0,29 July 2019,"As great and entertaining as the MCU movies are, the moral high horse they tend to look down from is bound to get cumbersome. This is where The Boys swoops in and steals all of the thunder from super hero movie tropes that we have begun to take for granted. This is not easy, saccharine family friendly viewing. This is hard as nails, guts in your face, angry and unrepentant. This is the view from under the feet of the moral high horse where the trampled have decided to just eviscerate the horse and the riders and the whole damn world if need be. I did not expect to like it as much as I did, I enjoyed it way more than I thought I would. I never knew Karl Urban had it in him to pull of this remarkable character or that Elizabeth shue was still around and still this damn capable. The acting across the board could have been better but beyond that there really is nothing that could possibly have been done better. This show grips you by the balls from scene one and keeps on squeezing all the way to the final scene when you are delivered with both a cliffhanger and a satisfying resolution. This is really some next level stuff amazon has in its arsenal. Easily one of the best iterations of the super hero genre that defies our expectations at every turn."
6.0,1 December 2020,Really good ! Great fun ! The only reason why I don't rate 10 is this « Frenchie » character who's not french at all and can't even speak french when he's supposed to... Pathetic ! Why the hell the production could not cast a real french actor for that part ? This guy sounds so ridiculous trying to pronounce « mon coeur » or « confit de canard » ! He gets on my nerves so bad ! I want him out or replaced ! 7 then.
3.0,24 December 2020,"Like SO many shows in this sad era of poor scripts, it started in compelling fashion. Then as usual, season two devolved into the same boring idealogical lectures. ZZZZZZZZ."
9.0,3 September 2022,"Great film! There's nothing more that I can really say about The Boys that hasn't already been said. It's just a flat out awesome show! It's easily become one of my favorite new shows in years! I binged the entire first two seasons in just a few days when they first came out and rewatched them again for the second time before Season 3 came out. I was expecting a little bit of a drop off for Season 3 because Season 1 and 2 were so great, and there is a little drop in quality but it's still a very good show! It takes everything you loved about Season 1 and 2 (the violence, humor, heart, craziness, character development, etc.) and takes it all to a whole new level! This show has such an original take on the Superhero genre that is both exciting and hilarious! I can not recommend this show enough! Just a warning though...once you start watching it it's hard to stop. Give yourself enough time because you'll want to binge it as quickly as possible!"

10.0,6 September 2019,"What a fantastic, brilliant show. Didn't want it to end. So different.... taking the glam away from the superheros and making them the ""baddies"". The acting was superb and story line ingenious. Love love loved it. Must admit from advert pic was unsure what to expect. May suggest they change this.....?.. as I don't think it does the show justice. But just got to say again BRILLIANT"
10.0,23 August 2019,"Loved the concept quickly, funny, snappy script. A good fun, witty watch."
10.0,14 August 2019,"Good characters, good story, bloody and gory, social criticism. It is fresh and creative. A must watch."
7.0,11 July 2022,"Fourth season has wrapped, with one more fifth being announced as the finale, I'm struggling with this one. Not for the faint of heart, this gritty, realistic, action thriller is extremely violent and features significant amounts of gore. Following a group of powerless humans, the boys, as they take on The Seven, an elite group of corrupt superheroes working under Vought industries, the mock equivalent of Avengers / Super Friends. The scripting is quite good, at least at the beginning, the acting is superb, and the production quality has certainly stayed constant throughout all its seasons so far. Based on a comic of the same name by Garth Ennis, I understand his material takes on some of the darkest, most morbid, and frankly twisted plot lines. This show is no different, especially in its latest two seasons, there were points at which it felt more like I was watching a live action episode of Happy Tree Friends. That amount of gore and adult themes appeals to some, for me it was a bit much, I found this really difficult to binge. Unfortunately also as things went on the writing gets significantly worse, with lines feeling stiff, and constant new characters and backstories being introduced that only go one layer deep, and so much cringe. A big fan of Preacher, Garth Ennis' other well known work, and especially loved the AMC adaptation of that, which I think I had a lot more fun with than this series. At this point, I don't know, I moved its score down one after season three, and I feel like I need to again, but I'll definitely check out the last season whenever that comes around to see how it finishes out. I'm not sure I'd recommend this series broadly, its good, but a bit extra."
5.0,24 August 2024,
10.0,31 August 2020,I thought this going to be another cheesy superhero program. I'd try one episode just to see how bad it was. How wrong was I. Love it. Not sure how many seasons you can get from this crazy world but for now I shall sit back and enjoy the ride!
10.0,2 September 2019,"This show has it all and Karl Urban is perfect. It has the right amount of action, comedy, and grit. Pure brilliance!"
10.0,3 September 2019,Definitely worth a watch! Very entertaining! It's nice to see a different take on the superhero genre.

8.0,21 August 2019,"I'll say this, it was very fun to watch and I am eagerly anticipating season 2... With all the super hero movies the last few years it was fun to watch one with a different twist. The character development was on point and the twists and turns were a fun ride... Well done Amazon... The only feedback I could give in this short review is to get hustling on Season 2!"
10.0,7 October 2020,"Amazon has finally have a hit on their hands with The Boys, about a group of misfit superheroes working for a big company run by a head honcho. The show is quirky, funny, sexy, and action packed. It was renewed for a second season, which is in progress and a third one is being filmed. It's based on a little known graphic comic book series. If you have Prime Video, enjoy it!!!"
9.0,9 October 2020,BEST SHOW EVER!!!! DOESNT STICK WITH THE COMIC BUT I LOVE IT SO MUCHHH
7.0,22 August 2024,"Since the advent of the internet, I must admit: complaining or defending a movie, TV series, or anything else has become a habit for everyone, and you have to choose whether you want to participate actively or just watch others squabble. This series, like EVERYTHING, has strengths and weaknesses. I've noticed that in ALL TV series, as the seasons progress, certain things become increasingly evident. If a TV series has a characteristic that makes it stand out, that trait will become more extreme over time. Well, ""The Boys"" has several such traits, including: It's irreverent, political, and satirical. Period. There's no point in splitting hairs over the writing, what happens, whether it's believable or logical. But don't get me wrong. It's not that mistakes can't be pointed out... all series have them. The point remains the same: ""The Boys"" is a successful series, and like all successful products, it's full of haters. I particularly enjoyed this season. There's more action, and compared to the previous season, although it takes a few episodes to really ""get going."" After the criticism of the eighth episode of the third season, which some found a bit underwhelming, they decided to make the final episode of this season ""rich"" in events.

As for the ""idiotic"" criticisms directed at the series, I can respond quite easily:""Only the first season was good!"" No. The first season was simply new. Then you just got tired of it.

""Now they're just going in circles, and nothing ever changes!!"" Very little changed from the first season. Even back then, they were going in circles, and there were long scenes of dialogue between the characters.

""But many things are illogical!! It's starting to look like a Marvel series!!"" So what? It's a TV show, not real life.

But the point is, my dear ""critics"" and logic lovers, if you think ""The Boys"" has been terrible since the second season, why are you still watching it?"

10.0,13 October 2020,"The amount of stars I gave the show, is enough to justify it's awesomeness"
9.0,20 November 2020,Now this is a true binge-worthy show. This show keeps you on edge and always wanting more. Can't wait for season 3. Highly recommended.
10.0,13 October 2020,It has loads of action and comedy in it. Trust me you won't regret following it. #heTAP!!!
10.0,15 September 2020,
9.0,20 June 2022,Two great seasons and the third is quite boring. Acting is really great except few people. The guy who acts Homelander is a really great actor also the focus on the mental disease of the heroes is really great. Great Effort from Amazon.
10.0,12 July 2022,"I love season 4.

I love the way they are roasting all the sides in the current culture war, the woke left marxists and the right, exposing both for what they are - the corporate signaling with BLM and rainbow flags, the Twitter scores, the instagram culture, the ""woke"" points... the scene in ""Disneyland"" had me laughing so had I almost fell off the couch. OMG whoever came up with Woke Wok should get some kind of a prize!

Love that Dean is Soldier Boy, I'm a big fan of Supernatural and glad to see him adapting well to the new role. I hope to see more of him next season.

A bit less in the exploding bodyparts department would be appreciated, but hey, we all know what we're in for when turning this thing on. I just hide behind a cushion until my husband says it's ok to look again :)"
10.0,9 July 2022,"The best series about superheroes, in each episode I love it more and more. Literally, if in our world there are superheroes, so they will be just like the series. The acting is very good and the writing is bold to the extreme.

An interesting and perfect series for me."
10.0,27 August 2022,"This is amusing and I have enjoyed watching it but it is built on incredibly stupid premise.

Why on earth would a group of superheroes need a corporation? Why would a guy with superman abilities be beholden to a bunch of flunkies.

It is stupid.

Especially when you consider the mentality of Homelander. He is a psychopath and intense narcissist. He kills anybody in his way. He is like a child with a machine gun. Who the hell cares about what is trending when you can fly? This was impossible for me to swallow. I kept going though because it was amusing.

Also Krl Urban's cockney accent was absolutely appalling. I come from Brixton (look it up) We don't all talk like Minder on crack. It was - again - STUPID."
6.0,31 July 2019,"Perverting superheros and making them despicable human beings seems to be the new go to. The show is unnecessarily evil. An example would be the second episode where continually cut to charred body parts being scooped into a trash bag. Why show close ups over and over again? It's another example of Hollywood baiting kids with the superhero theme, only to hijack and pervert their worldviews with vile subject matter. Regardless of what people say, tons of kids will end up watching this because of superheros alone, and we will continue to blame the president for the degradation of our country, when it's really us allowing evil like this into our homes...all for the self-centered desire to be entertained."
1.0,9 July 2022,"Dean Winchester on steroids, I love it😁😁 Jensen Ackles rocks this role, would like to see more throwback to his origin. A maybe a mini-part with Jason Padalecki just for the fun of it?😁😂"
10.0,18 July 2022,"Unique. Incredible Series, the battles are amazing as well as the scenes with blood too.

I've watched the three seasons in a week and other people they also have that opinion like mine."
10.0,20 September 2022,"I think they did a fantastic job with this show.

Every character has a back story that explains their why.

The consuming, sets, makeup, skilled cast, and storyline are currently incomparable to any other super hero programs right now.

Sometimes I wish that they just did a season dump so that I could binge watch, but the weekly episodes make me appreciate the show more.

The characters get more interesting with time. I really enjoy the new character that they introduce in season three. I can't wait for season four!

I feel like I can trust the producers and writers of this show to put out valuable, entertaining content. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother watching an unfinished show."
10.0,13 July 2022,"Many recommended this series to me so I chose to give it a go.. now I'm hooked.

It's so good! Dramatic, disgusting, shocking, entertaining, funny - just all round amazing. I can't wait for S4.

If I had one negative I'd say it's the accent of Butcher - it doesn't sound like it flows/comes naturally and is more emphasised than normal."
10.0,9 October 2020,"So the last episode of season 2 came today . After finishing the series I have just blown away . I really loved how they have showed today's real world problem in right way . Episode to episode they have showed totally unpredictable things , that's the thing I love about this show . You can't predict anything . I've seen many reviews here that it's political propaganda , it's not . It has shown the today's reality . I can't even explain how much this show helped me to understand the things . All the actor and actresses acted perfectly ( beyond perfectly tbh ) . Perfect show all around . Can't wait for season 3 ."
10.0,18 August 2019,"Amazing, fun, adult stuff. Film Noir meets the Superman.Just give it a go I seen this show 3 times back to back in as many days. The effects are awsome, the acting is spot on, the dialodue in great and the whole prodution is top notch."
10.0,7 July 2022,It has been shown to a great extent in this web series that what would have happened if the superheroes were in reality. This is largely a vigorous web series. This sentence has a good look. All the characters have done a great job in this web series.
10.0,23 November 2020,The Butchers have such awful cockney accents. Makes me cringe so bad. Apart from that awesome series!
10.0,14 August 2019,This show is sooooooooo overrated!!! Episode 5 and literally nothing has happened!!!
6.0,14 September 2020,Yet another streaming service studio original with a promising first season goes down the toilet in Season 2. Where's the wit? The fun? The ideas? The logic? Believe the other low rated reviews. Go read the original comics instead.
2.0,28 September 2020,Karl Urban plays his part to the key. Very entertaining.
10.0,9 October 2020,
8.0,5 September 2020,Love it and best of all is seeing this with 2 fantastic New Zealand actors in lead roles - Karl Urban and Antony Star are both so perfectly cast in their respective roles!
10.0,19 October 2022,"An amazing p*take that works on so many levels. Hugely entertaining from a purely action perspective, but it also satirises societies obsession with the superhero genre and vapid celebrity scene.

It also manages to successfully take stabs at the shallow selfishness of corporate greed and very well satirises America's culture of fear and world military domination (getting away with it by cloaking it in a comedic context).

The Billy Joel soundtrack songs played in this context are pretty funny. Also the feature leading roles by two great kiwi actors just make this show the best. Excellent editing that adds to the comedic elements and very good casting. Starlight is a treat on her own.

Truly deserving of its high score."
10.0,17 July 2022,"Among all tv and movie superhero shows of this year, you can clearly tell a lack of enthusiasm when it comes to the writing where everyone seems to be recycling the same ideas of other companies, and this show only makes me realize how poorly written those shows are, and how the only thing that makes them enjoyable is that they are part of the superhero genre, and now with this new season of the boys that comes back even more aware of this trend, we are left with what should be the right way of making a superhero story, which is by making it unique and by taking risks other companies like Marvel are too afraid to show."
10.0,11 October 2020,"A series that allows us to appreciate the true feelings, needs and values of what a human superhero would be. The emotional acceleration goes from 0 to 100 in seconds, it really is fantastic"
10.0,13 September 2020,"Great acting, great story, great effects, great costumes, great writing ect"
10.0,14 July 2022,"Deadpool²... Just when you thought no streaming service would go there, Amazon did... Amazing alternate view on our society, and what's wrong with it. And not afraid to go where others don't dare to go... Five stars out of five."
10.0,21 October 2020,"While the concept of the series is excellent and novel, the makers are palpably left liberals who hate conservatives and Trump in particular. The chief antagonist Homelander (checkout the nationalist monicker and attire) looks like a young version of Trump and makes no bones about speaking outrightly about MAGA. So it is a left liberal propagandist web series as is the case with most web series and movies these days."
6.0,30 August 2024,"What a shame... the first three seasons are very enjoyable. Personally I dislike super hero films - bit stupid and childish - and The Boys is a great antidote to that. Or it was. Season 4 plummets in terms of story, character development and taste (which was already questionable) like an elephant off a three metre board. So bad i can't be bothered to finish it (& that feels like such a relief).

Whilst I would like to see what the outcome will be (in terms of solving ""the"" problem) I can't be bothered with it.

I am surprised that the cast weren't a little perplexed at some of the rubbish that made its way into the screenplay.

I'm also amazed to read there might be a (final - thank the gods) season 5."
3.0,29 June 2022,"I am sooo over all the goody two shoes supes saving the world day in day out blah blah blah!

Reality is that if you are part-ish human, well power has a tendancy to corrupt. This show delivers the alternate view of supes and does it well. Karl Urban and the gang really deliver and Butcher's crassness is just an artform to watch. Anthony Star plays his part so well you can see his distain for us mere mortals.

Really all the actors here deliver and the follow-on seasons just keep ramping it up. Bring it on Vaught!"
10.0,14 September 2020,"Great writing, with sharp dialogue, amazing characters, and actors so good that bring this story to life with passion and most importantly success"
10.0,11 October 2020,"I love Eric Kripke.

The show is brilliant from S01. I wish the episodes were longer because that's how entertaining The Boys is. Kripke's writing is beautiful. I've seen his work from Supernatural. The comedy here is just brilliant! Everything about this show is brilliant! I went into withdrawals as S02 concluded. I expected it to be a longer season. This show deserves all the awards in existence. I am not being hyperbolic. I am saying, The Boys is a masterpiece!"
9.0,19 September 2020,"The best series ever. Very underrated and deserves lot more rating than this. This series is a combination of comedy, drama, action, suspense, science-fiction. A must watch for everyone"
10.0,21 June 2022,"This show came with different view of super hero other than we already seen in other movies. If you think super heros saves the world... Here the super hero are opposite than other super hero. In this show you will see dark side of super powers. Each cast perfectly fits in it character. The performance of 'HOMELANDER' literally fill fear in you.

In conclusion this series show different perspective of person having super powers. And you will enjoy each and every episode of this show."
8.0,26 July 2019,"I HAD been expecting something lighter so when I saw the record number of 'warnings' before episode 1 I knew my expectations were wandering around in a field somewhere, lost for certain (I gotta say there is an elegance to the fact that it hit EVERY friggen mature theme save for, what 'drug use'? Perhaps it's that I have a friend who's always saying he wants a show with so many warnings haha - yaaa this is it) Anyhoo, lemme return upon consumption of, say the first 3 epis with something worthwhile to relay - it's good though, it is good and you can glean its likely to stay that way // ok Ok Okay, well I'm back begrudgingly to say that perhaps I was overly enthusiastic. In fact, I likely will change it down to a 7 but alas I'm still within the opening hours. Here's the thing, whilst it's exciting and seemingly carries a relevant message AND, again seemingly well written, I can already see that the theme will likely pan out to be something to the effect that 'the real superheroes are normal humans not turning a blind eye to ' evil ' and though yes this is a noble endeavor its also a tad played out"
9.0,10 October 2020,Season 2 is upsetting all the right people but it's even better than the first
10.0,2 July 2024,"I watched seasons 1-3 in 2023, and I loved them, so when I heard of a possible season 4, I was truly excited! When it released, it did not disappoint with its satire of not only the superhero genre, but also the satire of American politics as a whole. I watched episodes 1-3 of season 4 as soon as they released, but when episodes 4-5 released, they soon became some of my favorite episodes with the new depth given to Homelander and the other characters. Most of the criticisms given to the show are due to viewers not understanding the show and what it has been building up to. I will admit, the political satire is not subtle at all, but I didn't let this stop me from enjoying the new season! I look forward to seeing what will happen next!"
6.0,20 July 2024,"Another season of The Boys, another year where little changes -- and once it does, it's largely contrived. Still, it remains entertaining, and frankly, as hard as its writing is to defend at this point, I'm almost kind of enamored with how dumb it is -- whether we're talking about the cast photos where everyone is flipping the bird to let us know how ""edgy"" the show is or the current state of its political ""commentary"".

And I get it. I understand perfectly why the satire at this point is so unsubtle that it occasionally makes Dhar Mann look deep: it's to make it obvious enough to chuds that this isn't ""their"" show, even to the extent that it ""makes fun of both sides"" (the show's criticism of performative gestures would often be construed as making fun of the left just as much as the right), that they don't glom onto it the way they did with Homelander and Soldier Boy after Season 3.

Regardless, what you end up with is a pretty dumb season of television but as I said, I was entertained by it, and I'd even go so far as to say that some of the actors are at their absolute best this time around.

Anthony Starr and Karl Urban are sensational, bolstering how perfect the casting is; it's damn near impossible to imagine anyone else in the roles. Less succesful are characters like Hughie (Jack Quaid), seeing as the writers clearly don't know what to do with him anymore; his arc is effectively abandoned halfway through the season and he's put through weird rape scenarios for the remainder of it -- one of which is played for laughs, one of which his beloved Starlight (Erin Moriarty) blames HIM for. (Needless to say, the Starlight-Hughie romance isn't as cute this season.)

But the action is as fun and violent as ever and there is the occasional joke that semi-cleverly lampoons the social media age as it might look in a world where superheroes exist, but it's rare. I've recently learned that Garth Ennis, the author of the original Boys comics, actually loathes superheroes and that there was never a greater point to his writing than ""superheroes sure suck"".

Therefore, I'd advise you to seek out Invincible (also on Amazon Prime) if you want a deconstruction of the Superman story -- wherein the parallels between a world like Krypton and the paradise envisioned by fascists are emphasized -- that has a little bit more to say, yet also says it more quietly than The Boys does with its Stormfronts and QAnon spoofs. Still, if you want musical numbers and disturbing dick jokes, I guess go with The Boys."
2.0,7 December 2022,"I know that it is literally what the show promises to be. And I tried so hard to like it, but I just can't. I like the underlying stories and commentaries. Superheroes gone rogue or the perspective of good and bad I think are very interesting themes to explore. But for me, the gross visuals are really over the top and take a way the joy of watching it. I have no problem feeling uncomfortable about myself if the story challenges my ideas and values of life. But this is more like I physically literally cannot stomach it. So i decide to stop watching. Kudos to anyone that still continue with the series and actually are excited about what the next season will bring."
8.0,8 August 2019,I am so happy someone thought of this concept (The actual comic book this series is based on) and Amazon made this series. This is how i imagined super heroes to be in real life. Marvel somehow corrupted the idea of people with super powers. There is no black nor while all the time... Gray is where the world lies !!!
9.0,9 July 2022,"This show caught me off guard with twists from every episode, this the kind of show that you cant predict whats gonna happen next, shid got me glued to my chair through every season highly recomended."
9.0,15 July 2022,"This show from top to bottom with characters, plot and powers is phenomenal. The acting is absolutely insane. Every single actor is perfect for their roles. Love this show so much."
8.0,5 September 2020,"The Boys is one of my favorite Prime original show. Just binge watched the season 1 and it was worth every penny.

The show gives us a new take on super ""heroes"" where everthing is a PR drama and how supes misuse their superpowers. A group of normal vigilantes plan to take down these supes.

The cast is full of very talented. Karl Urban portrays the leader of vigilantes and Antony Starr is casted as leader of corrupt supes. Both are portrayed as true bada**es. The visual effects and cinematography is amazing. The story is well written and is amaxingly adapted to screen. Really liked the concept of the show. Will definitely watch Season 2, expectationsbare high."
10.0,24 June 2022,"I was hesitant to watch this show because I don't care about superheroes or super powers. Couldn't care less about Marvel or the Avengers. But this show is an answer to an audience like me. Great writing, characters, acting and tells a meaningful story. I've never seen anything like this before."
9.0,27 July 2019,"I was super sad that Prime canceled the Tick, but apparently they have stepped up a peg with their production. Karl Urban and Jack Quaid have great chemistry, and the story is smartly written with believable special FX."

1.0,9 October 2020,That character is dragging down the show. Snore performance and whiny as heck.
10.0,18 September 2020,"This is exactly how it would be if America had superheros. Corporate greed, scripted television appearances and doing anything to make a company billions. Everytime I saw my father for the last month, he kept telling me to watch this show and I finally caved. Im in love.

My fiance who isn't big into superheros absolutely loves this show as well. The pilot was action packed and caught our attention and now we're hooked. Amazon did a fantastic job and have what I think are the perfect cast to make this show spectacular. I could say they pulled a Netflix but I'd rather this series not end after 3 seasons with a cliff hanger.

10 out of 10. I highly recommend."
9.0,17 July 2022,The best dark comedy series out there! I am fckn obsessed with it!! So unexpected and always surprises you with the most possible gross way 😂 i wish i discovered it earlier! Can hardly wait for the new season!
10.0,26 August 2019,"If you are tired from watching the next n+1 Marvel or DC superhero movie, or the next cliché series, than this show is for you. It is brutal, well written, dark, and it reflects human nature. The actor of Homelander is doing one of the best jobs in TV history.

Granted that are sidelines that are less interesting, but the main plot, the atmosphere, and the characters all make up for it."
10.0,7 October 2020,"A little bit of hokey mixed with quite a bit of 'WTF?' and a whole lotta 'Oh Snap!' makes for one amazing effed up Soup show.

10.0,15 July 2022,"This review will not be structured in any way. I am just tryna get 150 characters.

I really enjoy this show, some of the character development for these characters are just way too good and the backstories that show why some of the characters turned out the way they did. Some are deeply heartbreaking. The Fight scene choreography of season 3 is just so spectacular, I'm no expert but there's a fight that involves multiple people which I can only describe as one of the most awesome fights I have seen in a TV show. I really enjoy the whole idea of the superheroes not being these perfect people who fight for justice but are in reality corrupted by the fame, success and most of all the power. I HIGHLY suggest watching this show, there are some scenes which some people may find disturbing but just tough through it and you're in for an amazing story, a great cast of characters, emotional moments, GOOSE BUMPS and so much more. Do yourself a favour. WATCH IT."
6.0,19 August 2019,"I liked the idea a lot on paper. But the story itself is actually pretty average. The Seven are just conventional villains, so it's a standard ""small group of rebels vs powerful bad guys"" story with predictable cliches along the way.

It would have been a lot more interesting if the Seven were likeable anti-heroes and we saw things from their perspective. As it stands it's just a formulaic series dressed up in a subversive looking package."

10.0,1 November 2020,"The Boys season 2 is a fantastic continuation of the Amazon Prime show. The whole show is great thanks to the directing, writing and acting. Every actor does so well with their roles. It is very difficult to single out any one performer. My favourites are, 1. Anthony Starr as 'Homelander' who brings something new to this character and makes us feel sorry for him after he massacred seven people just minutes before. 2. Karl Urban as 'Billy Butcher', someone who does his best work in the season finale. 3. Aya Cash as 'Stormfront', the only actor who I am convinced can portray a Nazi as having redeemable qualities. We saw some well needed development for Queen Maeve (Dominique McElligott) and Black Noir (Nathan Mitchell) with more about the latter coming in season 3. The newcomers work really well within the confines of the show. Stormfront, she is brilliant and works well as a foil for Homelander. Another great newcomer is Lamplighter (Shawn Ashmore), he is used to forward the plot but also shows the terrible nature of most of the members of 'The Seven'. 'The Church of the Collective' side plot is very intriguing. Their entire gimmick is trying to get former members of 'The Seven' (A-Train and The Deep), back into the group. They have an interesting relationship with 'Vought International' whilst trying to get the members back in. In an early episode of the season the writers are obviously mocking cringeworthy superhero tropes like the forced feminism scenes, however, in the final episode they bring it back and are able to do the fights themselves and make them feel organic and not embarrassing like the others. The best episodes are, 2:3 ('Over the Hill with the Swords of a Thousand Men'), 2:6 ('The Bloody Doors Off'), 2:7 ('Butcher, Baker, Candlestick Maker') and 2:8 ('What I Know'). Overall, this is one the best shows I have ever seen, and the finale is the single best episode of any show ever. I highly recommend and if you are able to watch this, please do."

9.0,24 September 2020,"The overall idea of this series is cool. I'm disappointed that they messed it up. I don't find the characters likable or their conflicts moving. The story line just pitifully moves along. The main character played by Jack Quaid is a weak uncertain guy that disappoints you constantly, I kinda like Billy Butcher and Starlight but the story is convoluted. Not sure how you take a perfectly good concept and then make it tedious to watch but there you go."

10.0,8 September 2020,"Hands down. Best web series ever made. After watching this is when you realise Netflix is the most overrated online television platform ever and Amazon prime is infinitely better than it. The cast couldn't get any better than this the acting is totally perfect which makes you stick to the show from the beginning to end. The visual effects are movie level, breathtaking. The story revolves around a group of corrupt superheroes. Best show ever even better than those overrated stranger things and money heist"
9.0,20 September 2020,"Absolutely best show today. From tackling topics like politics, gaming, comic books themselves, Marvel and D.C., this show is just UTTER fun. From a suspense thriller perspective it hits the notes. From someone seeking that hard R rating it hits it. Someone needing a good chuckle it'll have that in their too. The story is tremendously written and the cast is utter joy to watch as they are great. All around my favorite show of all time. Many fun things going on from love stories to broken hearts."
9.0,15 September 2020,Hell yes..! Now there is sth for adults..! A place where supes arent the intresting characters but Bad boys are..! Language choice is A+
10.0,20 September 2020,"More of an ensemble piece in Season 2 every character seems to be imbued with fiery passion. Relishing their part in this amazing series.

It has breathed new life in the Superhero genre. Importantly it never takes itself too seriously and provides moments when your jaw drops open, quite literally.

Without a doubt, the standout star is once again Homelander, mainly because Antony Starr steals every scene with his unpredictable reign of super-terror. He's constantly chilling, and it's hard to not feel on edge whenever he's on-screen.

I'm loving the Super Seven's interactions and back story of Stormfront a wonderfully deviant diva whose motivations aren't apparent yet, only time will tell!

Overjoyed that Season 3 has been re commissioned as I for one can't get enough of ""The Boys""."
7.0,3 September 2023,"""The Boys"" is my favourite series and the best series of all time without any doubt. This show has everything, blood, women, kills, supes, good actors and most importantly COMPOUND V. The whole cast is exceptional but Homelander (Antony Starr), The Butcher (Karl Urban), Soldier Boy (Jensen Ackles), Frenchie (Tomer Capone) and Victoria Nueman (Claudia Doumit) were amazing. It even tops Breaking Bad (my second favourite series and one of the best oat) as the pacing is just perfect, without a huge number of episodes and the plot is on a whole different level. It has memes but also proper story-telling. Let's not forget the criticism this series shows to the woke culture (""normality"") of our modern world ,which is a very brave thing for a TV Show. ""The Boys"" accurately depicts how chaotic our would be if superheroes existed. It also shows how big companies control social media and the public. This show feels like it is reality as they have perfect understanding of our society and have also done great marketing and social media campaigns (check the Vought YouTube channel)."
5.0,5 March 2022,"Season 1 - 7/10.

This superhero show is a satire to you usual superhero movies. We have a fake superman, a fake the Flash, a fake Aquaman, etc. - so it seems that much inspiration is taken from DC.

The universe plays in a similarly corrupt worlds as the one we live in. The only difference is that they have superheroes, or ""supes"". On screen and in social media, they all seem like awesome righteous people but it quickly turns out that they hide more than one might expect. This is all for show and in reality there is a lot of corruption. Also, where do their powers even come from? The boys know about some of the supes heavy misdeeds and start fighting back.

It was alright. Honestly, I think the show was basically always super boring when the boys were on screen but it was often interesting when the supes were featured. They did a good show highlighting some of the corruption and ridiculing some of the superhero business but the motivation of the superheroes is not that clear. Why do they necessarily want to join the US military? One may argue about more money but the show does not at all show why these supes would need more money. I mean, Homelander is a freak who wears his superman outfit the entire day and his daily highlights is when he gets to have sex with his chef.

Season 2 - 5/10.

Meh, kinda boring. We get some new supes, get deeper into the mess Vought is in and Starlight gets closer to the boys, actually accompanying them occasionally. But man, why the heck is she so darn weak?

There is a focus on Homelander's child and quite a bit more on Homelander's insecurities. They continue to thematize some topics like religion, racism and white supremacy utilizing especially that this is an American series, as the black-white thematic and Christianity are especially prevalent in the US (but of course the same topics exist everywhere else).

But yeah. Meh. I wasn't convinced. Also not sure if some scenes needed to be added. Like the attack from the freak whose power is that he has a super long dick? That was disgusting and I don't think anyone needed to see that..."
8.0,29 July 2019,"This was a great show for a while, and then the Christian-bashing starts. And before anyone assumes I can't look past my own religious affiliations, that's not the only reason I started to dislike parts of the show.

I'd you're looking for action, this really isn't the show for you. It's more of a drama series, and it is an odd mix with the unbelievably graphic violence, which really seems out of place and unnecessary-I really don't think it adds to the story at all. And neither does the graphic nudity. Kind of confused as to why these elements are included in this series.

The majority of the dialogue is in the form of long speeches, which get really boring. In fact, the dialogue between characters is pretty awful. From what I've read, the monologues are mostly lifted from the comic book which is probably why they work, but the rest of the script-writing is pretty terrible.

Production and story line are great, highly enjoyable. But now to my other complaint.

Don't get me wrong, I am a Christian, but I have no problem at all with portraying Christians as hypocritical characters in any show or movie-this is part of the reality of life. Anything from 12 Years a Slave, to A Time to Kill, great films with this kind of subject matter do not bother me in the slightest; even Easy A and other comedic portrayals of Christians, I don't find offensive and I think can be highly entertaining.

But this particular plot line has absolutely nothing to do with the story, and it feels totally out of place. It's inserted for some unknown reason as the main subject of episode 5. And I'm not talking just moderate poking fun, there is incredibly offensive language and subject matter specifically concerning the very core beliefs of Christianity. I mean, we are taking about Jesus here, right? The guy who said ""love your neighbor as yourself."" I wonder if the writers would have done this for any other religion?

Plus, the last three episodes are just really boring. The show had so much potential, and then it just fell apart. Such a shame, good acting, good story, good production. But what a way to alienate half your audience for no real reason.

To be fair, the show doesn't portray Christians as good, but it doesn't really portray ANYONE as good. Pretty much every character is a terrible person who makes selfish choices and they all deal with the consequences."

9.0,26 June 2022,"Its just fantastic,absolute joy to watch. I have almost watch every comic book show ,but non of them are close to this series. I can say that the show is better than the comic itself. If you are a superheros movies or show fan ,its a must watch."
9.0,5 September 2020,"Anthony Starr is a revelation as Homelander as the guy you love to hate.

Brilliantly cast and always entertaining."
10.0,11 October 2020,"The mystery of season 1 end has solved and brought forward by season to very well and nailed it!!!

The beginning of season 2 was little slow but the time you wait and watch it gets more crazier and hail to the boys."
10.0,10 October 2020,One of the best series I have seen lately. Makes me believe not everything is lost for this world just yet.
9.0,16 July 2022,"I like everything about this series from casting to the bad side of heroes.

Well, the comics were wide received. And Amazon chose to make a show out of it. Though there are some changes in the character's gender, storyline, etc.

But the way they have executed is mind-blowing.

Season 3 was the most anticipated one, but every episode was worth the wait. I like the way the series is going.

Looking ahead to season 4.

Must watch, great acting, VFX, casting, screenplay."
10.0,2 July 2024,"The Boys is a series that I am eagerly waiting for, every character is very good, or for the butcher, I have no words. Or the fight scenes in this are murder scenes, I haven't seen such scenes in any other series. Or I can also say that you guys haven't seen either so as soon as possible, watch this series and also suggest it to your friends. The series blends stunning cinematography with dark, thought-provoking themes, delivering a viewing experience that is both entertaining and unsettling. If you haven't started watching ""The Boys,"" now is the time. It's a must-watch for anyone who appreciates exceptional storytelling and complex characters."
6.0,30 July 2019,"What a refreshing twist on the superhero genre! I love the dark comedy, and the implied digs at the MCU franchise. The cast are just superbly casted, with great acting and chemistry. Production quality is excellent, and has a big budget feel. The humor is well-written and does not get in the way of the storytelling, and does not feel forced or inappropriate. The blatant, forced social justice/political correctness that infuse so much of the new shows these days are kept to a non-distracting minimum here--this is how it should done.

Watching this show is time well-spent. Looking forward to many more seasons!"
10.0,10 June 2022,Plot wise the show is great! It definitely has an i teresting concept and pushes the audience to expand their view on what they think heroes might be. However I think the show has a poor representation on how middle easterns are portrayed. This show portrays middle easterns as terrorists and only shows Americans as the 'saviours'. Overall the plot is amazing but their representation of different ethnic groups is extremely outdated and toxic.
8.0,19 January 2023,"Below average. I don't see what people see The show is a typical superhero film but adds up a little of twists there and there but s all the same kind of hot trash. If you don't like superheros you wonlt like this

I don't know why its so recommended as something different from superheroes and that non fans of superheros would like it. Its ont.

Its also filled with hamfisted politics out of nowhere and a lot of times, gets worse as you go. I want to watch things for entertainment not a lecture.

The only positive thing I can say is they casted a good looking villian in Jensen ackles but that's about it really."
10.0,5 February 2021,"With the seemingly endless wave of superhero flicks being churned out every year, The Boys is the critique of the genre I'd been wanting to see since the moment I realised I don't identify with any of them.

I love this show's more cynical, realistic reimagining of what our world would look like with superheroes integrated into it. It takes these beloved, celebrity-status ""supe"" archetypes we see all the time in Marvel movies and portrays a version them where severe corruption goes on behind the scenes. These ""heroes,"" while being forced to maintain a flawless media image, get involved with bribery, manipulation, sexual assault, drugs, political assassinations, and fight not for good, but to protect the interests of a shifty conglomerate. It's interesting to see superheroes using their power the way two-faced politicians might, instead of the usual melodramatic cartoon Hollywood portrayal. Through this approach, The Boys offers a lot of commentary on corporate America as well as the soulless nature of pop culture - its references are very much in date, and it generally comes off as a really socially-aware show.

There are many solid characters, especially the show's main antagonist Homelander, who is easily the most memorable part of the show, Antony Starr giving an outstanding performance. There's some great set and costume design on top of that - I'm not sure if it's intentionally so goofy but I can't get over how hilarious A-Train looks to me.

Some aspects of this show are however flawed in my eyes - there were a few weaker plot-points I wasn't a fan of, with me specifically struggling to get into the second season at first. An ongoing problem for me throughout was the fact it felt way too easy for characters to just break in and out of what would be some of the highest-security places in America. Also, the semi-comical violence in this show gets to a point where it just feels too over the top - when you see multiple bloody CGI flesh explosions in every episode, the shock value wears off pretty quickly.

All in all though this is definitely worth a watch - as someone that evidently isn't a fan of superhero media, The Boys gripped me straight away, and I really enjoyed most of it."
10.0,11 August 2019,"The Boys could had beaten the Box office of JL. Thoughtful and realistic depiction of superpower beings. Top class CGI, although you will notice some inconsistency in some scene. Top class action and acting."
9.0,28 August 2019,So much fun! Don't miss it because you will be so sad like that dolphine!
9.0,10 August 2020,It's a satire of the Hollywood movie industry but with super heroes. Really great acting and dialogue. I love it. It could use some more action to balance all the talking though. A couple of episodes are really dragging along.
8.0,1 November 2019,This is my first review ever.I decided to watch it because of Slipknot's video. WE DEFINITELY LOVE IT (I often watch series with my son)!!! The music is fantastic and the way Jack Quaid develops his character is fascinating. Gripping and really recommended to watch.
9.0,16 August 2019,"The Boys excels in practically every aspect of filmmaking. The cinematography is amazing, acting is superb, storytelling is phenomenal, characters are memorable/relatable, and the VFX and costume designs are great. Kripke and Rogen succuessfully adapt Garth Ennis's comic series to the small screen. It's done in a way where it's not 100% comic book accurate but the liberties taken still manage to demonstrate the subject matter to near perfection. The only reason why I don't give The Boys a perfect score is due to the fact there are only 8 episodes. It could've (and should've) been longer. Despite its short length, The Boys is a must watch. It is so good that you don't even have to be a fan of the genre to enjoy it."
7.0,12 August 2019,By far the best series on any streaming service/tv. It was so well done. It is not for the easily offended religious people though. So if you're religious you've been warned.
3.0,11 November 2019,"This TV series was made to remind us a lot of things, that nobody is perfect, that power intoxicates and that we don't know what our favorite super heroes are doing when they're no saving the world. It made me ask myself a lot of questions and for that I am eternally greatful."
8.0,10 June 2022,Great execution but the basic premise is ridiculous. People with amazing powers are getting exploited by an an evil corporation because they have no other alternative? Come on!
8.0,17 September 2020,"Basically Season 2 is just 'Homelander' killing everyone. So predictable, so boring. The storyline so contrived. It feels so much like whatever. It's not even the typical average rating 3 out of 5, which seems to be everything these days, but this one is a solid 1. Nothing redeeming."
10.0,27 July 2019,"Amazon created a great show in The Boys. An excellent twist on the oversaturated superhero genre. The dark, well written, and complex narrative make for an intense character showing. Violent, graphic, and mature the superheros parallel the gods of ancient Greece. They are fraught with human fraility. Flawed, emotional, and vengeful this is not your average Superhero flick. Reminds me of Watchman. Overall, worth a watch. Excited to see what Season 2 brings."
10.0,23 December 2020,"It is a good tv show. In this show superheroes are not shown divine in terms of their mentality. they are super selfish for fame, money, public acceptance."
10.0,7 August 2019,"This is my first time posting a review, and I just had to for this show. Will surprise you in every way!"
9.0,9 August 2019,"An awesome series, the dark side to justice league proves all the things we areissimg if the superhero's aren't raised the right true way! An absolute joy watching and an interesting twist to the story line."
9.0,25 August 2019,"I'm my opinion this is the best super hero series made to date. The normal formula has been thrown out the window, this is different. The characters are engaging, interesting. Karl Urban is fantastic every second he's on screen. This series is for adults and well worth watching. I cannot wait for season two, absolutely brilliant."
10.0,26 July 2019,So im a grown man who just happens to be a kid at heart seeing the ads i knew it wasnt meant for kids however this is a blast for adults theres explosions and language galore here theres nudity and violence howevr if your looking for a damn good time then thisis the show for you absolutely no doubt this is a total win for amazon just like everything it seems to come out with
7.0,30 July 2019,"When superheros become spoiled, entitled and corrupted...politics and conspiracy on a super level. Super good vs super evil...some are hopeful that good will prevail."
2.0,8 August 2019,"I suspect the mere title for this series has triggered many people who vouch for the current MCU storytelling direction. I enjoyed this a lot. The dynamic between the characters esp the underdogs is enjoyable to see. Butch is excellently played and I love his accent and his disregard for other people's feelings! The Boys gets top marks from me but I hope this doesn't bow to social justice pressures as we've seen with the MCU and DC. Cough ""Batwoman"". Warning: This series isn't for Soyboys."
10.0,16 June 2022,Some things are very unnecessary and the killings are just too extreme. Some things the characters do are just outright disgusting. Very unnecessary things.
10.0,21 September 2020,"Season 1 was fantastic... season 2 introduces a know-it-all hipster who everyone is scared of. Some ridiculous scenes of The Deep getting to know himself (and his gills). Not a single worthwhile plot line.

Season 2 MUST HAVE new writers, because its a completely new show.

Dont believe the fake reviews.

Watch season 1 and pretend there was never a season 3"
10.0,30 July 2019,Love the show glad amazon took the chance on it I watch the whole season in one day
10.0,31 August 2019,"I've watched so many TV series and this one is indeed Superb! The storyline is very creative and original! For Adults only, not your typical superhero for Kids!"
8.0,12 November 2019,"Half way watching the first season and I already can tell for sure that it represents what a superhero story would look like in real life. It is a great twist on past decade of superhero genre, by shoving a big spoon of reality in the spectator. Well written story, good acting, this is not much about special effects but by the excellent drama involved. Amazing story. I totally recommend the series!!!"
10.0,23 August 2019,"Amazing series, loved the darkness of the comedy, if you like killing eve you'll like this. Great idea well executed. Can't wait till the next one. ""Did you call god the C word?"" Genius."
10.0,27 July 2019,Really great show! I loved it. The idea is great and acting is great. Homelander is wonderful) This is the superheroes which they would be in our real world. they will surely turn superheroes into that and make some more.
8.0,11 July 2021,"I loved the issues this show tackled, and the manner in which they did it. The characters were great, not one but two New Zealand actors to celebrate. What's not to love!"
7.0,17 August 2019,"That's was amazing tv show, you can see dark stories about superhero."
5.0,8 August 2019,"The Boys is so amazing I want to hug each and every person who worked on this show. The acting, the music, editing, dialogues..its all damn perfect!! Thank you Amazon Prime!!"
8.0,5 September 2020,"I like the satirical aspect of this show, but there's a lot of gore, stereotyping & some really bad dialogue, which is made worse by Karl Urban's all over the place and annoying accent/s. Otherwise, the Boys reminded me a bit of Buffy, but without the strong female leads and sharp dialogue. In the Boys, we have the unassuming girl with super-human powers, the gay girl, and the sociopathic girl, but they are all secondary to the Boys."
9.0,14 August 2024,"If so, watch this show without delay. For me, The Watchmen (comics and movie) are more than enough of a cynical take on the whole superhero genre. Alan Moore did everything that Gareth Ennis and Eric Kripke are so desperate to replicate, only a hundred times better.

Worse still is the show's commentary on current day politics, with unveiled allusions to Trump and Maga supporters crammed down viewers' throats at every turn. There's also plenty of cringe lines like ""girls get it done"" and overuse of trendy lingo like ""cucks"", ""snowflakes"" and ""chuds"". But Leftist are rarely subtle with their messaging.

By season two I guarantee you will never need to see another exploded head in your life. (Crazy but true.) Season one by itself would have been a fine encapsulation of all the themes that show tries to tackle. Everything after is just more of a same. The ""mysteries"" really aren't mysteries at all. Homelander has a screw loose, Butcher wants revenge, Starlight is conflicted, yadda yadda. The Boys never transcends its initial premise of ""what if superheroes were flawed?!"" with all the complexity of a ""I'm 14 and this is deep"" meme. If The Walking Dead never wore out its welcome for you then you might like this show. But if recycled cape-porn tropes aren't really your jam then probably just stick to season one."
8.0,6 August 2019,I just got done watching the boys first season. I thought I was great but the whole time I was watching it I just kept thinking to myself doesn't watch my coming out with a TV series as well and how's it going to be compared to this because watchman's going to have some great competition I guess? Let's just hope it's as good or better
9.0,19 August 2019,Saw the previews for this new series and thought I'd give a look. Wasn't expecting what I saw but I'm no doubt hooked. Cannot wait to see the remainder of the first season.
8.0,17 January 2021,"With all it's gore and sometimes shocking scenes, with a story in the background of what a super could or could not be. It all makes this so compelling that you can not stop watching. Loved the twist in this series."
10.0,27 July 2019,"I can't believe I binge watched this series in one sit, My eyes are burning but I'll try to write the review. the series is what you expect and what you'll want, It is an incredibly satisfying narrative and a new take on the super hero world, It's not really realistic, it leans a lot more toward the dark side of this world. the series deal with Issues like sexual assault and drugs in a very smart way that most shows and movies these days don't know how to do. the stories of each character is very nicely designed even the bad guys and the ending is very satisfying and will leave you wanting more. this show is a very well designed series and is very much worth your time."
10.0,2 August 2021,It's not that easy to find this kind of real-life relatable fantasy web series or movies. This is one of few which are incredibly diabolical to watch.
10.0,10 October 2020,Just finished season 2 absolutely blown away. Amazon don't ever can this show
7.0,5 September 2020,
2.0,8 September 2022,"I honestly have nothing to add to what has already been said about The Boys. This is just a fantastic TV show! It has quickly become one of my favorite new TV shows of all time, if not my favorite! When the first season originally debuted, I was hesitant to even watch it, but I watched the first episode anyway, and I was so hooked that I watched the whole first season. I fell in love with the characters, and the acting was fantastic, just amazing, and then there was a unique second season, and before the third season came out, I watched seasons one and two again! Season 3 has a slight dip in quality compared to the great season two, but it stars one of my favorite actors, Jensen Ackles, whose performance as Soldier Boy was fantastic! Since seasons 1 and 2 were so fantastic, I expected a slight dip in quality, but I'm pretty sure that season four will catch up. I was overjoyed and excited to learn that another of my favorite actors, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, would be appearing in season four. There is no way that with him on board and the rest of the great actors, the series can't be even more brutal, bloody, and perverse, just like I love it!"
8.0,23 August 2019,"It was good, a bit cliche and you could always guess what was coming next - no twists or surprises but sort of watchable, I don't think there were any likeable characters, the ""main guy"" was a wishy-washy wimp and ""The Boys"" were just washed up wallies. The thing that really did my head in was Billy Butcher's atrocious accent. It was like a New Zealander watches Snatch once and goes ""yeh i got this"". It was awful, made no sense and while everyone else seemed to be a good job doing their character Billy couldn't decide if he was going to do a comedy routine as a New Zealander pretending to be in Eastenders or going to be an exagerated London lout - it was rubbish. Just made me feel like there was so much effort into making a great show and this pantomime accent and overacting let it down."
10.0,10 August 2019,"This is an amazing superhero show, amazing story watching this made me question how people watch those nonsense story lines and terrible cgi. For a TV show this is amazing cgi. What won me over was the story, sounds almost realistic."
9.0,7 August 2019,"If you're reading this before you watch, this is not your normal run of the mill super hero show. Its kinda like Watchmen meets Mystery Men....but darker way darker. Not to be watched with kids."
8.0,15 November 2019,"This show feels a lot like Watchmen yet without the liberal undertones. This show is a harsh reality of what superheroes would do in our world if there was literally no one to stop them. The great storytelling, acting, and the insane plot twists along the way make this the greatest super hero TV show of all time."
9.0,14 August 2019,"Great series, that really is something extra. Acting is great and this is must see."
10.0,12 December 2020,"It would be the real world if superheroes did exist! This coupled with good writing, interesting plot-twists and the absence of clichés makes it the best among the superhero movies/shows for me. The endings of both season have a perfect subtle cliffhanger which makes them feel finished and at the same time makes you look forward to the new one!"
9.0,9 September 2020,"Same energy the plot is more intricate, you see more of the heros real feelings and emotions, looks really good for the rest of the season. Stromfront has something to hide very excited to see what.

Only thing i really don't like is The Deep side story. It's not funny so far kinda pointless unless something big happens next with this Scientology parody religion. The scene where he talks to his body and sing made me cringe big time, idk if it was supposed to be funny but it was lame."
8.0,24 July 2022,"A breath of fresh air regarding superhero media. The actors are impeccable (specially Homelander and Kimiko), the plot twists are always on point, and personally the role of Giancarlo Esposito just took the series to a whole different level. Also, finally some good gore being presented in streaming services."
6.0,28 July 2019,Great show we really enjoyed it! Definitely recommend!
3.0,4 October 2020,"I'll be honest with y'all, the show is good, really good, but that's it.

It isn't the show who represents how the superheroes would be in real life, that's an edgy and ignorant take.

Neither is the best superhero show, that will be Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. along Daredevil but that's a thing you'll never realize cause y'all wanking on The Boys way too much to see how good AoS really is.

People called Titans the best sups show and at the same year Daredevil Season 3 was released, you are seeing the pattern? Cause hell, it is very clear.

It's just popular and has a lot of gore and dark humor, that's why it's trending.

I have seen people calling it the best show on air but that's just ridiculous, that's the overhype speaking for them.

But hey, what do I know? The Boys is too much for me to handle I guess"
8.0,8 September 2020,"3 Stars simply for Anthony Starr absolutely killing it as Homelander. His performance aside, so far Season 2 has been disappointing, in my opinion.

They took an actually interesting, entertaining show and turned it into yet another bloated, slow moving, preachy show that I would never watch. Typical modern television: has a bit of success with originality, then uses the show as a ""platform"" to express cliche ideals. Lame bait and switch.

Wish they just stuck to the source material! Read the comics to discover the subtle but important changes the showrunner and writers decided to make. Imagine taking someone else's creation and arrogantly thinking you can change it to suit your agenda."
9.0,5 August 2019,
8.0,1 August 2019,"Enjoyed this spoofy superhero series, as did everyone else it seems. Although I'm not sure who taught Karl Urban his London accent, sounds more like an Australian accent, guess it makes sense for a Kiwi."
10.0,6 November 2019,"The Boys adds a heavy dose of reality to the superhero which is frequently all sunshine and rainbows. The language, cgi, dialogue, story, everything screams: reality!"
10.0,31 July 2019,"You always thought of seeing superheroes in anti-hero image, some minor tweaks of brain washed or side switching have been shown ever . But this is that coming true, how you have wished what mortals would do in front of powered gods. This is good watch."
9.0,25 August 2019,"Creative, fast pace, lots of twists. Great acting, sci-fi and writing is excellent."
9.0,18 October 2020,"Season 2 political??? Really?? Guess you could find the back of a cereal box political if you try hard enough. I do agree season 1 is better but i love season 2 as well!! I was depressed going into season 2 after reading the reviews but i guess since i am not a political person i didn't see what those reviews were talking about. Season 1 was better because it was new, a different take on super heroes, and well i am a fan of Karl Urban and love his role in this. Season 2 does a lot more back story on some of the characters which i enjoyed!! Love the dark comedy and enjoy the music in it even more!!"
9.0,21 August 2019,"A nice change from the usual formulaic superhero twists a refreshing blunt force of a series led by the bluntest object of all Karl Urban. How I imagine superheroes would really be like if they existed the perfect blend of anti-heroes on each side with drama, action and humour all in equal doses. Great fun."
6.0,8 August 2019,"Unplug yourself from poor adapted Marvel and DC fare and see how it's done. Masterfully crafted it's got action, superb acting,plot and character development. If you liked Preacher you'll love this 10/10 for me shines in a world where movies and tv are made to please the minority. It deserves how ever many seasons they need to tell their story."
5.0,8 December 2020,"Season one is much better than season 2. The two leads but heads a lot but they are on the same page. However season two Hughie really gets annoying and is just an emo child. Also the show has major nudity warnings, which you'd think would be naked chicks but it's just a bunch of dicks. Overall the show is good with a great plot, but it has a lot of small annoyances that just don't make it as hyped as it is right now."
10.0,8 September 2020,
10.0,16 August 2019,I was excited about this show when I saw the first the trailer and read into the premise. It exceeded my expectation of a new show. The only negative thing I have to say is there are only 8 episodes in the first season.
10.0,11 August 2019,"I rarely get excited about TV series anymore. Breaking Bad, Rescue Me and Bosch are some of those worth writing about. But then along came ""The Boys"". What an absolute gem this was. Top writing and directing. But it was the acting! Never seen Jack Quaid before, but casting pulled a master stroke here. And Karl Urban. Accent all over the place, but brilliant nonetheless. This is quality TV. To all involved, thank you and you can all take a bow. Well done."
8.0,4 August 2019,"When I heard that amazon was going to make this series it looked like a raunchy superhero show. After watching every episode I have been proven wrong. This show is a breath of fresh air on the superhero genre. At points this show is mature, but the story and the characters are all compelling. Can't wait for season 2."
9.0,15 August 2019,"If super heroes were real, this show would be more relatable than any other super hero show/movie I've ever seen. Hilarious, dark, and Compelling! 10/10 would recommend!"
9.0,24 July 2022,The acting in the show is very good. The series criticizes superheroes very well. Might be the best superhero series I've ever watched. The series also touches on some very good places.
10.0,18 October 2020,"Its a different universe where Superhero are bad and mean. Compared to Marvel and DC, they boys deliver where normal people saves the day from Superhero. Story telling is on a different level. Its worth of a hardcore Nerd fan of Superheros and Supervillains."
8.0,30 July 2019,Great script empowered with superba acting. Must watch!
7.0,30 March 2020,
5.0,26 December 2021,"The episodes are entertaining... Sometimes with a slow pace & ""easy to remove"" scenes. They should have worked harder on the plot holes. Some characters are hard to swallow whether good or bad fellas."
9.0,12 June 2022,
9.0,23 October 2020,"Lots of action, killing, and swearing, including the ""c"" word. I loved season 1 more, but season 2 was not far behind. It seems that it might not have a season 3, but I guess time will tell."
8.0,21 July 2020,"""the other side of grass always looks greener"" A concept which left us rethink about the superheros. Season 1 ends with some unanswered questions and which makes it worth to wait for season 2."
9.0,4 September 2020,"I will talk about most recent 2nd season episodes. The plot continues to be great. Butcher is witty as hell and I am not "" STARK RAVING"". Only issue that puts season 2 below 1 is the familiarity with the characters. All the major characters have already unfolded and that really messed up the element of surprise in season 2. Don't get me wrong, the actors have done a perfect job again but it is getting a little predictable. Some new Supes have been introduced but it's hard to bind them with the ongoing storyline and feels rather contrived.

Well, regardless of its shortcomings, 'The Boys' is a great watch and I would highly recommend it."
10.0,21 August 2019,"A sobering rethinking of everything that has been piled up about superheroes lately, in the key ""But is this super X just a crazy psychopath ?""

Banter over modern culture, bringing to absurdity, shifters, unexpected moves - everything is very intense. Not to much sentimental and dull empty talks.

All turned upside down. Gore and harsh black humor is present.

One of the BEST this year, definitely."
9.0,14 August 2020,
10.0,16 August 2019,
9.0,9 August 2019,Thoroughly engaging and entertaining reimagining of the superhero genre.
7.0,29 August 2020,Amazing and disturbing it will blow your mind. Awesome and that you must watch
5.0,13 August 2020,Good Superhero movie after a long time. I liked the season 1 more than remaining.
10.0,18 September 2020,"What the heck is going on? Season one was so good. Season two has jumped the shark in a big way. There's very little action and they turned it into a soap opera. We waited a year for this garbage? I don't understand why all the critics are giving season two great reviews. The fact is, it sucks! The story drags and nothing happens. If you're looking for superhero action, don't waste you're time with this season."
8.0,11 August 2019,"I was very pleasantly surprised that the whole super hero show was not like the normal run of the mill. I am a big Marvels fan and a bigger DC hater so was worried that this had come from the DC camp . Thankfuly not as both story acting etc was executed brilliantly a real adult show binge watched the whole first series and ear gels await the next,specialy with all the cancelled marvels productions that I loved to watch this will keep me going."
8.0,3 September 2019,"This show is really unique, and i couldn't stop watching it, is really worth to watch"
8.0,12 July 2021,"I started first season on Amazon and this is really nice series. When you think not superhero things, it is really suitable for understanding the political situation of some countries.. Nice characters, nice story. Also Butcher is funny. The Deep is hilarious, I am looking forward to 3rd season."
9.0,27 December 2020,"The mixture among heroes, corruption and blood is just perfect."
10.0,10 August 2019,Hope they dont fu*k up the second season couse it is AMAZING
10.0,29 July 2019,"Its Dark , its funny, its engaging everything you want from a series is there is this amazing prime original series. I officially say that with this Amazon prime will be in the game. Karl urban is so badass and his acting is humorous offensively funny. This has everything suspense superhero fantasy crima drama comedy dark homour, love betrayal its a full package. I dont know why not many people know about this its not marketed well but its one of the best series of 2019 and I am so looking forward for new seasons. Prime needs more content like this. Just awesome 👏🏻"
10.0,30 July 2019,I Really Love the characters especially The Boys Agains The Super And the plot it's unique and epic And The End like imagine the biggest wow in your life and that it 🔥🔥🔥🔥 100% Shocking. . Can't wait for Season 2❤💯
6.0,11 November 2020,"I like the overt swipe at Scientology the series gives in the 2nd season. Nice. I found the first season more tantalising than the second, however the final episode of the 2nd series cant be beat. Overall, the heavy gore and violence could be toned down, but apart from that the show is great.

A satisfying commentary on the hypocrisy and deceit that characterises big business in the real world."
4.0,25 January 2022,
10.0,5 October 2024,"The latest season of The Boys had been a disappointment. Television series, like any other form of art, often reflect the times and environments in which they are created. The creative direction of a show can be influenced by a myriad of factors, including current events, societal shifts, and even the personal experiences of the writers. It's not uncommon for shows to evolve over time, sometimes in ways that may not align with the expectations set by earlier seasons. The challenge for writers is to balance storytelling with messaging, ensuring that the narrative remains compelling and characters stay true to their established arcs. When a show takes a turn that seems to diverge from its original path, it can be jarring for viewers who have invested in the characters and the world they inhabit. It's a delicate dance between staying relevant and maintaining the essence of what originally drew audiences in. Feedback from viewers is crucial as it can help guide creators in understanding the impact of their work and shaping future content. As the landscape of television continues to change, the dialogue between creators and the audience becomes ever more important in crafting stories that resonate and entertain while also, perhaps, prompting reflection. The hope is that subsequent seasons can find a way to address such concerns, striking a balance that satisfies both the narrative ambitions of the creators and the expectations of the audience, and not just vomiting personal ideology on out screen. Writers and showrunners should leave their politics at home and just write good stories."
8.0,26 February 2021,"It took me a couple of days to review this show, because of the impact it had on me. I'm not the biggest fan of really graphic violence and the depiction of it and it can be the reason for me to not watch a show. The Boys has this (sudden) graphic violence in it, but I took it, because the show is really gripping. Ok, maybe a couple of flinches and sideways looking :)

Urban is just fantastic as the main character and carries a lot of the grim energies together with Antony Starr. The latter develops as a really creepy and convincing sociopathic villain. The rest of the cast is well sought out and together they form a great team to portray the story.

The story itself is at some moments not the best told story. There are a couple of jumps and assumptions that the viewer must swallow to follow the storyline, but overall it's well laid out and it develops in a good way. The action, the cgi, the camerawork and the pace are great and keep the viewer very much engaged.

In all honesty... I can see that its tagged under dark comedy, but one could also argue that its just a really dark depiction of a possible universe not too far from our reality. I personally believe in a bright and open future, but if you put on some really dark glasses and let yourself be drowned in hopelessness... than The Boys portrays a really scary future. But in the end, it's a great sci-fi show with a very original twist and I would have rated it higher, if it wasn't for some abrupt moments and twists that didn't feel natural to me. But a definite watch!"
10.0,25 July 2020,"One of the most entertaining and clever series currently available on television. Now that the whole superhero genre has taken over Hollywood and we are getting plain cgi fest, which generally lacks key storytelling elements, its so refreshing to watch something that is so unique and thought provoking and just plain old entertaining. From acting, to storytelling, to action sequences, to comedic timing everything is just so perfect that will want you to wanting more of this."
10.0,13 September 2022,
10.0,30 July 2019,"This show is brilliant and unique, unlike marvel and DC silly series"
9.0,30 July 2019,Loved this take on the superhero world. It's dark funny and feels like a series of 1 hour cinema movies! The casting is amazing couldn't fault anyone. I just hope they can hold everyone in for the next season as there are so many actors that will be catapulted to stardom (if not already) by this series. Hopefully bigger budget and lots of cameos!!
8.0,25 August 2019,Absolute amazing writing. Very creative and realistic. It's a must watch!
10.0,23 January 2021,"I really, really enjoyed this series because it really provided a different view on the action and superhero genre. It is very gritty, and I liked the creativity put into the series!"
6.0,8 August 2019,"If PC culture doesn't destroy it, this may be one of the greatest shows ever. Taking Superheroes and making the story realistic. The characters are awesome and have more depth than your everyday super hero show. I give 8 stars because its too early to give it any better."
1.0,18 October 2024,"It started pretty well with the first two seasons, got a little bit weak with the third one (I think that it was interesting only because of Soldier Boy) but the fourth one... I'm sorry but I had to skip some scenes because they were either disgusting (like the one with the ""batman"" character, Ashley and Hughie) or just plain boring.

To be honest, I'm glad the fifth season will be the last one (besides spin offs), because it's becoming too long for what the main plot is.

Regardless, I must say this show isn't all bad: the acting is the best part of it, Homelander is such a good character and the political division between the Starlight fans and the Homelander ones is pretty cool."
10.0,24 February 2023,"This is such a well done show, so engaging and interesting with great characters and back stories. The special effects are great and Karl Urban is awesome as Butcher. The first and second seasons have some shocking scenes with a lot of graphic violence, etc. But the third season just goes too far for me. And, that's coming from someone who was fine with the first and second seasons. There are just far too many scenes in the third season that were too gross, and done only for shock value. It's not necessarily the violence, but the childish nudity/depravity and other really bizarre things that pushed it over the line for me. I probably won't be back for season four unless they dial back the shock factor/depravity quite a bit and go back to just the standard levels of obscene violence. My score would be a 9 or 10 for seasons one and two, but season three drops my score to a 5."
9.0,21 August 2019,It so different from all the others superheroes movies and series. It really shows you how sups will behave in the real life.
10.0,9 August 2019,"A pure cotton candy for those who despises Superheroes and related movies and stuff. And for those who loves new-different-out of the box ideas/stuff/stories, the series would surely please them entirely."
10.0,1 September 2019,Every second you spend while watching this series is freaking worth it. What the F are you waiting for?
10.0,18 December 2022,"For a series about super heroes, there is surprisingly little action save for a load of gory CGI. By the third series it is getting a little tedious and any scenes concerning the 'deep' character really take you out of the flow. It is not even clear what kind of superpower he should posses. The scenes with Kimiko and Frenchie are the best. A little special love story and some awesome fight scenes. Karl Urban's growling starts to get on your nerves after a while. I would have liked to see a bit of character development I guess. It is still highly entertaining, but with better scripting this could have been awesome.."
9.0,2 February 2021,The first season was amazing but the second has been terrible. Dragging 21st century issues and politics into it....boring.
10.0,15 July 2020,Good attempt against the Avengers in a Hilarious way. Really good Series worth watching.
8.0,19 October 2020,"I watched the whole first season in one sitting; over 8 hours without budging from the sofa and it was easy. Amazing story, well written with an excellent cast. Worth watching for Starr's performance alone, although all of the cast bring their A-Game to every episode. To top it off, Season 2 somehow managed to match the pace of Season 1.

No need to go into detail with this show - just watch the first episode and try to stop."
7.0,22 January 2021,"I was reluctant to watch this show but finally I found it entertaining and somehow, unique. Scenes like the saved dolphin are hilarious... And much more to be seen."
5.0,4 January 2021,"What if superheros were real, and corporations were pulling their strings. That pretty much sums up this show. I love the idea, because it is probably how it would really end up playing out.

Its a good watch but the gore is over top. Like tarrantino neck wound over the top."
8.0,25 July 2022,"All too often, 30 minutes of compelling story line is completely undone by a scene that is beyond ridiculously dumb. It's like the writer and producer get bored and hand the keys to their insane uncle with a sixth grade mentality."
10.0,17 August 2019,
10.0,2 September 2019,"I never grew up with that Marvel or DC BS nor do I know the difference between those two ""universes""...

BOY, DO I LOVED THIS SHOW...! Everybody who is sick of that usual superhero ""goodie goodie- I save the world""-sh't, binge this show.

I highly recommend."
10.0,26 July 2022,"Good thing that I didn't read anything about this series earlier and I was really amazed. Couldn't guess for a single episode what was going to happen next. No all honest hero, no all bad villain - awesome!"
9.0,14 August 2019,"I always liked Karl Urban but he has overdone himself here. Butcher is one of the best characters ever.

And yes, he's not afraid of calling morons as morons, so that' why so many are p**ed off.

------ spoiler --------

Sorry you can get angry to Butcher all you want but that's the truth; all conservatives are moro... well, nevermind. Enjoy the show!

------ spoiler --------"
10.0,28 July 2019,"Thanks a lot to Amazon bringing us a decent sci-fi and super hero show finally. Superb realistic scenario and successful cast deserves praise.

I hope more will follow on season 2"
10.0,14 August 2019,"After Netflix's The Umbrella Academy, I thought superhero genre can't be more different. TUA was good and different. But after watching The Boys, I know it can be more different. The series is a slow burn. The first few episodes are slow and only picks up pace afterwards. The final episode was one the best finale I have ever seen. The performances where good, costumes were good and the performances were very good. The series's dark and gory take did make a good impact on the overall. The Boys is simply one of the best series I have ever seen in superhero genre."
9.0,30 July 2019,"It's funny, edgy, over the top, everything for a good r rated tv show. A friend showed me the first episode and the next day I bought prime just to watch this show and it was totally worth it. I so hope there's a season 2!!! Please make it happen prime!! Love this show!!"
6.0,13 July 2020,This is what Marvel should've been. The cast is top tier with especially Homelander. Not a perfect show but I enjoyed every episode.
1.0,9 October 2019,"That headline is directed at the writers of the TV show, not Garth Ennis. I would be less annoyed had The Boys been terrible from the start. But it wasn't.

The first five episodes, the bulk of the whole season are brilliant: funny, ruthless, brutal, uncompromising and really, bloody well written. My partner noticed things going awry at episode 6 but I really didn't catch on until the final episode just how much they'd bottled the climax.

Ah, jings, depsite the poor finale the show is still really good. Watch it, enjoy it and I hope you manage to scrutinise the ending as much as we did."
10.0,7 August 2019,"It started out pretty good. The first few episodes were a refreshing change from standard TV fare.

Then the writers decided to go all-in with the anti-Christian bigotry in episode 5, and I was done. It was typical Hollywood ignorance on display, but with a vengeance (calling God the ""c"" word, for example.)"
9.0,8 May 2021,"This one came as real surprise and turned out to be one of the greatest series I have ever seen let alone greatest superhero one! Unconventional heroes and villains make this one a great watch!! Screenplay, R Rated action sequences, production values, cinematography, direction, acting of almost all characters was just top notch! Its a welcome addition to superheroes genre which is hardly Rated R and only for adults! May go down in the history as one of the best series ever(personal opinion). Karl Urban rocked so did Anthoy Starr in as the bad bad bas superhero!! Aya Cash came and conquered! Keep doing the great work. Waiting for many more seasons to come. Just a suggestion to amazon is to release the entire series at once for binge watching and not weekly episodes! It sucks to wait!!"
10.0,21 October 2020,
10.0,18 August 2019,"Do watch this! It is a the more real superhero TV show. Also, this a series where the concept is more like Watchmen where it is a ""what if"" scenario for superheroes being real."
10.0,17 March 2021,"This is an excellent rethinking of a superhero Cinematic Universe. I love the characters, the writing, acting, and the visuals. It is hard to stop and go to bed, it really keeps you glued.

My problem is a lack of an actual story arc. After completing the first season, and going two episodes into season 2, I'm still awaiting the completion of any narrative Arc. I find this is a problem with many of these Netflix, or Amazon series: a sort of a soap opera curse.

With the Liberty to run the storyline through multiple episodes, there is no pressure to tie it up and put a bow on it. Compare that to your usual Hollywood movie, which gives you the whole story, and a sense of closure in 2 hours. I miss stories like that."
8.0,29 July 2019,"This new series also uses every typical elements which are essential for a mass entertainer like violence, nudity, comedy,'f' word etc. But what's good about this one is it's politics. And it has lot to communicate with the audience.For a superhero movie fan, this one is a refreshment program. Waiting more from this anti-superhero series...."
9.0,11 August 2020,"Accurate in spite of wordplay above. No spoiler to mention I just took a pause after an airplane scene in Ep 4 of Season One. That was the triggering threshold to jump on IMDB and go on record. I sincerely appreciate engaging stories and this is far and beyond most. I'm watching, fully-engaged vs usual dozen other distractions while lesser shows patter on in background. Quality is so unique, however, that I'm opimistic it will continue throughout the series. Meantime... you will NOT be disappointed. Take any preconcieved notions such as those that delayed me finally starting it and toss. Some core issues are endemic to the basic plot with superheroes in ""real"" world but deftly handled in a truly realistic manner I'd afraid would reflect any such reality. Not like anything seen before ala Hancock, etc. All characters are outstanding but double boo-ya for Karl Urban. Thanks, New Zealand, for sharing one of your national treasures."
10.0,26 August 2019,"This is surely the best series of 2019 and is is the perfect therapy for chronic superhero fatigue. ""The Boys"" definitely deserve and applause for the dark fantasy and amazing story-line."
7.0,30 July 2019,"I have never written a review of anything before, but this show definitely deserves one. From the start till end it was perfect and couldn't fault any of the acting or storyline. Something that's totally fresh and new which was most needed in the superhero themed movies and shows currently."
1.0,9 August 2020,"Awesum to see 2 kiwi actors in this amazing show, I hope this show has many more seasons in the future"
10.0,31 July 2019,"I found myself falling asleep watching this it was so boring and weak, not nearly as good as the comic even tho it pretty much follows the comic storyline, mostly. Still bummed wee Hughie isnt scottish."
10.0,29 July 2019,"Another clever narrative shrouding gender and sexual expression fluidity via agenda. Sadly we are moving farther away from any sense of moral fabric in mainstream entertainment. #commonsense

Too bad as I really liked the premise."
10.0,15 August 2020,"Group of vigilantes taking on superheroes?? I started watching with the same ""whatever"" feeling. But now completely hooked. Super fun and super entertainment! 10/10"
9.0,12 December 2020,"Unique, at least on the TV medium. It's certainly not new in the comic or literary mediums. Highly entertaining. Anthony Starr as Homelander is simply off the charts!"
10.0,26 July 2019,"There is so much TV to watch out there these days in the golden age of cinema that I am skipping shows that I cannot imagine I doing a few years ago. But watched each and every minute if this show.. wow! Great Characters (Butcher, Karl Urban being allowed to play himself is amazing and so far my favourite character. I love this new role for him). Simple Plot: Watchmensque beginning, remember the tagline,, 'who watched the watchmen' Amazing Non Cheesy Mature Sharp Dialogues and great onliners ('Tighter than a choirboy's @#$!..lol), Beautiful settings and Visuals. Down 5 episodes and am already hoping we get more of this."
9.0,6 August 2019,"Didn't expect to love this but I did.

10/10 do recommend."
10.0,26 August 2019,I love this show. A lot. Better than any others. This tell me my review is short
8.0,8 November 2022,"Amazon Prime has really captured a new essence of the superhero franchise and the recent burnout most have felt with both the MCU and DCEU is completely gone in the boys. It's more than blood, gore and dark humor with deeper themes delving into corruption and the dark side of the American dream.

The performances are absolutely amazing, and especially homelander and billy butcher are two standouts that will immediately become fan favorites. The show makes you care and hate the characters. You understand their emotions and reasoning for their actions. All around this is a niche' series for certain people. If you have a dark sense of humor and enjoy much more than just serviceable TV this is a definite watch.

9/10."
7.0,6 September 2021,
1.0,10 July 2022,
10.0,29 July 2019,"The show is basically for kids, just with sex and violence. It's same old Good VS Evil, just this time Evil is super hero.

The story will be more interesting if they are actually super heroes, if there are super villains only they can deal with, can you just ""blow them up""? Some shows like onepunch man or watchman also deal with part of this, and they are much better than this.

The whole setting is childish and incomplete, if there are so many people with super powers, where are they? And where are other super human in other countries? Should China or India got most super human in numbers? But the story just stay at the basic level, really disappointing."
10.0,7 September 2020,"I was enjoying the first several episodes until it decided to get preachy and political, geez, would love to watch a series without the writers feeling like they have to push their politics on you.. Smh"
10.0,14 September 2020,"A super hero series that feels so real it's easy to actually believe it could happen and relate to the characters, like someone went to the trouble of spending a few minutes developing the characters personalities and thinking how they'd react in any given situation. Also this is a series that hasn't been infected by the ""let's give this to our A TEAM now"" like Netflix does whenever something becomes a hit, and turns good series into woke pieces of crap filled with identity politics and political messages. Second season is on and it's just as good as the first one, if not better! Just watched episode 4 and can't wait for the next one."
10.0,6 September 2020,"We all know the basic superhero story, superhero wants to save the world, they save the world, everyone loves them, the end.

But what if the power and affection all went to their head?

This show, I believe, is the most realistic show involving superhero's yet. Not to mention it's a perfect mix of hilarious while also adding the disturbing scenes to really balance it out.

Highly recommend."
9.0,30 June 2020,"When I compare The Boys to Gotham I'm not saying that visually it is like Gotham, just that it is similar in that it takes ordinary people and pushes them to psychological limits, their dilemmas resulting in extraordinary heroic, or conversely, overblown devious behaviour. Like Gotham the serious edge is twisted with the whacky, resulting in enormous entertainment. For me, this is better than the Powers TV series (2015), though a very similar theme, basically because rather than a single fallen hero cop investigating superhero wrongdoings, the superheroes here are opposed by a very rogue, brilliantly resourceful and animated team of imperfect vigilantes. The characters in The Boys are deliciously chosen. It's super stuff, and great credit to the writers, totally engaging from beginning to end (I've only seen season 1), each episode highly satisfying, with characters you can either have great sympathy for or alternatively find reprehensible in the extreme (and many subtle colours between), with fantastic effects and a snappy script. For me, this was as much a classic revelation as was 2019's Brightburn the movie (though not as dark). I am increasingly being thrilled at comic universes coming to light. It is as great a revolution to me in my middle age as comic books were when I first discovered them as a small boy. The Boys is easily one of the most original things I've seen this year, despite the concept being explored in previous dramas. Cool bananas!!"
10.0,26 June 2022,"Billy Butcher, what a character!

Just one slight peev.....in Season 2 they have an episode about a guy waking up in the morning, every morning, listening to right wing radio, TV, News.....then he goes and murders someone.

It works both ways though!

And in this day and age, far more often from the left!

Anywhooo, that's my Tuppence worth."
10.0,16 July 2022,"I love the Marvel heroes, Ironman, Captain America, Hulk, but my new best friend is Billy Butcher. He's vulgar, gross, swears far too much. The first season was probably the best hero stuff I've seen since the first Ironman. This third season is just a bit to brutal for me. Still some good fun though. Homelander is really creepy you'll hate him. Try the graphic novels."
9.0,28 October 2023,"(Seasons 1 to 3)

I had zero expectations about this show when I started watching it, maybe because I only check it whenever I have free time, so I kind of enjoyed it at times but not much. Also, it doesn't really offer something new to the eyes; the here and there of the story are just copies of other superhero stuff that we see everywhere, so it really came out dry and predictable, and the characters' energy didn't really have any major impact on me at all. But, still, I finished all its seasons...and, as funny as it may sound...I think I'm going to have to watch another one when it comes out anytime soon....

(Season 4)

That ending is one heck of a cliffhanger. Season 4 is just insane as hell, and that, I think, is what saved this from all of the boredom that I got in the previous seasons. Likewise, there's not a single episode in this that hasn't blown my mind; everything is just pure madness.

Also, I think the best thing that happened in this season is Sage; she's the highlight, the plot, and the villain, no doubt; and of course, I love some Gen V cameos and can't wait for them to appear again on screen, cause they're literally one of the reasons why I decided to give this show another go, and that is a game changer for me.

It's just sad that we'll have to wait again for god knows how long just to get another season, but I'm seated for it, so do it."
7.0,1 July 2022,"The previous seasons were really good, but season 4 is top notch production quality. They've stepped up the shock value significantly as well, making Tarantino's worst seem like Mary Poppins."
3.0,9 August 2019,Just overrate this tv series Jajka is ua di oaoanam and and ues
10.0,20 June 2022,"This show is really well done but I think it is the most misogynistic show ever in TV history. It presents itself as showing the horribleness of these characters but when Homelander is talking about how the fans are loving the real him it is a true commentary on society and just the same as what happened with Trump. So each week this show is furthering the love for bad people like Trump, etc. This show is popularizing fascism, not trashing it. I suspect the people behind the show know it too."

9.0,7 December 2022,"The Boys series is a very good series with several funny scenes, but this series contains its ups and downs with bad scenes and good scenes. But this series represents a truth in itself, that even if there were superheroes, the media would end to corrupt the heroes, and also show what the heroes behind the camera were going to be like. So this series just showed what it would be like if a hero existed. Not everyone would be like Superman wanting to save the land, and yes it was going to show some crazy heroes. And that's why I like this series because it shows how Superman would be if he was evil."
10.0,20 January 2021,One of the best show in years. Can't wait for Season 3.
10.0,29 July 2019,"Ever since being announced, I've been looking forward to this series! Karl Urban is an awesome actor and he delivers in this! It's a mix of fun, action, comedy and an all over good time! I'm SO happy it got renewed for a 2nd season! I CANNOT wait! The characters are portrayed great and the chemistry is hilarious and everyone works so well together!"

9.0,11 December 2020,"What an excellent interpretation of the behind the scenes of superheroes for all the marvel and dc nerds out there. Watching this, you really don't know what to expect. It's such a violent, gory and shocking show, with the script on par with the content of the scenes."
10.0,23 September 2020,"Basically superheroes here are the corrupt politicians and the ""Boys"" are the normal day to day honest people who stands up to their abuse and corruption... it's ok to watch"
9.0,27 September 2021,"Concept wise, this show felt better, started with interesting plot and cool characters, but as it progresses.....it just delivers nonsense and unnecessary scenes which makes it lengthy and boring. I mean they wanted to make the watchers believe that homelander is a bad person and for that.....they show us dozens of lengthy scenes and just like that so many other unnecessary scenes make this show too long.

When the season 1 ends......what actually happens..... nothing......like the things they should have shown at 3 or 4 episodes mark.....they are showing at the season 1 end......and what happens in season 2...... nothing again......the show loses its original path and focuses on some other storyline...... The whole show looks like filled with poor writing and unwanted."
9.0,13 July 2020,"This is a must watch series. The best plot, best actors."
10.0,27 June 2020,Can't wait for the next series. Original concept and hope to have many more series.

8.0,19 August 2019,"Game of Thrones just handed over the torch.

10.0,23 October 2020,"Although The Boys was an adaptation, it has unique quality to keep the fans guessing every time. Storyline is perfect. There were some scenes that were bit confusing and complete opposite to what mentioned before. I highly enjoyed 2 seasons and have to say that cast is doing an exceptional job."
8.0,28 July 2019,"This is well worth the watch for the most part. One or two of the episodes were just pointless and stupid but they did stick with the script at least. I loved the anti propaganda, anti ""I am woman hear me roar SJW"" crap that you see on almost everything these days. I wasn't crazy about the finale at all however. This show has major promise but I will be surprised to see a second season. I would like to see a second season, but I would be surprised if it gets one."
8.0,15 September 2020,The show is dragging as hell and the creator thought they will get succed by releasing it in weekly basis despite being OTT platform show.
9.0,21 August 2019,That was something didn't see coming you got it boys in all the ways rather it is story or vfx they nailed every single episode of this series prime originals are getting very much better in story line or visual effects go for it right now!!!!!

And finally something with super heroes for an adult audience that doesnt include kids or annoying teenagers The script and acting is awesome - Urban is one of the best anti-heroes of all time. And season 2 started out great as well. Just hope that more people find this hidden gem."
1.0,7 August 2019,
10.0,23 August 2019,"I love Supernatural and Eric Kripke et al have done a great job making a great series. WTF moments come from the very start with 'the A-Train incident', I don't think I've ever been more surprised watching a TV show!

Few little holes in the plot creep in including how Hughie is suddenly able to find Annie (Starlight) In the last episode what a stroke of luck!! But I didn't really care and the series is so good you'll forgive it's slight misgivings...

Fave character has to be Butcher! Karl Urban is a Kiwi so I just think his over the top British accent is deliberate and fantastic! If you have a kid who's going to watch this be warned, the language and banter is choice, and hilarious! Butcher is just such an angry man and the ending is just so good!!

Watch this series."
10.0,26 January 2021,"A great series, with a few very nonsensical moments. Overall... epic."
10.0,21 August 2019,"Aside from the terrible English accent, it's a decent show. I am well and truly sick of super heroes which seem to be all that anyone makes movies about anymore however this is more about anti-heroes, it's alright, worth a watch"
8.0,16 October 2020,"Yeah, yeah, the plot is interesting, cool idea, but it's a gross out fest all the way through. Unless you really want to know how dead inside you are, save your mental health and watch something else. I wish I could erase my memory."
10.0,12 August 2019,"This is the superhero release you didn't know you needed. It's so nice to see the different spin on superheroes; the one we all knew would be possible, but no one ever talks about. I can't wait for more episodes to come out. My only complaint for this show is that there were only 8 episodes in the first season."
9.0,30 December 2020,"Absolutely amazing! Everything you want out of a series. Funny, plenty of gore, action, supes and shock moments! I'm currently re watching this with my mum and she loves it! One of my favourite series. Love it! Ignore the bad reviews. It's certainly worth watching!"

7.0,22 July 2022,"Realistic in so many ways, it doesn't stop from giving the audience what they actually need. What I like most about this series is that it represents real world issues such as what's actually going on between corporations and its representatives and people supporting liars and murderers or things that covered up just to not cause any conflict on media. I'm on season 2 so far, and it's going really great, and from what I've seen, season 3 is also a banger, can't wait to watch!"
1.0,20 October 2020,"Ok so this is one of the best tv shows I have ever seen. I am amazed by all standards! I don't want to spoil anything so yeah, just watch the damn thing!"

8.0,27 July 2019,"Interesting premise for this series--I was hooked quickly with episode 1. But the villains/supes are pretty much cardboard characterizations, and there really does appear to be a political agenda pushing it all. I got a ways into the third episode before bailing out. I've seen enough. Yeah, corporate greed is a big meany; haven't heard that before. You know the two-faced politicians are intended to be representative of a particular party and ideology. Haven't heard that before, either. It feels pretty hamfisted--just no longer interested in what's being pushed, here. I watch TV and movies to be entertained, maybe moved . . . but not to be indoctrinated. Bleep that bleep."
9.0,8 December 2019,"Love it. Great storyline, good acting and character development. Love the concept that even superheroes aren't perfect and need to be held accountable for their mistakes and actions. A refreshing change from DC and Marvel that is full of costumed clowns that I am completely over."
10.0,14 August 2019,
9.0,13 September 2020,I am a huge fan of the anti-hero storyline. I thoroughly enjoyed this season. If you're into the superhero genre I suggest you watch this. I love the cast lean in the show. The characters are diverse in terms of personality and are very well developed throughout the story. The main character has an amazingly good character arc. The production value is very good as is most Amazon productions. it is offered in 4K format which is great. The story is great. It is fast paced enough to keep you intrested the whole time.
10.0,27 July 2019,I was glued after watching the first episode. Have an inkling that the story is not the typical heroic in nature on its first 15mins until i verify it here in IMDB.

3.0,4 February 2021,"The Boys is mega!!

10.0,24 July 2022,
10.0,8 August 2022,"The series ""Boys"" is a phenomenon. A peculiar, but a phenomenon. The project interested in its unusual plot: the life of superheroes in modern society without embellishment. And this is an intrigue.

We're all used to comic book heroes. In recent decades, projects with diverse characters have been released one after another, recently almost every month. But all these projects are united by a common narrative concept, in which there are good or bad characters, or something in between. These characters are shown as fighters against evil, adjacent to it or hesitating. But not the heroes they could have been at their worst. ""Boys"" is a narrative without notes, without censorship, with all possible range of emotions and diversity of characters, among which the basest instincts, vices and a lot of negative things prevail. This is what hooked the series. At first. Well, then everything began to rest on the most interesting plots from season to season, where a lot of memorable characters are revealed to us, each of which is an amazing hero in its own way.

The series is sobering. It allows you to look at who people with superpowers could really become in our real world. They are beautiful in public, they are constantly working on creating a beautiful image in the media and social networks, but at the same time each of them is playing their own game, the underside of which ordinary people should not see. After all, then this action is shocking, and popular heroes will open up to their idols from a new side, not at all from the one you want to see them from. But this is what catches the series: the unprecedented intensity of realism, wild situations that occur during the development of the plot and, of course, behind the scenes of superhero confrontations, where each of the supers can be the enemy of the other. And with each season, the picture only improves, the plots become more saturated and interesting, revealing the characters from new sides. It would seem that the usual heroes of the work have already formed an opinion about themselves, but, believe me, they are ready to show something that will excite and make the viewer reconsider their opinion about them.

The production is good. The project is replete with atmospheric scenes, sometimes too violent, but this is one of the chips of the ""Boys"". There is a good black humor, excellent scenario moves, a lot of blood and not only. Special effects are performed at the proper level of a multi-part blockbuster, which is confirmed by the full canvas of the picture and its perception.

Acting is on top. Each character is terribly realistic: from episodic characters to the most important actors. I discovered the masterful play of actor Anthony Starr, who presents to the audience a kind of analogue of the famous Superman named Homelander (Stronghold, Patriot, Fatherland, Homeland - depending on the translation). Possessing almost all the same superpowers, this character is strikingly different from the usual kind Clark Kent. This is a really iconic character that makes you watch yourself with special interest. Starr makes it unforgettable and at the same time so disgustingly interesting. The Homelander is a controversial character. Throughout the series, he shows himself in a way that no one would want to see the true leader of a superhero team. However, this is the whole interest of watching ""Boys"". This is a project that tears up all superhero cliches, it is ready to show a completely different world in which I absolutely would not like to be.

The plot of the series is based on the confrontation of supers (people with superpowers) with a small detachment of their opponents, who believe that supers cross all boundaries and should not exist. But this is not a typical confrontation, where some are good and others are bad. You can't see the familiar world here. This is a fight in which all means are good, where each team has its own semi-groupings, and each hero must keep an eye out so as not to be thrown overboard by his team.

The project raises all the most pressing problems of modern Western society, not disdaining an abundance of violent scenes, arguments on racial, gender, sex topics. It seems that the project skillfully ridicules the stereotypes that have been established in recent years and at the same time carefully bypasses the sharpest corners. But as a spectator, it's damn interesting for me to watch what's happening.

Another important topic that is constantly on the screen is the representation of superheroes in the mass media. The ""boys"" draw a completely realistic picture when they openly show viewers (but not ordinary residents of the presented world) how the images of supers are formed for society, what tools are used for this, how they try to keep supers ""on a short leash"", and what happens if the situation gets out of control. It is a pleasure to watch what is happening.

I would especially like to mention the translation with which I managed to watch this series. This is a Cube-in-a-Cube for the first two seasons and a translation of RedHeadSound for the third. Translation with a mat, it should be noted, but for a project such a presentation of the material is perfectly similar, the vocabulary successfully falls on the original dialogues, everything is always harmonious and to the point.

The ""boys"" are good. A true masterpiece of its kind. This is an opportunity to see an unusual story, to come off to the fullest, to enjoy all the human vices, of which there are many here.

9 out of 10."
9.0,24 April 2023,"I could not get past the first three episodes. Overall, the show's premise is all about innocent, good, or naive people who are overpowered and victimized by a bunch of very disturbed and privileged individuals publicly viewed as superheroes. It's an understatement to say the characters were unlikable. The actions of these superhero characters with the positions of power that they had were so upsetting I felt that I was being violated just by watching it. They were all either apathetic, sociopathic, or downright repugnant, making it really difficult for me to care about the story as a whole.

Moreover, the show's attempts at dark humor often fell flat and felt forced, coming across as juvenile rather than witty. The female characters, in particular, were poorly written, reduced to little more than sexual objects or plot devices, which was both disappointing and uncomfortable to watch. I mean, look at the title, ""The Boys""...that kinda says a lot about how the female characters would be treated.

The original pitch for this show should have gone straight to the kitchen trash and stay buried under the rotten food.

UPDATE: Hahahaha.....a lot of people found my review unhelpful. I did change my wording a bit, but if you are a fan of this show and didn't like that I despised it, all I have to say is sorry, guys, but it's all true! Go ahead, find my review unhelpful. I don't care. This show is utterly disgusting trope just like my title says and it deserves a 1-star."

10.0,10 September 2020,"This serie has some really weird moments but i think its how superheroes would behave if they exists in this world. And thats why you keep watching, in its own weird way is this serie realistic."
9.0,12 December 2020,"I love this series, It so different from other superhero movies. I also like normal superhero movies but this one is great."
7.0,5 September 2020,I absolutely love the show and can't wait for more seasons to emerge. I just really hate how starlight is constantly narrating the show in season 2. It is super annoying and feel like I'm listening to a book instead of an actual show.
4.0,8 July 2020,"In an age of endless mediocre superhero films that attempt nothing more than bringing mild entertainment to the masses, The Boys is here to save the day. What would happen in a world where superheroes are treated as celebrities? Where they are the ones with powers and so they call the shots? That's the central premise of this show.

The Boys begins with a bang, grabbing your attention before you even know it. With such an explosive start, you instantly realize this isn't about heroes saving the day, otherwise there would be a lead up to this scene, rather the show takes a different approach. The Heroes, having saved the day, are celebrated. Soon enough their darker side is exposed to us.

And so begins a tale of good and evil and everything in between. One filled with twists and turns and a variety of morally grey characters, as well as some flat out evil ones (I'm looking at you, Homelander). The characters are so well written and their stories are so well told that you will find yourself sympathizing with characters you hated to begin with.

Some of the subject matter can hit close to home. Questions are asked and statements are also made about the world we live in. In a sense, The Boys takes reality and dresses it up in alluring superhero costumes to make us look at the world around is from a new perspective.

I recommend checking this one out whether you hate superhero movies/shows or whether you love them. This show looks very promising and I can't wait to see where it takes me."
9.0,22 December 2020,"I don't usually like the super hero genre. but after watching the first episode I fell in love.. This is not the typical web series you have watched.. This felt like watching my favorite movie but a long version of it.. The action, the gore, the humor, everything I hope from a good movie(series) was there. Even the story and acting is good.. The chemistry between the characters felt natural.. Yeah there are 1 or 2 stupid scenes.. But you would hardly care about them..."

8.0,15 September 2019,"The boys was a nice treat. The story line is solid, the action scenes quite well directed, the blood and mature scenes just enough to keep it interesting.

9.0,8 October 2020,"I never heard so many swear words from people in real life. My ears were bleeding! But I am still trying to watch the second season till the end, cause I like the idea. I think that screenwriters should think about alternative way to express character emotions."

8.0,29 July 2019,"Having to live such a Marvel/Disney dominated world, this show is the perfect remedy for someone like me, who is easily, utterly (though not always) tired of the average-superhero This series is dark, violent, hilarious with surprisingly a lot of heart. It still kept much of that Garth Ennis essence but have certain adjustments of their own that make it just as great as the comics, if not even better. Amazing cast, VFX and script. There are a lot of scenes that are ridiculously brutal but never felt like they were for shock value.

It's personally very difficult for me to find a series that I truly enjoy, because I'm just picky like that. I'm glad that I've found this show and definitely recommend it, rather you're a fan of the original comics or not."
7.0,20 August 2019,"Here comes this irreverent, snarky, pull no punches show that's glued my eyeballs to the screen for the past week.

With exception of Karl Urban (who is excellent as always) the cast was new to me. Some of them I wouldn't want to be in a room together with. And after watching episode after episode, this gut sinking feeling has grown stronger. Fantastic.

Now there are minor writing hiccups and lack of attention to direction, but this is a solid show that expands on the evil superhero theme better than anything I have seen to date.

Please don't screw up season 2."
1.0,30 June 2020,"From the Pilot it quickly becomes clear that this is not your run-of-the-mill superhero trash. It's a pretty unique take on the genre with great acting, some unexpected plot-twists and an ending you're not likely to forget anytime soon. Rated R for a reason and I loved it."
10.0,5 September 2020,"I love this show. Fresh and funny with tongue in cheek characters. Itdoesn't take itself too serious and as a result its entertaining.

Full of flawed charaters on both sides of the fence. They battle it out continuously. Well written and hopefully there will be multiple seasons."

10.0,10 October 2020,"Wanted to like this show; the premise was promising and I like some of the actors featured. Production values were good....HOWEVER!!!! Both my wife and I could not get past the vile and crude aspects of the scripts. If you have half a conscience, this show is sure to be an affront to your senses on a variety of issues and levels. Quite frankly I am disappointed that the actors have compromised themselves to the extent that they have agreed to participate in this repulsive waste of time and money."
9.0,15 August 2019,"Wow. If other shows on here are like this then I need to watch more stuff on amazon prime... TheBoys is absolutely amazing, this series really blew me away and is now one of my favourites, just everything about it is just so good"
9.0,2 February 2021,Must watch if searching for anything that separates itself from the feel good marvel and DC universes.
7.0,9 October 2020,"When this series was released I remember me being in a bad place and binging it just like any other. When I completed it, most of my friends hadn't seen it, I begged them to see it, and now we can't not talk about it.

I love Amazon's idea of releasing one episode per week even though initially I hated this, but this showed me that this way it stays with us longer and has a deeper impact.

The casting is great specially Karl Urban and Antony Starr. The range they have is incomparable. They are not following the source material and it has turned out to be really good.

The CGI is perfect, the story arcs are great, and everyone has a clear motivation behind their actions that give them depth."

10.0,2 August 2019,"Superb show, Original, funny, well acted and a great storyline that keeps you hooked Only issue is... Karl Urban is supposed to be English and his English accent is 'ok' except when he bizzarely reverts to a Kiwi accent at least once in every few episodes!.. Surely this was noticed in the edit??

But this is a small issue in the best show of the year"
10.0,5 August 2019,"Fantastic. Dark. Raw. Unflinching.

The ""suits"" are essentially a metaphor for ""celebrities""."
10.0,5 August 2019,"The series that got me to subscribe to Amazon Prime. Despite reading all about the spoilers, amid all the hype I just had to go and watch it for myself.

And sadly, it is not as satisfying as I hoped it would be. The production values are pretty good, as are most streaming series these days.

The characterization was a bit spotty, they were dead right on some but the others, not so much. For example, I'm not sure they really knew what to do with Queen Maeve, nor with The Deep. I think they wanted him to the Comic Relief of the series, but he didn't come off as that funny.

Initially it was good see a fresh take on the Superhero genre, but eventually it just got a bit tiresome watching a bunch of jerks with few redeeming qualities.

Still a good enough series to watch overall, with some nice plot twists."
8.0,10 October 2020,"A refreshing change to the usual superhero offerings. Those who say Series 2 is a disappointment are talking out of their behinds. I think they may have hurt feelings because of the political parallels thrown in there, along side the dark humour. Instead, concentrate on the strong character development and the age old story of good overcoming evil, but at a price. One of the best recent TV shows out there."
9.0,30 July 2019,"Nearly every rating relating to strong sexual content and violence was shown before the premiere episode, yet the Spartacus series has more overt sex, nudity, and language than this show did. I can only surmise the reason was to get viewers attention to watch. Other than the 'click bait' as it's referred to on YouTube when the title gives false info about the video content. I took about half way through to begin to get the dark humor and point of the show and it's characters. I agree it's a refreshing alternative to all the CW DC comic based shows. And the reality proposed in this show is about as likely to be real if there really were people with superpowers. Power has always corrupted absolutely and always will."
8.0,21 September 2020,What everyone else said already in the comment section below. thanks for reading.
9.0,12 July 2020,"No words can describe how good this is. The writing, effects, acting, concept. Kiwi's Anthony Starr and Karl Urban, nail the leads as they always do."
6.0,29 July 2019,"Needless to say from my headline, I cannot wait until the season 2 debut. From the first episode until the 8th, a realistic take on the lives of Superheroes is offered as gritty and as honestly as possible. I love such renditions, it keeps the superhero genere fresh. What a concept, to think superheros have insecurities."
10.0,28 July 2019,"So I've read through most of the reviews, and they are full of praise, and the only bad reviews are from people who read the comics. So if you didn't read the comics like me, this is probably among the best shows you will watch all year, great acting, great story, cool graphics, amazing chemistry between the actors, and totally unpredictable. I went into this with no expectation at all, since I just landed on it by mistake and it was a pleasant surprise. Am only 4 episodes in and just loving it. This is absolutely not for kids. I've watched a lot of crazy shows in my lifetime and thought I could never be surprised, but there are those moments in this show where I just went, WTF did I just watch."
10.0,4 July 2020,"From Outrageous Fortune to this, his acting is brilliant. Great show too."
10.0,6 May 2021,
8.0,17 August 2019,"If America actually had superheroes this is how things would go. Like me, if someone is sick of Marvel and DC universe it's a must watch for him."
9.0,28 July 2019,
9.0,28 December 2020,"The boys really changes the Superhero storyline.We are all used to a certain superhero who saves the day but what about those same superheroes who are the real villains.Just amazing and it is done perfectly,more seasons left to enjoy."
8.0,25 October 2020,"Friendly, but a bit overrated. We find much better as an Amazon Original."
9.0,13 October 2021,"Ever wonder why shows like this wait until season 2 to get political? It's because people only review the first season.

Season one is genuinely fun. As Amazon demonstrates time and time again, they make amazing live action versions of other people's stories, so long as they don't try to do any writing on their own. The not-so-subtle comparisons between the superhero industry and Hollywood are really on point. Great action, and some serious tension.

Season two felt like a different writing team. Lots of (now past) current events crammed in everywhere, lots of group stereotyping, and generally just a lot less world building and character development. There was some good action and a few twists here and there, but mostly just came across as preachy and dated watching this in late 2021.

Season 3 is more of what we saw in season 2, but worse. The few decent characters are constantly emasculated, and the writers seem to think that gore and sex acts are a fair substitute for humor and tension.

Season 1 gets 8 stars.

Season 2 gets 3 stars.

Season 3 gets 2 stars

3 stars overall because I take personal offense to the deliberate bait-and-switch by the producers/writers."
6.0,4 September 2020,The boys is the best show om tv fight now and its so different form other superhero films and tv shows with fights being realistic and just awesome
4.0,19 September 2020,"Best series I have ever watched. Won't disappoint you in in any way. The best, high budget superhero series even better than most live action superhero movies. So underrated, even 10 stars would be insufficient. A must watch for everyone"
10.0,8 July 2020,"This is a great show with good actors, story & script. The superheroes (bar 1) are a foul bunch of people but the BOYS are the real heroes. My only complaints are that I need to keep subtitles on for 'Frenchie's' dialogue as his diction is unintelligible, and Karl Urban can't quite convince with his distracting performance of a Kiwi/Fake Bri-ish accent. Out of all the cast Simon Pegg merits 1st prize for his nor-too-bad-generic American accent."
9.0,10 October 2020,"I was surprised that some reviewers criticized the anti-hero, over sexuality, political, and religious components of the show. Guys, relax! the show itself is a mock to all that and also a critique to the people exploiting the same things in other movies."
10.0,30 June 2020,"Absolutely brilliant. Great cast, well written and some really good cinematography. Not usually a fan of the superhero genre but this is a fresh take on it with gritty action and dialogue set with a decent storyline and a lot of comedy on top. Watch it now."
8.0,7 January 2021,"Story, drama, comedy, action, romance, politics and super hero's."
10.0,17 August 2022,"Some sad, cynical man read the Superman story ""What's So Funny About Truth, Justice and the American Way?"" and thought to himself ""Um actually, several things 🤓""

It's an effective action thriller series with goofy exploitation-style gore. Karl Urban is great as Billy Butcher, their variation on the pseudo-hero Manchester Black, and Anthony Starr is fantastic as Homelander, their twist on Superman.

Meg Ryan's son is the heart of the story. He is very charming and charismatic, but sadly cannot act to save his life.

The show gets bogged down by it's simplistic commentary that is presented with an annoying self-importance.

In addition, I think the ""evil Superman"" schtick was kinda cool in 2011, but now can feel tiresome. This is not entirely the show's fault, but the oversaturation of this kind of story in the last decade definitely takes away from the enjoyment.

I wish we had more sincere, heartfelt takes on the Superman archetype, I guess it's not gonna come from the Lex Luthor streaming service. (although The Boys' version of Luthor is still a bad guy, played brilliantly by a sleepwalking Giancarlo Esposito).

In conclusion: Fun and cool, but not nearly as profound as some people make it out to be. The 2nd season is considerably less polished than the 1st, both in the storyline and almost all aspects of the execution."
10.0,14 September 2020,"The first season is a solid 6, maybe a 7 as Karl Urban (The Bourne Supremacy) really carries the show in every scene he does. The season ends with a good surprise ending. In the second season things fall apart as they struggle to find a plot for all the developed characters which are quite a few, the 7 heroes, the 5 antiheroes, and the support staff of about 6. I think it's just too many balls in the air for the writers to juggle and they end up trying to force everything to work together.

A good premise but poorly executed and several scenes in season 2 are just annoying and pointless and leaves the audience wondering if this is the best they could come up with."
10.0,19 September 2020,..except for Simon Pegg's American accent! Totally unique story line
10.0,10 September 2020,"Just watch it! You won't regret! For me this is the best series ever produced. It has all the ingredients a series needs. It has the sense of (black) humor as well as some outstanding action scenes. The scenario Superhero vs Human has the touch of David vs Goliath, but it's much more in there. It's also Good vs Evil or Poor vs Rich. Good actors, great story, lot of blood - I love it!"
6.0,8 January 2021,"I watched 2 eps, it's ok.. just that. Pacing is slow, 3/4 of time is filled with pointless scenes. You can see they saved a lot on cost to make it by small repetitive locations, almost no fx etc. Story... Is almost not existing.. If you have never seen a corrupt superheroes in any graphic novel or game then you will be surprised.. for me it's ok to watch but nothing fancy or engaging. It's still better than Ennis novel which was all about 10yo jokes"
1.0,29 September 2022,"I went into The Boys expecting some idiotic, predictable and cliché superhero show. I was proven wrong within the first episode of the show. The show is about a band of men (and later women) run by William Butcher, who try to expose the corruption of Vought, a company that protects superheroes. It starts of slow and strong and you slowly start to feel a connection with the characters. The acting is impeccable, and the writing is unlike any I have seen in the show. Homelander is easily the best written character, and possibly has the best actor of the show, who can perfectly demonstrate the narcissistic tendencies and behaviours of his character. If you haven't watched his yer, I highly recommend you watch it, because it is genuinely the best superhero show ever. It's deep, original, and understands what it's trying to convey throughout."
9.0,8 July 2020,"With DC pumping out garbage (With a few exceptions) and Marvel having just finished off their incredible third phase. Superheroes are more relevant now than ever. The Boys takes heroes, and makes them realistic while still feeling like a comic book show. In making Superheroes selfish celebrities, you make for an entertaining show with many disturbing themes. The show through all its edge and grit, is funny however. The biggest strength of the show besides it's acting is it's script, so many great lines are in each episode. The Boys is definitely worth watching if you're interested in a new take on Superheroes."
8.0,26 August 2019,If you're not onboard........ Why not? Outstanding show
8.0,7 September 2020,It is a great anti hero squad against the named hero trying to take over all control.It is a battle of the right against the wrong in all the wrong ways.I personally loved the series and would like to continue this series and get such amazing plot.
10.0,28 July 2019,Really enjoyed it but it was just the justice league gone bad
9.0,19 September 2020,After watching the the first couple of episodes I was excited about the show then the plot holes and poor character development and corny dialogue really made this an effort to keep watching - and it never got better
10.0,11 January 2021,A marvellous adaptation that knows how to escape from the topics of the superheroes' genre
10.0,16 August 2020,"Great show but must every other word be ''fucking''? This is what gives this surprisingly good show away, that it was filmed in Ontario, Canada. There is so much use of the f-word or variations thereof, that it actually begins to grate....and the writing in general is not first-rate (needless to say). That being said, it's a great show."
10.0,29 August 2019,This show is fu***** good. From start to end . Very good writing and all the right actors. Cant wait for season 2.
6.0,10 July 2022,"Is someone else sick of watching the supe save the day? Look no further! This is far from your typical superhero movie. As a matter of fact, its the complete opposite of what MCU fans are used to watching. The series sets the tone from episode one, where an innocent civilian gets killed by one of the supes, an the corporation behind the supes tries to settle it by offering money as a compensation. Soon after that the group of unlikely characters (one od them being the bf of the death civilian) get together with one mission, to take revenge and strike the supes back. The show just keeps getting crazier and crazier. Three seasons in and it somehow still manages to push up the boundaries of whats possible. Do not be discouraged by the fact that this is a superhero tv show, its probably the complete opposite of what you expect it to be. 10/10."
3.0,22 September 2020,This show is like a mystery thriller novel that you cannot put down! Absolutely worth watching! Finally a show that packs a punch and leaves you wanting more after every single episode.
10.0,13 December 2020,"Love it it got funny moments, badass moments. It has everything a super hero show needs! The main character yuwi (not sure how to spell his name..) could need some serious character buildup but other than that this is a great show to watch."
8.0,16 September 2020,
8.0,5 September 2020,"I have enjoyed Karl Urban for years. Just about everything he does, I like. But this one is the top of the heap. He is hilarious! Antony Starr also pulls off a great doosh character in this. You just love to hate him. Some of the story line gets spread pretty thin, but that is because nobody is doing 20+ episodes for a season. That sucks big time. I am really starting to detest these shows that have a handful of episodes, and then you have to wait for at least another year. If it was 6 months between seasons, it would be better..."
9.0,21 December 2020,I know this series is sort of darkly comedic but it's basically also almost prophetic - in the current zeitgeist I fully believe that this is what would happen if superheroes were real. General idiocy would ensue and people would suffer for it.
10.0,24 June 2022,"Doesn't have the courage to be as grotesque and outrageous as source material. Fun to watch, but a letdown for comic book fans. Seems like a kids show in comparison."
10.0,27 August 2019,"The Boys, a new Amazon Prime original is a realistic take on what it would be like to have DC-ish superheros (Supes), in our world. There is Homelander (Superman), Queen Maeve (Wonder Woman), Deep (Aquaman), A-Train (The Flash), Black Noir (Elektra-Batman combo, maybe, kind of an enigma), Starlight (kinda like Static, she can draw electricity to her and use it as a weapon, also very strong), Translucent (invisible and indestructible, with skin harder than diamond). These heros make up The Seven (Justice League) and work for Vought Corp that handles their PR, marketing, legal, and arranges their heroic appearances (they are not supposed to do random vigilantism or leave the country). Vought also contracts out lesser supes to cities like Baltimore and Detroit that are overrun with crime. Vought predicts when and where crime will occur and arranges for the appropriate heros to appear and save the day. They supposedly do this with a sophisticated intelligence gathering and advanced computer algorithms. Supes doing unauthorized (by Vought) crime prevention may be liable for any criminal or civil issues that happen. The exception being Homelander who is so powerful that he can do as he pleases (although other countries have threatened war if he operates there without permission) because the govt is afraid of making him angry. The actor playing Homelander steals the show, plays the character with real depth, and keeps him from being a cheesy gimmick. Unlike DC and Marvel heros, these are fallible people, they make mistakes, they don't always do the right thing, and they might even be perverted at times. They say power corrupts and absolute power... Not everyone loves supes and Karl Urban plays Butcher, a man who has made it his mission to bring down supes and uncover corruption at Vought Corp. To do that he assembles a team with their own colorful names like Mother's Milk, Frenchie, The Female, and then there is Hughie, once a superfan of supes until he and his fiance have a close encounter with A-Train. Butcher and friends call themselves, The Boys, and the story behind that shouldn't be spoiled. The show is fun to watch, well acted, some minor pacing issues, laugh aloud moments, a few head scratchers, a few WTF moments, and the most diabolical scene involving a baby you've seen. It's based on a comic but there are enough changes that readers won't know everything that's coming."
8.0,28 June 2020,"This show represents what would be like, if we had superheros in real life, just a bunch of coporative people trying to make money out of it. The show is great, and it brings out the human side in the ""sups"", the good and the bad, all at once! Going on the opposite direction of what we see in the movies nowadays, and that's not a bad thing!"
7.0,23 August 2019,"Having heard only one recommendation for this series I was initially dubious. But having binge watched the whole series so far today, I feel like it was warranted. Anti heroes may have been touched upon in the likes of The Watchmen, but I feel this dark comic touch with its doping related undertones set itself a world apart from the others. I wanted to rate this a perfect ten, but I feel it was only let down by its unnecessary casting. Simon Pegg Has literally no place in this series. Anyone could have played his role and I feel it would have been taken more seriously without him. As soon as he put on the awful American accent, I put my head literally in my hands. As well as Butcher and the English/Aussie mash up which I still can't see any reason for. However I did like the randomness of the characterisation and found all of their traits were portrayed perfectly. I mean Deep, and his fishy fascinations were hilarious! Stole the laughs for me. With regard to the plot, there's nothing I can fault. The only downsides are that it started becoming slightly predictable in what should have been an unpredictable plot full of hangers and twists. Hopefully the rest of the series will add marks, and I hope they don't just cash in on the brand and ruin what is bound to be a second series. For now; a thoroughly good watch and thanks to my bro for the recommendation"
1.0,27 July 2019,I was skeptical. The title is crap but the show is amazing. Such a great story and hinting at the power and influence of superheroes.
10.0,17 October 2020,"This is one of the best series I've seen in a while. The characters are so well created and I like the fact that it's so realistic. It has o bit of everything: comedy, drama, action, and it always manages to suprise me with the plot twists. I definetly recomand this series and hope for more seasons to come."
9.0,28 July 2019,"I loved the pilot, and the first few episodes were also great. I think they really took their time with the first few episodes, but something about the context switches felt off. I found that whenever it went back to a different character's timeline I'd be feeling like ""oh god no I don't care about this, show me more of the other one"". Regardless it wasn't that bad because I found myself being engaged in those scenes as well. As the show progressed, I either got used to it or it went away (with the latter being the likeliest), but there was a new problem, the plot just progressed what I felt like too fast and carelessly. It felt like they weren't really putting the effort into making the scenes as impactful as before or exploring the plot. The ending could have been really powerful, but to me it felt like nothing, in the last 10 minutes of the season they jumped through a lot of hoops that could and should have been explored. A baby got killed and it was really overlooked, felt like nothing, I wouldn't even remember it if I wasn't writing this."
10.0,23 September 2022,"The Boys is set in a universe in which superpowered people are recognized as heroes by the general public and owned by a powerful corporation, Vought International, which ensures that they are aggressively marketed and monetized. Outside of their heroic personas, most are arrogant and corrupt. The series primarily focuses on two groups: the titular Boys, vigilantes looking to keep the corrupted heroes under control, and the Seven, Vought International's premier superhero team. The Boys are led by Billy Butcher, who despises all superpowered people, and the Seven are led by the egotistical and unstable Homelander. As a conflict ensues between the two groups, the series also follows the new members of each team: Hugh ""Hughie"" Campbell of the Boys, who joins the vigilantes after his girlfriend is killed in a high-speed collision by the Seven's A-Train, and Annie January/Starlight of the Seven, a young and hopeful heroine forced to face the truth about the heroes she admires."
8.0,11 June 2022,"Karl Urban is NOT British, and if he's trying to do an English accent he's failing miserably. The man's Antipodean, and it really comes across.

Shame, because it seriously distracts from what's going on."
10.0,30 July 2019,
8.0,6 August 2019,"The last season was a mediocre mess riddled with loopholes, back and forth all over the place nonsense, unnecessary drama, became hard to watch for most of the season, the religious and sociopolitical satire was pretty funny though."
10.0,9 July 2022,"The boys is simply an exceptional show. Every episode is unique and interesting, and most importantly, as good if not better than the last. All three seasons so far are wonderful, with my favourite being season 3. Every character is well fleshed out and developed properly. Each character is unique and special in their own way, with the acting of them being sublime due to the incredibly talented cast. For me the standout performance is Homelander, every scene he appears in has me quivering as to what he'll do next, my favourite loose canon in fiction. And definetly one of the best shows ive ever seen."
8.0,24 July 2020,Funny. Dark. Excellent. Original....was not expecting this thought it would be corny like the tripe series that marvel and dc are churning out.
7.0,25 September 2022,"I love Garth Ennis's work. I read the comic long ago and when I heard it was going to be brought to TV I was skeptic that a work of this nature could be well adapted or even appreciated by the general public. But I was so wrong!

Even though the series doesnt exactly follow the comic script the adaptation is superb. The premise of the series is what would happen if superheroes were real people? People with their flaws and merits endowed with terrific powers. You are immersed in a world were corporations are behind these beings, approval ratings matter, and not everything is as simple as superhero comics make it to be.

Writing and dialog is top notch. The series is full of twists and keeps you craving for more after each episode.

Acting is superb. I think Antony Starr as the Highlander is outstanding. He can really instill fear just with some stares and dialogue pieces. Also Karl Urban as Butcher does a wonderful job. But in general, the cast is great, full of complex and rich characters that are well portraited by the actors.

Highly recommended if you like the super hero genre and dont mind a lot of gore."
4.0,28 August 2019,"In the first quarter, the content of blackening super-English is only the surface, and the deeper is the combination of idol industry, collusion between government and business, and ethics of science and technology. At the core of these issues, the film points to ""money is the source of all evils."" "". On the side of the picket, at present, only the image of Butcher and the past are deeper, Hughie is relatively simple, and the other three people have a larger gap. Overall, the first season was more successful in explaining the big background, and the dark side of The Seven is better."
8.0,4 September 2020,
10.0,10 October 2020,"I went into this hearing different things, and I must say, it is really well written. It's all about power, control, psychological issues, and the blur between what makes someone a hero, and a true villain. Ignoring the fact some of people have powers, you do start to hate some of these superheroes. Also, it's a great political and social media take on being liked by society and making money for entertainment."
9.0,17 July 2022,
9.0,21 July 2022,"The Boys: Season 3 on Amazon has the gang trying to stop the Supes especially Homelander who is played by Anthony Starr from from his destructive pattern. The boys head to Russia to revive Soldier Boy (Jason Ackles) to be able to stop Homelander from his terrible ways. We later learn Soldier Boy is Homelander's long lost father. Great script, wonderful cast, very entertaining with lots of body parts Soldier Boy (Jensen Ackles) hunts down his former team to justice for putting him in a chamber. Loved every minute of it. The Boys steal Compound V to gain the advantage to bring down The Supes. The plan to end the reign of the Supes. Definitely all this series to your list. Hopefully next season we get to see never any of the servers."
9.0,30 September 2020,
8.0,24 July 2022,"Here we have another example of a good comic book that should have been left alone. This show genuinely had a lot of good going for it but it just relies too heavily on shock factor and forced liberal politics without improving things that matter. The story is boring and predictable with no substance and written like a bad detective show, the script is campy and with great actors you'd think the dialogue was executed better, the cinematography is lackluster with unimpressive VFX and little to no good hand to hand combat (given the extreme us of typical super powers). The fact is much of the comic uses aspects from other comics in a satirical way, so the concept is already unoriginal and uninteresting when translated to the screen. If you are looking for a good show that respects its source material this is not the show for you."
9.0,19 September 2020,"Of today's social issues. We get strong female characters without merely being vehicles for victimage. At the same time we get male characters with unchecked power acting poorly who are not just one dimensional villians.

On top of this we get a running narrative of how the moment's social justice trope is packaged for millennials through focus groups and manipulative media in a way that shows the emptiness and immaturity of so much of it.

Although, it isn't just a condemnation of political correctness, as through an admitted tongue and cheek approach, it reveals how unchecked power can truly oppress. We can only hope this starts a trend in more nuanced approaches to social issues.

On top of all this is a truly first rate cast. I haven't read the source material, so I admittedly don't know if there was any casting that changed the nature of the story in a negative way. But based on the story that's being told on screen everyone is spot on."
10.0,15 September 2020,"The series easily deserves a 7 plus and the guy who plays Homelander alone adds 2 stars to make it 9. What a character! Absolute brilliant and absolute maniac! All the other characters are on par, Elizabeth Shue and Keith Urban are a little over the top, but fine, the Boys do their job, but you gotta watch it for Homelander. A true American Hero! in every way down to the bone"
7.0,22 September 2020,Moving forward little bit The last episode no new tale Yes the story and lines is very good But there are no new And we need more action
1.0,27 June 2022,"Content Warning: Rape and associated themes. Not for the faint of heart. I am currently avoiding a rewatch of the first season(s) for this reason. Still worth a recommendation, because if you can stomach it it's really good."
10.0,18 September 2020,"Incredible, I liked it, it has shown an undeniable reality of what super heroes would be like"
8.0,4 September 2020,"I stay over night to watch it over, lol, how unexpected!!!!! Just like got on a crazy ride!"
8.0,19 September 2020,"Best series I have ever watched in a decade. At least ten times better than the overrated, overhyped series like money heist, dark. Even better than stranger things. It's better than every series of this decade (in terms of gripping, story). Will keep you at the edge of your seat from the beginning to end"
9.0,11 October 2020,Absolutely Loved Both Seasons 1 & 2 Hoping There Will Be Many More !!!!! This Show is An Absolute Classic Holding Out For Season 3
10.0,30 December 2020,"The first episode started off great but the rest is just tasteless

I can see they are trying to create some kinda dark comedy. ""Oh, let's just put every heated topic irl in an 8 episode series"". It is funny sometimes but without actual depth.

Flat characters except Homelander"
10.0,13 September 2020,"Loved Season 1 although the show is unapologetically bloody, 8 stars anyway as the storyline of Heroes as a business is new. Season 2 releasing every week is a 0 star. And introducing racial politics in episode 4 is also a 0 star, I see enough divisiveness and hate on the news, I don't want it in my entertainment. So, average a 5 right now and I suspect with the next episode I will be disgusted enough to stop watching altogether. But, at least we had Season 1"
9.0,13 September 2020,"Love this series, evil superheroes is an amazing concept!

Would have been 10 if Amazon was as user friendly as Netflix"
9.0,16 September 2020,"I like the characters, the story is interesting. Scenes can be a little bit harsh and violent at times, which can surprise you. Interestingly, there is some politics mixed in, as these superheroes are quite involved in those aspects of society. Overall I enjoyed watching this one, though for me Umbrella Academy is a step up."
7.0,30 January 2021,"The rating is 0! While this is supposed to be satirical, it is AWEFUL!!!! I am a fan of Eric Kripke's work and am completely and totally beyond disappointed that Eric Kripke stoops this low!!! This show is what a 12 year old boy would write given millions of dollars to waste. It perpetuates racism and mysogyny. Beyond discusting!"
2.0,21 July 2022,"The Boys offers a fantastic spin on superheroes in everyday life, and how stuff like money and fame can corrupt even the supernatural. We see first-hand how disastorous it would be go introduce superpowers into a corrupt enviroment under the supervision of an entitled government.

For example, take homelander. He has identical powers to DC's superman except in this world, he is the strongest being to ever live. We're so used to superman being weak compared to other heroes or villians that we forget how truly powerful and dangerous people like Homelander can really be."
8.0,12 July 2022,"This show is amazing. I love anything that subverts tropes and expectations and just the idea of Superheroes as celebrities/corporate entities and all the baggage that comes with fame/money is brilliant. And the show (so far, here's hoping it continues until it ends) lives up to the brilliance of the premise. The satire on consumerism and our current political climate, media, woke culture, just all of it is so friggin spot on and amazing. There are certain specific parodies that are just hilarious and amazing. The cast is phenomenal. I feel like it takes a South Park approach in that nothing and no one is off limits, which I love."
8.0,9 October 2020,
8.0,22 September 2020,"If you like superhero shows and movies, you will love this show. A real masterpiece, highly entertaining, exciting and realistic."
9.0,9 September 2020,What an absolutely brilliant show... it's a 10 from me... amazing !!!!!!!!
8.0,18 August 2019,"Its a great show. I like the different take on the supes and its just funny from its gore, language, and the action. A great adult show to watch. Now I just cant wait for season two."
8.0,9 July 2022,"An interesting plot with potential. Many superhero shows and movies are dull, but this one is intriguing. If you are yawning during The Avengers, The Boys will be a nice diversion. This is good adult entertainment."
9.0,11 October 2020,
9.0,16 September 2020,"I watched the first season of this show back when it first released, and I was absolutely blown away! I've rewatched it since and season two continues to improve with more twists, action, blood, and even more superheroes being absolutely stone cold than season one. Give this show a watch immediately!!"
6.0,2 August 2019,"If you haven't read the comic, I can wholeheartedly recommend this to you. Thanks to the novelty of the source material and the right dose of trademark gore and violence it overcomes the already all too obvious weaknesses in it's narrative stucture. Great production values and acting really help at that front.

But.

You can already see them scurrying back to the original material whenever they realize that their own little ideas completely fail to get them anywhere. This may save viewers from more police-academyesque humour and having certain characters save seafood because the actor looks really good in his costume, which would be a good thing.

But since they have no real grip on the material they are throwing out the suprises and twists and turns as if they had an infinite amount of them. By the way: They almost do. But there's already so much of the underlying secrets and backgrounds spoiled and wasted that I would need far more confidence in the writers than I was able to build up when it comes to the next seasons.

They also don't know how to work on those small moments. An example: Having the female being beautiful and girlish for just one second would leave so much more of an impression if it had been a season of her usual getup, not something like 30 minutes of screentime. Once again: With this source material they don't have to be too careful about saving moments like that one.

But they have already written themselves into several corners and will need a far stronger vision on their own if the good first impression is supposed to last longer than one season."
5.0,20 September 2020,Creative story and world. Cast is top notch. Brutally violent but also hilarious. And lesbians...the good kind.
10.0,19 September 2020,"This is one of the best TV shows I've ever seen in my life, every second of every episode is so enjoyable I couldn't even look away from the screen. It's only one and a half season and it's already in my top 5 of all time. Second season has been absolutely brutal and phenomenal so far. I hope this show go on for so many more seasons, I can't get enough. And even though it's just 1 and a half seasons, it's underrated. This needs to be watched and talked about by everyone, this is honestly top TV right here and at the level of GoT and Breaking Bad.

Homelander is one of the best characters ever and the guy who plays him is extremely talented and exciting to watch. And the rest of the cast are fantastic, and especially Karl Urban ""DIABOLICAL"" what an absolute badass.

This is a masterpiece of a show, 10/10."
9.0,15 August 2019,"Lets get some stuff out of the way...

The Verification Principle cannot be verified. ""Only statement that are scientifically provable are true"" is not true because it is not scientifically provable. It's just an idea. It's a self-contradiction idea. Yet this idea is the basis for all your secular BELIEFS. See, what I just did here? It's called LOGIC. You can prove something with logic alone. I just proved your secular epistemology is nonsense. :). Want more logic? It's stupid to demand physical evidence for something that exists beyond the physical boundary of the universe.

The empirical evidence from SETI and Hubble and FERMI says there are no aliens. Yet you people make up all sorts of nonsensical-fundmentalist-unverifiable explanations because you worship Star Trek. They retreated into cyberspace??? Issac Arthur is an ignoramus fundamentalist. All his ""theories"" cannot be proven. Secular people don't follow even their own dogmas.

Is believing in God like believing in fairies or spaghetti monsters? No, God provides the necessary prerequisites for the existence of the universe. Spaghetti monsters do not. Ya, it's called LOGIC.

""All morality is subjective"" is not scientifically verifiable but secular people assert this like a dogma. What about miracles? Well, these are one time (anomalous) events. Hence they are not repeatable by definition. Hence, to demand repetition (scientific verification) is nonsensical. Why do I need to say this? Because secular ignoramuses reject common sense. Eyewitnesses are a form of proof. You believe more where there are more witnesses and NOT AT ALL when there are NO witnesses. There are no witnesses for flying spaghetti monsters; so don't believe it. There were ten thousands witnesses for the miracle- of-the-sun at Fatima. Google it if you don't believe it. Lesson done."

3.0,1 March 2020,"I don't understand why the average reviews here are so high, the point of a great TV show is to tell a story. The show does a good job of setting up its fundamental premise, which is why I stuck with it, but enduring the appalling acting of Karl Urban as Billy Butcher was torture. It's not just his pathetic attempt at a cockney accent that seems to swerve into Australian/Kiwi for every other syllable, it's the unending tedium of his swearing which fundamentally then makes any real attempt to expressing anger completely meaningless. The show has so much potential but at least based on the first season doesn't seem to have made any attempt to actually explore some really interesting ideas."
8.0,26 September 2020,Posting this review after watching season 1 and 2. Very interesting story. All the actors have done great job. One of the best shows i ever watched in my life.
9.0,1 July 2022,"While Disney and MCU are busy trying to shove political correctness down everyone's throats, along with ""the message"", Amazon is killing it with ""The Boys"". A gritty awesome super-heroes tv show that truly conveys what it would be like if super-heroes were real. Unmissable!"
8.0,26 September 2020,"What to say... I really love it on every aspect. the season two is a master piece , who would think that you'd find the most sensible and complex analyze of current society and trends in an amazone super hero show? I would advice to really pay attention to what it says , it really talks to all of us encouraging us to think more deeply , it encourgaes us to be smart , to use our brains. Use the time between each episode to think about it because there is way more to it than a good fun story, great actors and artistic direction."
10.0,22 September 2020,"I love this show but had to write here to state you guys took it way too far on the whale death scene in season 2. Absolutely heinous and completely unnecessary.

Otherwise, great show. But seriously , don't do anything like the whale scene again. Scarring and entirely useless to the plot other than to make you hate the good guys for , you know, ramming a boat right through a whale."
10.0,30 September 2020,"The comic book for being so popular was really disjointed, hard to follow and about half the time mind-numbingly boring. Snapping between timelines without letting the readers know what was happening, keeping 'secrets' that all the characters knew about but the readers didn't. Basically a lot of cheap ploys to seem edgy and hide that the thousands of pages it ran was mostly padding to hide the fact the writer didn't have a coherent story when it started. Overall the comic was around a 4. Invincible was way better and even managed an HEA, pretty good for a 'realistic' superhero book. Why it hasn't gotten a show and something much lower in quality has is a mystery to me.

The series treats the audience with a tiny bit more respect. Though bashing on Christianity (admitted, it was in the comic too - but then again Stormfront was a guy and they changed that) is getting old at this point. Seems kind of cowardly since the studios know that Christians aren't going to show up at their offices and start murdering everyone when they are offended, unlike followers of the religion that must not be offended even though they account for almost all religious terror attacks. Or atheists for that matter. How about showing a more realistic event, like some atheist neck beard fedora wearer shooting up a church because it's cool to hate on Christians like they do on TV and in the comics.

Other than their slavish virtue signaling to current social hot button issues, things go boom often enough to entertain. The story flows way better than the comic and the acting is quality. Overall better than the crap you get on Netflix these days anyway."
10.0,7 September 2020,"I loved Season 1. it was fast pace, amazing character development, acting was phenomonial! I was so looking forward to watch Season 2.

After watching the first 3 episodes for Season 2 - I have to admit it was somewhat boring. Lack of character development or at least how they presented - it was flat. I had to push myself through the 3 episodes and I am glad there were only 3.

I couldn't relate to Hughie, or Starlight who are undoubtedly the most humanized of the bunch.

It is clear that the showrunners drank the social justice and virtual signalling Koolaid, just like many of the these big productions. I am disappointed they went that way at the expense of the story.

I do not recommend watching Season 2 - it was a waste of my time and a disappointment. Its' too bad that the all of Season is already shot - its downhill from here"
8.0,16 August 2020,"I just got done watching Umbrella Academy (Netflix) and The Boys (Amazon) & since I was on a role I figured I'd watch Hunters. I'm not comparing the three shows, it's just I don't normally like bingeing an entire series so when the mood strikes I was as much as I can. A lot of people complained Hunters is a Tarantino rip off but I look at It as an homage. I liked the idea of the show but I definitely agree with viewers who said it was too long. This could've easily been a two hour movie if all the unnecessary crap was cut out."
9.0,11 September 2020,"In these days finding good tv shows is rare..

8.0,26 January 2020,"Being raised incorrectly, you know that you'd be a dick if you had super powers. A time where we've got the do gooder Avengers that can do no wrong, to superheroes that are assholes. This programme is certainly more true to the superhero spec considering the day and age we live in. Love the humour and action, you won't be disappointed, just give it a go."
8.0,20 December 2019,Great show. Loved the premise and the execution. I really hope there is a Season 2. And soon!
10.0,19 September 2020,"What a series!!! 🙌🙌!! Absolutely a must watch!! Everything is perfect! The plot, the actors,"
9.0,16 June 2022,"There is one great thing about this series which is focusing of role of the people in the modern western society. Yes, they have the greatest power and their acceptance is the ultimate vote. But, people are easily manipulated by corporations, the government and the rich. That is very well explained in this sci-fi series and seriously it is more than what you can expect from a superhero story in that matter. The visuals are also acceptable and good but not excellent.

However, it contains all the problems and story holes that are common in all the superhero movies and shows out there. I don't want to go in that direction and list them because the list would be so long. That is the real problem with this kind of movies. Sometimes they don't make sense even in their own introduced logic.

So, overall, it is surly an above average work. It surly amuse you and is also has something to offer socially. I recommend it to watch it if you have time."
9.0,12 June 2023,"Really really really bad acting, shallow characters and really lame script. Most of the dialogues made me wonder, who talks like that? More than half of characters and scenes are just unnecessary, making you go like ""what the q""? Useless twists and turns just to keep you interested, and I honestly gave it a try, but I gave up in the middle of season two, mostly because the acting is so poor that it hurts the brain. Elisabeth Shue was the only one convincing. I'm just sorry I wasted almost a whole day of day of my life on this rubbish. I would gladly give this show minus 10 stars if it was possible."
9.0,20 December 2019,This is so much better than the plethora of Marvel and DC content. A refreshing new dark comic series.

1.0,21 December 2019,"Worst and best opening scene with the girl on the street. Almost like suicide squad or watchmen, the next is there better heroes? Or just the norms? Trying to stop the bs seen as the bad guys to the public (aka the bad guys? Get it?)"
8.0,30 August 2019,I never watch super hero movies or shows but I was hooked 5 minutes into The Boys. I think what attracts me to this show is how similar the world it exist in compared to the real world. Love it and can't wait for season 2
10.0,3 December 2019,"""The Boys"" is one of the most amazing superhero shows right now. It has all the gore (and more) of Deadpool but all the social commentary of the modern world. I enter the show with a strange premise; I thought this show was about a group who stop corrupt superheroes. But it's actually vastly different. ""The Boys"" is essentially about a world where ""Vought"" manages to make superheroes as rentable as they can be.

Our leading characters are a group that we will see unit forces to discover the dirty secrets and some evidence of the dark side of the most beloved superheroes of this universe, ""The Sevens.""

This adventure is full of social commentary as I already said. You can compare the corrupt world of superheroes with many different aspects of our world. From politics, corporations, religion and show business, this show is a critic of our world, the way some people or companies try to maintain a clean image even though they make grave mistakes and sometimes they are as***les. This show succeeds with his social commentary.

The gore is there and it's moderately good. This show has much blood and action and that makes it better. The pacing sometimes feels slow because it's trying exposing the way this universe works but it is stills a good show. The characters are all likeable and the villains are genuinely interesting.

From the concept to the execution, ""The Boys"" is almost a masterpiece of 2019."
8.0,19 August 2019,"An original, well written, perfectly performed series that combines humor, action, and the irony the most superhero films are losing sight of due to their hubris... Probably the only 'must see' production that's come along in quite some time."
9.0,5 November 2019,"The Boys is very entertaining and well made. It's very funny throughout, but also has a very dark tone to it. Its filled with many plot twists, and the final episode leaves you wanting more. Its whole take on superheroes in a corporate setting is very different and unique. It's funny, gory, dark, vulgar, crude, and filled with action. The action is good and every episode was needed. It's like Deadpool on steroids. I would give it a 10 star rating but episode 7 was very slow. Still furthered the plot but slow. Besides that show was really good. Homelander is a pretty scary villain. Can't wait for season 2."
9.0,16 June 2022,
10.0,1 April 2023,The writers in Hollywood have completely lost their artistic imagination and touch. Every show and movie continues to be a promotion of hedonistic life. Everything is pointless view. They reinforce this by destroying the body like a meat puppet repeatedly. The story itself is nothing. A reinforcement of life being a pointless lustful violent exchange. It truly is depressing. At least the show's storyline keeps you engaged enough to finish the show. Somehow in the satanic propaganda being constantly thrown at you the show still makes you want to see how it ends. It's probably worth 2-3 stars for that. Truly a drain on the soul to watch this anti-Christian hate filled pile of propaganda.
10.0,2 September 2019,"I was impressed before I could finish the first episode. The dark humour was entertaining and I could enjoy it. CGI is fairly good for a TV series. Karl Urban is just awesome. I'm bored with superhero movies showing only the good side of the story. We need more TV shows or movies like this to make us wonder what if heroes are corruptible and has an ulterior motive behind their actions. No human is Saint afterall, and superheroes (barring few aliens) are no exception. Expecting second season soon."
10.0,12 April 2020,"I really hope the next season doesn't go full CG like the first season did halfway through. They brought it back to live acting in the last episode, which, in my opinion, saved it. It's a good show. It has a good story. The premise is interesting. The writing is excellent (I have the luxury of having not read the comic books, so I can't complain about the differences). The CG is terrible.

I hope the next season comprises entirely live actors. Save the CG for special effects and use it sparingly."
6.0,15 December 2019,"While the premise did have some promise, the execution left much to be desired, while the production was top notch the story was simply not engaging enough and the writing and acting were pretty average."
4.0,9 November 2019,"Quick-witted show for adults that tracks one man's vengeance against the superhero that killed the love of his life and how it sheds light on the dark underbelly of more human than human. Light on its feet, but hardcore with its violence, there is a message underneath all of the fun, though it is a bit muddled in places. Well worth a watch."
9.0,13 August 2019,"2 cents here, not a big deal. Pros. Great premise, interesting dark characters, nice payoff, and an endearing hook.

Cons. Longer than needed heartfelt introspective scenes, slow pace, shoddy narrative that doesn't stay its course, weak main protagonist borderline cheesey."
9.0,22 August 2019,"It's filthy, gory and violent. Can't wait for Season 2."
10.0,16 December 2019,Im not even half way through the 1st episode and Im digging it already. Its full of surprises and far from boring! Must see TV
10.0,26 December 2019,This one really got me hooked. You just have to watch the first few minutes. The actors did also a very good job. Cant wait for season 2.
8.0,10 October 2020,
9.0,21 June 2023,"It basically turned into yet another politically motivated show. And what's with all the sex scenes. Feels like Hollywood is normalizing this behavior. Not worth in my opinion. Just a soft drama porn but the gore is appreciated. The acting was great but again declined over each season. I do like the characters and how they talk about certain topics. However, they seem to be biased on their thought process and subtly show that through the show. I do believe in second chances so I will watch the new season, but I will not recommend this show. Use the budget for actually getting better writers and more originality."
9.0,6 September 2022,
10.0,19 August 2019,"Each actor really owns their respective roles in this series, and that's what makes this great for me.

Being a super hero genre fan, I have become picky with my ratings but I had to rank this so high because of the cast and the jobs they did acting.

Antony Starr is amazing in this as Homelander. Never disappoints and just owns the scenes he is in.

Looking forward to season two after that ending."
1.0,13 October 2020,"This show is excellent. I'm so glad that I've found a TV show that's funny, entertaining yet very grown up, in being that it's definitely not for kids; the content is so centred on current and past events that it's quite remarkable how they're able to stay farely true to the comics, whilst at the same time creating some thing completely fresh and new. I was very impressed with season 1, but season 2... Jesus Christ!!! Season 2 had me going through the spectrum of emotions. Can't wait for season 3. This is a show that goes from strength to strength because of solid writing. And now for the elephant in the room -- the white supremacist crybabies who are so rattled that a tiny fraction of their antics made it into a very popular hit series: Hitler was a monster, a staunch white supremacist and one of the most notorious tyrants to date. His legacy runs rampant through everyday life and has far-reaching influence all over the western world. He has infected a great deal of simple minded people with his poison. That's in real life. Stormfront was a Nazi in the comics. Albeit a male Nazi, but still a staunch, loud, extremely vocal, out and out Nazi. So, to all of the white supremacists throwing an epic tantrum at the ""politics"" ahem RACISM fleshed out in this show, which is done masterfully I might add... BE BETTER PEOPLE! You're only triggered because you're heavily flawed, ridiculous ideology is being given the coverage that it so rightly deserves, when you'd rather operate in the shadows. That's why you're all here attempting to sink one of the best TV shows of our times. You did the same to Watchmen, and it's tired and extremely weak. I'll say it again, if this rubs you up the wrong way, there's a strong chance that you relate too much to the Nazi Stormfront, which is a YOU problem, not a The Boys problem."
8.0,12 August 2019,"Vengeance leads eventually to more conflict and drama and death. Especially because it started after a mistake/misunderstanding. GoT fans already know this; see Rhaegar and Lyanna. But also, this series shows us the drama/tragedy/responsibility of being special. To some you're a freak, to others you're a superhero. It's a burden you must carry. Well...GoT fans know this also. I'm not gonna say who, 'cause it's obvious."
10.0,20 November 2019,
8.0,23 August 2019,"This is a good show. It started out pretty intense and then it slows down a little in the middle episodes, but it was a very entertaining season 1 for sure. I personally don't think it's quite as dark as Watchmen (which I think is one of the all time great movies), and it has a lot more moments of levity, but it's definitely in that same vein. Amazon can do a lot with this series and I hope they keep it going for a while."
8.0,3 September 2019,"In movies if Superheroes turn evil the become super villains, however, The Boys gives it a new twist. These are Superheroes with human corruptions. They're greedy, insensitive, theives, frauds and are just interested in making more money for their corporate bosses.

It's truly refreshing to see a fresh new approach to Superheroes movies/series. Must watch!"
8.0,17 September 2020,"Its been almost a decade where big studios have been producing some superhero heavy hitters. The Boys is not a superhero movie. Its more a allegory to what would really happen if superheroes existed.

I came to the show being a bit weirded out and angry with actor choices ( I read the comic prior and I feel like the comics themes have not aged well some actor choices were a bit odd)

While the comic shows a much more gore oriented story with shock being shown with grueasome deaths, disturbing fetishes and A LOT OF LGBT unfriendly stuff the shows does a good job with wrestling with this controversy.

If you are looking for a show that will laugh in the face of goody MR.two shoes that we are so used to see on screen and comic books then this one is for you. If you clutch pearls at someone saying the word c***t then it should be a skip for you."
8.0,11 July 2021,Season 2 was a let down.too bad )(dissapointed). +1 for the Japanese cute actress/actor/transgender (never know nowadays)
9.0,1 August 2019,"The growth of the comic book super hero genre in movies today is spectacularly fecund. Marvel seems to be the biggest box office draw in the last 10 years. I hate to say this but it is part of the dumbing down of America; where once juvenile past-times and B movie drive-in and late night TV diversions are A list tickets these days. So, in that eruption of mega corporation mass marketing, a smaller ""counter-culture"" of movies and shows mocking and satirizing the genre. Ironically they are usually based on graphic novels like this one and Happy. And like Happy, this one is ultra violent and devoid of any really likeable or heroic characters. But this one ratchets the cynicism and violence up one more notch. For instance, the main super-""hero"", Homelander, is Super Man meets Captain America all star white guy stereotype. To top it off, he is an ordained minister. Of course, he is an utter evil and depraved man, the worst of the lot. The soups, as they are called, are run by a corporation called Vought, where the cynical jaded head of it, Madelyn Stillwell, played by Elisabeth Shue, manipulates and protects her screwed up heroes. The corporation is all about money and publicity and turn every super-hero mission into social media click-bait event. The corporation also wants to get into the Pentagon defense complex. Then enter Hughie Campbell, Dennis Quaid's son Jack, a computer service tech. He was talking to his girlfriend on the street when she got gorily and horrifically splattered by a soup called A-Train who is their Flash counterpart. Not only was that over the top violent, but it suggests that running people down is a regular item for A Train, since he seems unable to dodge obstacles in his way. Come on, that is a really stupid way to get about. Well, poor Hughie was jerked around by Vought's lawyers and let down by his amiable but weak dad. So enter Billy Butcher, aka Karl Urban, a fast talking con-man come vigilante who knows what conniving scum Vought's soups are. So he convinces Hughie to go along with a plan to bug Vought's inner sanctum. Then another brutish soup, Translucent, gets wind of this and follows Hughie back to his shop to beat and try to pump info out of our hapless Hughie. But Butcher returns in the nick of time to save Hughie from this warped soup and the two, with the aid of another comic book sort called Frenchie, imprisons then eventually ends up killing Translucent. From then on, we were exposed to one nasty brutish violent incident and gun fight after another, interspersed with scenes of ruthless corporate behavior and horrific sex. Such as where a female soup called Popclaw, a Wolverine knock off, sits on then crushes a hapless guy's head after she enticed him in her bedroom for sex. Then we have a #metoo subplot, there's the sleazy soup The Deep, an Aquaman imitation, coerced a new pretty female soup Starlight aka Annie January, for some sex. Ironically the Deep was one of the less evil soups and Starlight was a virtual goddess of a classic superhero and a small town conservative Christian woman to boot. Then the Deep has a bestiality streak with a dolphin, which is cheezy enough. But he kidnaps the dolphin and when he wrecks the van, the poor dolphin gets graphically squished by an 18 wheeler.

This show just loves trashing everything from religion to even motherhood, where Vought gets mothers to be to take a drug that causes their infants to be soups. The cynicism, like the extreme violence and sex it promotes, is plain ugly. The indie movie ""Super"" was a good take off on super heroes w/o the extremes of this. But it is addicting and Amazon's high budget and packaging makes it easy to binge watch. It also has the malignant Seth Rogen as its producer."
10.0,5 November 2019,"The premise has so much potential to exploit. Although I understand the need of cheesy dark humor to set a solid fanbase and likeable characters (Breaking Bad took a similar path with the comedic tone of season 1 and turned out a masterpiece seasons later), I believe The Boys can be more than just KickAss/Deadpool jokes, it could be the next Watchmen.

Let's just hope for a more mature season 2, and an even more mature season 3."
6.0,12 December 2020,"I'm really enjoying the show, it's fun, outrageous and entertaining. But really, as a native French national, I'm annoyed and taken out of the story every time a supposed french character opens their mouth. I can't understand them. How hard is it, really, to find a good native french speaking actor? The conversations in french are just f*-ing ridiculous. Please let me stay in the story and hire people who can actually say 2 words together in their own supposed language. Also, Butcher does not sound British. Why make him British instead of the Kiwi he is, what's wrong with that? Other than that, great job. Keep the episodes coming."
3.0,5 November 2019,"The Boys (of all things) has some genuinely very interesting critiques of the entertainment industry, celebrity culture, religion, and sexism in the workplace. There are some really good performances especially from Antony Starr and Erin Moriarty. Most of the characters are multifaceted and entertaining to watch. The show's equivalent to superman is particularly fascinating and genuinely terrifying. The superhero commentary ranges from darkly funny, to devastating. In one episode, they take a very traditional superhero rescue scene in an unexpected direction. It might be the best scene in the show. The series is definitely not for everyone as it is very violent and sexual. The weakest aspect of the show is probably the fight scenes which aren't great (however they aren't really the focus of the series so don't really dampen the experience to badly). The ending of this first season was a little anticlimactic and effects can look a little rough sometimes (both costumes and effects look very CW). I really didn't like Jack Quaid's performance early on but he really grew on me. As someone who tried to get into the comic and hated it, this adaptation surprised me. It is definitely worth the watch, try to get past the first episode."
9.0,15 September 2020,"I don't know how to add reviews on Amazon prime. Since everyone is giving it a bad review, stop pleased. This show needs more love than ever. Best comic adaptation"
8.0,9 August 2019,This is a comic book series is amazing but with a twist. It shows you what would happen if superhero really do exist so dark yet light with soo many character all with the right amount of screen time but antony starr is homelander what a show cant wait for the second season.
9.0,14 November 2019,"This blew my mind. It's so raw, the personalities are so real. It's not your typical superhero flick. There's no corny character or cliche storyline. This is the real deal.

You see how a person with super power really behaves and you see the consequences. This TV series is ace!"
10.0,13 August 2019,"Pretty captivating and engrossing. Although, it somewhat fails to make some moments land or hit the mark, emotionally. Luckily, it's a totally superficial problem that's easy to overlook, because the pacing is executed well. (Can't help but wish 'Umbrella Academy' had this quality of writing and staging and pacing.) It's a show, but often watches like a movie, and it was very easy to binge this the last couple days. (Note: Not a fan of the title, but maybe it's illustrated as having a more poignant relevance in the comics?)"
9.0,13 August 2019,Erm... Kinda funny but... I kinda f... hate costumed superheroes. Still... I think is... lame! Like... Ridiculous through the roof! But yea. It's... A gig. Americans... God help 'em.

6.0,24 August 2019,"Concept seems to like regular stuff kind of marvel or dc, but the entire plot is build very different and interesting."
1.0,9 August 2019,It turned to be a great show with great graphics and ICG but the acting is super weak
9.0,9 August 2019,If you want a superhero show that's for adults look no further! Unexpected turn of events in the first episodes sucks you in for the whole ride. Binge worthy. Even the special effects look better than the movies. Raw and real and not too comicy or cartoonish.
10.0,13 November 2019,"Some weird editing in the action scenes, but that might be intentional. It falls victim of some cliches, i really didnt like the romeo and juliet conflict, but apart form that an amazing series. some nice jabs at the super hero cinema hypestorm, and with a dark sense of humor at that.

8/10: nice and edgy, in the way that works"
9.0,9 January 2021,This is one I want to sit down and watch on the big telly. The scene where the boyfriend is left just holding her hands made my jaw drop! The effects are amazing. I love the concept of a world where superheroes are real.
8.0,10 December 2019,"Here's The Lowedown on ""The Boys"" (TV-MA - 2019 - Prime)

Genre: Series/Comic My Score: 8.5

Cast=10 Acting=7 Plot=10 Ending=9 Story=8 Violent=10 Intense=8 F/X=8 Comic=8 Funny=7

The Boys is set in a universe where superpowered people are recognized as heroes by the general public and owned by powerful corporation, which ensures that they are aggressively marketed and monetized.

""We're super...who are you?"" If you are looking for something way to the left of the MCU...something that makes Deadpool look tame...this is something to checkout. There is some solid dialogue and some juvenile points as well. One thing's for sure, the gore is phenomenal. This was a crazy series with an amazing cast...I can't wait for season 2!!"
8.0,24 September 2019,
8.0,30 January 2021,
9.0,17 October 2019,"Every scene is depressed, cliche, arguing. Every character is either sad and confused or sad and aggressive. The complete opposite of what a good person is. Started skipping through it after the first scene, and everywhere it landed it was exactly the same. - Depressed, cliche, pointless arguing.

The camera shots and production quality itself is pretty good."
10.0,25 November 2019,"I like it because it was new genre , anti superhero :)"
6.0,18 August 2019,"This is brutal, this is bold, this is well written and amazingly acted, the plot is actually worth watching, there is no black and white, only gray. This show is a rare gem, it won't draw in the masses, because it is just not average enough. But if you have seen as many movies and as many shows as I did, you will appreciate the fresh and the brave in this story. This is so good that I actually cannot believe I just saw it on TV."
2.0,2 September 2019,"The boys shows us a new way to see the heroes; but not stop there, with exciting characters and nice ideas, the episodes construct a story that's delicious to watch. However some moments still feel slow, but nothing that can destroy the experience. A really nice serie that everyone should see"
9.0,9 August 2019,
10.0,15 August 2019,A perfect rendition of what modern day superhero living and being would be like. Perfect level of feeling. Perfect level of action. Perfect level of gore. A must watch 👌🏼
10.0,19 December 2019,Great story. Great comedy. Great characters! Incredible cast! Keep this going. Can't wait for more
10.0,6 September 2022,
10.0,10 October 2020,
9.0,18 September 2020,It is really a one and a half hour movie elongated to two painstakingly long seasons. And season 2 episodes comes once a week.
8.0,21 June 2022,"Dang! So disappointed that I have to stop watching The Boys after just threw episodes. Such a great concept and very good first season. Season two is overboard woke with more virtue-signaling and messaging than anyone can possibly tolerate. It is so blatant in fact that it completely ruins the show. I would bet that it will get just enough viewership to convince the studio to make a season three just to wrap up the series. Unfortunately, this is what happens time after time in Hollywood these days. Blame the studio for hiring bad writers that can only identify with a minuscule portion of the population. Go woke go broke!"
9.0,6 September 2022,"The boys caught me at an age where I had grown up with the marvel universe, starting at ten watching iron man on DVD as it had come out. Eventually as we all do, I grew up, as did marvel's characters, leading up to endgame, upon which, if I were I a better and certainly smarter writer than I am I would pontificate on the meanings of the main character's (Tony Stark/Steve Rogers) death's and what that meant to the greater superhero genre in general however i'm not a cunt and so I won't.

The Boys and it's universe address a fact that Myself and a lot of other's think to be true. That a superheroes powers would be independent of their own personal beleif's and agendas. Few are good and decent folks, most are power and attention hungry monsters, seeing 'baseline' humans little more than invaluable meatsacks. Almost all viewer's will identify with hughie, a man irreparably assaulted and horrified by an indifferent ""supe"" (superhuman) he is then thrusted into a life of combat and general mayhem as he teams up with the boys to combat the ""supe"" threat.

It is a great show, especially if you're suffering from marvel fatigue, i'd recommend it to all those over 15/16 years old as it's veeeeery explicit (in all ways)

A huge standout is Antony Starr as homelander, he has really shown his acting abilities and range, flipping from absolute madman to calm and collected in nanosecounds, especially in season 3. Watch this damn show!!!"
6.0,26 December 2019,"There is too many superhero movies to keep up with their universe and stuff. That's why i could just keep watching this show. Its not complicated, supes just want to have some fun and they don't care about us.

Many of them in the show have their own personal agenda and they keep messing up with their duties. It's just kind of a different point of view on the genre. I like it!"
1.0,5 September 2020,"I must admit, I really can't stand most of the superhero movies with way to many characters, instalments and reissues. That's the reason I got into the series so late. I just thought this is Amazons answer to The Avengers, but got interested when I noticed the unusual high IMDB rating. During the first episode I knew this would be a good series to watch. It has got criticism of a corrupt society, corporate, politics and the mainstream and apart from being eye candy in 4K HDR it really gets you thinking. For me a good series needs to stimulate me intellectually to be interesting and not only consist of pointless action and that's exactly where The Boys scores."
9.0,12 August 2019,It was very good series but if they make season two like that it would be better
9.0,26 August 2019,"Totally fresh take on superheroes, definitely recommend if like me you're struggling to find something fresh to watch."
10.0,9 August 2019,"This is the (much needed) opposite of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with more base instinct and raw power than the restrained nobility of the recent decade's worth of superhero movies. Homelander is purely terrifying in a way Thanos never was."
10.0,2 September 2019,"Just when you think you're done with the superhero fatigue, a show like The Boys gives you hope. Which is ironic, because nothing about this story screams hope.

The Boys explores the introduction of super-powered individuals with much darker themes (like we don't have enough of those also). By focussing on the influence of social media and the marketable image of a 'hero', this series remains very grounded. It poses the real question of - How would the world look at superheroes today, and then dives into a very well thought-out reponse.

With no surprise, corporations begin trademarking Supers as their own product, carefully crafting their backstories, choosing their marketable demographics, using them for product endorsements and scripting out crimes for them to stop. Its House of Lies meets Watchmen.

The cinematography is stunning; there are some beautifully shot scenes. The characters are well-written,and quite funny. I also like how no one in this show, except Karl Urban, is famous in the US. So we're seeing relatively unknown actors, who do a good job with what they're given.

Its such a meta-relevant series for 2019; I think about how Tom Holland is basically now a multi-billion dollar property, being fought over by two megalomanic corporations,as easily something that the Boys can get into in future seasons. This series does a good job of blending comic book mythology with real world consumerism. Its a good example of how vast the comic lore expands into, how you dont always need a ""world-ending threat"" storyline, and how small scope think pieces actually hit the mark better. This is basically an alternate version of a morally ambigous Justice League, and if that appeals to you, get on this."
10.0,29 August 2019,This is good it deserves to stay in my hard disk looking forward to season 2! Love it!
10.0,17 August 2024,"A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT: This show has made me feel antagonistic toward the LGBTQ+ community due to its poor representation. The way they deliver social messages is mediocre, and they seem to have turned the series into a commercial just to secure funding. The repetitive storyline (blackmail, blackmail, blackmail), clichéd dialogues, and the actors' performances in emotional scenes are laughable instead of moving. The script and acting (except for the Homelander) are so terrible that they've resorted to using ""show within a show"" scenes to cover it up, trying to make the current quality seem better by showing even simpler acting. My note to the production team: Change the writer."
7.0,6 November 2022,"First of all, the plot is not half bad, and the revelations are nicely spaced out. Good writing skills there. The characters are a nice blend of real life personalities and whatever fits the plot, gaining depth as we go along, and not too easily foreseen.

However, when we are finally learning who is behind everything the consistency of the plot unravels completely, and illogic has the day, for if what they tell us would have happened to be true history would have been different, and so would Vought's progress. Out of nowhere an old Nazi appears, and wants to turn the deserving parts of the US into superhumans. Why she has been gone from the scenes we do not know, but the funny thing she is not Germanic at all, but Jewish. Either this is a subtle case of irony from the writers, or just American lack of understand of the world.

At least she should have been blond and blue-eyed, with a touch of übermensch about her. Granted, Himmler et al weren't that high on the scale of Aryanism either, so maybe I am just being difficult."
5.0,1 February 2020,Really well made. Great writing. Great characters and great action. Just cannot fault it.
7.0,27 December 2019,

1.0,9 November 2019,"I liked The Boys a lot and preferred it to The Umbrella Academy, although I like that show too. Lots of surprises and a subversive storyline, dark humour and fantastic acting by so many but especially Karl Urban. An impressive show, I am looking forward to season 2."
7.0,30 December 2019,"Show is okay but could be a lot better. I like the idea and interpretation. Still some episodes are boring, characters don't really dvolve and watching it you expect a lot more."
5.0,13 December 2019,"I love this show. None of the usual moral scrouples, these supes just do what they like not so much BS. Cant wait for more seasons."
7.0,15 August 2019,"I like the way this show portrays superheroes in a funny and corrupted way. Its a new way to show what heroes truly are. I kind of got tired of the typical superhero cliche, so this a great way to twist the genre of superheroes and make it fresh again, but in a twisted way."
1.0,7 June 2021,
7.0,6 August 2022,"My score is an average for what I would give each season Season 1= 8 Seasons 2 & 3 =7 Season 4 =- 10

Tl:dr: Season s1-3 america is the backdrop for a more interesting than real life, fantastical story. Season 4 the very concept of storytelling has been abandoned, events from seasons 1-3 are either rendered irrelevant or retconned and a world with a psychotic superman clone becomes a barely present backdrop and yank politics, that are relevant to less than 4% of the population are the sole focus.

I can summarize how objectively bad 4 is by covering 2 points

1: Neglecting over 7,000,000,000 people The show started as a story where there are super powered beings but they aren't the boy scout, incorruptible characters they are in most stories and a group of mostly ""normal"" people get caught up in the carnage that said deeply flawed but above the law beings create. However season 4 throws all of that out the window and instead becomes a soap box for the multimillionaire writer to pat himself on the back for ""saving the world"" because he arrogantly leans into his very clear bias and bastardizes the show turning it into nothing more than a platform for him to stroke his self-righteous ego and preach about matters he, as a multi millionaire, has zero comprehension of. This is objectively moronic because as I said above, there are over 7 billion people on this planet who are not easy living, upper middle class yanks, we do not care about yank politics, we have zero interest in spoilt rich people in-fighting, however season 4 only caters to 1 side of the coin, for 1 demographic in 1 country. The mass appeal that made the show an overnight success has entirely been removed, are you a well paid, ""gen z"", white yank? If the answer is no then nothing, literally nothing about season 4 will offer you any iota of escapism or entertainment. Sure homelander has always been an antagonist who wears a yank flag but he was the character, now the political beliefs of one easy living, out of touch writer is the character and the boys and the seven alike are just vehicles for his arrogance.

2: Nothing happens At the time of writing this 6 out of 8 episodes have aired and literally nothing has happened. The season has no over-arching plot, there has been no world building, no character development, no progress made from ""the boys"" collective, obviously I can't yet speak for episodes 7 and 8 but as of right now it is safe to say that someone could skip episodes 1-6, jump in at episode 7 and not be lost or confused. The screen time has been utterly wasted on moronic things, 1 spoiler free example is a character materializing out of the ether who we know nothing about, have zero reason to care for, yet we are supposed to believe that they have a real ""relationship"" with a recurring character and the best part about this forced character? It undoes build up that has happened throughout the previous seasons and is then dropped, so even if you are ok with chunks of screen time being wasted by a character you don't know, who has zero connection to the story, even then this is objectively handled poorly because nothing comes from it and then just as unceremoniously as it started it again fades back into the irrelevant ether it came from.

Another irrefutable example of sheer unbridled idiocy is that the above example happens not once but twice, in a season where there is no story whatsoever we get 2 different ""B storylines"" where characters are just plucked from oblivion, forced onto the screen, forced into ""relationships"" with the main cast, serving no purpose whatsoever other than padding the runtime and then just vanishes. Do you watch the boys to see homelander and butcher face off? How about seeing how starlight and hughies relationship evolves? How about seeing new ammoral super powered beings wreaking havoc for the common folks? Well tough, instead you will see less believable relationships than in porn, less writing than a youtuber apology video and less out of touch than a celebrity with a private jet on standby preaching about global warming at an awards ceremony.

There are dirty puns in bathroom stalls that had more time, effort and brain power put into them than the ""writing"" in season 4 of this example of wasted potential."
1.0,12 August 2019,"Really refreshing show. Raw, violent, hilarious and not too over the too. Performances are bang on and the story develops at a good pace. Get involved with The Boys!!!!!!"
7.0,27 July 2019,"First of all, I read rhe comic years ago and I am very fond of it. Once a year I give it a re-read, while laughing out loud.

For the ones who loved the comic and are a bit with 'angst': The main difference is that there's less violence and sex in this tv show then in the comic series. And that's a bit of a shame when your adapting an 'Off the hook,very explicit adult (satyric) comic'.

The story's been simplified a bit and is alright to follow (roughly the same, and I expect that they want to make a lot of seasons of it)..

The good news is that they did capture the tone of the comic, and that rhe casting is TOP NOTCH!! Billy the butcher is spot on with these English punchlines, crazy Frenchie, MM is a big bloke with a good heart, Annie the naive Starlight, and the female is very wel cast. The homelander is as obnoxious as in the comic..

Although I didn't like preacher, 'The boys' is quiet allright for a geek like me 😉..and it's defintly enjoyable. But if you like this, then go and let your mind blown by the stunning series by Garth Ennis.."
1.0,9 August 2019,"I'm telling everyone I know about this show. Season one, IMHO, is better than any of the Marvel shows done on Netflix. While I thought Daredevil and Punisher were good, The Boys blows by them. This show brings elements to Superheroes that is original and fresh and adds a couple spoonfuls of HBO-level maturity. Karl Urban is fantastic as Butcher, couldn't get enough of him and his Spice Girl references! The actor/actress that played Homelander and Starlight are fantastic as well. C'mon Season 2!"
6.0,3 December 2019,"I must say this is a completely different take on the whole superhero genre. This show has it all, great real relationships, the corporate world and its corruption, the good guys the bad guys. The humour in it is absolutely spot on and very appropriate. The moral crisis that each person will face. You really feel each part and it really has drawn my girlfriend and I in. We just finished episode 6.

I think this is one of very few reviews I have written but I would highly suggest this show!!

Beyond excited for season 2 and we have not even finished season 1 yet!"
5.0,22 August 2019,"A great change to the normal superhero series, the brings superhero's down to earth and gives them the human nuances all mortal have: Ego's, greed, lust, ect... instead of the perfect moral code the Marvel characters have. Not quite as evil as Brightburn but it may get there. Can't wait for next season!"
7.0,9 December 2019,"Finally something really worth to watch from amazon studios, a bitter lifelike superhero series."
2.0,23 January 2020,"Heroes are amongst us, but they're not exactly like you expect them to be.

This is the incipt of The Boys in broad terms: a world where most heroes with incredible powers are employed by a powerful corporation called Vought which both manages them and gains lots of money and fame from their ""brands"" (movies, merchandise, advertisements and so on). In this strange yet potentially realistic setting comes the story of Hughie, a normal boy with a normal life who suffers a tragic loss by a superhero's ""accident"" and decides, when approached by an odd guy named Butcher who asks for his help, to try and bring down the great facade of heroism and perfection which surrounds Vought and its employed heroes.

The plot is what really strikes you during the view. It is strong, mature, yet sometimes hilarious, violent and convincing enough to leave you with the impression that this is what would happen if superheroes really existed.

The cast is good but not great: Karl Urban and Erin Moriarty give away a compelling acting whereas I'm not really sure I deeply liked Jack Quaid's performance and being he the main character that stung a little.

Summing up everything this is a great start for a show that I'm sure can give more and more in the seasons to come, and both critics and Amazon seem to agree with this opinion given that the series has been renewed even before the first season was published."
6.0,21 August 2019,"This show has all it needs to make it one of the greatest TV shows of this century. It contains great acting, great characters, great camera and visuals and of course an awesome and exciting story that keeps you wondering what would happen next and how this whole thing will be going to end. Plus all this is wrapped in a dark humorous atmosphere. Definitely a must watch and not just for the average Superhero Fan.

Season 2 unfortunately lost me a bit."
1.0,30 November 2020,"It seems like a good idea to make the series . But the act was bad the story was Implicitly empty , alot of scenes no need for it. I would recommend it to young people and teenagers. But i recommend to show better than this"
7.0,3 October 2020,"So far Season 2 is not absolutely disappointing only because of the quality of its source material: otherwise it is nothing but cliff hangers steering from half-witted twist plots varnished in excessive gore that add nothing to the story.

The juxtaposition of the slow release of episodes with the energetic and immersive pacing of the plot absolutely kills any appreciation the show, and makes the whole season only worth skip-watching: skip until an ex-machina advances the plot, wait a week, rinse-repeat - a formula the audience can only hate.

After it is released in its entirety, the cliff-hangers will lose their value, and the audience will be confused as to why each episode lasts 50 minutes, when skipping to the last 10 minutes of each episode provides all the relevant content in the most efficient way. For those who are already watching the show this is clear: 40 minutes untangling an implausible ex-machina, which of course becomes irrelevant as soon as the next inane cliff-hanger comes in. Trust me, not worth your time.

Do yourself a favor, do not watch."
7.0,24 July 2022,Awesome series best storytelling different from the other superhero series season 3 I think it is the best show of 2022 so far awesome cgi storyline character and their actors and hats off Anthony starr as homelander they nailed it and in every season they introduce new superhero and so check out the awesome series in the Amazon prime video people loved this series so far.
1.0,27 July 2019,"Due to aggressive marketing for this, I got a little skeptical at first. So much on the nose marketing turns me off a little but now I realize why they did it. This show deserves it. It is brilliant, smart, hilarious, well written piece of work. Keeps you on the edge, always interesting and literally zero slow moments. The whole narrative flows like a melted chocolate. Karl Urban shines. It takes the cake in a much more entertaining way. Love the spin on ""superheroes"" and really shows how this show is the evolutionary result of Superhero Genre fatigue. A well done in my opinion. I'd be surprised if they are already not planning future seasons. It deserves it."
7.0,16 August 2019,"Amazing show that I binge watched over 3 nights! You don't have to be a superhero fan to watch this because it flips the whole genre round on its head & this makes the show very dark, humorous & highly addictive. I hope Amazon keep this show going for at least 5 season's as it has so much left to explore. Do yourself a massive favour & sit back & watch this gem of a show you won't be disappointed."
5.0,21 August 2019,"Very nice twist on the superhero world, it put a 180 degree different point of view which put the viewer in anticipation to know what's next."
6.0,15 September 2022,This shows proves that if superheroes exist in our human world how will they be capitalised and used for the motive of gaining power among the people and anyone trying to stop them will be punished and be declared terrorist or something to the public manupulating them through social media and so on however season 3 was a bit disappointing for me as what they were trying to acheive in episode 1 was redirected to that problem only at last episode you would understand if you have watched the show anyways a perfect R-rated masterpiece we deserve from marvel we didn't get this show provides us that truly amazing.
5.0,15 August 2019,"It's well done and we'll executed. The only really flaw is the weak character development of the Superheroes during the first few episodes.

Karl Urban's Billy the Butcher steals the show. Hopefully Annie's Character will be given greater moral challenges in the second season.

Her goody two shoes act was getting wearing by episode 7. It should be increasing difficult for her to maintain her morality with the 7 in the 2nd season."
7.0,30 January 2020,"This series is so well done in so many ways, some worth mentioning is -The visually effects is really well done! -The audio and then soundtracks is well thought out and put in the series in perfekt moments. -The world building is spot on, the world comes Alive, everything from posters, character, newsfeeds, even ordinary stuffs like toys and buggning flys.

The series is visually and audio way a pleasure to watch But The best part of it is The take on superheroes! We have gotten alot of the superheroes genre in latest But The Boys gives an uniqe touch on it, the collatraldamge, the gore, the bakside of the fame and we get to se The moneymaking industrial behind them.

Last But not least, the casting is super and The acotrs have done an amazing job!

A real superheroes series whit The upsides and downsides of being an superheroes, whit The enemys and The fans that comes whit it, aswell The spoofs on The american style gives alot of comedy."
2.0,19 August 2019,"This film is a film that is worth watching, not the origin of superhero movies for young children, but this film is very appropriate for adults and the language choices are also good and the scene is exciting."
6.0,1 August 2019,
1.0,4 June 2022,"Season 1 was great.

Season 2 wasn't as good, but still very watchable.

Season 3... absolute GARBAGE. Horrible storyline - or should I say ""storylineS"" (way too many ""who cares"" storylines).

And let's not forget the leftist propaganda, obvious hate for our country, and blatant lefty talking-points RUIN this show.

The sexual depravity and explicit gore are also now crutches just for the sake of shock value.

After the first 3 episodes of season 3, I've changed my ""8"" rating to a ""2"". It would be a ZERO if not for the great season 1 and decent season 2.

I, for one, am done with this show. It's so sad how the Hollywood Left ruined this once great storyline."
7.0,22 August 2019,"Hey Netflix Marvel, DC Universe, and Marvel Universe take a seat. This is a change from the same drabe meandering action movies and series. After just finishing the last Netflix season of Jessica Jones (snore) ""The Boys"" came as a shock to my system. From the very beginning of the first episode holding hands will never be the same. I could not stop watching this show. The production value in retrospect was low to mid budget but in no way distracted from the show. It's nice to know superheroes can be fun again. If you haven't watched this show try the first episode."
1.0,8 July 2020,"I like everything about it, it's a 10/10 for me I really recommend this to anyone who is just Bored with all of these Superhero content they cramp in our throat for the past 15 years or so.there is only one tiny little problem and that is queen Maeve doesn't have any sex scene in the whole show, if you can believe that, so I recommend for the second season she has a lesbian sex scene with her girlfriend and a Threesome with homelander and Starlight were she plays the older woman .....ok that's too much I'm just fantasizing but if you do that please make it at least 5 minutes long so I don't have to replay that over and over again"
7.0,22 January 2020,"What can I say, the cast is superb, everybody acts their role as they are supposed to. The directing is beautiful and the story is compelling.

Power corrupts and we can see it in the super-heroes clearly. I wont say anything more, watch the first episode, if you don't like it, then it's not for you."
2.0,16 August 2019,Did not know this till now but I have been waiting for this all my life!! What a show 10/10
7.0,2 September 2019,For those who are sick of super hero movies and prefer something more realistic I suggest this show. The dialog is real and I can see how people can get caught up in hero worship
1.0,19 August 2019,"This series is an instant classic...great acting (good to see Elizabeth Shue) with Karl Urban injecting every scene he's in with his dry humor in that wonderful accent. Da bomb.

Costuming is spot on! From the shirts that ""Hughie"" (played by Jack Quaid) to the Supes wardrobe so much thought is put into each episode.

And the ""Cherry"" (yes, I am making a reference to the title of episode 2) on this Supe Sundae is the soundtrack! Makes all the episodes well rounded.

Watch this series and your in for a treat!"
6.0,3 January 2020,"The Boys is funny. At the firs, i didn't think that this series will be funny. I laughed so hard at episode one. And my best episode is actually episode one, when ""the accident"" started everything. This is a series which give the first impression for the viewer to continue watching. Although, there are soma boring parts and predictable, especially in episode 3 until 6, the last two episodes save it. Good job for the writer."
5.0,13 November 2019,"I was hesitant to even watch episode 1 honestly. I sure am glad I did, it was a little slow initially in the story development, but it was crucial to the main character. The the story takes off after that and your hooked in for a binge.

If your a Sci-Fi or super hero fan, This is the show!

Sarge"
7.0,25 April 2020,"I was enjoying the show until the the dolphin / Deep scene. It was completely unnecessary and brutal. I'm not sure if the idea was to sicken animal lovers, or just add on to the already horrific fact that nearly 30 thousand dolphins are Savagely mutilated then thrown back into the ocean to drown every year! It was entirely too upsetting to continue watching the series."
1.0,1 August 2019,
7.0,22 November 2019,"These times we live in are not my favourite. People lack uniqueness, the social media situation is out of control, information and knowledge have little to none value, and most movies have a number in the title. No I am not talking about the 101 Dalmatians but all the sequels, reboots, crossovers and whatnots. And superhero theme is at core of this problem, I think. Naturally, I have been very sceptic about this show then. But my oh my, was I taught a lesson. Although most characters in The Boys lack depth, those that have been dealt with more dimensions feel very real and most of all I would like to bow before Anthony Starr for his, in my opinion, astonishing performance filled with so many emotions and understanding that not only you will believe that this creature really exists, you will feel for it. Great job by Karl Urban, Liz Shue and Erin Moriarty as well.. Story is quite simple but good, no excessive CGI, not many cliches, loved the dark humour.. But overall this show is being held together by great performances and Anthony Starr deserves a Golden Globe."
1.0,12 August 2019,"I loved this show. It covers many subjects with nuance and perception, such as sexual assault, for one. It makes story-telling choices that are daring and novel, to its credit.

I would have given it a 10, except for all the politics and anti-religion stuff, which I would have forgiven, had it not been so overdone in one particular episode. Still, it gets a 9 from me."
6.0,30 August 2019,Great show very entertaining very creative lotses twist funny action packed
1.0,11 December 2019,"Calling the Boys a superhero series is actually not accurate. The Boys is about power, corruption, society and ""what if"" superheroes existed in real life. Add an extremely well built and gripping plot and class acting and you obtain my favourite series in 2019, hands down."
7.0,6 February 2020,"Just wow, it shows the dark/another side of or fav supes and also it reminds of all the superheroes we saw in our whole life... . . . Loved it... . And it's s rare that I rate or review anything on IMDb..."
2.0,22 August 2019,Darkly entertaining. This is what a want in an action show!
7.0,10 August 2020,Everything is ok/good about show but nothing great.
1.0,2 April 2022,Season one was good. Lots of action. Good story. Season two is tuning into a soap opera. All dialogue...lots less action. Just about ready to pull the plug on this one.
7.0,13 November 2019,"*Review for season 1* When Garth Ennis said that The Boys would ""out-Preacher Preacher""... well, he was right. Maybe not in quality, but The Boys sure was a sick series, amazing and crazy also. The Boys was a different (but not that original) take on superheroes, presenting them as a bunch of psychos ('cause Ennins hates them), with an underground CIA team ready to take them off the map if they cross the line. The series managed to be horrifying and hilarious at the same time, developing a great history through it's almost 100 issues; and for me, a must read to all comic book readers. So I was quite amazed when this TV adaptation was announced because the trailer was pretty bad, and certainlly they wouldn't be able to be really faithful to the source material (because of the dark nature of it). Well, I certainlly was right... but also wrong. No, this is not a faithful adaptation, maybe not even a good one. One thing the show mantains is the name, but not that much else. The characters are different for the better (Hughie, the Female, the Deep, A-Train) and unfortunately also for the worst (Stillwell, Butcher, Homelander, MM, Frenchie, Queen Maeve...), with some of them being totally erased (the Legend, Terror, Jack From Jupiter). Not blaming the actors, all did a great job (especially Karl Urban and Antony Starr), but most of the characters were great from the start, so why change them that much? Maybe because this shows differs totally story wise from the comics. Now, I admire the risk of taking a different path, and so far this 1st season the history is great, but man, how tf they're going to continue it? They closed all the doors they could take if they followed the comic arcs, I think none of them will be used in the 2nd season (as almost none were used in this one), so i'm really worried for how the show is going to continue. I'd also like to mention how this show is lacking some blls. One of the hallmarks of the comic was the extreme violence. The show has some, but not really that much. Some people may say is better because the violence is the comic was pure shock-value... well that's true, but it was also used for a bigger impact in you, and for making you laught. The characterisic sick humour of the comic is also totally gone, maybe laughed 3 or 4 times, could they change that? Don't let my complaints intimidate you, this show is quite great. The timing for this to be released is perfect, considering we're living in a time were superheroe movies are the most successful and 90% of them suck, this show is a breath of fresh air, just as the comic was back in the day. Still hyped for season 2, let's see if they manage to not ruin this. 1st season rating: 7.8/10"
5.0,27 July 2019,
6.0,1 August 2021,"The Boys feels like the result of a culture saturated for decades in video games and pornography, with writers so incapable that they confuse shock value for drama. It feels that way probably because it is. Stay far far away from this trash, it is a waste of time."
1.0,26 December 2020,
7.0,5 October 2020,The novelty wore off quickly. Superhero show are rapidly becoming the boring Westerns of the 21st century. I watch one every two years or so and they're all the same. Too long and unlovable characters.
2.0,3 January 2020,What happens when Super Heros are dark....total chaos. .and this series shows this world and definitely has some turns.
6.0,12 August 2022,
2.0,28 September 2022,"The actually story is between heros who get the power from some chemicals and other side there are some common people who destroys the hero's.

I love the stroy line , creating VFX was also fantastic. When I watched the first episode it's wow bcoz every character plays a great role. Some of character creats nudity. Some are great heros with real power. It's wow, some of killing scene creates great bcoz in real life it gonna not made it but in the series killing scene were great. Dialogue gives so much realistic. I loved the storyline.

My rating about this series is 7 bcoz so much nudity content involves. But it's good."
7.0,7 September 2020,"The first season pushes boundaries with gore and flipping the script on superhero tropes and presents a story that's interesting to follow. Season 2, on the other hand, completes forgets that the point of any story should be the plot, and focuses instead on just coming up with reasons to insert gore and violence that do not advance the plot in any tangible way. There may be a good story that you could find in season 2, if you dig down. But they cover it up with gratuitous and utterly unnecessary gore. Plenty of shows and movies have copious amounts of violence, yet still remain loyal to putting the plot first. This is not one of those. Why? Just, why?"
2.0,23 December 2019,"Furiously paced, unapologetically vulgar, outrageously violent, delightfully quick-witted, and surprisingly clever. I started The Boys expecting another tongue-in-cheek satire about Marvel/DC; and though The Boys is without a doubt exactly that, it's also a mature exploration of celebrity culture, Eisenhower's military industrial complex, and many other complex themes. It's genuinely surprising in places, and deeply empathic in others. The story is unpredictable when it needs to be, the acting is on-point, and the dialogue is quotable as bad. Don't look this over as just another satire; this show is so, so much more."
3.0,8 July 2022,"Homelander is the show. Butcher, Hughie and the Deep are the only other watchable characters. Every other character is just filler garbage. Frenchie and Kimiko are absolutely the worst thing about the show. Forced wokeness keeps it from being a great show."
6.0,22 August 2019,Unnecessarily disgusting in the most Zak Snyder way.
5.0,4 June 2022,Sorry did I miss something? When did The Boys turn into a soap opera for woketards? 3 episodes in and nothing has happened except for a load of boring preaching to all the nasty masculine white men and some small moments of gore for shock value. I wander what show will be ruined next?
6.0,22 September 2019,"Yet not perfect.

While everyone is complementing Karl Urban for his performance in season 1, please do not forget Antony Starr's stellar performance! Even if it may seem easier at times."
2.0,27 July 2019,Unfortunately this series didn't seem to embrace any of the original content from the graphic novels. It seemed to have a total rewrite of the story line with much of the points that were made watered down or missing and with any sort of comedic value just sucked from the show topped off with just a few bad words thrown in to make it seem fresh and edgy. It's a shame I was really looking forward to this coming out.
7.0,21 December 2019,"Was ok,uneven (acting and prod),not nearly crazy enough...and I know,I'm not impartial,but next time,hope they try to find french actor,that was tough to endure.j'dis ça j'dis rien..."
1.0,12 September 2020,
6.0,24 March 2020,"The trailers had got me hyped for this show, even though I'm not a fan of the creative team behind it. And the fantastic first episode promised a lot, sadly the show doesn't deliver. I thought I would get a dark but fun show, showing likeable oddballs defeating smug supervillains, maskerading as heroes.

Especially Homelander is an amazing villain, but like many modern shows (like The Walking Dead) this is not a story about good guys against bad guys. The writing is good, the cast great, the performances are all fantastic. But I can't help asking myself what's actually the point of it all.

It's a great premise, but just not used the right way. It's not going anywhere interesting, it's dark, hopeless world creeps under your skin and they seem to be brutal simply for shock value. The show is really good, but it doesn't give me anything and was not fun to watch, instead especially the last few episodes were just stressful and depressing."
1.0,17 December 2019,"The Boys is an entertaining programme. Yeah, okay, the love of your life may well soon be forgotten when a chocolate-eyed blonde babe with super powers comes along, and there are some clear agendas going on as I mentioned in the subject line, but overall, The Boys is an entertaining programme - so much so, I fact, that I had to repeat myself."
1.0,8 June 2022,"The one word I would use to describe this show is...FUN...enjoyable, disgusting, heartwarming, blood 'n' entrails fun! The good guys are the worst guys and there's no such thing as a straight line from point A to point B. This show definitely is NOT for everyone. In fact, the more warped your sensibilities are, the more fun you'll have. There are a few things in season three that become a bit cringe (it wouldn't be a Hollywood production without a little bit of ""THE MESSAGE""), but they pass and the story's back on track. It's great to see this show's a hot because Carl Urban is too great an actor to be riding the pine. Every second he's on screen is electric, and his chemistry with Hughie Campbell (played by Jack Quaid), his polar opposite, is great. I hope this goes on for awhile, because I'll take all they can give me!

UPDATE: Wow! Season 4 is it for me! No, it's not because Starlight butchered her face, it's because the writers butchered the plot! I spent three seasons watching Frenchie and Kimiko build a solid, heartfelt relationship...then BAM, Frenchie touches another guy's hand and turns STRAIGHT UP GAY! And I know that it has been established that he's either gay or bi in past story lines and it didn't bother me, but this smacks of lazy writing. All the other jabs at the right wing and straight up mocking of Christianity got slathered on a bit thick as well. But hey, the show runner told me that if I didn't like this...DON'T WATCH! Well, you get your wish!"
2.0,2 August 2021,Something off and I can't put my finger on it. All I can say is that I was not immersed. I admit this is not very helpful but there is my perspective!
2.0,5 August 2019,"Only five episodes in, but this is by far the best thing that Amazon have made. Funny, surprising, violent and clever. I'm so impressed with this show. Carl Urban's accent does waver a little between British and Australian, but apart from that minor fault the show is faultless and gives a great new twist the the whole superhero genre.

Just finished season 2. And I Don't understand the negative reviews as I have to say it's even better than season1. The last couple of episodes of season 1 went a bit dark, but no worries on season 2. Unlike season2 of Preacher, The Boys keeps the mindless violence and fun turned up to the max. Thankfully a season 3 has already been commissioned.

Season 3. Oh dear. What happened to the dark humour that made this show so successful? The last 3 episodes did get back to form, but the first half of this series is just a total misery. And because I loved the first 2 seasons so much, it just made season 3 all the more disappointing, so much so I have lowered my rating for the show down to a 6 from an original 9.

Season 4 Unfortunately I gave up after the first episode. There is no more humour, it is now just dark and sinister. My overall ranking has come down to a 5."
3.0,23 October 2019,
5.0,22 January 2024,"I haven't read the comics and you shouldn't have to in order to watch the show or have an opinion on it. That said.

The whole ""superheroes but edgy"" genre is getting a little stale in 2024, but The Boys is enjoyable enough to continue on despite this, mostly due to the absolute joy that is seeing Karl Urban (Billy Butcher), Antony Starr (Homelander), Jensen Ackles (Soldier Boy) and Giancarlo Esposito (Stan Edgar) chew up Kripke's dialogue. Fine cinema this is not, but it's enjoyable. It's violent and crude without being solely shock jock tripe.

Where The Boys stumbles is the direct, on the nose parallels between Homelander and his fans/allies and the Trump presidential campaign of 2016, which was already getting stale in 2019 when season 1 hit Prime. The references would be obvious to anyone and Kripke himself has said Homelander is supposed to be a Trump figure. It is the year of our lord 2024 (2023 when season 3 debuted) and Kripke is leaning even further into the Trump/Homelander thing. Idk about you but I 1) watch TV to escape reality, not be reminded of the political circus of the modern era and 2) am sick and tired of hearing about Trump.

Hopefully (but unlikely) Kripke starts devoting more time to the genuinely interesting things he could do with this property, instead of ""Trump's an evil Nazi, ok guys."""
1.0,13 January 2021,"Sometimes you could see that they were creating a show, but enjoyd it though."
1.0,16 July 2020,"Liked a lot of it. However, whoever wrote some of this is a grim person. So tasteless, so pathetic and so sickening. Trying to be all current and ""edgy"" but it's just BS. Not going to go into details but some of those writes need a mental check. Embarrassing making that and releasing it to the world and ruins it because it's all I can take away from it."
5.0,18 August 2019,WHY the disgusting and crude language - its total unnecessary and detracts from a great show. I would've given it more stars. Please tone it down in future episodes
5.0,30 July 2019,"The show sucks. Production values are good, but story, characters and their interactions were totally dull. The main premise was drama. Minimal humor. Annoying and obnoxious characters. It's shocking that this sits at a 9.1 on IMDB."
1.0,10 May 2021,"Without any expectation, if you watch, You won't be dissociated for sure."
1.0,14 June 2022,"There is nothing creative about this show. The first season I will say at least seemed to have a story and then everything after that is just trying to find ways to push every single boundary possible (and soaring waaaaay past it in my opinion) just for the shock factor. It's a show of moments designed to have a bunch of YouTubers post reaction clips on their pages and that's it. No story...just garbage to make people go ""HOLY ****!!!!!"""
5.0,4 August 2022,"Action scenes are weak.

Another super hero's intro is very bad.

Not Comics accurate.

Comedy, Romance, Dialogues are having best timing. This series is very perfect super hero series."
1.0,10 June 2022,"This could have been so much better if it wasn't so gross. I hate the needless depravity. I don't need to see and hear every disgusting thing that the writers ever thought about. I feel like it's been written by a group of teenagers trying to shock their friends.

Not for me; I'm obviously not part of their target demographics. Cringe worthy."
5.0,12 January 2020,Storyline was ok. Solid acting. Too silly in some parts.
1.0,13 September 2020,"Disenchanted with amazon's delivery choice. Putting that aside, this season is a slow burn and less exciting for me."
1.0,4 January 2020,"What I do like is the idea, the story, the effects (and then some not so much, a bit 90s over them), the costumes.... And obviously one of the most beautiful women on earth Elisabeth Shue (who can forget her, or Cage for that matter in the excellent Leaving Las Vegas) who performs wonderful in her role.

Unfortunately she is the highlight of the cast, and that to me is the weak point. The rest, except of Dominique McElligott, and a couple of others in B roles is disappointing to me. Are they overdoing it? Is the director confused mixing credible roles with overacted ones? Is it maybe supposed to be so? Am I just not getting it?

To be clear, Im not saying its bad acting, but it isnt good as I perceive it.

Anyway, Ill continue to watch as it is entertaining, and with some serious undertones (ironically especially today) about the US empire and its true dreams (subjective and personal view). Hopefully the cast will have set itself for a season 2, and I can vote it up to a 7 or 8"
1.0,12 October 2020,"The 1st season was amazing. It was new, refreshing, full of action, good story.

I was really looking forward to see the 2nd, I even waited for the whole season to finish so I could binge watch. The 2nd season was disappointing. Way too long, boring scenes, I needed to fast forward many times because it was painfully boring and several scenes didn't add anything to the story.

After this 2nd season I don't have high expectations towards the 3rd so I won't watch it. For me, it's cancelled.

Watchmen should have been continued, not this."
5.0,2 December 2019,When heroes become an entertainment industry under the law of performance and profit. Making money is more important than serving the right purpose. Some ordinary gars rise up and try to destroy this strong system.
5.0,3 June 2022,"First Antony Starr (LOVED him in 'Banshee') brings Homelander to a whole new level. The character Antony creates has soul deep disdain unlike any villain I've seen to date. The pain and angst of this disdain move over him at the slightest hint of benefit or accomplishment in another person. He smolders with a slithering hatred that stuns.

Second the level of creativity and risk taking 'The Boys' undertakes is impressive. 'Termite' and all he can do is pure genius. Just amazing writing, acting, direction, effects. EVERYBODY does wonderful work.

And this is the third season.

Wow.

At that point my rating was an 8.

Then came season 4. Wow . . . What a waste of time. Big fat fillers and an empty set-up to what will surely be an even emptier season 5. Too too bad. The ruination of a unique creation.

Cue funeral dirge . . . Too bad about the totally mediocre season finale. WHAT a disappointment. So, these guys can't really bring it after all . . ."
5.0,10 July 2021,"Season 1 had a lot going for it but in season it stagnated like many shows do. It went from S1 nostalgic rebel anarchy to S2 ""mediocre housewife"" storytelling. It had potential."
1.0,16 January 2023,"This show has a super (no pun intended!) interesting concept. But it's very poorly executed. The plots and subplots are disconnected and confusing. The graphic violence & gore would be fine if paired with good writing, creative humor and some semblance of character development. Characters are killed off on a whim with no impact or emotion because they are all insufferable. The writers seem incapable of understanding how to build suspense or tension. I watched 8 episodes to attempt to give this series a fair shake as many have spoken highly of it and loved it. Unfortunately it is very poorly done. And not only that but it's extremely cringey. If you want to watch a smartly written vigilante show, try Dietland."
2.0,27 October 2019,Tapped out after 6 episodes Consistently boring a waste of Urban and Shue AKA The Squabblers
5.0,27 July 2019,"The comic book ""The Boys"" is dark, twisted, funny and a hell of an entertaining ride with a great story and crazy good characters. Everything this lousy TV series is not. All they had to do was take the story of the comic and put it onto the TV screen and you would have ended up with an epic TV show. Think of Breaking Bad meets the first seasons of Game of Thrones meets The Sopranos. But for some reason they decided to completely rewrite the story, hire completely wrong actors and turn it into an epic fail of a boring snoozefest. Instead of a wild, weird storyline like in the comic book we see miscast actors spending their time in some bowling alley talking about nonsense, or they are sitting around in some cellar doing nothing, they are discussing really boring stuff in some corporate office, they visit some festivites , or (my highlight) they are giving endless boring speeches. Again and again. There are only a few good scenes in all of the eight episodes when - you guessed it - they stuck to the comic book. But that only makes about 20 minutes or so. The rest of the eight hours of showtime is an absolute boring disaster, a creative catastrophe brought to you by talentless showrunners who brought you such snoozefests like ""Supernatural"" or any lame Seth Rogen ""comedy"". ""The Boys"" as comic is one of the best comics ever. ""The Boys"" as TV series is THE WORST TV SHOW EVER. Read the comic book."
3.0,6 August 2020,"The story is decent though it is not original. They are quite proficient in portraying problems with American society. Unfortunately, the series have an excessive fan service, as if the director took a book of sexual deviations and made the actors play it all out on the screen. Coprophilia and sex with animals are omitted, although Aquaman came pretty close to the second one with a dolphin."
2.0,16 February 2024,"I don't know. Most superhero shows and movies aren't usually funny at all. This is one of those. Their focus is to save the world. It's not to be funny. Superhero movies and TV shows shouldn't mix with comedy. There's a reason they don't work together. They can't make enough clever jokes. They can't focus on saving the world while trying to be funny at the same time. I don't see what's so funny about this show. I could only get through a few episodes. Not enough action or drama. Not very many punchlines or at least clever ones. The characters also speak very slow or very fast. The setting is kind of odd. Why does the show seem so dark when it's daylight? The lighting could use some TLC. I get that some of the slow pace or silent moments are supposed to make the show seem more dramatic, but much of it is just lazy. I've seen a lot of dark humor on television. In my opinion, this doesn't really show much of it. Maybe it's just the timing. I know many people think that swearing is funny because it's unexpected. I don't mind the swearing, but it doesn't even help the show's humor."
1.0,14 July 2022,
2.0,26 July 2024,"If it was not for Anthony Stars, I wouldn't have even watched it! Bad image for S. U. P. E. R. Heroes and I did not enjoy it at all. At least they could have swapped this butcher with Anthony stars! After Banshee I can't see this The story was too lengthy and not connected at some seasons. Especially season 4 is a disgrace I wonder who gives this series 10/10 and why Horrible.

The selection of actors doing the super heroes could have been much better.

The group fighting the super heroes are certainly wrongly chosen and not convincing! Actually I hated them all except Frenchie he is the only one convincing."
5.0,18 September 2020,"I hate series but I made an exception this time. Season 1 was very unique. The view point it took and the characters were exceptional. I was really impressed. But now with Season 2, the story seems exhausted of its original tempo and slowed down to its final wish and will die. Sadly. I expected a ""really something"" but now..."
4.0,28 July 2019,Why did they need to include such stupid leftist propaganda in this show? Ridiculous. Ruined the whole experience for me.
3.0,8 June 2022,
4.0,29 July 2019,"I was hoping for something a bit more original in terms of the superheroes being not so heroic, but it was just a mashup of ""Hancock"" and ""American Gods"" neither of which I was a fan of. This just isn't for me. Then again, I'm not a huge DC/Marvel fan, so I'm just not the demographic. I went to the show seeking some good villains or antiheroes, but the definition of this on the show are male actors who act like any human creep: sexual perverts, no accountability, thinking they are hotshots. Once you remove the high concept (which is brilliant, by the way), the actual content is just a show about superpowered guys acting."
3.0,26 August 2019,"Even though the show starts strong with a vision of a different superhero universe than usual it starts to go down the cliche route in many plots. Meh, the end was predictable. Nothing we've never seen before. I do love the characters and how they explore the role of superheros in society. However, I caught myself thinking ""This doesn't make sense"" many times. Soundtrack is good. Some performances are a bit lackluster. Production quality is there, but don't expect any extreme visuals. All in all, a good time, especially as a change of pace from all the other superhero stuff."
1.0,24 January 2023,"I tried to watch this show when it first came out and kinda lost interest during the 1st season during MCU times. But started watching it again in 2023, actually kinda did enjoy it. Homelander makes you hate him and is absolutely a crazy psycho. Some of the other characters are whiney and some bad writing. But the main four guys have some good chemistry and good laughs. Overall first season is worth watching as they get you to enjoy how a crazy superhero and a money crazied corporation can effect the social media.

SEASON 2 WOW! I just don't understand why it's so BAD. It felt like overwriting or trying to push too hard. They lost the chemistry between the main characters that made us keep watching season one. The superheroes have powers, then they don't use them or they got different ones. I know they use the V drug as an escape goat or more missed writing. Then the one girl Kimiko can be completely ruthless but then does nothing to help her bro. I was super lost in that episode. They drag on some of dumbest things but make the good parts very few. Homelander doesn't ever let anyone bully him.... and then everyone is bullying him.

All the super heros are super push overs and are always broke... so weird as all they talk about is money and ratings and add the social media garbage into it. Now they have pushed the racism into the mix and same sex relationships. I'm just confused how these things have seemed to take over in this season.

Don't know if I can finish it or even want to. Let alone go onto season 3."
1.0,11 April 2020,
1.0,15 September 2020,"Shoe itself is pretty good, but show runners have no respect for the audience, feel that you should be forced to dedicate more time to there show."
1.0,26 October 2022,"Have you ever wondered why all super beings become heroes and won't just take the easy way out. I mean, if you think about it honestly, if you got super powers would you only use your powers for good? Would you not get an ego? Would you not think of yourself as better than and more deserving than the normal people?

This show plays with all these concepts and binds it together in a really good story. It also shows how people that are normal view these super powered beings and all the different responses different people varying from hero worshipping to how dark we can turn in order to eliminate the perceived threats.

Really good show to watch."
4.0,28 July 2019,
1.0,12 October 2020,"Loved season 1.

However, Season 2 was just a series of long drawn out 'deep meaningful conversations' amongst characters that we care nothing about. Any plot developing action and genuine story line was forced to take a back seat to ultra violence and insincere emotion, leaving any trace of the wit and sarcasm of season 1 long behind.

Hughie and Starlights relationship is laughable, Butcher is one dimensional, has no character development and still fronts that poorly executed Jack Sparrow-esque cockney accent, Homelander is the only saving grace of the show.

I like the jibs at modern day America, at populism and the rise of white nationalism. But, you can't have a good show on symbolism alone.

All the action is edited into the trailer, the rest is repetitive drivel. Save yourself 8 hours and watch that."

Yes, it is violent and in your face. There are some full frontal shots of dudes but not one naked breast in 10 hours which is confusing. There is bad language and blood and gore. Hope that parents that took their kids to DEADPOOL have figured out this isn't for 13 year old boys. The reviews are running 9 on here and so hopefully it will have a long and productive life. So far the only bad episode was one about how Christianity is a lie for sheep and gay is the way. The lead guy, Butcher is a anti-hero to the extreme. The tech guy is easy to pull for - everyman. It is just getting legs and I can't wait for season 2. Sadly. Revisiting this review, show goes down hill fast. The third and fourth season has even more naked dudes in your face and they make a main character gay after 3 years of straight. This show is unwatchable gay pornography and I don't know how it got past the censors."

Seems the only thing that had The Boys in it was the lazy script you wrote for a well thought concept. Every part of this series is just fully rubbish, I feel nothing for the characters and no chemistry between them whatsoever, your writing failed in every aspect of creating a character arc let alone tell a well connected story. I don't believe you score this high and the only reason of this can be that your audience are also high. What a joke of a writing crew. Shame!"
1.0,10 September 2020,The first season was decent until the last three episodes then it just got lost. The second season is just awful... why spend so much time on dolphin boy and have his gill sing to him for 5 minutes? He was gone. Stay on the main story whatever that is...
1.0,18 June 2022,"By season 3 it just becomes ridiculous and silly with too much woke liberal sexual sadomasochism depravity.

The directors seem to be running out of ideas to shock. Lost interest. Such a waste because season 1 and 2 were good."
2.0,7 September 2020,
2.0,18 June 2022,"The Boys started off strong, got a little bit hanky in the second season, but this third season has gone completely off the rails in its soapbox politics.

It was so promising, and I'm still holding out hope it can turn itself around. When it's not doing the social commentary it's still reasonably good. But when you cast every villain or disgusting person as thinly veiled tropes of any party, you're not focusing on the story and it shows."
5.0,17 January 2024,"Well reviews are being deleted once again, just like this one. This is the fourth time I have posted this one. Hmmm...I guess no negative reviews of this particular show are tolerated...I wonder why?

""The Boys"" was a show that started out solid, with soo much potential... but became an unwatchable mess. The cause, the people involved with the series and their self-hatred, nihilism and desire to use this show as a platform for their own ideological impulses.

It follows the same predictable pattern of what modern entertainment has become these days. Ideology passing as entertainment, underpinned by some socio-political, supposedly progressive babble that seems to be all the rage in Hollyweird nowadays.

The baddies are also as cliched as they are predictable and boring and exactly who you'd expect from a ideologically infused production of this kind.

This has become such a predictable pattern, that there is no longer any anger, frustration or ranting to be done...not even sadness or resignation. Only apathy.. Summary: An interesting beginning followed by a rapid decline..."
4.0,11 July 2023,"It's quite similar to Kripke's previous TV Series with all made-up messes or situations being more complicated so it will make a long series. The plots and rhythms are very identic also. Ackles' performance is the only best thing in here, while Butcher and Eternal Homelander were super-awful, and they want to keep them alive to make a long series. Other characters, will be gone one by one slowly within the series. The stories weren't growing well, and predictable as I said above which were made it up to be complicated ones. Can't say anything else about it. I won't waste my time on the next series."
3.0,10 January 2021,"I haven't read the comics. I have no doubt that if I liked the comics I would hate the show, I don't know why people watch tv/movies of comics/books they love. season one is excellent. 9/10 season two is crap. 0/10. it's slow, and packed with political references. no thanks."
1.0,8 July 2022,"I love the show but that unconnected knee-jerk of a ""punch line"" instantly took 5 stars away for me. It's completely unrelated and had nothing to do with their history or why they where attacking him. So disappointing, the end fight was already not going anywhere and then they spew this out of nowhere propaganda in there as a cherry on top... sell outs."
2.0,6 August 2019,"Not sure what they were trying to accomplish with this, but it is just utter filth from top to bottom. Every single character is a either a sociopath or a psychopath. If you even remotely like this show, even just a little bit, you are in need of serious life coaching or something. I'm not saying that to be funny or .... whatever.... you really need to do something to change your life."

4.0,4 January 2020,I would love to see something like this that I can watch with my family. Every streaming service is competing to be the most offensive. And I already know I can change the channel! I know I will be ridiculed for this but this will not be allowed in my home.
4.0,4 August 2019,"Dumb and boring. Dark humor, not humor at all. Spoiled ""superheros "" gone amok."
1.0,21 June 2022,I enjoyed season 1 the most. Season 2 was good too. S3 on the other hand is just so bad. Jensen Ackles's acting is average. The only actor I enjoy mainly is Antony as Homelander. He carries the whole show. S3 just uses violence for shock value without any clear plot.
2.0,11 August 2019,"This series is the perfect remedy for the ""superhero nausea"" from Marvel and the like. It's amazing in every regard and paints quite the picture of how superheroes could be perceived in the ""real world"", with some added flair, of course. Check it out, you won't be disappointed."
1.0,31 December 2022,
1.0,2 September 2022,"I've been following The Boys from S1. And hot damn, it was genius.

I went in with the same expectations into S2, but I found it sometimes lacking. Still my enthusiasm and momentum carried me through, right into S3... and boy, if they dropped the ball in this season.

Let's get the positive stuff out of the way: Antony Starr and Jensen Ackles are both pretty awesome in their roles. And Kimiko's final decision about her power was really heartfelt.

OK, that was quick. Now, the rest...

The writing in the whole season is nothing short of abysmal. Gone are the intriguing premises of ordinary people fighting an evil company with superheroes. Gone are the reliance on grit and wit and street smarts to outmaneuver your opponent. Instead enter a**-pulled contrivances, half-baked subversions and downright stupidity.

Instead of an intriguing story you get everyday politics injected into the show - in spades. And with a subtlety of cracking a walnut with a sledgehammer. ""Oh You see? We mock woke corporate marketing! We mock Orange Man! Underground media! Mainstream media! We're bashing both left and right, aren't we kewl?""

The writers also had no idea what to do with their characters after S2. They had put half of the cast on pause or simply abandoned their storyline. Characters constantly make stupid and/or contradictory decisions that they would never have made in previous seasons. Power levels and power dynamics are being shifted on a dime. The last episode was especially full with eye-rolling moments, from Maeve dropping some of the deadliest nerve agent right onto the city to the awful final showdown.

Thank you show, you had such a promising premise, I even held my hopes high after S2 for all the ongoing storylines, but you let me down big time."
1.0,17 June 2022,"I admit, the first season or so, I found it funny and a different and somehow more realistic take on what the world would be like with people endowed with super powers. But three seasons in, it's just a nasty, ugly slog that I no longer have any interest in."
1.0,21 March 2021,"Not enough of a cinefile to recognize the behind the scenes people other than Seth Rogan to know if any or all were also involved in Preacher but if you liked/loved that particular excursion into insanity (and I really did) I predict you will like/love The Boys to the same extent and for the same reasons. It skewers everyone and everything that needs skewering in today's social/political realm, while maintaining just enough humanity to allow viewers to identify with things that are really going on in life. Funny, gory and topical, I can't wait for season 3.

Edit: Well S3 continued the good, the bad and the gory and did not disappoint. Couldn't wait for S4. But I should have.

My questions? When did Disney buy HBO? Or did HBO have to give up creative control as part of its packaging agreement with Disney +? I know HBO is predictably left wing as is Seth Rogan. But both had been able to put aside their ideological leanings in producing this show for three seasons, skewering all sides with equal contempt. But I guess the pot (pun intended) finally boiled over and so far this year (must wonder if this being an election year had anything to do with it) it's just another in your face Orange Man Bad/pregnant single mother good trope and I won't be watching anymore. Starlight's ""heartfelt "" rapprochement with her aborting her baby rang so hollow it inadvertently made me laugh. Where was all this ""thinking"" when she was in the process of making this baby? Was she so weak willed and so enthralled with lust that she ""just couldn't help herself?"" What does this say about women? Are they really the ""weaker sex?"" That's certainly how she appears although I'm sure that's not the message the writers were attempting to get across. And Sister Sage, the smartest person in the world, who is Black, female and avariciously horney when she's around a horrible, immoral man she normally can't stand, but can't deal with all the pressures that come with being smart, so she occasionally has a lobotomy (unintended drug reference maybe?) just to ""get away."" Again if, as I assume, the writers purpose was to extoll the virtues of smart Black women, I just don't get it. And finally Homelander. I guess the best that can be said is they didn't have him dye his hair orange and give him a wild comb over, but they might as well have. So I've disabled my reminder for this show and will be letting this monkey ride off on the back of the shark that it jumped. And it's too bad. Thus was a nice companion piece to Doom Patrol. But it's obvious that they canceled the wrong show."
4.0,14 June 2024,"A spoof of comic book superheroes, The Boys has been operating on a waning plot. The boys could have been concluded in a single season, to start. Nothing further noteworthy can be found in the series. There are situations where having too many people involved at once makes character participation appear challenging. Thus, for the sequences that are added between episodes, continuity is highly important. The idea is that everyone is aware of the true tale and how the comic book version concludes. As a result, the cinematic representation merely provides an estimate for how the characters will perform in each scene. The truth is that both Homelander and Butcher are performing admirably. Via his role, the actor playing Homelander is fully expressing the character's hatred. In terms of entertainment value, the plot is fulfilling its purpose even though it occasionally drags and gets monotonous."

1.0,29 July 2019,"...there are no likeable characters. Most every character is selfish and arrogant. Interesting concept, Karl Urban is fun as you can guess, and this concept might have worked but aside from one of the main characters who is....nice..everyone else is just mean. Lost interest about half way through episode 2."
1.0,14 May 2021,Psychopatic trash written by a utterly depraved mind. No wonder the planet is going down the drain when people can even contemplate giving this anything more than one star. It's a true testament to how sick Hollywood has become.
5.0,9 July 2022,To many fillers its like they are trying milk the franchise . Season 3 content should have shown with a decent paced 4 episodes instead they streched it to 8 episodes with unnecessary fillers which barely add anything to the story. Amazon and sony should put more budget to this franchise because they need to step up the fight scenes. But I love the cast they did an amazing job as always❤.
5.0,10 August 2019,
5.0,21 January 2021,"What a pity for a show that starts so well to become so tedious and pretentious.

The first season is interesting, but it was already clear in which direction the series is moving.

Another show that went in the predictable direction characteristic of today's entertainment industry. Writers simply cannot refrain from destroying such a great concept.

The cast is not bad, the cinematography is good, it's a shame the writers aren't equally good. Too bad, the plot is fun. Too bad, the plot is interesting, but it's not worth wasting time on another tedious and pretentious series.

It could have been great. Another missed opportunity."

1.0,25 May 2020,"This is, almost purely, a character and actor review.

Jack Quaid: Comes across as both naive, sensitive and as a man with a mission - he just keeps getting better and better. Karl Urban: Plays the same gritty/violent/edgy character he's played so many times before - for the love of Bob, give his character more depth - he can do it! Antony Starr: Wow... talk about a total uplift! This guy has really raised his game here. Erin Moriarty: Awesome ability. This is a lady to watch. Dominique McElligott: Excellent - pity that her role was so poorly implemented. No depth of character whatsoever. Jessie T. Usher: Again - not enough depth for the actor to gain momentum (pun intended) - but one to watch out for. Chace Crawford: Brilliant performance - despite the script doing truly weird event turns with his character. (Obviously someone wants him gone.) Tomer Capon - Absolutely wonderful. At times I could almost believe that he was talking from personal experience. Bravo! Laz Alonso - Good performance within the narrow bounds of the (clichéd) writing - not his fault, you can only work with the lines drawn. Elisabeth Shue: Fantastic as always - though, again, the characterisation was a little stilted. Simon Pegg - A British actor with a remarkable film career of his own... and you can see and hear the experience that allowed him to take a 'bit' role and make it his own. Jennifer Esposito: Why, oh why did she bother? Surely this fine actress could have been better utilised... what a waste of her and our time.

Overall: Despite the lack of depth of any of the characters (and realising that these are not 3 hour long episodes) - the show is superb. It's extremely rare to find something new these days... mostly it's just a rehash of the same boring old themes. So far, this series has comedy and action - I hope to see some actual drama and pathos soon - and more rounded characters. This series is great - it could be groundbreaking - so go for it, please!"
1.0,26 July 2022,"I don't get it. The boys is vile, disgusting and shallow. Maybe it's all the sex, nudity, drugs and swearing that people like it so much. The use of famous super hero knock offs and lazy story telling makes this probably the worst series I ever muscled thru..."
5.0,10 September 2022,"Save your time. This show is heavy handed with the Political Correctness and Anti-Christian bigotry. If your bored out of your mind watch something good, Band of Brothers, Game of Thrones, Sesame Street even, don't waste your time with the Mad Liberals of the Boys. It is puke worthy in it's graphic nature, both for gore and over the top sensuality often combined into a cringe worthy remembrance of 80's and 90's get naked before you get dead brands. If you're a hard corps democrat it's probably right up your alley, knock yourself out. You will be drooling over it with out a doubt. Every one with a moral compass take a hard pass."

It was so distracting one cant focus on the story. Not to mention it was slow, plodding and weepy and weak. Everybody has a sob story and its tiring."
3.0,20 September 2022,"The first two seasons were fantastic, a ""realistic"" view of super heroes in the real world and how absolute power corrupts absolutely.

This was more than good vs evil with interesting back stories and great action sequences.

However, enter Season 3, Episode 1.

This show has turned into a pornographic decline and I am no prude but the first 10 minutes were deeply disturbing and had me quickly reaching for the parental controls on the streaming service.

What a shame, I hope the lack of audience for this season is a lesson for the creators to dial back as I have no interest anymore in this programme.

Watch the first 10 minutes, delete from watch list."
4.0,1 May 2021,But the way its going seems like a children's story with bad language... WTF.
1.0,11 September 2020,"I wanted to at least give season 2 a few episodes before I wrote it off. They changed too much from the comics in the 1st season but it was still good enough for me to see what was coming and now that I have I'm done. If you haven't read it you will probably enjoy the show, it's fun and violent and is great for those who are over supes. Enjoy it if you do."
5.0,23 November 2022,"It started really good with a fresh storyline.. but then just like many tv shows, it got dragged too long to the point it doesn't make sense anymore to me.

Season 3 was the worst of them all. Some storyline are just unnecessary.. bad script writing... at some point I feel like this was written by some apprentice writer or something. The plot is so predictable and they destroy the characters with some stupid conversations, or plot decisions. Even Hughie.. at the end of season 3, he become so annoying with his insecurities I was like.. oh just stop it! I'm embarrassed to see him.

I just need Homelander to die as soon as possible. Stop prolong the unnecessary.. I don't care anymore about the plot or the character's story arch.. sorry.."
5.0,13 October 2019,"I can't help but notice, repeatedly these days, how much we all today live in the world created by Alan Moore (even if he has had his name removed from it).

There are so many 21st century shows and comic books - all the ones which pose the question 'But what if superheroes lived in the real world?' - that all lead directly back to the books Moore was writing 20, 30 years ago. This particular one is greatly indebted to, most obviously, Watchmen, but also to his great superhero cop series, 'Top 10'.

'The Boys' is horribly cynical, crass and violent. It feels the product of a generation raised on Grand Theft Auto, and emerges from the same bleak, empty, hollowed out void that Joker and Too Old To Die Young crawled out of. There's an awful, depressing, god-shaped hole at the centre of it all, with no more heroes or anything else left to believe in, seeing only the worst in everyone. Predictably, all the male superheroes are evil, while all the female ones are either good or conflicted. No change there, of course, but I keep wondering what these kinds of messages, now so common in popular culture (and everywhere else) are doing to the glue holding civilization together.

Anyway, all this is made bearable only by the fact that it is also very clever, surprising, and genuinely laugh-out-loud funny. I'm three episodes in and I have no idea where it's going to go. And I do like being surprised.

Karl Urban's accent is a thing of bewilderment and wonder, dogpaddling all the way from the Docks of London to Auckland harbour and back, often in a single sentence. There's a (seemingly mandatory in 2019) #MeToo subtext to the plot that emerges as the story goes on, but I have to say, it's at least dealt with interestingly and intelligently, without any placard waving, and seems believable in the way it unfolds.

The script is witty and sharp, with many memorable lines scattered throughout it. The placement and meaning and delivery of the sentence ""Don't you ever besmirch Billy Joel"" has so much more depth and poignance than one would have thought at all possible.

I also want to add, even though it's now a very common thing to remark, the show has a first-rate soundtrack - whoever's choosing The Damned and Jane's Addiction and Bill Withers has a fine record collection."
3.0,13 September 2020,"We're all stuck at home (esp. in California) and the producers want to spoon-feed us an episode a week?

In any event, so far season 2 is nowhere near as engaging as its predecessor."
2.0,26 August 2019,Amazon disabled reviews and comments on this series to silence the disgruntled customers' complaints about it. That shows how good it really is. Yes. Some of the customers are abhorred by some of the naive messages this terribly put together series tried to push. But most of them are just shocked by how terrible and inept the makers are. They took a great concept and turned it into the worst TV show ever imaginable.
1.0,5 August 2020,"At every chance the 3 plot relevant women get hurt and yet the emotions that drive the show are those of the male dominant cast. It's a series of edge lords, preeching anti-corporate ideals in a series made by Amazon."

2.0,9 April 2023,"For a series that gets an 8.7 rating, it's extremely boring!! Finding good writers these days is a real problem and you won't find them at The Boys either! Most of the characters especially in ""the boys"" are like cockroaches, they can't be killed otherwise they are very boring, empty and very annoying. I've only seen season 1 which is enough to know it's not going to get any better either. This show is painfully bad, ""the boys"" are kind of Mary Sue types get away with everything, while the ""superheroes"" suffer or make dumb mistakes all the time, the story makes no sense, everything is very predictable!, made for empty simple souls who have nothing to do in life anyway. Again I really have no idea why anyone likes this or where the 8.7 came from because this series is garbadge and I don't recommend it to anyone either. A waste of your time!"

1.0,6 December 2023,"The major problem with this show for me, is PACING. Every episode is almost an hour, MOST of the duration are dialogue scenes that are pointless, dragged on and tension-less. Almost feel like filler scenes, they probably are. The show has a flexible good plot that could open the way for a lot of tension packed sequences, I wish the writers would have taken advantage of that, but unfortunately thats only 10% of the show. It's that 10% that keeps me watching waiting for them to happen.

If you do not mind slow-burn, monotone pacing that spikes every now and then but still revolves around an interesting plot and some interesting characters then this show may be for you.

If you are searching for shows like Breaking Bad, GoT, Money Heist, Squid Game, those kind of shows that have great pacing and non stop tension, then you may regret watching this show if you are actually able to continue watching it.

Good Plot, some Interesting Characters, Terrible Pacing !"

The story line is horrible, the acting is ""not there"" . This is the same old same old superhero show (i watch superhero shows) with a different spin... boring boring and more boring.

4.0,21 July 2024,"I've been following the show from the start and found it amazing, however the political leans ruined it. Very obvious push to influence viewers to adhere to a certain ""world view"", and moreover, they tried to amplify stances for those that are less decided on their political views, seemingly as an actual push to manipulate younger viewers to vote in a certain way. I find it incorrigible that these rich producers can use entertainment media to manipulate morons that lack basic intelligence and critical thinking. Again, the show is entertaining, but it's very obvious to us older guys/girls that have some experience under our hood that this is just another blob of baby-food to stuff into the mouths of the latest generation of moronic, self-entitled seedlings."

Scenes are too bloody and terrible. So is it me or this is now the general trend of what is it to be ""cool"" on TV? To show some nudity and hear cursing language all time? Is this modern America is all about? To create Superheroes, then to distort the opposite image of them with such a TV barbarity? Then some people think this is one the best shows of 2019 and henceforth? I just now realized why the covid came quickly. Perhaps the Boys is the main reason, besides of course Trump presidency!"
2.0,22 April 2021,"The first series was great. Unapologetic, ruthless and devoid of political intent. It was refreshing to see Hollywood back something like this - super hero's that displayed more realistic Human traits like jealousy and callous rage.

And then Series 2 came along and all of a sudden there were these tiresome political platitudes seeping in. It was like new writers had come in, but I'm inclined to say it was actually planned to hook us in and then feed us what we actually expect to see in a Marvel film.

Looking back, the writing was actually on the wall where ""The Boys"" slowly started to become ""The Boys and Girls"". But you may be wondering what clichés I am now talking about. No offence, but if you can't see them, then it is already too late for your tired and clumsy saturated mind that is afraid to actually express itself.

A nazi super hero at the forefront? Check.

A sickly Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez lookalike politician who is woke? Check - and of course ""The Boys and Girls"" look pathetic in her midst.

Homelander now dating the nazi superhero and now a racist himself? Check

The introduction of carefully placed symbols deliberately included to evoke feelings of justice, like Homelander's painting on the side of a barn with his cape replaced with the confederacy flag? Check. This is despite him being mates with A-Train...a black man.

Anti white racist scriptwriting? Check - here is an example of this ""I can't lash out some aging entitled maniac, that's a white mans luxury"" - what? This is said by one of the richest and powerful men in the series lol. Pathetic.

They should have stuck to what they started with. The first series was legitimately fantastic, with a less politically motivated storyline, which at the end of the day - when I want to watch entertainment, I want to be entertained - not see a slow burn transition from A-Grade Hollywood, to Fail Grade Hollywoke."
4.0,14 March 2022,"They say sex sells, well it doesn't sell in my eyes. Just another boring mindless tv show that tries to hard, suppose to be a action show, with some stupid humor and every episode someone is either having sex or trying too or displaying women in ungodly ways.

1.0,21 July 2022,"Whilst the premise of The Boys is one full of all kinds of possibilities, the execution is truly offensive. The characters are all interesting with Homelander being the best of the bunch and is a true dangerous psychopath. The main problem is, is that The Boys is full of all kinds of completely unnecessary blasphemy, perversion, swearing and gore. You would not want the people who contributed to this anywhere near your family and especially not near your children - the danger would be immense. It's obvious by the near endless repetition of Jesus' name as an expletive, that the creators of The Boys detest him, and in doing so detest the good, the beautiful and the true. Their cowardness and mockery earn a 1 out of 10 from me, and I would advise everyone with a shred of goodness to stay away from all of Amazon's offerings until they reign in their contempt for God's son."

2.0,18 January 2020,"It's pretty much all in the title, I loved the comic and I loved how most of the orginal material was correctly and skillfully portrayed in the serie. Except they changed (Annie) or omitted the right amount of content (for example on Maeve) so that they could do the maximum fanservice possible to all the feminists out there (who pretty much anyone hates). And the sad thing is that they didn't need any of that: the original material was well thought enough to bring the right message. But no, that wasn't enough and they had to degrade the original material more. What a shame."
4.0,19 June 2022,"I think this could work better as a film or at max, 2 seasons, wrapping up then.

The first season is mostly worth watching because of the different take on superhero fiction, good casting, and there is an okay balance between light hearted/humor and dark (though progressively too much of the latter as it goes on). There also is some sense of optimism like there is a chance this can all work out. And behind all of it is a critique of the current state of the US in terms of political and social divisions, power (corporate and government), exploitative historical events, etc.

It starts getting harder to watch towards the end of the first season and basically continues like that in the next season but even more disturbing, weird, hopeless, depressing, and more focus on Homelander while also feeling monotonous.

They just reveal a bit more of the story behind everything each episode to keep you watching while the same pattern plays out repeatedly: cat and mouse chase, extremely gruesome horror-film-esque scenes particularly with Supes, character conflicts within both the 7 and the Boys, reminding us the mostly bad characters have sympathetic flaws and the good characters have bad sides and some are closer to in between, and that the Vought corporation and its founders and leaders are really the main villain (like the Palpatine character in Star Wars), though their creations sometimes go outside the limitations they try to keep them within.

Some of the easy initial comic relief elements lose their effectiveness by the end of the first season. Yes, Homelander looks and sounds funny but by the end of the first season, that goofy side doesn't balance out the insane mass murderer, bully, stalker, and abuser aspiring for world power anymore. Same with A-Train and Stormfront. The comic relief of Deep's scenes gets old quickly, a lot of it is more like nightmare fuel and not funny."
2.0,5 June 2022,"S3, E1, Did you guys really need to go there with Termite? That's a much too sensitive topic if you know what I mean. I had to curl up into a fetal position to protect my sensitive parts. I almost had to shut it off, and that's a pity because The Boys is top 10 of all time best TV show. Is all the dismemberment and exploded meat really necessary to get across the excellent basis for the story and characters here? Yes, No? I'm not sure I can keep watching. It's like the producers are actually trying to see how many people they can repel."

4.0,10 September 2020,I thought we were past this crap. We don't pay for the service to have this done to us. Apparently it was the producer's idea and Amazon was against it.

I love the series but they are slowly destroying it.

Would have been better to end the series with season 3 but they had to milk it more.

Season 3 had an interesting script but they ruined it with the last episode, they built the whole plot just so that in the last episode we are again where we started. Lovely."
4.0,21 November 2019,"This could have been really good. It's a very creative premise with interesting characters. But not only does the language, sexuality and violence push the limits on what's morally acceptable, it panders to the hate that pervades the anti-Christian community. It's as though the producers drove around to Chick-fil-A protests, asked ""Who hates Christians?"" and signed up the most vehement responders as script writers. The writers clearly knew what they despised about the Christian faith throwing in every cliche they knew to include. They tried so hard, the lines written for Christian characters sound nothing like the way Christians talk. Every Christian character is purposefully a degenerate human being. Episode 5, ""Good for the Soul"" was the last straw for me. It even stoops low enough to make fun/light of an individual's choice to be baptized."

2.0,6 June 2022,"This show used to be so interesting, and pretty funny and as the seasons have gone the writers/producers and directors have just been pushing the envelope!

5.0,12 July 2022,Why they had to drag this story for the ending to be the way it is? Soldier Boy was a little levelheaded character than Homelander. All that protection from Butcher because he promised his wife so the rape seed can high five the rapist? I like super soldier's manly remarks I don't think soldier boy is worst than homelander. I honest was going to stop watching this show but Jensen previously acted as Dean Winchester was on this third season was one of the actors so I gave it a shot and got disappointed.

5.0,8 July 2022,"I really liked the concept of The Boys. Having superheroes as being the villains behind an evil corporation seems like an edgy take on the overplayed superhero genre and I thought there was a lot of potential there. Even the vulgarity of the show added a lot of novelty and as someone who enjoyed shows like South Park, I wasn't opposed to the vulgarity of it.

But the thing about being edgy and vulgar is that you have to be clever with how you use it either to emphasize a point or help connect it to a story line or it becomes very childish and cheap. The problem is after season 2 and 3 they did exactly that where it becomes a cheap parlor trick to try to keep audience entertained instead of using it to drive an element in the storyline.

Also the love storyline.... childish and underdeveloped."
1.0,27 July 2019,"This show is interestingly written. It doesn't explain how the world is full of people with super powers, but a team of seven owned by a big corporation are secretly corrupt. There's nothing heroic about their character and a team of vigilantes is looking to bring them down. In episode 5 the writers wanted to work in their Anti-Christian bias and have the heros go to an event meant to mimic a modern-day big tent revival or camp meeting where the show mocks evangelical Christianity. If you're a believer, don't watch this. This is just Hollywood not only objecting to our faith, but overtly making fun of us."

1.0,29 June 2022,"The Boys is absolutely vile. This is why the ordinary world despises Hollywood and America. Shows like this are a window into the minds of some truly sick creatures. Agreeably sliding downwards into a stinking, heaving sewer isn't creative or witty. Making excuses just so you can puke out your warped perversions onto the film screen isn't any sort of accomplishment other than degrading oneself and those who partake of said sick offering. Having got as far as episode 6 of season 3 I am now in for the full ride, just so I can gauge the true level of degeneracy that went into this cinematic faeces and then to warn others not to even contemplate degrading themselves by watching it. None of the perversion and blasphemy is even necessary - it's simply that this is what America and the western world has become.

The more bile like this that Hollywood churns out then the more people will reject you & the more people detest you, and the more people will encourage everybody else to reject and revile you too."
4.0,5 March 2023,
1.0,24 August 2019,"This series has a promising concept and this is why people would see it as a potential binge watch . Not more than one episode the viewer would be able to perceive the truth of episodes full of boring dialogues , incessant overacting casts and a poorly performing story line. All the hype that gets created in your mind gets diminished exponentially coz of the lackluster story. Boys tries to fit in all the contemporary topics that could make a better world but the viewers aren't there to have a soul change in a fictional story involving characters full of crisis . It might be denigrating to say what I mentioned in the above lines but then a story needs a good back bone to rely on which the Boys never provides."
5.0,27 January 2024,Not sure how no one sees this is pretty much a bootleg version of marvel. It is similar to brightburn where you take the hero's people admire and make them into characters who you would despise. Then you have the good guys just like marvel to try and save the world from these depraved characters. Watched 30 min of one episode and said yea this is trash and moved on to something else. There are enough shows out there on the same theme but are able to display it better without the cliche lines and actions of the evil superhero's. So if you want to watch gore and a stupid script by all means waste your time but fair warning this is not anything different from what's out there.
3.0,29 July 2019,"I feel that American filmmakers, for lack of a better expression, have no balls. There was such a great material in the comic book, which clearly I'm a big fan of, and they never used the any of the good or pivotal parts. Why is butcher's wife still alive and the baby too. If they had the courage to film the baby popping out of her stomach and him beating it to death with a Lamp like in the book I'd have more respect for the show. Where is superhero team teenage kicks being mauled by the boys? Where is Terror the dog? Why are the boys all weak instead of injected with V?

They dumb it down and make the characters less excessive than the comic book. I hate when that happens. At least in the movie Sin City they kept true to the comic in every aspect. I would have liked some sort of semblance to this with the boys.

I had such high hopes for this show and they completely let me down. I kind of had a feeling this would happen because the same people that did the boys did the show preacher and that was a failure to. Garth Ennis writes pure gold and when you try to change it, you will fail.

Going forward I hope they add much more violence and brutality and try to beat the comic in terms of mayhem because this was weak and soft."
1.0,20 June 2022,It's really sad to see the show have a need to bring their leftist political views into what was a very good show. Now it's barely watchable. This sad part is that they don't see themselves in any of the same things they are trying to smear others with. I would ask them to hold up a mirror and become truly a takedown of all the systems of power that hold the rest of us down but they can't. They might not get invited to the next Hollywood party. Sad and pathetic.
1.0,3 July 2022,"I don't understand why people enjoy this horrendous show. I mean, we have enough problems with this oppressive world because quite frankly I think it's time for Hollywood to start listening to what individuals actually want instead of making dark and disgusting things on TV."

1.0,29 April 2021,"Starting out the show seemed pretty cool, but I noticed a pattern with the episodes each one of them shows the men to be either uncaring sociopaths, single minded or idiots, while the women are portrayed as morally conflicted or a naive Mary Sue its too on the nose with its gender politics, there is no nuance to the characters. Putting it simply if its a male character, they have the depth of a puddle, with female characters they are superpowered flawless heroines with attitude got so cringe inducing I couldn't stomach the last few episodes. When did bashing a single gender become entertainment?"
1.0,14 June 2022,"It started off too good and I was too excited as well as eagerly waited for season 2. Would have rated it 8 but there is too much unnecessary graphic violence. This starts in season 2 and keeps on increasing right from the first episode. Infact too much to the point that I have stopped watching it. For me, the directors have ruined the series. Were season 1 ratings low that they had to do this?"
3.0,13 June 2022,"So , I have been watching the show. I enjoy the great directing and good picture. Also, the premise is a true breath of fresh air. Company of super heroes goes corrupt and basically rules the world. Heroes are the new celebrities and they are as unethical and as uneducated as them.

Now, to the sad part:
The dialogues are terrible. They basically cover the lack of quality with profanity.


Every romance in the movie is cringe-worthy. They reek of self pity and overly expressed emotions that are not genuine. One wants the girl but the girl is basically miserable and rejects him. The other is just hurt and they want to show us that it is a tough nut to crack because she was hurt and will not let anyone near her. Half of the time I can not look at the screen when french and Kimiko interact. Jesus!




Finally, I will have to admit that Homelander is a great villain. Powerful, evil, controlling, with an interesting story. Well done. I am just really disappointed by the dialogue. The plot is fine, but considering that I can hardly watch some of the scenes due to the issues mentioned above, I am not sure if I am keep watching. Anyway, we see."
2.0,27 July 2019,"This series is great and like nothing I've ever seen before. I'm on episode 6 and can't get enough. It is cast well, produced well and just very well done. It's very original, gory, love the bad language and sexuality. Not what you want your little kids to see but it's okay to have an adult focused series! It seems like it represents true corporation and government motives. They try to act like they care but really only serve themselves. I'm picky and get bored quickly but really like this show. If you like dark and edgy... definitely give this show a chance. You won't be disappointed!"

With its over-the-top violence and ignorant characters, I can see what they're going for, but God, it is SO bad. After the first season, I just couldn't keep watching the train wreck. Sorry, no."
4.0,10 June 2022,"Started out so strong and I loved the first season. Second season was not bad but not great either. Thinking maybe they coming back stronger on the third. Boy I was wrong. Don't get it. It's was fun when superheroes use their strength or what ever they are good at the wrong way. Someone is bound to use it the wrong way but pretend they are good. But third season it's just psychopathic. Just creepy. Of course it's political. Top dog can do whatever they want or you life goes down. This is not entertainment and I'm guessing it's the last season. I'm won't se it anyway. Another show that's starts good, getting people to like it just so they can politicise you. Haven't worked so far, when are they going to learn."
4.0,22 May 2021,"This is a great series if you enjoy predictable story lines with gratuitous events and mediocre acting. While I will admit the premise is a great starting point - it's all downhill from there. One would have to think long and hard to come up with a show with more clichés than this gem. It checks all of the right boxes for the easily amused masses, however, substantively, creatively, and objectively it is just poor. Poor writing, poor acting, editing, effects, and production."

2.0,12 August 2022,Story progression and character development throughout the season could have been done in 2 episodes. Instead they dragged it out with absolute rubbish. The more outrageous the better...right?...wrong...series tipped into the ridiculous and became unwatchable.
5.0,24 June 2022,"So, how do you make a comic book and TV show for psychos and sociopaths that upholds sadism and bigotry? Oh, that's easy. You make it a dark comedy and say that you're actually (wink, wink) satirizing comic books and not (wink, wink) endorsing the villainy. That way, you can get away with an evil Nazi poster child as the most charismatic character -- you're not celebrating him or his attitudes (wink, wink) but showing how awful such people are (wink, wink) in this world.

See, the obvious way to prove this true or not is to simply look for some sort of moral retribution. No, not in the very last episode that (wink, wink) shows everything is an illustration of satire, but throughout. That's just Drama 101. But this show lacks exactly that.

Now, if you're into all that -- and the creators of the show obviously are -- then this is for you. If not, you'll just roll your eyes at the juvenilia. Fart."
5.0,11 June 2022,"Only just started watching the show and the first few episodes were great then it started to die down a lot and get too political, slow and boring. There was a couple of laughs but I would hardly put it in the comedy genre but that's probably me being British as the yanks comedy is rather dull, slow and hardly amusing but this has always been the case. I'll try getting into season two but as others here have said the show gets worse. Oh dear."
2.0,15 February 2024,"I just finished episode 4 of the 1st season and decided to give it one star for several reasons. I watched the first episode thinking there is some good idea behind the show. Antiheroes always seem like an interesting topic. Then it's just gotten worse and I started watching it on 1.2 speed. It's just sooo slow, jokes are lame and childish, plot has little or no sense, there's no character development and some if not most of the characters are simply annoying.

Gonna finish the 1st season on an even higher pace hoping it will develop in some other direction. If I don't edit the comment don't even bother starting watching it!"

1.0,16 November 2020,"This show is horrible. I can deal with the occasional F bomb, the violence and gritty anti hero stuff but this show is overboard. There's not really any character to like or relate to. The use of profanity makes you think aliens wrote the script after listening to toxic high schoolers in a game lobby. Seriously, I can't watch this garbage. There is nothing redemptive or honorable as there is in other anti hero favorites like Watchmen. At least in that, they offset character deficiencies with desire to do good, though from different vantage points of what is in fact the highest good. Nobody is as amoral as the characters in this show."
3.0,21 September 2022,"Its sad how people are rating this one, actually there is no character development at an extent where you can be amazed and invested. The boys nor the heroes develop to a level where they can entertain us , there is no dept at all in any characters. I have somehow finished it but nothing amazed me or entertained it was nothing like what i have expected. Not magical it dosent boost your dopamine at any point in the series there are three seasons none of the episode was awesome enough to make you amazed , not even good for kids as there is blood everywhere and thats a little interesting part , the way they blow humans. I am disappointed."

1.0,23 August 2021,"The show and original comic offered deep critiques of American corporate capitalism as a vehicle to subvert the concept of a superhero. Well done.

Do Americans nevertheless also see how that equally speaks to American corporate news AND to Hollywood/TV film productions - including this very show? The unrelenting effort to propagandize to the viewers, to misrepresent the underlying interests of the content producers, and the vitriolic hatred espoused by those who profess to be tolerant (to ""go high when they go low"")?

Look how the writers and producers co-opted the original comic to advance a 2020 election agenda (and to flagrantly demonize ""the other""). Now that ""order has been restored"" in American politics, will the writers and producers allow the comic book story to return to the surface? Will they continue to use it as a cheap veneer to keep telling the rest of the world how to live and structure our societies, just as their national government does?"

1.0,16 December 2020,"Ugh. Haven't read the source material but don't need to in order to call this out for what it is: garbage that substitutes immaturity and violence for a story or characters worth caring about. Like another crap show from years back called True Blood, this one wastes a cool concept on mostly unlikeable characters, increasingly extreme violence (oh, how edgy!), and overall empty entertainment for folks who either want to turn off their brains for awhile (nothing wrong with that) or who don't care about quality.

This one definitely brings out the Ignatius J Reilly in me.

Here's hoping that comics that tell a great story (East of West, Saga, Lazarus) are eventually given a good TV adaptation so we have more than crap like this to choose from."
5.0,23 September 2021,"So, to explain the title, this show is a great show about the question ""what is superpowers existed?"" answered realistically. So, its about government corruption, evil celebrity heros powered by corporations, deceit and twists. That part is amazing. However, a lot of the show is downright trying to be degenerate or gross, not for humor, drama, or entertainments sake, but just for 0 reason, not adding to the plot. I wont spoil anything, but alot of the show revolves around relationship drama as well, which isnt so bad. Its very preachy. Every part of the show has nonstop propaganda being thrown at you, and boy is it biased to one side. I wouldnt mind a few jokes or points but alot of it is just constant whining without a point. It seems like the writers were really trying to vent by crying about anything political they can. In this year it can get annoying when every single tv show, movie, and creation from the media agree on every single issue down the list, theres no more creativity. Aside from it the storyline really is great, and ive been told by many the comic is way better. I now have that, so ill give it a try."
4.0,9 June 2022,Far from the comics. They went for spectacle and shock value over actual quality or entertainment. Sprinkled heavily with the typical woke garbage.

1.0,14 October 2022,"The only reason why I'm giving it a 3.5-3.75 about is because of the season finales of each three seasons (especially season 2). Otherwise I would give it a half a star review for these reasons: there's no character development whatsoever, totally lame and weak writing, and even worse fighting scenes. There's hardly any fighting scenes and whenever there is it ends fast. Butcher is the worst character, nothing good about him. I only watched it for Hughie and Annie but in season 3 Hughie became one of the worst until the very end. Another reason is because Jensen Ackles was in season 3, but his character wasn't the greatest even as a bad guy. And if course everybody can agree Homelander is the worst too (but surprisingly not that bad of a bad guy, especially the second and third seasons)."
1.0,4 August 2019,"I hope the non stop gore keeps going.

The nowadays cliche critique to america s policy is somehow outdated but the series just not focus on that what saves it.

But if want pure escapism then buckle up, because you're definitely NOT in Kansas anymore! I actually think this a 7. But I wanted to draw your attention to the point I was trying to make.

5.0,11 September 2024,"Repeated scenes of: intimate and perverse sexual acts, massive amounts of wanton violence and an orgy of gun violence, while folding these themes being related to Christian values and leaders make this series unwatchable. Super Heroes are by definition roll models for our young gullible children; so when a network produces a Super Hero themed series it goes without saying the target audience is children or family entertainment. This series target audience is Peter Pan adults that live in a fantasy world. The explicit sexual scenes' involving same sex partners, aqua mammals and full frontal nudity displaying exaggerated genitals is not for family viewing being offensive to the majority of adults and parents. The repeated inferences to religion are in bad taste and offensive to the faithful who live their lives according to their beliefs. In short the series is not family entertainment using the Super Hero theme to insult and offend the Christian Jewish values that represent the majority of the Untied States. Using the flag of the United States as the cape design of the Super Anti-American hero, ""HomeLander""who is a disturbed violent adult who suffers from childish tantrums and uses ultra violence in anger against anyone who disagrees with his leadership, sums up the perverted overall theme of this wanton effort of ANTI-AMERICAN leftist garbage."
5.0,29 July 2019,"Well so much potential the first episode was great and then bogged down by slow drama obviously rushed and poorly written and done on the cheap, although it does have its moments and it tries hard the cheapness and rushed writing comes through. The original trailer looked great made you think that a band of misfits were going to get payback and kill bad super heroes or ""Sups"" and so much great adventure could come from this storyline but in 8 episodes only 1 ""Sup"" is killed, so for the next 7 episodes it just flounders around in this pointless drama with a tiny bit of comedy and suspense mixed in. Would work good as a movie but fails to hit the mark as a series also the dreadful season final ending was obviously written while filming with no thought of how comically trashy it ended. Basically its Just a quickly made show to fill the slot and I presume we will see a lot more of this tacky stream tv series to fill the binge culture of todays viewers."
3.0,29 July 2019,"One would think that a series about super heroes would be great entertainment for the whole family. This show is about everything you DON'T want your children to see. Perverted sex scenes. Every other word is an F-bomb of some form or another. This show had a lot of potential with great actors and lots of action. Too bad Unholy Hollywood has to keep pushing the envelope with disgusting immoral tv and movies.

I wonder if mr bezos screens any of this crap his network is pushing on Amazon viewers.

I watched 2-1/2 episodes and pulled the plug. I'm not really a prude. But enough is enough!!👎

End of rant👎👎👎"
1.0,17 October 2020,"I've been disappointed with shows that start off so new and different and really have something to then come back and disappoint, the latest being the abysmal second season of umbrella academy. I binged watched the boys 2 in two nights, being excited to watch it after episode 4 I just felt something I'd not felt watching a show for ages, I was just bored, I wasn't into it, just didn't get an ounce of enjoyment or emotion or excitement from more than the odd moment.

Think I realised there's just no good characters, sure all have moments and or qualities but overall they're just kinda dull, none of the 7 feel special, everything was predictable and it was moving painfully slowly. I thought the acting was weaker, homelander, strange just the constant grimace I just didn't enjoy his twisted character as it had no range. The rest were merely ok or way less important. Some moments were cool but that was normally the special cgi moments, in terms of story, character arcs and show quality this was a long boring slog to a predictable outcome.

I fully get high scores for the first season and that love may inflate enjoyment of 2 but for me it was a colossal waste of time."

With a 8+ rating I expected so very much more, but I can only assume the majority of these high ratings are by viewers of a younger demographic, who are perhaps are the target group - they're easier to please with this kind of nonsense.

The biggest problem I have with this series is that it just tries far too hard to impress. It tries too hard to be cool, tries too hard to shock & offend, tries too hard to be relevant and tries too hard to be have a storyline that makes much sense.

The acting isn't bad, other than the annoying Billy Butcher (Karl Urban) character, who the script writers have totally missed the mark portraying the gruff, foul mouthed Englishman stereotype.

I tried to finish at least a full season, but by eps 5, I was done. Maybe I'll give the comic a go, I think they'll be far less yawning."

5.0,26 December 2022,"The Boys is one of the worst superhero shows i have ever seen. The concept of the movie might be one thing, but sadly there is one big thing in this series that breaks everything. The show is not for kids and i am totally ok with that. What totally destroys this so called show, and this is not the only one either: useless, inappropiate and unecessary sex scenes. Seriously? Wyo does everything today have this kind of useless piece of s***!? This breaks everything and it seems like people are focusing more on this than the actual story of the series. This get the lowest score on my book and thats it."
2.0,29 July 2024,"I got addicted to it since S1E1. You probably read a lot of positive comments and I agree with many of them. But let me here focus on the negative side of The Boys: 1- Too much anti-American, as if the US is a big lie.

2- Too much anti-christian, and promoting atheism.

3- Disgusting violence towards the human body. I am just worried about the sanity of young adults who watches this series.

But, despise all this, I am old enough to differentiate right from wrong and so I continue watching. In fact, I became a fan of Homelander, and I want him to win. On the contrary, I started hating Starlight in Season 4.

Regarding other characters, Butcher is exceptional, while Kimiko is a pain in the neck."

2.0,4 September 2022,"Started off really strong. Good character development, strong storyline, very little dull moments. Season 2 had a lot of boring and drawn out scenes. Worse is they spent those moments filling it with wokeness. Quips about white men, female and black oppression, etc. None of it to support or further the plot or character development, just there to get points. I don't get why the entertainment industry thinks anyone wants or needs to have this in their shows and movies. Focus on what matters and maybe the show's quality would stay consistent. I'm only 2 episodes into season 3, so we'll see if this season is better. Already some woke nonsense, which I can overlook as long as it doesn't contribute to any sort of quality decline."

Jack Sparrow chewing scenery as hard as he can while stupidly waxing poetic about the Spice Girls----It seems like someone got really high and thought ""Hmmm, What's funny? what's shocking?---Oh I know add more blood!""--------There are great performances from all of the actors, Shue, Starr, Quaid, and yes, Urban for what it's worth...But as the largest name on the marquee, His character's just annoyingly closed off and one dimensional..... basically bullet proof because of plot armor.....(oh and he can apparently sneak into ANY ROOM at ANY TIME undetected? please...).....The series as a whole plays a little like ""Sin City"" with it's tropes out front and big dumb ideas...(modern fame, the brainwashing of society, by the government, the Christian right, the corporations...) --- It owes a great deal to ""Watchmen"" of course........ the story drags on for 8 hours....and It's STILL not over........Sure, a couple things get light shed on them by episode 8.......and yes, Homelander as a character is terrifying in his own way...but there's a whole lotta cringe and not enough ""Super""-----Producing comic book hero stories is no longer acceptable as a ""cut and paste "" affair after the brilliance of the MCU in the last few years."
3.0,5 July 2022,"Despite the show's attempts to seem like a parody of Marvel, with a more intricate and deeper storyline, all it ends up being is another moronic mainstream series that attributes all the characters a history of psychological illness and tells the story in a distorted world (obviously referring to American society).

As a conclusion: You can judge the authors by the idea and by the result. The idea is great, but the result is what you always get lately with these kinds of series. Disappointed."

Today, after watching the latest two episodes of stranger things and with nothing else to watch I gave it another opportunity and I started watching the second season.

My goodness, it's even more lame than the first.

When you see a brilliant series like ""Last man on earth"" being cancelled and this one reaching its third season you say to yourself, the end is nigh."

5.0,20 October 2020,"What's all this hype about ? If you're a guy with sane mediocre standards at the very least you'd either burden yourself like I did or drop it from the get-go. Season 1 was good on its own, but then everybody was talking about Season 2 and I said, alright ? Maybe give it a chance? Guess what, Kudos to Homelander for having saved this show.

This series went wrong in so many ways. I understand it wanted to take its own endeavor in the ""supe"" department but it fell flat miserably. The plot in the first season was loud and clear, it was fun and somewhat unpredictable at parts. But that's evident provided that the show did its best to sell. Second Season however, ""butchered"" every aspect. Take for instance the terrible dialogue which was already a flaw but then turned into teen chattering in the second season (I can't count how many times the word c*nt has been mentioned). So many insults it takes half the dialogue literally, and every response to any action is either blackmail full of insults or compliments full of insults.

Dialogue wasn't the only ill dog, even the character writing was so terrible. In the first season we actually cared about the main characters but in the second season it's thrown out the window, with the lens focused only on the plot which was, by the way, all over the place.

Butcher became a very annoying character written so poorly I yawned during every scene of his (He had so much potential, the casting actor did great but he's no culprit of the crime the writers have done of him).

Slowly moving towards the finale we expected something huge but well, it failed miserably. What can I say ? This hype is wrong. The only thing that saved the show is Homelander (both his character and the actor), and I kept on watching just for Homelander.

The show did get it right only a few times, countable on a hand's fingers. Sometimes they go extreme lengths to create the ""wow"" factor which is a cliché in itself. So either take the risk of watching this, perhaps you'll like it like the majority seemingly do, or be blown off with disappointment only a season later.

I am gonna give some credits to Starlight's actor, you rocked. Everything else was just uncomfortably misplaced I couldn't bear it.

Bad Humor (Cheesy, full of insults, feels like teen talk), Bad Writing (Feels so fabricated), Bad Dialogue (Written by an amateur?), Bad Plot (Going nowhere despite the potential ?), Bad Characters (Bad Character Development, Bad Character Backstory and even bad character management, except for Homelander which was their one and only trump card)

Season 1 is fine (7/10) Season 2 is a frowning 2.

Just watch the first season and drop the rest, for your own sake."

1.0,15 May 2021,"I haven't read the comic but I don't think it is possible that it is as badly written as this. The first chapter of the first season was great, with a great idea but by the end of it, it left me the feeling that they were going episode by episode, it started to not make sense. It was at least entertaining.

Then came season 2, it is so boring, full of filler scenes and every situation is resolved in the most stupid and lazy way. They are underestimating their audience. What a waist of time."
1.0,25 September 2020,"Billy Butcher is a one dimensional boring toxic male. Just meant to create chaos wherever he goes. But it's predictable and boring. Every scene he's in feels like it lasts a thousand years. I keep hoping he gets killed even though I know he doesn't in the comic. Why is he written so poorly? And the crap that they give this actor to say, he can't sell."
5.0,30 October 2020,"Fantastic original idea that should of been a movie. This show is painful to watch because at times because of it. They stretch out the just dialogue scenes to fill a episode. Acting is great except for the huey guy is terrible but I understand why they cast him as he is the perfect example of the 20 something nerdy white male target audience they are going for. It's obviously not shot in New York. Literally first shot of the series you can tell by the lighting, street poles, people, traffic, skyline that its Toronto. The cgi is just too much, even some simple room shots they added glossy furniture. I just think this story would of come across a lot more powerful if it was a movie instead of a TV show. They could of focused on continuity, practical effects and actually shot in New York, something to be proud of. Unfortunately they went with ""keep them watching"" instead to put a couple more bucks in Mr.Bezos pocket."
5.0,14 June 2022,"The way this show heading AMAZON PRIME is in no intention to move story ahead cause they don't know what to do next so dragging one of the best shows.

4.0,17 May 2022,"There is a good show here, it is interesting to have an exploration of the negatives of Sups, but the storyline and exploration of this is unfortunately, for me, overshadowed by graphic violence and gritty-ness, taking front and centre over the story and characters."
1.0,9 November 2020,"Suuuucks. Such derivative acting. Also, this show has few entertaining sequences mixed into a mess of boring banter. I think the hype is simply a product of how calloused we've become to violence and of how ridiculously gory some scenes are."
5.0,9 December 2020,"... I am not watching super hero movies because I don't want to be confronted with problems, but see them solved. A funny, feel good, couple hours. Sure, obviously this series has followers, but than I don't watch horror or vampire or never dead movies either. This is just as much garbage. So - if you are like me - and you like and dislike the same types of movie, if the first scene puts you off as much as it does me, where a super hero acts neither as having super powers, nor like a hero, than spare yourself the rest. I started it three times ... but now, after the first 20 min, I gave up. Ebert says the first episode is the best and downhill from there ... geeez ... if that is the best, I really don't want to see the rest."

Not only was it disgusting, demeaning, and volger it is repetitive and pointless. It really changed my opinion of Ackles to where I don't want to watch anything with him in it....

5.0,8 September 2020,"Love the premise that superheroes would really be supervillains. This would be one of my favorite shows, except that it keeps trotting out a completely irrelevant anti-religious message that does nothing whatsoever to advance the story. There were only 8 episodes in season 1, and they wasted one of them on a ""preachy"" subplot about how Starlight used to be a Christian but now she knows that no one can really know what God is like. That was annoying from a creative perspective, because it made no sense. But then they doubled-down on it in the first episode of season 2 by apparently turning her into an atheist so that she can slip into another completely irrelevant monologue about ""Bible camp"" and how there is no God and her parents lied to her for her whole childhood. It's a really contrived loss-of-faith moment that I'm sure resolves with some kind of existential redemption later, but I had to stop watching cuz I was sick of cringing. It's almost like the writers are using this show as therapy to exorcise their baggage about Christianity. Hard to believe that in 2020 it's okay to suggest that all Christians are ultra-right hippie-cultists, assuming that none of them would be completely normal people who would watch this show. Ironically, they try to make it ambiguous whether or not the middle-eastern terrorist McGuffins are Islamic, but devote so much time an energy to a ridiculous caricature of Christians. I guess there's a little PC-hypocrisy in all of us. Go watch Daredevil or Boss if you want to see a show where the fact that Christians exist actually makes the story more interesting instead of unwatchable."

Fortunately, the tongue in cheek violence with gags, Butcher's foul mouth and his awful British accent are still keeping me watching!"
5.0,24 July 2022,"Just so everyone knows, The Boys comic book is written and made by people who have openly admitted to hating superheroes, and the point of the book was to be a satire and deconstruction of the genre.

I am a hardcore superhero fan, I've been one all my life. But during my childhood, or whenever I was out in public wearing a Spider-Man shirt (or something like that) I never once felt save or secure about myself, because i was afraid of the ridicule, scorn, mockery, and bullying that regular people who do love and enjoy escapist fiction face from people who love to make people feel inferior, lonely, and like an outcast, simply because I like something.

Superheroes, (and nerd culture in general), has been portrayed in a hurtful depiction for too long, that no one feels safe to be who they are because of some angry, mean, rotten, bully who thinks their smarter, more adult, wiser, and are so progressive every time they mock you and others. That to mean is the message and intent I get from both the comic and this show.

People like to stereotype superheroes as an male adolescent power fantasy. While there is certainly nothing wrong with that. We often forget that Superheroes have evolved as a genre. Granted it took forever for a Wonder Woman movie to get made, and a lot of the respected publishers of Superhero comics don't promote their books as they should be for a general audience, but in the end it doesn't matter, so long as the product is good, and is about being a hero with powers and abilities, and willing to stand up for what is right.

We live in a world today, where violent, terrible, unrepentant people with real power, use it to commit atrocities in the name of selfishness, greed, and everything evil.

Superheroes are characters meant to boost morals, and inspire us to want to be better people. Costumes, symbols, superpowers, and escapist elements are good ways to draw inspiration from and use every day. I know the difference between fiction and fantasy, but what is so unbelievable and fictious about being a good person, or wanting to be a good person.

Then you have The Boys, taking a genre that is meant to be geared towards everyone, (especially little kids), and have it be bloody violent, with sexual assault, torture, rape, reinforcing demeaning social issues that inflict minorities.

I realize this show is trying to be a deconstruction of the superhero genre, but it's not. These are not heroes. These are supervillains, and supervillains are people with power who use it to do evil things.

The writer of this comic series, is very cynical and say, ""Come on, it's true to real life. I mean wouldn't anyone with that kind of power really want to use it to good and help people like you and man"".

Kindness, compassion, and decently are thing the world needs, and we will always need. People need to be reminded about that with things like superhero media, because superheroes are ultimately about kindness and decency and can inspire us.

What I find cathartic about the people who bullied me for liking escapist fiction is, those people probably never learn, or understand the meaning of empathetic or decent, and instead decided to lord that power as a way to make themselves feel large. And they could've be decent, kind, and compassionate, (everyone simply just wants to be noble and kind), but they weren't.

A little empathy, humility, and imagination, and people can be better then how they used to behave.

I don't have patience, or tolerance for shows like this. This show pushes the envelope into gross, edgy nonsense to try to win over people who already hate superheroes, or are bullies that already mock and bully people for liking superheroes, or are just people who behave with that whole shallow culture that is just so ugly and insecure that it just reinforces bullying and intolerance.

I don't know if we're ever going to live in a world where people are free to be who they are and be happy enjoying what they love and finding other people that like what they do. But shows like The Boys, just reinforce bullying, and instead depict superheroes as pedophiles who rape and kill anyone that want because they figure ""Who be stupid to want to fight me"", or have moronic and hate filled characters like bill the butcher who are overly cynical and are design to remind people that life just plainly sucks and there is nothing you can do about it, or do anything to make it better. This show is garbage, I don't even want to rate this show. Because I feel like giving it any kind of mark is just too kind."

5.0,9 September 2020,"In one episode there's TWO superheroes versus ONE superhero... who will win? Well, apparently ONE is greater than TWO in the minds of the writers of this show. It's so freeking unrealistic... in the real world, those TWO superheroes would have dispatched that single superhero so fast it would make her head spin!

And in another episode they had the opportunity to kill ANOTHER superhero, and yet the boys chose not to.... so we all know that in a future episode the superhero that they let live in this episode is going to reappear and cause more trouble for them down the line, simply because they didn't kill him in this episode... it's a massive plot-hole when the characters in your show/movie DON'T act realistically and DON'T do what a normal person would do in that same situation and it's inexcusable.

The writers of this show need to catch a wake up real quick because these plot-holes are deplorable and it'll result in people abandoning the show.... if I wanted to watch 'something flashy that's extremely unrealistic with tonnes of plot-holes' then I'd go watch Fast & Furious 8"

Superheroes genre was once felt like it was made for superhero geeks.

Then something happened. Superhero genre exploded with cartoons live action and movies. Every corporate network and production was producing and investing in superheroes whether DC, Marvel or others. This overwhelmed me. Superheroes became dark, liberal, fan service and for the general audience.

The Boys with my 2020 vision is overwhelming because it seems cliché. I've been here before. I've seen it. It's overdone.

I don't think cliché is entirely the problem. It's forcing so many superhero products all at once where you either lose interest, can't keep up and or just don't care anymore because you already know what is going to happen.

The Boys is nothing special. It's a soap opera. A super opera. Same old super drama.

Like every show it will start great and then end bad.

Verdict: As of 2020 if you have seen 1 superhero show. You've seen it all. Pass. There is no point in watching this redundant hash."

3.0,8 September 2020,"The reason I am giving this a 3 star rating is due to the release of Season 2. I promise there are no spoilers in this review, just want others to be prepared before you start Season 2. Season 1 was great if you wanted to binge watch the entire season in one day-you could. I mean Season 1 really drew you into the series, but Season 2 is not up to my standards. When it was announced for the release of Season 2, I was excited, along with most people. But highly disappointed when only the first 3 episodes were available on Sept 4, 2020. The first episode was more than confusing, due to it not leaving off from the last episode of Season 1 right away. It doesn't tye anything from the previous season until near the end of S2 E1. There is also no recap, so you might want to watch the last episode of Season 1 before you start Season 2, if you dont remember. But don't get to into the show, Amazon is only releasing new episodes of Season 2 every Friday. Part of the reason I gave this a 3 star review. At this point I'll just wait for it to be canceled or not renewed, to watch the entire series. Other streaming platforms do not do this to their customers. I'd rather watch 3 minute ads/commercials every 5 minutes on hulu if that gets me through an entire Season. Also, I don't understand how you expect to keep people interested in this show. The whole reason for streaming platforms is for binge watching, catching up on old shows and being different from actual television. When you take away one of those elements, you get review bombed because this isn't what Amazon Prime customers expected. We were told the release of Season 2 would be 9/4/20 not PART of Season 2. This review will also be posted to Amazon."

5.0,27 July 2019,"Why they put adult content (nudity, etc.) in a show that's clearly written for the mentality of a 14 year old, is beyond me. I struggled through the first 2 episodes hoping to find some redeeming quality, but to no avail. I gave it 4 stars because the creators did a good job of entertaining the pre-teens and teens. They should have left out the adult content though."

4.0,30 December 2020,"This was one of the best shows I watched. Best Performances. best writing and dialogue. But Eventually Writers run out of Ideas. Then what do you do ? Bring the race relation in the script. White american superheroes are bunch of racists and everyone from other races is so nice. What a narrative. I can usually understand the sequels are of not that great quality but this one has really gone down the drain. Character arcs, dialogues, performances are still great in season II but story line is so full of propaganda. There are lot of plotholes too but whatever."
5.0,1 January 2021,I only watched a few episodes but found the show offenisve. I do not find sexual harrasement or sexism entertaining. I would not reccomend this.
2.0,14 August 2019,"If you really tried to make a evil justice League movie as bad as possible you'd end up with this. Poor production, way lot of talented actors that were clearly given to much freedom and a lot of horrendous acting by others. Jesus Christ that was a frustrating 4 seasons of nothing but cringe."

3.0,27 July 2022,...... how many episodes and series do I need to watch? I really want to like it but just can't get through it. Giving it a 5 so I don't look like that much of a looser. I'll give it a 4th shot. Ugh! Wish we could get reply's on here. Help ;)
2.0,9 August 2019,"Based on the comic book.

This show could have been epic. Instead, it was weighted down with social identity tropes and subplots.

I do not recommend The Boys."
1.0,25 September 2022,
5.0,6 September 2019,"It really didn't help when they crammed 8 nauseating cuts in a 3-second sequence (25:45, S01E03). Personally I don't really enjoy such choppy action scenes because they kill all the fluidity. Resorting to rapid cuts indicates lackluster choreography, or at least that's the way I see it.

Otherwise I like the ideas and the message. A bit cheesy and on-the-nose but still enjoyable from time to time."
3.0,7 December 2020,"Two seasons could be accommodated in 90 min., everything else has no happening and shows stupid filling of time.

* Season 1 - repetition of the same scenes, very boring * Season 2 (watched 1,5 episodes) - repetition of the same scenes, very, very boring * Nothing happened except very annoying media personation of heroes * I recommend for ages 3 to 8 years! And I guess they give all high ratings!"

5.0,3 July 2020,The Boys 2019: Super douchebags in latex...with gangster behavior as a foundation for there motives...Please kill this show as the superdouches kill everyone else as its the super show that give franchise superheroes a bad name...If you want to see the best bits in this show you'll better-off fast forwarding each episode!
5.0,12 July 2022,
5.0,7 August 2021,The director seems to have an unhealthy fascination with blood and gore which was unnecessary for this series. It really was unfortunate could have been a brilliant series otherwise.
5.0,30 August 2019,"Although it's essentially just an 21st century update of Watchman, the pilot has some decent new ideas and is fairly well packaged - though isn't exactly amazing, and some of the writing is pretty basic.

But episode two became such a dull slog it left me clawing my eyes out in boredom.

Abandoned."
5.0,9 July 2022,
5.0,31 July 2019,I liked this better before I realized who the writer was. After the extended suffering the later seasons of Supernatural brought to it's fans - I'm not sure I'm willing to get back on that horse.
7.88,13 June 2021,"It is conceptually bad, everything is bad, the good guys are just as fantastic as regular super heroes but bad, everything that happens is bad, it is a tragedy. Have you read the comic? Well guess what it is REALLY bad. Bad things are just suposedly pleasant as if they were good things... It is like bad art. It just sucks. Watch it and hate yourself or dont."
7.88,7 December 2019,
7.88,13 June 2023,"EDIT: I've now watched the 4th season and this is a show that has completely lost its way - I won't be watching again.

The crude attempts to shock and the weak storytelling that were starting to become an issue in the third season have completely taken over.

""The Boys"" themselves were always the weakest part of the show but their story is now so boring, and their characters so contrived, that they ruin every scene they are in (and they are in the majority of them). Turning Frenchie ""gay"" (and then straightening him out again) is the most obvious example, but there are far too many to list in this review.

Homelander is still the star of the show and his anger and desire for power remains the best part of it, with Firecracker (Valorie Curry) the strongest of the new characters.

Once again it dodges a proper ending in the season finale so they can drag it out for yet another season.

I realise I've written more about the fourth season than any of the others. Trust me, I'm barely getting started. Suffice to say it jumped the shark a while ago (probably with the Black Noir origin episode in S3), and is not worth watching any more.

ORIGINAL REVIEW (rated 8/10): I love the world The Boys inhabits.

A collision between power, ambition, race, money, religion and politics. It's dark, it's satirical, it's spectacular and it's very violent.

Far and away the best scenes involve the superheroes. Anthony Starr is outstanding as Homelander, capturing his delusion and danger perfectly. There is great support on the Vought Industries side as well - particular mentions for Elizabeth Shue, Aya Cash and Colby Minifie who always make their scenes stand out.

Unfortunately ""The Boys"" - the rag-tag group of vigilantes who want to knock the ""Supes"" from their pedestal - are the weakest part of the show. Relentlessly weary and downtrodden, you get a bit bored when they are on screen, and just end up waiting for Homelander and his crew to return.

The show suffers generally from a naive view of anything outside the United States. Karl Urban (a Kiwi) plays Billy Butcher as a Cockney with a ridiculous devotion to slang that makes him come across as a Poundland Danny Dyer. Kimiko is supposedly a Japanese woman who was kidnapped and taken to the Phillipines of all places - and is introduced as a mute, which REALLY slows down every scene she is in afterwards.

The other general issue is that sometimes the dark, satirical humour tips over into silliness, destroying the tension.

Nevertheless the first two seasons are excellent with gripping finales.

The third season starts well but then seems to lose confidence in where it is going, which results in a scarcely believable ending.

Hopefully the creators get their mojo back for the fourth season (which I'm sure is coming)."

7.88,2 August 2020,"Way to many dead ends. The stretch between the sups and classic comics is atrocious. I do like the premise of the show, but come on."
7.88,7 August 2019,I tried to like this..the plot is interesting..concept is interesting.. but the direction is so idiotic and dumb and childish..too many flaws...this show deserves better a better direction.
7.88,4 August 2019,Great concept but the excessive unnecessary profanity is distracting at times. What would the world do if some superheroes actually lacked character?
7.88,8 July 2020,There isn't an original thought in a complete season. Low quality tripe.
7.88,18 April 2024,"From the first episode I found this show kind of boring. I think most people give it a high rating because it's a different take on superheroes. Superheroes are not the good guys here but is that enough to make this good? Most of it is dialogs after dialogs. There's hardly any action, which should be one of the first criterias to make a superhero show, whether the superheroes are good or bad. Most people say that it starts getting boring after season 2 but I think it just because they get over the excitement over the original concept. But I say it was boring from the first episode. Some people mentioned that there is nudity in this but I just finished episode 2 and so far all I've seen is male nudity. I don't know who they think the main audience of a show about superheroes is but that's not my thing. Anyway I gave it 3 stars because the few times when they have special effects on they are well done but I don't think I'm gonna keep watching this.

Update: I have updated my review and added 4 more stars. The rest of season 1 was better than the first 2 episodes. I still think this show should have more action, instead of all the action reserved for the last episode of the season. I think the character The Deep is completely useless and could have been left out of the show. Oh i forget he's the one the writers wanted to parade naked throughout the show."
7.88,30 June 2022,"They should call this show, ""If libs had powers"". The irony is that Homelander personifies what left wing consider to be justice. Besides the whole premise being self-defeating, the show is boring. Constant sex scenes for no reason, and people standing in rooms talking. Maybe 5 minutes of action each episode and that is usually just torture. Either the writers make this show horrible on purpose or everything that think is cool is actually kitsch."
7.88,4 September 2024,"I hope that the writing team of season 4 does not continue with messages that could be perceived as anti-Semitic. For evidence,

look at chapter 2 and the stand with the minions with a blood Star of David, and an inscription regarding world domination.

There are more examples during the show.

And in general, why involve politics in entertainment? Why does any writer think they can put negative messages into a science fiction series? Such actions only make me abandon the channel. Hoping to find good and clean content

If in season 5, there will be more signs like this, we will notice and will work to take down offensive content as much as there is if so.

,peace and love."
7.88,11 May 2021,Didn't make it through the first season. It's a lot of shock and awe. Hardly any real plot line or character development. If you enjoy shows with violence and nudity this is for you. I wanted to like it but it was just not engaging.
7.88,7 October 2019,This could have been a good show. It wasn't. Very formulaic and poor character development. 'The Boys' were generic and uninspiring. I gave it 5 stars because I just got an oled tv and it looked really cool in hdr. Would not watch a second season.
7.88,7 January 2022,"I so mad, that i've wasted my time on 16 episodes of this nonsense. You had all the potential: idea, cool actors, but you failed it all. First episode was the best one and with next 2 they were not bad, but all the others just led series to the bottom. It's not average, it's not below average. It is a trash. Not recommended, no person with brains and sense of taste would like it. First season, well, i believe you can say that s1 isn't a complete trash, but the second one is. You know i already see these hypocritic opinions of the masses about The Boys, like it is dark, mature, has a good story and characters, but in fact is is worse than most animes that pops up in your head. Yeah, that's the reality. It's it brutal, much more brutal than this terrible gum show.

Update: 1 year and 4 month later watched S3. It was funnier and better than 2nd. I kinda liked first episodes, not bad in sense of comedy: absurd jokes, irony and satire. But latest episodes casual s*** my ass style. The ending is casual terrible soap opera type. Yeah, the boys truly terrible tv series, no consequences, no real development."
7.88,7 December 2020,"Brutal, offensive and terrible. I don't like the offensive language and graphics."
7.88,28 July 2019,I'm a few episodes in and there hasn't been much action....this is about people with super powers...well where are the scenes where they are using their powers? I can count on one hand the amount of times...and thats unacceptable
7.88,22 September 2020,"This is probably not for our age group but more for the right here right now age group with perhaps limited attention spans, which require instant gratification so lots of 10s dished out.

Meanwhile, having watched Smallville, some episodes many times, we were looking for something else perhaps not as gritty as the Watchman film, though that was excellent - more a TV series.

Like this?

We had to give this up after few minutes because it had zero character build up and went straight into full hyped up mode instead.

So swearing from the get go and I can only guess its filling in the gaps in the script. To cap it all the incredibly early Selfies moment, which says it all really, as this trite overused me, me, and me, ritual, was born more than a decade ago.

In addition, I do not mean the world of Smith in the Matrix because The Boys is without any of the finesse of the first two versions of those films. I can never fathom how superfluous throwaway expletives make for a good intro.

Let the easily fobbed off seething masses, who allow the raking in of gazillions of any currency on the back of the Marvel films, give this endless 10s. I gave it a three because at least it takes people off the streets.

Gone are the days of the massively better, incredibly detailed, fantastically scripted, and superbly acted; even great sets/lighting but let's not go on too much, super hero programmes like Smallville and more is the pity. Briefly, I have just sorted out the Men from The Boys.

By the way Smallville, in my opinion, is the best superhero escapism drama series that's ever been."
7.88,23 July 2021,
7.88,7 July 2020,Where is the story? Where is the action? Where is the drama? Where is the fun? This series is not even worth filling boring hours with. What a piece of garbage.
7.88,17 June 2022,"Every episode has about 35 random and forced use of the F word. It's so obvious, it makes you laugh one you pick up on it. Pour 50 shots of your favorite and go watch an episode."
7.88,21 August 2021,"What a total crap! I cannot believe that this series has such a high rating.... No plot, no characters and sex all the time FOR NO REASON AT ALL.

Do not waste your time people."
7.88,16 July 2022,I love the first season and than just so stupid and I thought is was so freaking ridiculous I did like is at all. I just they would have kill loser homelander and guy is insane so is solider boy he has no clue how to fight in real war and he just talk out his but and I am sorry but Eric who make supernatural you have a twist mind and why in world did have to say the c word in that show. It just plain suck and the only character that I like was starlight she was good and kind and just wanted to help people those other so called hero just killed innocent people for no reason all plus his show 💔
7.88,14 January 2020,
7.88,11 June 2021,"One of the most overrated series , Nothing in the series seems to be reality , Recommending you to watch other series."
7.88,6 August 2022,One of the most boring TV series I've ever had the displeasure of watching. Can't get past episode 3 if series 1. Took me 5 times to try and watch the second episode. Some people are really easily pleased and specially with the super hero genre. It's just the typical American tripe. Really don't understand the big hype behind it. Maybe it's just me but I'm struggling and I don't think I'll give it a second chance.
7.88,18 August 2019,"Alas, they were quashed. I imagine writers waking up and not being sure what was written the previous day... The show is slow, pointless, dragging it's feet like it'd rather be somewhere else. Me too, I went elsewhere to find fun, disappointed."
7.88,11 July 2020,"This show is great for a first watch because it's like a magic show for people who love adult superhero stuff. But the second time around, you figure out the biggest trick on your own and realize they only wow the audience once per episode with a memorable scene (with the exception of the pilot and finale, which need to have a few more memorable scenes). A good amount of these scenes don't advance the plot at all, but are memorable for their shock value. These scenes are enjoyable and they serve their purpose of keeping the viewer interested, but the rest of the show is just a set of pretty dull buildups to these intense or funny scenes, which is why I think a magic show is a good comparison."
7.88,17 October 2020,"I am not a huge fan of this show. This show use so many over the top moments and gory bloody events to overshadow the lacklustre storyline and almost zero development. Sure some characters die, and new villains pop up and sure there are some reveals, but overall, at its core and if you watch the first and last episode of season2 basically nothing has changed. The show do not progress. It is the same thing over, and over, and over again.

There are also several pretty bad actors, mainly the side-characters, that lower both the score and the overall quality.

With that said however this is still fun. This is entertaining and the show have a lot of cool and WTF moments, so I get why so many like it. This is not bad, not at all. And the show also highlight an interesting thought; what happens if a lot of sociopaths emerge as superheros and they are just as egocentric and fame-hungry as any NBC reporter? To be fair, most people developing superpowers would act like these ""heroes"" in this show. About this I am 100% sure. This is what and who people are. Sadly. Which is also what make the show kinda scary.

Although I enjoy watching this show I cannot forgive the lack of development and all the over the top violence and gore which serve no purpose other than hide the bad storyline. I give this show a 6/10. The first season is slightly better, almost a 7/10, while the second season is almost 5/10. I am not sure if I can recommend this. If you do not want to think, you only want hot people having sex, lots of blood and violence with little or no purpose and you want to live in the fantasy of superheroes gone nuts, then yea, sure, you can watch and enjoy this. But this is not for those who want intelligent TV."
7.88,7 September 2020,"The Boys could be about ANYTHING. A title should give you insight into what a show is about without giving away anything or pidgeon holing itself AND it should at least TRY to be a complete work of art in and of itself.

Might've been better to call it ""The Girls"", or ""The Show"", or, ""Just Watch it Cause We Made it."""

7.88,21 February 2022,"Would love to see them make fun of all religions like drawing a certain character from a certain middleeast religion. Oh well, guess these people have zero cojones and it just comes off as punching a little kid. Or making fun of the woke religion, oh right, season 2 is there to enforce it because you cant get a job otherwise. Love the R rated stuff though."
7.88,12 October 2020,I love the story but the production value is so low. Loads of continuity errors and the British accents take you out of the story.
7.88,11 September 2020,"Thoroughly enjoyable - and great job upstaging the seemingly never-ending superhero movies and their banality.

*the multitude of negative reviews on amazon's site (and some here on IMDB) with their endless whinging about how ""they don't pay for prime to have to wait for staggered releases"" and ""wake up, this is 2020, I want to binge watch the whole series"" just scream of a group of kiddults who lack any semblance of fortitude. I for one feel the weekly release is a great thing.

This series is a gory, irreverent, violent-porn wonderful breath of fresh air!"
7.88,4 September 2019,
7.88,6 September 2019,"The acting is good, the visual effects are great, and the basic premise of deeply corrupt superheroes with various apparent mental disorders is still cool (as it was in Watchmen). I thoroughly enjoy the not-so-subtle parodies of the Justice League heroes, and there are plenty of fantastic scenes and moments throughout the first season.

Now, I'd probably have given The Boys a 10 back in the Reagan era, or even in the 90s, but the kind of over-the-top Anti-Americanism and Christian bashing it indulges in just feels vicious and crude to me now. Perhaps society today is dominated by completely different forces than the Moral Majority, or maybe I've simply outgrown my youthful cynicism. Either way, just like with Preacher (also based on a Garth Ennis comic), I find it incredibly stale, and it seriously detracts from what is still a good show. (And I say this as a Swede with no religious convictions.)"
7.88,18 September 2020,This show is like watching a morbid train wreck. Disgusting but I can't look away.
7.88,4 November 2019,"Great cast, great story, great visuals, but ending the season after 8 episodes really feels like it's being milked for another season. A ridiculous finale that answers nothing"
7.88,30 August 2019,Agonisingly boring. Watch at your own will!. Had to stop at episode 5
7.88,19 August 2019,"I absolutely loved The Boys plot. It's pretty unique, and fun. With that being said, I try to limit the amount of filth I watch, and unfortunately, this show seems to add it without cause. Its gratuitous nature was quite offputting. I did appreciate the fact that they did seem to darken scenes that might come off as offensive, but why even put them in there at all? At times I felt very uncomfortable watching, to the point of just turning it off. However the plot is what kept me coming back. It's unfortunate when there's such a good plot line, and great acting, but writers still feel the need to muck it up. I've seen many TV shows rated TV-14 that were excellent. The plot and acting held up the show. Adult content doesn't equal better. Let your writing and acting speak for itself. Tone it down a little, and I think you'll broaden your audience."
7.88,10 September 2019,"I guess it's cool to be contemptuous of the Marvel franchise, but this gave me whiplash. Yes, the people to a large degree will follow anything. However, this Superhero conglomerate somehow is impervious to public scrutiny. They used a heavy dose of dark and evil to create their characters, and I get it, but it was a bit much. Overall, the acting is good, and the storylines are certainly fascinating. I'm assuming season 2 will take a more intricate storyline with how season 1 ended."
7.88,7 September 2019,
7.88,1 January 2020,It's okay. didn't quite like it. I don't understand how does it have average score over here.
7.88,31 December 2019,"Ok, quite liking this series. Up to episode 4, season 1 :)

The only thing I cannot get past, as a kiwi, is Karl Urbans' accent. He sounds a mix between bad cockney (perhaps), Aussie and Kiwi. One scene he's more cockney then the Kiwi twang comes in, then it sounds Aussie. Is this meant to be? I hope not... his character could come across so differently if the accent was right, being he is described as a 'British guy' in one scene.

If the 'uccent' wasn't such an issue, would definitely give more stars 😊"
7.88,1 August 2019,"I just don't get it, it's a nice twist on the super hero genre surely, but a 9 out of 10 stars?!! No. Something isn't right here.

I'm sorry, but the story is just very average and a bit cheap if you ask me... It's not moving or special, it's just so predictable! The main character is just plain out boring, although the super girl is interesting. But thats it... It's violent and it's weird... Please stop glorifying this cheap series and stop comparing it with big titles like Deadpool and Wolverine. Please just stop. It just ain't the quality. My highest rate is a 6, but even that is too high."
7.88,18 August 2019,"But I still have nightmares from one scene, w/o spoiler: ""the"" exploding head. For me, that was just disgusting (in the end), Though I have no Problems with Salad-tossing per se. Without the scene, It's a great show nonetheless!"
7.88,13 August 2019,"Loved this show! So nitty, gritty, dirty, funny...and dark! Awesome. Great characters and great acting! So much fun, and so cool to see the twist of it all being just corporate greed at the bottom of it. Great performances, lots of laughs, oh craps, and sadness. A great twist on the collateral damage of ""Superheroes ""! Can't wait for more!"
7.88,21 September 2020,"The Boys season 1 is a hilarious, gory and realistic look at what would happen if superheroes lived in the real world. The show follows a group of people (The Boys) who want to try and take down corrupt superheroes who abuse their superpowers. The acting is absolutely brilliant in particular, Karl Urban as 'Billy Butcher', Jack Quaid as 'Hughie Campbell' and Erin Moriarty as 'Starlight'. However, the best acting from the entire cast comes from Anthony Starr as 'Homelander', the most popular hero and the leader of 'The Seven'. He is able to go from goodie two shoes boy-scout to complete psychopath within a single scene. The plot is very entertaining with a great twist at the end. This is achieved by the immense acting, brilliant directing and exhilarating writing that goes into each episode. The show doesn't shy away from very tough themes, especially religion which is obvious with the character of Homelander. The other themes included (misogyny, capitalism and corruption) also land perfectly with each of them getting the ideal amount of time needed for them to be displayed. This show obviously takes inspiration from the characters from 'The Justice League' with their group being called 'The Seven' and every member being a blatant carbon copy of their Justice League counterpart. The best episodes were: 1:1 ('The Name of the Game'), 1:4 ('The Female of the Species'), 1:7 ('The Self-Preservation Society') and 1:8 ('You Found Me'). However, it wasn't perfect, the show does drag in places and I wish 'Black Noir' had a bigger role. Also, I wanted more of 'Queen Maeve's' backstory as I feel they are two characters that have loads of potential. Overall, I loved this first season, I can't wait for season 2 and I'm looking forward to seeing older members of 'The Seven'."
