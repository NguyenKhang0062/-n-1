0,8.0,5 June 2024,"So I was left a little disappointed after the last film, something just seemed to be missing but this really hit the spot.

The 2 central characters still have great chemistry, but this felt a lot more like an ensemble piece with more fleshed out characters around them. I'm just going say #Reggierocks.

Some great cinematography with lots of fab camera and drone work zooming around all over the place. The first person gun work at one point added a new dimension.

Miami looks beautiful with the Orange and Teal tones.

Action galore and a good protagonist in Eric Dane, although his motive and why he is doing what he is, was pretty rubbish, but he still played it well, and to be fair you don't come in to this sort of film hoping for Shakespeare level story telling.

Some fun cameos pop up which raise a smile.

The soundtrack is good and Lorne Balfe delivers on the orchestrated score.

It has all you would expect from a Michael Bay production. Definitely life still in the franchise.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
1,7.0,6 June 2024,"I do not understand why some people are still at this ""Will Smith"" slap stage. Just get over with it. You don't give 1/10 to a movie like this unless you're dumb and got shot in the head. Yes what he did was bad, but it has nothing to do with the movie nor his actions, cuz remember he's an actor. Remember all these people giving 1/10 are still but*hurt about the slap & are trying to boycott Will Smith for his acting career. I don't want to include any spoilers, The movie is funny got great comedy lines, great acting and the jokes are just too funny so don't lurk around giving weird unrealistic rating just because you don't like the actor in real life. & i'd suggest to watch it for fun.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
2,9.0,5 June 2024,"I have always been a fan of will and Martin ever since the fresh prince and Martin show. This movie was so fun, I laughed so hard and the audience in general too. Action packed and some scenes were shot in a way I never saw. Congrats to the filmmakers adil and Bilal which are from my city Brussels in Belgium. They gave their own twist and flair to this and the last bad boys and I hope they keep coming. I watched the premiere 2nd of June and now I'm re watching the old ones. Probably my favourite action series.

Also regi is the goat 😂 annd I love how Martin is more like the badass this time anround, he did a great job. Again, this movie is awesome and I will be watching it many more times.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
3,8.0,5 June 2024,"The fourth entry in the revitalised buddy cop, action, comedy franchise. Bad Boys: Ride or Die sees wisecracking Miami cops Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) embark on a dangerous mission to clear the name of their late police captain when he gets linked to drug cartels.

Firstly, they missed a trick not calling this instalment Bad Boys 4 Life, alas we cannot have everything we desire. Anyway, it was inevitable that we were going to get a fourth (and potentially fifth) as 2020's actual Bad Boys For Life made nearly half a billion dollars and due to the pandemic, was in the top 3 highest grossing of that year.

It has been too long since I watched the first film (it is long, long overdue a rewatch), however Bad Boys II I return to every couple of years when I require a dousing of Bayhem. Has it aged well? Nope. Is it obnoxious and overlong? Yes. Does the action rule? Hell yes! The third film I found solid, yet disappointing, it lacked the grit and sleaze of its predecessor and incorporated a bizarre supernatural element that didn't quite click.

This was a real step up from three and balances the slick, modernised lega-sequel of the previous film with the sleaze and chaos of Bay's entries. Admittedly it's a little bit of a rushed and rocky start and narratively the film isn't bringing anything particularly new to the table, yet it's clearly relishing its heightened mid-00's vibes. Once Marcus returns a from death's embrace with a new outlook on life and spirituality and Mike's fears for his family, his own mortality and a reconnection with his fugitive son come to the forefront of his anxieties, the film adds a surprising layer of character work that still manages to incorporate dick jokes and f-bombs aplenty.

Action-wise this boasts some of the franchise's best set pieces. Director's Adil El Arbi & Bilall Fallah certainly lean a bit heavier into the Bayism's here than in BBFL. A slow-motion, sped up and gloriously chaotic digital, neon tinged art exhibition shootout is very Bay. A superb John Wick-esque home invasion shootout (featuring a well deserved triumphant moment for a fan favourite character) and the *entire* finale section of the film is a bar setter for shootouts this year. The incorporation of first person POVs, drones, alligators, explosions aplenty mix together for a riotous bloody blowout.

Performance-wise this was certainly the best way Will Smith could properly return after the Oscars controversy (I know he had Emancipation a few months after the incident, but I don't think anybody apart from me watched it). His more vulnerable and subdued fatherly moments as Mike are well executed... as well as the kick ass swagger that established the character. However, it's Martin Lawrence that steals the show. A motormouth, wide-eyed, born again foul mouthed spiritual guide who claims he can't die. He's having a ball and both he and Smith's chemistry is still unbeatable. Supporting players Jacob Scipio, Ioan Gruffudd, Rhea Seehorn and Reggie himself Dennis Greene are all locked in to the material.

Bad Boys: Ride or Die was a bullet riddled, cackle worthy blast of throwback fun that was a step up from my expectations. Smith & Lawrence are still a great duo, the action is killer and the balance of soap opera sincerity and over-the-top drama balances effectively with the motor-mouthed bickering and gags. Sure, the plot isn't particularly standout and the film is a little choppy in the first act, but when the wheels begin to fully spin, the film charges off the start line.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
4,7.0,7 June 2024,"Terrible acting, bad storyline and absolutely not funny (although, they try). Obviously someone needed the money and Hollywood is out of fresh ideas.

Only a few actors should act in action movies beyond a certain age and the sad boys aren't amongst them.

Not sure, if part III or part IV is worse, but both are not worth watching at all.

From here onwards, I can ot tell you anything anymore about this bad movie, but I need to fill the minimum characters. Interesting fact: there were 6 people in the cinema watching this movie. On a friday evening. I guess a lot of people were smarter than us 6nand didn't even go into the movie.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
5,8.0,5 June 2024,"It must be a lot of fun to write these 'Bad Boys' movies. The two lead characters really are great and they play off each other so well. And even if you wrote something in the script that was so-so, you know you've got a couple of great actors who will make it work. There were a couple of lines in this movie where I thought to myself, on paper that probably wasn't all that funny, but they found a delivery that got a chuckle out of me.

There's everything you could want out of a 'Bad Boys' movie in this one. The action is there, the laughs are there, there's a great menacing villain and there are some fun side characters to help carry the load. We are four movies into the series and have yet to see a drop-off in standard whatsoever. Bring on the next one I say. 8.5/10.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
6,9.0,7 June 2024,"Watched it in Imax in Manchester Vue and it has to be one of the worst written movies i have watched in a few years , sad to see better action flicked movies get bombed like Furiosa ,watched that last week and man what a movie that was after fury road. This movie is worse is many ways compared to For Life.

Hopefully this will bomb bad as Fall guy and all too coz this isn't any better than any of those dumb action flicks. Go watch Furiosa guys and do that after watching Mad Max Fury Road, just a recommendation to you'll, and you'll will love it for sure.

Now all we wait is for Deadpool and Wolverine hopefully that wouldn't disappoint like so many others this year man.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
7,4.0,9 June 2024,Movies was unbelievable from start to finish. Definitely was the best of all 4 films!!! Anyone rating it under a 7 is Definitely a rating killer. I'm very hard on rating movies! I'm against all cheesy films! I will not go to the movies if the film is a below 7!! I cried laughed throughout this movie! I didn't go watch any of the previous bad boy films in theaters. This one is a must see!! Don't listen to these people who rated the new mad max film a 7 or 8.... please dont!!! I didn't expect the movie to move me the way it did... Sheeesh! I watched it in Dolby and felt even bit of action in this film. MUST SEE!!!,"June 7, 2024 (United States)"
8,10.0,11 June 2024,"I loved the first two and felt like the third was very, very off tone and out of place for the ""trilogy"". If like me you disliked the third, you will hate for forth. Where the third introduced this bazaar soap opera styled movie with a witch and a long lost son, this one they introduce.... god? And soul mates..... its funny I completely missed the warlock and demons in the first and second film.

I genuinely hope this movie makes enough money to fund a 5th film just so they can afford Michael bay and some decent writers! Because I love seeing Will and Martin together and the characters (at least the OG version of them were so great). Why have they made Marcus SOOO dumb... it didn't work for Thor love and thunder and it doesn't work here.

The directors need to quit and just work for MTV it's genuinely like they have never seen the first two films and have only HEARD about Bay's style of directing. Just because you can fit a camera in a seemingly impossible position doesn't mean you should do it every 3 minutes. Every shot and scene in this film is just flooding with an attempt to be stylish or cool or bay-esc. The camera is constantly spinning or moving it makes Bay's shaky cam feel like a tripod. Also what's with ALL the colour/neon!? Every close up I swear has either a red, green or purple glow to it; unless it's interior, in which case you are treated to over the top lens flare from curtain less windows. The OG films looked beautiful but also had some grit to them.

Point is I am a fan so wanted to like it but it didn't look good, it wasn't funny and it just felt like the franchise is going the same direction as fast and the furious but some how less entertaining.

The last two films have been a crime to cinema, how they got Will and Martin to sign their contracts I will never know.

How two thirds of this film was ever put on the page, I will never know. It felt like a straight to DVD waste of time.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
9,8.0,5 June 2024,"This truly was the best in series. Loved all the action sequences, great acting, great writing and great directing! This really is a movie that should be enjoyed on a big screen to experience it in full force.

Furthermore, the chemistry between Will Smith and Martin Lawrence is highly entertaining and makes the movie fly by.

What I also appreciated is the press tour and how Will Smith and Martin Lawrence actually seem to be really good friends which definitely adds to the experience and one can see that in the movie.

Go in, have fun - in this day and age we need to stop pointing out the flaws but to go in and enjoy. This is entertainment after all!","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
10,3.0,5 June 2024,"Bad Boys is back and it's so much fun, action packed and hilarious! More Martin Lawrence than the last one had which I really loved cause he was hilarious in this one too and so many types of jokes in this! Martin also had a really funny shootout scene involving food. Action was badass with the great choreography the last one had and more of that brutality too with bloody heavy hitting scenes, one scene I thought I was watching John Wick! There is probably one scene I wasn't keen on which is when someone has an out of body death experience, didn't match the grounded story. But the rest of the story was thrilling and connected to all the past bad boys films which I can appreciate it more for that, especially seeing the relationship between Mike and his son. Mike had some more character work with his panic attacks and even Marcus showing age and toll of the job they do. Final showdown was epic with tons of action with some really unique stuff to have fun with. Music they used too was really epic of course ""Bad Boys"" song but the song ""Tonight"" was really awesome and the use of those songs made it so much more amazing! Some really interesting camera angles especially during the final face off and as a wannabe cinematographer I appreciate them trying new things and seeing them work. It's good to see actors such as Rhea Seehorn, Eric Dane and Ioan Gruffudd in more roles too! There is also a Michael Bay cameo which was pretty cool! A great Bad Boys film that is epic on scale, hilarious and action packed fun!","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
11,5.0,12 July 2024,"I was a huge fan of the first two movies, at the time there was a lot more buddy comedy action films back then and these were up their with the best of them, rewatched both over the years. The third was ok, not great and not particularly memorable, I was kinda surprised they did another but I think the reason is pretty simple... Will Smiths popularity and reputation took a huge hit for a long while and this being one of his most popular franchises was more likely than a geriatric fresh prince.

I for one was a huge will smith fan from awful movies like WWW to his music and tv but last 6-8 years I've found I've gone off him and his style a lot and this film really drove home stuff I don't like, the endless shots of him pulling faces, the fact he has to be the hero, talking down to others, his character is not likeable, Lawrence is near 60 with endless hair dye doing the same stuff as when he was mid thirties, it felt forced and a bit tired to me. I didn't find any of the healthy living jokes that funny.

I found the young generation saved this film from being a walkout for me, the couple, the son and son in law were great, especially the son, the scenes were great with him in, he was very believable. One thing that bugged me was that the ""good guys"" fall into an animal enclosure and think it's ok after winding it up to attack the animal. Hardly standard good guy behaviour.

Story was ok, but far fetched and lame but that fits in with this maybe being forced out, who knows, but either way as a stand alone film it's probably quite entertaining and watchable but for a fan of the series and 2 actors I've enjoyed a lot this didn't land.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
12,7.0,27 July 2024,"I'm not understanding all these good reviews on here? I LOVED the first two, liked the 3rd one, but have recently grew more attached to the 3rd one as of lately. However, this one, what a major disappointment. It seemed like they had a set amount of days to make this movie with a set amount of money to spend for the movie. It literally was not like ANY of the other 3. The action was scenes were abysmal, their usually funny and perfect timed humor was nowhere to be found. Thinking the funniest part of this movie was the very end with Reggie. I'm hoping that this movie will be like the 3rd and grow on me. Oh and not to mention, the casting was awful! I LOVED the captain, he was the 3rd most loved person in all 3 movies, next to Mike and Marcus. I love the idea of the daughter to avenge his death, however, the casting of his daughter in this movie was an awful choice. I just felt her acting was pitiful. I'm not sure what happened to Michael Bay/ Jerry Bruckheimer making this movie, but my thumbs up are for the first 3 and a thumbs down for the 4th.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
13,1.0,6 June 2024,"Bad Boys: Ride or Die is a fun-fight entertainer with a predicted storyline. It would be incorrect to categorize this film as awful. Let's talk about it using the key components of a movie.

Direction: Not too awful. It might have been better with more information regarding the character development, scene continuity, actor dialogue modulations, and setting.

Plot: The plot of this film is weak. There are no enhancements over any of the prior stories or materials, and the plot itself is not new.

Screenplay: It appears that there is no need to rewrite the screenplay for this film. It may have changed places, attire, and other equipment from the original script.

Dialogue: The dialogue in this film is informal and typical given the circumstances. A portion of them are useless.

Cinematography: This film emphasizes the use of cameras. Particularly in the action scenes. Not that awful, actually.

Acting: Will's entertaining dialogues aren't all that memorable, and his acting is lifeless. Several times, Martin has overacted. That could be the characterization, I don't know. However, something is absent.

Editing: The hue and lighting aren't very appealing. VFX and blue screen are provided as usual. For the huge screen, some effects are quite unique. It's interesting to watch fight scenes with musical accompaniment.

Stunt: As long as there is minimal usage of blue screens, the stunts in this film are good.

Soundtrack: It's alright. The stunt scenes' background music is well-done.

Attraction: To put it simply, the Bad Boys movie's entertainment value is ""okay."" It is not a thrilling, suspenseful action film. A typical action movie, nothing noteworthy to say.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
14,1.0,6 June 2024,"That's not to say this franchise has overstayed its welcome, no. But this movie feels like it has exhausted its last bit of entertainment without coming across as unnecessary. And that's a good thing.

Out of the four Bad Boys movies so far, this was probably the one I enjoyed the most. It maybe also has to do with the fact that this was the first Bad Boys movie I've watched in the big screen, naturally making the experience more exciting and memorable, but I also feel like the movie has a lot to make it likeable - be it the rather cliché but effective script, the callbacks, the action, the excitement and most of all, the amazing chemistry between Will Smith and Martin Lawrence.

Overall, the movie is pretty fun and while not all jokes land, it's still decently funny and entertaining at the same time.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
15,2.0,11 June 2024,"Hollywood can't make movies anymore. So they make pretend movies, that is movies that just runs without any goal, story, entertainment value or respect for their audience.

This is one of those pretend movies.

So... what do we get for our hard earned money? No much, to be honest. We get a couple of bad actors that tries to be funna (fail), that try to be cool (fail), and that try to make talk about old age and at the same time doing the things they did in the former movies (fail).

The problem is that even the camera work and directing are bad. And why use shaky cameras that just make it even harder to watch this money grab? Well I guess someone is laughing all the way to the bank - unfortunately it's not the viewer. Give this one a pass.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

they missed an upportunety here.

The movie is good.

Decent even

decent acting some parts are creative

but anything with will right now is bound to fail.

Them choosing ti go to cinena first instead of releasing it on netflix was a mistake it will flunk on the cinema office obvioaly that will just send a message that to not put will in cinema now.

They should have released it in netflix .

In anyway it will come to netflix within a month o assume.

This is a good movie to watch in netflix not good enough for cinema and if you wait just a few weeks it will be in netflix where much more people will upvote it and like it.

It is cute though to see Will Bots that he paid a lot of money for giving this movie 10 stars chatgpt reviews

.downvoting every negative review.

And against them.the real people giving this movie a 1...

its a cute battle.

17,3.0,8 June 2024,"I'm shocked people liked this. I think it's one of the most miserable things I've seen at the cinema in a good while. Bad Boys: Ride or Die tries to convince you it's trying hard, but I wasn't fooled. It's free of anything edgy, radical, daring, or provocative, even though it stylistically feels like it's insisting it is those things. A few blood spurts and some swearing (not nearly as much as earlier movies, from what I can tell) can't fool me. It feels like it goes out of its way to avoid racy humor, has one scene with racists but feels afraid to make them genuinely racist, and refuses to punch up or down with its humor. I just wanted it to pick a direction, even if it meant a film feeling lowbrow or mean-spirited. At least it would be something. Comedically, this is so flat, uninspired, predictable, and corny. I laughed more at the film than I laughed with it, and I barely ever laughed at it to begin with.

The film makes baffling decisions about where to take the two main characters and then never explores those things in interesting ways (sudden panic attacks for one, and a near-death experience in the film's opening moments for the other). There are so many side characters and they're all less interesting than Smith and Lawrence, and those two are already going through the motions here (there are crumbs of chemistry between the two still, here and there, but it's slight). The supporting cast just overwhelms in the back half, once or twice to the point where I briefly forgot this was a Bad Boys film.

It doesn't live up to the title the way you'd want or expect. There is nothing Bad in a good way here; it's just Bad in a Bad way. There's nothing by way of attitude, spark, life, or guts. It's a cowardly, flat, monotonous, cynical, ugly, boring, and woefully lacking film. I hated it. The only thing that saves it from a 1/10 is the fact there were some explosions and brief moments of camerawork in the climax that looked kind of cool. I guess Smith and Lawrence could've been worse, too. They're phoning it in, but they phone it in better than anyone else in the film. It's abhorrent and soul-sucking cinema.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

19,8.0,23 July 2024,"Bad Boys: Ride or Die

Oh dear, I had hoped that at the end of the last banal movie we had seen the end of this excruciating franchise. How much macho posturing can we, the viewer, be subjected to that literarily made me squirm from one scene to another.

Not only was there a vestigial script, nasty stereotyping, preposterous scenarios, and the most egregious and controlling relationships based upon fear and retribution. This movie grandstands this mucho behaviour and promotes it in the most barefaced manner. How can this still exist in 2024!

It does not pass the minimum bar of six out loud laughs per movie I didn't laugh once.

Lastly and perhaps most shockingly this movie was used as a vehicle for the cancelled actor Will Smith to re-enter Hollywood. Previously he presented himself as a black role model across the world, a whole generation copied his supposed wholesome and non-judgemental approach, he then turned out to be nothing more that a violent misogynistic who had hoodwinked the public for years, there is no coming back from that period!

I hated this reductive movie from start to finish I'm not sure who this was made for but whoever is lapping up this rubbish needs to take take a close look at what it is they are admiring.

For me this is a 3 outta 10, at best, I enjoyed some of the stunts.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
20,10.0,10 June 2024,"Martin Lawrence totally killed it here but I do believe Will Smith is still affected in his acting due to his slap incident (or perhaps his charm is gone).

Same old story (good guys get set-up by bad guys and they win in the end). Jokes were ok but I don't think I want to see Will Smith ever again on the screen (he was once a favorite actor of mine).

Supporting cast was lackluster as most people have said. And some scenes were fun but the story overall was very predictable (specially who the bad guy is which you can figure it out in the first 20 minutes or so).

I love action films and comedy, this used to be a great movie series but I think Will Smith should consider retiring and let his glory days be gone...","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
21,1.0,5 June 2024,"Cinema can and sometimes must simply entertain. It's not about an elaborate or even new story, character depictions that are more than just superficial, outstanding action scenes, great camera work, or even exceptional actors. It's about fun and distracting the audience from the rest of the world for 115 minutes. ""Bad Boys Ride or Die"" has achieved just that. Admittedly, Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett have been my favorites since 1995, and I dare say that ""Bad Boys"" was one of the most-watched films of my youth. And just as I don't feel really old almost thirty years later, neither do Will Smith and especially Martin Lawrence, who really gives it his all in the fourth installment of the series and provides plenty of laughs.

Yes, the film is no revelation, and some camera angles were annoying because they were much too fast and hectic. And when the camera switches to vertical format in the finale, I know that perhaps I am indeed too old for this stuff. However, ""Bad Boys Ride or Die"" is also one of the most honest films of the year. Here, nothing is taken seriously anymore, and the goal is for everyone to have fun. For me, that was enough, and the film works better than much of what else I've seen in the cinema this year. If you haven't liked the ""Bad Boys"" so far, you won't be happy here either. For everyone else, go to the cinema and have fun.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

As actors age they make choices that always come with consequences. Martin Lawrence has made the choice to wear a lot of black, but the jowls ALWAYS give it away and that takes away from the whole experience in my eyes.

24,6.0,6 June 2024,"From the opening scene I broke my jaw laughing and creamed my Levi's (the first of many times throughout this achievement to the world of cinema and quite possibly humanity). Chris Tucker, newly married, and Kevin Hart, sporting a bulbous face prosthetic, are back as everyone's favorite wiseacre detectives (I actually have no idea what their official titles are as cops, like no idea) and their captain is being framed...But this time he's dead...WOOOOAH (just popped off in my Hilfiger's again writing about how well crafted the story is). Lethal Weapon and Rush Hour have to clear the captain's name cause his cranky ghost keeps following them around during their investigation. While following a lead that sees them off to New York, Ride Along and Money Talks pick up the B-team Ghostbusters from Afterlife to help with the case that they fear involves a sinister Bughuul. The Ghostbusters and 48 Hours visit a haunted Blumhouse that's filled with a whole gang of the fattest DJ Khaleds you've ever seen (think of the mini marshmallows in Afterlife and Frozen Empire but they're all the size of the original Stay Puft marshmallow man but have the skills of a talentless cry baby; this scene also made me frost my Wranglers). During the shoot out with the Stay Puft Khaleds, the ghost captain gets his brains blown out by ANOTHER ONE...which is a mistake because now it's personal. The Blues Brothers ditch the Ghostbusters, who just hung around and kept dancing to ANOTHER ONE, before following a clue left in one of Stay Puft Khaleds wretched ass songs. They must infiltrate a prison to retrieve a former British spy and a wrongfully accused army ranger...and you guessed it, the prison is Alcatraz. When Miami Vice arrives they pretend to be lawyers (again, I don't know what their titles are as cops, they may be actual lawyers at this point) when all of a sudden their gigantic, metal, magnetic boots they've been wearing the entire film lock them in place. All the doors of the cells open and a riot ensues, but through all of the chaos, in walks Castor Troy (already wearing John Travolta's face). ""OOOO WEE YOU GOOD LOOKIN,"" he exclaims as he begins throwing green balls filled with a toxic nerve gas, Blue Streak and Ali remember they're wearing bazooka powered jet packs that allow them to explode out of their boots and through the roof of Alcatraz into the sky and hurling toward an oncoming plane. Out of bazooka juice and free falling they manage to get onboard the plane, which just so happens to be carrying some of the most dangerous criminals this side of the Mason Dixon. Someone says ""OH HELL NAW"", but I don't want to spoil who, and someone else says ""WOO WOO WOO"", again no spoilers here as Big Momma and Hancock approache the cockpit Cyrus the Virus turns and says ""Thank you for flying Con Air, unfortunately this flight is for prisoners only unless your Dave Chapelle, and lets face it, you guys aren't Dave Chapelle."" Fortunately for the Rush Hour 2, a couple of these prisoners are innocent and willing to help, they include Stephen Baldwin and Laurence Fishbourne reprising their roles from FLED and Richard Kimble from The Fugitive, replacing Harrison Ford in the role is Mark Hamill, which I found to be inspired casting. As all the convicts on the plane surround them The Bad Grandpas, Fled and the Fugitive must share one parachute and jump off the plane. A mid air fight ensues with all the men punching and quipping like mad as they plummet to the earth, real obnoxious like. Thankfully a group of bank robbing surfers were sky diving that day, Johnny Utah and Bodhi give The Fresh Prince and MAHHHRTIN a chance to steal their parachute, as they were also fighting in mid air at the moment.

25,1.0,10 June 2024,"I looked forward to Bad Boys: Ride or Die as I really enjoyed Bad Boys for Life. It retains a lot of the positive things which have made the past films fun such as impactful action, R rated jokes and family dynamics. That came with a bunch of side characters new and old and an okay plot but there is one thing that lets this movie down and it's Martin Lawrence's character, Marcus Burnett.

Unfortunately, it's becoming all too common in Hollywood for a character to be so over the top for a movie that it just becomes distracting.

After surviving a near death experience at the beginning of the film, Marcus is high on life and he literally acts as if he is high for the rest of the film. This went beyond fun and playful to the point where it was distracting and annoying. It led to many frustrating scenes which felt like they belonged in a cartoon including one scene where the characters chose one of the worst possible moments to sing the Bad Boys theme.

In the End, Bad Boys Ride or Die is a frustrating but okay film which could have been much better with different narrative choices although many people might enjoy the direction that the film went.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
26,8.0,26 July 2024,"The movie"" continues the long-running saga, but this latest installment falls into the trap of delivering more of the same without much innovation. The film lacks any fresh elements and largely recycles tropes seen in countless other action movies.

The action scenes, while brief and sporadic, feature our heavily battered yet inexplicably bulletproof heroes. These sequences are interspersed with lengthy, tiresome filler dialogue that does little to advance the plot or develop the characters. The two hours in the theater felt more like a slog, as the film struggled to maintain engagement with its audience.

""Bad Boys 4"" at times resembles an ego-shooter game, a style that may appeal to fans of intense, immersive violence. However, this aspect requires a particular taste for such content. While the film manages to deliver solid entertainment and the dynamic chemistry between Smith and Lawrence remains a highlight, it ultimately fails to rise to the level of a masterpiece.

One of the most glaring issues is the evident aging of the main actors. Smith and Lawrence, though charismatic, often show their age, and the series' attempt to maintain the high-energy antics of its predecessors feels forced and out of touch. The weariness is palpable in many scenes, making it clear that the franchise is running on fumes.

A passable action film that relies heavily on the established rapport of its leading men. It offers a familiar blend of action and humor, but its lack of originality and overused clichés render it a largely forgettable experience. While fans of the series might find some enjoyment, it's time for this franchise to finally rest, acknowledging that its stars can no longer convincingly play the roles of youthful action heroes.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
27,1.0,22 June 2024,"What can I say this movie was just horrible. Will Smith for starters just isn't relevant anymore. He's still acting like he's in his 20's or something but please he's well into his 50's a this point. This has to be some of his worst work. I'd say we're all just tired of him at this point. He can't keep play 20 forever.

The camera work looked like something out of a horrible Michael Bay movie. Shaky camera movements, loads of jump cuts, way too much fancy and overused / outdated camera work.

The story line was thin. Just something to hold the action segments together. Honestly it's really not much different than the 3rd movie, or the first two.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
28,2.0,7 June 2024,"Bad Boys is one of the best buddy em cop action comedy franchise and with 4th part it looks like they've run their course. I enjoyed this movie but it offers nothing new it is just same as last film which I found amazing because 3rd one came after a very long time after 2nd one, but this time magic and charm don't work.. Chemistry between Will Smith and Martin Lawrence is the real soul of these movies their comedy timing is perfect and they can still kick some ass even after 30 years.. Story was same as many other movies we've seen before good guys gets framed for something which they didn't do, they catch bad guys and defeat them. The End. There are some good action scenes in this movies mostly consists of shootouts ,I think 2nd one has the best action sequences because that was directed by Michael Bay who is known for making big scale action pieces, after some time you'll get bored seeing same action again and again but it was still very fun to see on big screen especially the FPS gun scene during climax.. Cinematography consisting of Skylines shots of Miami was cool to see, soundtrack was good and acting of man leads was the best part of movie... Overall I enjoyed this movie as a Summer popcorn flick, if you love action comedies with some of the old famous actors of Hollywood you should catch it on big screen. You will enjoy it..","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

Martins charachter over does it to max, I got secondhand embarassment. Movie is a mess, no head or tail. These two need to retire. Waste of time and money. I had to forward my way through it. If I had to pick one positive, it would have to be Armando, this actor did good and was the only one I wanted to make it, and somewhat connected too.

30,4.0,10 June 2024,"Having enjoyed the previous Bad Boys films, I expected the latest installment to deliver the same blend of action and comedy that made its predecessors enjoyable. Unfortunately, this film missed the mark on all counts.

The comedy that was a staple of the earlier films was notably absent. Will Smith, who was once effortlessly funny, seemed to have lost his comedic touch. The film felt more like watching someone play Call of Duty for an hour and 51 minutes, lacking any real engagement or entertainment value.

Ultimately, I found myself so uninterested that I decided to leave the theater with 20 minutes left. The music in the theater lobby proved to be more entertaining than the movie itself, so I waited there for my family to finish watching.

If you enjoyed the previous Bad Boys movies, I would not recommend this one. It fails to capture the humor and excitement that made the earlier films enjoyable.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
31,4.0,7 June 2024,"I really enjoyed the first three movies in this series. The first two from Michael Bay truly raised the bar for gritty action movies. The third from a few years ago with new directors was a surprisingly great follow-on that was just as thrilling and fun. This movie, however, was a significant departure in quality.

Story 1/10 Acting 3/10 Direction 4/10 Action and effects 3/10 Nostalgia factor 5/10

What brought this desperate, greedy cash grab of a production down was how lazy and derivative it was from start to end. The amount of predictable core components of the story were only surpassed by the cheeseball dialogue and gags. What made the other films enjoyable was a delicate balance of quality action, believable stakes, and well-placed comedy. This failed attempt was just cringey and pathetic. While Will Smith did... okay... it's evident why Martin Lawrence faded into obscurity decades ago. Bad Boys should've ended with #3.

32,4.0,7 June 2024,"Bad Boys: Ride or Die is the fourth film in the Bad Boy film series. This fourth part is again directed by Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, who also directed the third Bad Boys films together.

When their former captain becomes involved in corrupt dealings, Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) are also seen as suspects. Now they have to prove the innocence of their old captain and themselves in their older age, poorer health and panic attacks themselves.

With this fourth Bad Boys they realistically respond to the aging aspects of the main characters. For example, at their older age they still have to solve police cases. Because they are now seen as suspects themselves, they receive little help from police allies, so they now have to solve the problem themselves.

The directing duo once again provides entertaining, creative action scenes. Many of these are entertainingly over the top, but some are a bit too exaggerated. This makes it almost look like scenes from superhero action films, which means that the realistic aspects of the film are somewhat lost.

The mysterious aspects are also quickly lost in the film. This way, as a viewer, you learn sooner than the main characters who is really behind all the criminal cases. This can make the story a bit long-winded, because the main characters are looking for answers that you as a viewer actually already know. The only thing more fun than guessing which of the other agents can or cannot be trusted, but unfortunately this is often a bit obvious.

What also makes the story a bit long-winded is that in addition to the main story, the main characters also commit many other side stories that are more separate from the main story. This sometimes makes it feel like you are watching moments from another film, or possible elements from sequels. If they had balanced everything a bit more, they could have had a shorter and clearer one.

Will Smith and Martin Lawrence still have good chemistry together as police partners and friends, but just like their characters, they have also aged a bit. Together they each provide their own form of humor in the film. They only switched their personalities a bit with this fourth film. Will Smith often still makes appropriate jokes, but his character is now also more concerned about things. Martin Lawrence's character thinks he can handle more of everything in this film and thus dares to take more risks. This brings him into entertaining action moments, which he then deals with in a more comical way. There are also some well-known cameos in the film from prominent characters from previous Bad Boys films, or simply from famous people, who are mainly known from social media.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
33,1.0,6 June 2024,Not as good as bad boys for life nowhere near as good as the one that came before yes it was very funny in places Martin Lawrence is a legend in comedy I just did not like the story it did not feel the same as bad boys for life it had a lot of action but that's what you would expect from a bad boys movie this movie is the worst out of all the bad boys movie in my opinion the two bad boys going on the run as fugitives that's not a bad boys movie and the lead bad guy now please they could have atleast picked an A list actor. Been reading some reviews and people are going on about the will smith slap...who cares unless he slapped you lol. So if they do decide to make another bad boys movie please be alot better.,"June 7, 2024 (United States)"
34,8.0,6 June 2024,"After the entertaining Bad Boys: For Life came out a few years ago it was guaranteed that we would be getting a fourth film in the franchise and here it is in Bad Boys: Ride or Die and I saw it today with this being my review. The premise of the film sees Mike & Marcus on the run after their former Captain is accused of working with the Cartels.

Main Character Will Smith as Mike Lowry and Martin Lawrence as Marcus Burnett are what carries this film and the chemistry that they have together. They both look like they are having a blast and their enthusiasm and energy is what I really enjoyed. Though, I can't deny that both characters have story arcs and they both come out of nowhere and are a bit bizarre and hold the movie and these characters back.

Supporting Characters Paola Nunez makes her return as Rita and I enjoyed her character, she is an old ally of Mike's and she has taken over the captains role and I thought she gave a pretty solid performance and I enjoyed watching her.

But the rest of the cast aren't great, Jacob Scipio is back as Armando and this guy has very little charisma and intrigue about him. This comes after a bland performance in the previous film and it just seems this guy can't live up to the hype of taking over from Will Smith which this film possibly wants.

Vanessa Hudgens as Kelly and Alexander Ludwig as Dorn return for this film in a clearly reduced role and they are pretty much given nothing to do except being some low level comic relief which doesn't really work when the main duo are way more entertaining.

The film really wastes the talent of Ioan Gruffudd and Rhea Seehorn with these generic characters when they are capable of so much better. Seehorn in particular is an amazing actress with her work as Kim Wexler in Better Call Saul being Emmy worthy, hopefully she gets better roles then this in the future.

Story The previous film tries to tell a more personal story and had some success but this film falls flat on its face. There is one scene at the beginning of the film that takes away the whole intrigue for the film and I wish it never happened as it would make the film much better. Both main characters story arcs are dumb and the villains motivation is basically money which is super dull and made me not really care about anything that happened to anybody in this film as it was incredibly predictable.

Script There is no denying that this film has some pretty chuckle worthy moments and I think I was doing this pretty consistently throughout the film which was nice to see. But some repetitive jokes fall a bit flat and really aren't as funny as the writers think they are. Also the drama is really not there, as I said I never really cared about any of the characters towards the end and the weaker script doesn't help.

Style The style of the film is pretty similar, there are some good high octane action scenes that are a lot of fun and in particular I love the sound of the guns and loud they are, it makes it feel like you are in the action scenes. However, there are other action scenes where the camera is shaking everywhere and I couldn't tell what was going on, there is also one scene where for some reason they try to make it look like a video game and it looks incredibly cheap and tacky.

Overall Overall, Bad Boys: Ride or Die is a below average film that for me is the worst of the franchise. It can't follow up from the previous film and this is probably the end of this franchise and that is probably a good thing. If you are a fan of this franchise, maybe wait until it goes on streaming, if not then give it a miss.

Instead of it being an action movie it became a doctor phil session. At no point in time was I on the edge of my seat wanting to know what happens next.

Funny (didn't laugh with a movie like this one since a long time. Jokes, the dialogues,.) great action shots,.. And the chemistry between Will Smith and Martin Lawrence is unmatched! The are so great together.

I put this movie in my top 3 above the previous one in my list of favorites. Can we now just forget what happend with Will Smith on the oscars and bring him back? It was a mistake, he apologised, move on. That besides, this 4th part is the kind of movie you can go watch twice in theaters.

The amount of progress the Film industry has made is mind boggling and each of the movie has something different since they have invested lots of dollars in either special effects or soundtrack or storyline. This movie has nothing even a kid will get bored and sleep.

Watching this movie is like watching a Hollywood movie of early 2000s. It doesn't even look like Hollywood movie. Even our Bollywood movie are 1000 times much better and you can't compare it to any Hollywood movies because Hollywood inspires entire planet Earth to invent and think out of the box so the human race can progress. This is not worth watching in theatres. I was deeply shocked that how such a junk and low quality movie is getting released worldwide. Don't waste your time and hard earned money.

38,1.0,9 June 2024,"Let me make it simple instead of exaggerating like most of reviewers here.

Action: That part is brilliant, but greatly nodding the head. The bullet flying around, bomb booming there & there, flaming up like a blaze, and yelling/screaming was the most exciting part.

Joke: Most jokes are completely dried up with a lack of points, and even adults here in the movie theater didn't laugh most of the time, except for several teenagers who didn't know what those jokes meant. Let me be honest here, we do laugh at some of it, especially the alligator part.

Story: The point of this story was to clear up the names of those two cops who got pinned on after they got set up with falsely accused suspects. They have to fight their way out. I wish it was additional a bit more of a detective perspective, so I could understand the step to step. So, the story was ok.

The worst part: The trailer scene because it showed two white men defending their property, which is what everyone in the United States should be doing, but in this case, this scene showed a confederate flag hanging down on the wall in the background, and several shirts hanging on the rope about being proud of purebred as it was somehow a bad thing, (Last time I checked, it almost 2025 and anti-white hate is unacceptable.) but the in the way this scene was put in and how it was made is the most unrealistic, bigot, and discriminate because it was painted as it was supposedly we all are alike which majority of us are not.

Overall: Do better next time.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
39,10.0,18 June 2024,"Hey there buddy,

Just finished watching Bad Boys, and I've got quite a few things on my mind. Man, I'm bummed out to say it was a sheer disappointment! The movie seemed to have all the ingredients of being a classic hit but unfortunately, it fell way short of my expectations.

First off, the plot was super predictable. There were hardly any twist or turns to keep me on edge. And honestly, the humor felt forced. While I hoped for some rib-tickling moments, all I could manage was a few half-hearted chuckles.

I have to admit, the chemistry between the leading men was still there, but it just couldn't save the dull storyline. The action sequences were okay but came off as over the top at times. It seemed more like watching a video game rather than an action-packed film.

Also, the dialogues lacked depth! It felt like they were just trying to fill in the silence rather than contributing to the storyline. And the overuse of cliches really got to me after a while.

Overall, I believe, they simply tried too hard to recreate the magic of the previous movies without bringing any new elements. A classic case of same old wine in a new bottle!

Sorry for the long rant, but these are just my two cents. Maybe some others enjoyed it more. Anyways, hope to catch up soon. Stay safe!

P. S. Let me know if you have any other movie recommendations. But no more Bad Boys, Please!","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
40,1.0,13 June 2024,"I just watched this movie, and it was an utter disappointment, far worse than I had anticipated. I knew going in that it wasn't going to be great, but I didn't expect it to be this bad. It felt as though the actors got together and said, ""Let's make a movie with a low budget,"" and then proceeded to do it without any clear direction or purpose.

The story, if you can even call it that, was practically non-existent. It felt like a series of random events loosely strung together with no real plot or coherence.

The direction was shockingly weak. Scenes were poorly staged and edited, making it hard to follow what little story there was. The pacing was all over the place, dragging in parts that should have been tense and rushing through moments that needed more development. The cinematography was uninspired, and the special effects, where they existed, looked cheap and unconvincing.

I kept holding out hope that the movie would redeem itself in the second half, but it only got worse. The plot holes became more glaring, the dialogue more cringeworthy, and the overall experience more frustrating. By the end, I was just counting down the minutes until it was over.

I strongly advise against watching this movie. It's a waste of time that you'll never get back. There are far better ways to spend your time than enduring this mess of a film.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

On a macro level, where are we as a society when an actor can do what Smith did, and that person gets a pass? Woody Allen, Roman Polanski, Ezra Miller and others commit crimes, make poor personal choices and their invitation to the silver screen keeps on coming.

Bad Boys: Ride or Die is an awesome action comedy film that takes the fourth film in a exciting fun emotional territory. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence has this series and own it. They still live up to it by keeping this series fresh and grounded.

The plot is great. It follows more into deep territory as these characters are getting older with Marcus having a heart attack and coming to peace with what he needs to do. And Mike getting married and anxiety when it comes to shoot outs. It has a lot of family dynamics.

The action sequences are fun and exciting. The script and direction is filled with emotions, and action. The cast ensemble is great. The climax taking place in a abandoned amusement park was fun. The cinematography is great and wild with its fast moving angles during the shoot outs. The music soundtrack is great.

45,7.0,9 June 2024,"Bad Boys: Ride or Die is an absolute rollercoaster of a movie that left me breathless and wanting more. From start to finish, this action-packed film delivered non-stop thrills, laughter, and an intense storyline that kept me on the edge of my seat.

Let me tell you, this movie is a perfect ten out of ten! The chemistry between the lead actors, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, is off the charts. Their banter and camaraderie are so natural and hilarious that I found myself laughing out loud throughout the entire film. Their comedic timing is impeccable, and their on-screen presence is simply electric.

But don't be fooled by the laughs, because Bad Boys: Ride or Die has some seriously intense moments that will have your heart racing. The action sequences are expertly choreographed and full of adrenaline-pumping moments. From high-speed car chases to jaw-dropping fight scenes, this movie delivers on the action front like no other. The stunts are jaw-dropping, and the cinematography captures every heart-stopping moment with precision.

What sets Bad Boys: Ride or Die apart from other action films is its ability to balance laughter and tension flawlessly. Just when you think you can catch your breath from a daring chase, the film throws you into a nail-biting scenario that has you gripping the edge of your seat. The pacing is perfect, never letting up on the excitement, and keeping you engaged from start to finish.

The plot of Bad Boys: Ride or Die is also a standout feature. It's not just mindless action; there is a depth to the story that adds emotional weight to the film. The characters are well-developed, and their motivations are explored in a way that makes you invested in their journey. The twists and turns in the plot keep you guessing, and the resolution is satisfying and unexpected.

I can't end this review without mentioning the amazing soundtrack of Bad Boys: Ride or Die. The music perfectly complements the high-octane action and adds an extra layer of excitement to the film. It's impossible not to groove along with the beats and get swept up in the energy of the movie.

In conclusion, Bad Boys: Ride or Die is a must-watch film that hits all the right notes. It's a perfect blend of laughter, action, tension, and heart. With its impeccable performances, breathtaking stunts, and a gripping storyline, this movie is a true masterpiece.

It's the Worst of the 4 Films.

Elements I did like about the Film -

💬 Much of the Comedy didn't land(more on that later) for me but there's 2 Belly Laughing moments that I had. 1. Was the Martin Lawrence walking backwards through Traffic because "" I Can't die"" 🤔😂 and 2 Was Directly after that when Will Smith catches up to him and Pulls his Gun out towards his face and says ""You're Telling me............"" 😆😂

🔮 I lIked the Surreal Scenes when Martin Lawrence ""goes to the other side""

💣 Some of The Action Scenes were Ok(More on that later again) I liked 4 Particular ones. The 4 were as follows, 1. Armandos Prison Scene was impactful 💥 and brutal as hell, you could feel the hits. 2. Reggies action scene was awesome ⭐, his movements were so swift. 3. Will Smith does this MMA super fast wrestling type move on ⏩ an enemy combatant in the 3rd act at the theme park. 4. Was the Very End Shooting Decision🤒

Elements I didn't like about the film -

📜 1a. The Plotline was Lackluster as Hell. Killing Captain Howard in Bad Boys 3 was an Absolute Disaster of a Mistake. It would of been FAR more effective if Captain Howard was Actually Alive on this Adventure to clear his name in Bad Boys 4. 1b. That said , we had an interesting premise of his daughter who was looking for Armando to Execute Him, and even that was lackluster, they needed to build into that far more, which they didn't, it was barely built upon and then they just tacked it on at the end.

😐 Much of the other bits of comedy that weren't funny, this is mainly due to the fact that Martin Lawrence has Terrible Low Energy & Awful Line Delivery.

🎉🥀 The other action scenes that were not very good, (helicopter scene & Martin Lawrence on top of the car on the road scene). These 2 particular scenes were not that good, and the edits were terrible in these scenes, too many damn edits.

💭 There's a concept in here with Martin Lawrences' character (mentioned above) that should have been used more(within the action scenes) and Utilised far better than it actually was.

😠 The Villain, not good enough, he starts well and then it's just nothing, he was as cursory as it gets.

Overall, not good enough, 2 Belly Laughs, 1 Great Action Scene & 1 Good Action Scene, just no, that's not enough at all.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
47,1.0,7 June 2024,"It's been four years since we were allowed to see the last Bad Boys film. To everyone's delay, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence returned as agents Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnet. Of course, the first mentioned was discredited at the 2022 Oscar ceremony, after he sold actor Chris Rock a bang for his head after making a joke by his wife. Because the whole world spoke of shame about this, it became a bit quiet around Smith and he has done little more. This fourth Bad Boys film should give his career a big boost again and time will tell if the world has already forgiven Will Smith. In my case, I never blamed him for anything and I thought it was all very exaggerated how everyone reacted. I have always found Smith a good and above all nice actor and nothing has changed at all to date. The third Bad Boys For Life from 2020 is nice, but didn't manage to hit the level of the first two films, I expect the same from this fourth part and that's fine, because this will be a lot of action and humor where entertainment is guaranteed.

And that's it, Bad Boys: Ride or Die gives exactly what you expect in advance and offers a tight two hours of pure popcorn entertainment. The film opens with a bickering Mike and Marcus. Marcus has to live healthier for his health, but when the two with screeching tires race across the highway, Marcus really wants to get something to drink. He gets 85 seconds, where Marcus seizes this moment to buy a hot dog and war Skittels within that time, but then the case is robbed. When Mike furiously walks into the case, a gun is immediately pointed at him, but Mike immediately starts whining at Marcus about his eating behavior. Bam! Opening film, something that immediately leaves its mark on the rest of the film. The gradient just fits perfectly with the predecessors and the directors on duty know how to make the course go as it should. Perhaps a point of criticism is the rather dynamic camera work. You may not really realize this at the beginning of the movie, but when the big action scenes come, it sometimes works disturbingly. Especially in the big end fight, where switching to a first person shooter mode, it looks rather cheap shooting. This was already shown in a making off, in which Smith controlled the image with his movements with a camera around his waist or on his arm.

The movie is really full of spectacular action and it's impossible for you to get bored. When Mike and Marcus try to purge the name of their deceased chief commissioner, they are forced to work with the captured Armando, son of Mike of course and bad guy in the previous film. Armando is the only one who can identify who is behind the plot. Unfortunately, the shoe is a bit pinching there, because although the writers may have tried to keep the story mysterious where the outcomes should amaze the viewer, the course and the outcome is very predictable and that is a shame. You will actually know quite quickly how or what in the 'trust no one' cat-en-mouse game where you eventually get stuck with a 'see' feeling. That's quite a shame, because this could perhaps have been prevented with some better writing, where you would still have a reasonable surprise to expect, but none of that. You actually see this very often in these kinds of films and of course you don't go there for a heavy plot twist where your mouth falls open, but here a very easy way is chosen to stay honest. Does that affect the film a lot for the rest? No, because as indicated earlier, you just get what you want and what you expect.

Bad Boys: Ride or Die is already the fourth film in the series and gives you as a viewer exactly what you expect from it. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are the bickering police duo again and end up in an explosive situation again. Perhaps a little more attention should have been paid to the story itself, because that is very predictable, but well, because you are constantly entertained, a large part of the audience will be a concern. However, the camera work is sometimes just a little too dynamic, making some things difficult to follow. For the rest, this is just popcorn entertainment from the top shelf and as mentioned you just get what you come for, a lot of fun humor with action, action and more action. If the Belgian directors Bilall Fallah and Adil El Arbi continue to do this, they can still make a few films, because this is just wonderful set your mind on blanc and just watch and enjoy without fuss or other difficult hassle.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
48,7.0,8 June 2024,"This movie was great! Very easy to digest, not as vulgar or over the top cursing like the others so maybe people miss the edginess but it Definitely deserves an 8 out of 10. Good storyline, and it reminds me of the 90s and early 2000s movies that actually were enjoyable to go watch in theater with family.

The characters of course aging as well as the actors so the movie was a great adjustment for that. I feel that he should have passed the torch to his son in movie so it could continue the franchise. However, who knows. Reggie, ex military may be stepping up to the plate to be the next one in line.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
49,10.0,16 June 2024,"No! No no NO!! What was this?? Bad Boys 3 and Bad Boys 4 were/are the worst of the series.

Sadly, the franchise has delved into Fast & Furious territory-crappy story, terrible dialogue, forced jokes, predictability, and horrible villains. But hey, at least it's still better than than tard Madame Web. That's the WORST movie of ALL-TIME. But I digress ...

Bad Boys needs to desperately return to its roots, ie Michael Bay. At least he can make the same ol' mindless action type of stories look and feel cool.

Bad Boys has gone downhill with the two brothers directing. Don't get me wrong, they can do a good job, but just aren't right for this franchise. Don't you agree?

While I was watching Bad Boys 4 tonight, I was really thinking about their Batgirl movie that got shelved, and how it may have looked. I mean, would you have wanted to see a Batgirl movie in the Bad Boys 3 & 4 tone?

The jokes didn't really hit. And sure, I LOVE movies of all types. This was strictly a popcorn, escapism movie-a very far cry from the rather serious yet comedic tone of the 1st Bad Boys. Martin Lawrence was overdoing everything. And cracking jokes while getting shot it is getting lamer and lamer with every movie.

The editing was atrocious and the editor needs to be fired honestly. The story was completely uninteresting, as were the villain and any supporting character. Who approved the script? It ALL STARTS WITH THE SCRIPT, PEOPLE!!

""Oh, they go have a shootout at the former crocodile amusement park, and then a crocodile shows up and .."" I would've stopped them right there and said ""Are you out of your mind?""

Anyway, I've written enough. I'm a HUGE Will Smith and Martin fan (I grew up in the 90s) but it's safe to say they I will not be supporting another Bad Boys film. Bad Boys 1 & 2 = CLASSICS, 3 & 4 = NO NO NO.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
50,1.0,7 June 2024,"The story's nothing special with one-dimensional villains, damsels in distress and the attempts to tie it into previous films is pretty weak, but the Miami setting is wonderful and used very well with exotic nightclubs and an iconic culture. The frequent and frantic action pieces are exciting and intense with enough explosions, violence and good use of clever camera work, constantly jumping between different views of the scenes. The characters are funny with plenty of jokes and humour as they make fun of themselves and each other whilst accepting they have aged. A couple of good cameos and an ok run time, but the choppy editing is noticeable at times.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

Now this isn't some masterpiece by any means but this may be the most consistently funny and most crowd pleasing of the whole franchise! Bad Boys 2 is my favorite and the level of that movie's intensity is nearly matched with this new one. Crazy that a fourth Bad Boys would even be considered the best or most fun. But here we are! Now I will say I miss the grittiness and even the aggression of the first two, but I appreciate the homages to the OG and love the new ideas, and visuals the two directors bring to the franchise! There's also a great action moment that gets the crowd hype! You'll know it and love it when you see it! As much as I love what the directors bring, I do kinda hope Michael Bay gets to direct the next one (if the box office gods let that happen).","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

It couldn't get worse. Cardboard villains, terrible music, poor photography, and heroes that are out of shape and having too much fun with each other. Nothing is better than mediocre. And I was a big fan of the original film.

It's hard to do #2 after a big hit and even harder to do #43, etc. Few films are able to keep up the momentum. This one should have stopped at #1.

It's clear that people have not forgotten the ""slap heard around the world"" and they never will as long as Will is on the big screen. Disliking Will Smith is fair enough but it's not fair to all of the other actors and actresses who did an amazing job.

Bad Boys: Ride or Die is an awesome action comedy film that takes the fourth film in a exciting fun emotional territory. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence has this series and own it. They still live up to it by keeping this series fresh and grounded.

The plot is great. It follows more into deep territory as these characters are getting older with Marcus having a heart attack and coming to peace with what he needs to do. And Mike getting married and anxiety when it comes to shoot outs. It has a lot of family dynamics.

The action sequences are fun and exciting. The script and direction is filled with emotions, and action. The cast ensemble is great. The climax taking place in a abandoned amusement park was fun. The cinematography is great and wild with its fast moving angles during the shoot outs. The music soundtrack is great.

It is a film with fun action and humor. This series is still staying fresh.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
55,4.0,7 June 2024,"I have been and will continue to be a Will and Martin fan! These guys showed up, showed out and entertained me in this movie. Prior to PanD19, I stayed in the movies. When I saw the trailer for this one, it brought me back. Total nostalgia, the movie previews, the seats, popcorn, people talking to the screen (yea I did a little and then I shut up) THIS MOVIE reminded me of a happy place!

I love a good laugh, cars, fighting and blowing stuff up. Bad Boys 4 gives you all of that and more. Absolutely loved this movie and will see it again with family. I know ppl are still in their feeling about the slap, I get it you're entitled to how you feel and spend you hard earned dollars. But I was taught not to judge because you don't want anyone judging you, no one is perfect, live and let live.

57,2.0,14 June 2024,"How this film is currently sitting at a 7.0 score in IMDb I don't know. It really is woefully bad in every way.

The story is so cliche, lazy and feels like it overstays its welcome. It just doesn't feel like there's much flow to it and it makes for a bumpy ride. It peddles so many tried and tested action film tropes and doesn't bring anything particularly new to the genre.

Then there is the acting which I must say is some of the worst Will Smith has ever done. He really feels like he is phoning it in on this one and it makes for an excruciating watch at times. Martin Lawrence gives a fine enough performance but his character is given dire dialogue that really grates. In fact all of the dialogue is either just cringe or cliche.

Then there's the villain of the piece who is a bland cookie cutter attempt at an antagonist. Him and all his goons are boring to watch and go through the evil guy motions.

I will say that there are a couple of half decent action set pieces, but the camera work doesn't always do them justice.

Maybe I'm in the minority here but this film just felt very lazy, boring and formulaic. Perhaps time for this franchise to say goodbye.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
58,10.0,7 June 2024,"""Bad Boys: Ride Or Die sets the stage for an exhilarating start to the 2024 summer movie lineup. Despite some missteps from its predecessor, this film delivers a thrilling action-packed narrative, catering perfectly to fans of the franchise. Clocking in just shy of two hours, it strikes the ideal balance, keeping the audience engaged from start to finish. There's a standout moment midway through that elicits spontaneous applause, reminiscent of the awe-inspiring scene in 'Captain America' when he wields Thor's hammer. Personally, I found it immensely enjoyable. While it may fall into the category of 'dumb-fun,' it masterfully blends cinematic comedy with adrenaline-fueled action, making it not only rewatchable but a definite must-see.""","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
59,10.0,12 August 2024,"Longtime, not to mention long in the tooth police partners Mike and Marcus ride together...they die together...and now are back in a superfluous sequel together. Mike is attempting to settle down, Marcus is trying to avoid stress, but that all goes out the window when their late superior officer Captain Howard is implicated to be in cahoots with a dangerous drug cartel. Naturally they feel inclined to preserve the posthumous legacy of their fellow policeman. Beyond good use of the Miami scenery, there isn't much going on here to justify this sequel's existence; it shoehorns in some major characters who aren't given anything substantial to do, with a stale plot that runs on autopilot featuring generic bad guys, uninspired action scenes (with disorienting camera work), and forced attempts at humor which continually flop. The results aren't funny or exciting despite how hard Martin and Will try to make it work, and attempts to recapture the magic of earlier movies only highlight how lame and unneeded this newest entry truly is...whatcha gonna do?

60,10.0,11 June 2024,"This substandard superficial movie has ""rescued"" the summer season for Hollywood. That's incredible to consider with its rote hackneyed action scenes, the low angle too bright clumsy cinematography, gratuitous unnecessary ""look at me!"" cameos, and absence of laughs and effective humor, and the obvious ad libs that just doin't work (the Reba scene with the rednecks elicited no laughs in the theater). Maybe it's me but I just don't find Will Smith and Martin Lawrence bickering and yelling at each other for two hours as entertaining.

It's amazing to see that Furiosa flopped and Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes (both very decent movies) grossed a lot less than this travesty. If there is not better proof of modern American idiocy, I can't find it. The problem is with this movie's box office, there will definitely be a sixth movie.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

Action packed and exciting I cannot wait for the directors cut of the movie I will like to learn about the back story and see the outtakes. Surprises popping every few minutes, never a dull moment.

Positives for Bad Boys: Ride or Die (2024): Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are once again on fire with their phenomenal chemistry. The action in the movie is once again well shot and choreographed, as much as I do enjoy the action in the first two movies directed by Michael Bay, especially Bad Boys 2 (2003), these two directors out do Bay in every way possible. The humor is done very well. I also love the story and how they make Mike and Marcus the target of the police. The villain of the movie, played Eric Dane, is one of the most easy to hate villains that I've seen in any movies and that's entirely due to the fact that I primarily know Eric Dane as Cal Jacobs from Euphoria and I despise that character so much to the point when this villain finally is defeated emllby Mike and Marcus, I was rejoiced with so much happiness.

Overall, Bad Boys: Ride or Die (2024) is yet another banger in this franchise that never misses and if you love these movies then you'll definitely love this one.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

The film showcases impressive and stylish cinematography, while still retaining the iconic touches of Michael Bay, the director of the first two Bad Boys films. Adding to the excitement, Michael Bay himself makes a cameo appearance, and there's even a nod to TikTok influencers.

Although Part 2 remains my favorite, I haven't laughed this much in a long time. Martin Lawrence was hilarious, and Will Smith was fantastic! I would rank Part 4 as the second-best in the series. Like many others have said, if you don't take it too seriously and simply enjoy the ride, it's a fun and entertaining two hours. I hope it does well at the box office so they'll consider making another one. Despite the Bad Boys getting older, they still have what it takes to entertain!

I really don't understand the hate for Will Smith either! Yes, he made a mistake-just like all of us do. But you're there to be entertained, not to judge him based on his personal life. In the movie, he plays Mike Lowery; he's not Will Smith for those two hours. If we judged most celebrities the way some people judge him, we wouldn't have anything to watch or listen to. I don't condone his actions, but he defended his wife with a rash decision that he likely regrets. We've all been there at some point in our lives. Judge him by the character he's portraying, not by his real-life actions. And if you're one of those who insists on hating and judging him, I wish more people lived as perfectly as you!","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

The characters completely lack the necessary development and depth, and their dialogues resemble tedious clichés rather than real and impactful conversations. While the film tries to tackle some deep issues, these attempts are quickly forgotten due to superficial treatment and lack of attention to detail.

However, Martin's obsession with Skittles and snacks felt a bit silly, as did the mystery surrounding their chief's cartel dealings. The movie was shorter than expected, but the side characters, like Reggie and Armando, were fantastic. The plot was average, reminiscent of an 80s action movie. It included some tense moments, such as a main character having a cardiac arrest and another experiencing a panic attack.

Now, about Will Smith: there's been a lot of backlash against him following the infamous Oscar slap. While I don't condone his actions, everyone makes mistakes. We all have our moments of poor judgment, and it's part of being human. We should focus on forgiveness. After all, we're Bad Boys for life! Fist bump!","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

And im not that guy who is just boycotting will smith, i love most of his films, but this one isn't on that list.

The villains in this script are supposed to be developed, yet they come across his human-less cardboard cutouts. You know even Darth Vader had a little bit of humanity. Something that drove the viewer to be intrigued by the villains plan. If you wanted to make a slapstick movie about two cops, you could have at least worked some good dialogue. I can't remember one quote from the movie. This is one of the most unrewatchable movies I have ever seen. But what do I know, everybody above the line got paid some big bucks. The purpose of this movie was to pay people, not entertain. I imagine it will lose money and show up on streaming video with viewers forgetting it very soon. Great camera work on the Florida city skyline, facepalm! Even the scene with the local white guys was just horrible. I was the only one in my theater for the 6:00 showing on thursday. And looks like the box office shows that no one trusts these guys to make a good movie. Jerry Bruckheimer approved the script? I simply don't believe it. It was rushed. I was bored.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

The audience that was with me had a blast and recognized every nod to the previous films. The dynamic between Will and Martin are brilliant held to together from this bond created by the love that is left from this franchise. I honestly believe that Adil El Arbi & Bilall Fallah were excellent choices to continue this series, the cinematography felt unreal. In some scenes it felt like I was watching a first person shooter and other scenes I felt like I was watching brutalities that would be in a John wick movie. After this I would love to see where they take the story although for now, this was a great place to end the Ride.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

The other supporting characters were meh, marcus and mike were typical selves and no matter how you feel about Will Smith after his shenanigans, it was ok. Some over done explosions, i wish hollywood would stop with that and keep effects more realistic. (cars exploding and flipping over after a bullet to the radiator type stuff or a frag grenade exploding into a huge fire ball). I feel that action flick style from the 80s should be over and people should be shown a more realistic action sequence. Hollywood would save a lot of money and people wouldnt have a false idea of what a rifle does.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
86,9.0,7 June 2024,"Finally an AWESOME summer film!!!

No Spoilers:

I've always enjoyed the comedic styles of Martin Laurence and Will Smith going back to the late 80's.

The chemistry between the two has always been great and they still have it in this fourth entry of the series. This might have been my favorite role Matin has ever played. In fact, he makes the movie.

The plot kept my interest and there are some fun callbacks spread around the film. Overall, the film was FUN! You have action, comedy, music and quality dialogue for once. Lots of laughter in our theatre and I look forward to going to see it again before it gets released at home.

Enjoy!","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
87,9.0,10 June 2024,"Despite the comedic misfires, Martin Lawrence manages to salvage some moments. His ability to wring humour out of even the most predictable jokes is commendable.

However, these moments aren't enough to salvage the film. Ride or Die never elevates itself beyond a mediocre action-comedy. It plays it safe, content to rehash old tropes rather than offering anything fresh or original.

Who Should See It?

Bad Boys: Ride or Die caters to a specific audience. If you're a devotee of the franchise with low expectations for plot or character development, this might provide a mindless summer escape. But for those seeking an intelligent, well-written, or emotionally engaging experience, look elsewhere. Ride or Die might rev the engine, but it ultimately sputters out, leaving viewers yearning for the inventive action and witty dialogue that defined the original Bad Boys.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
88,1.0,9 June 2024,"To be honest I find it astonishing that they even made this.

How long ago was the first one? It feels like a lifetime ago.

While the first one was very exciting the sequel was not so great. That's where they should have stopped.

The third film was a surprise coming so long after the first two and, let's face it, was interminable. It literally goes on far too long.

I've never managed to sit through in its entirety. Not even on television.

Now we get this fourth film . Its amazing that they made and released it. Bad Boys is a thing of the past. I don't think that anyone was counting the days until another Bad Boys movie.

As for the movie itself: meh!! You've seen it all before. Over the top stupid action and unfunny ""comedy"" that doesn't land.

Don't waste your money seeing this on the big screen. I don't really advise seeing it at all.

I will always love the first Bad Boys movie.

Stop making rubbish sequels way too many years later.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

After seeing ""The Fall Guy"" we were primed to check out the stunts and they were amazing. The acting was great. Smith and Lawrence were quite funny and Jacob Scipio s a nice addition to the mix. Tiffany Haddish's role was absurdly amusing. The women were strong and the men were all over the place. The plot had innovative twists that made a big difference. We loved the alligator. The villains were very bad and the Bad Boys were hilarious. If you need pick me up, this movie will do quite fine. Check it out😁.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

Loved the twists that kept on happening in the movie (rather predictable to someone who's watched a lot of movies) but nevertheless great experience.

Love the tiktok fellas cameo at a single scene, and thank you for an obvious nod to John Wick action at a certain scene by certain individual, wasn't expecting that, but it was great, and unexpected!

Overall I would definitely recommend this movie to every action/comedy lover, as this is just another banger that you must watch.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
91,9.0,26 July 2024,"Loved the originals back in the day, but super disappointed with this one. Everything about it, from the script to the direction to the editing is so incredibly amateur, it's surprising Smith allowed it (there was a time I felt he managed to consistently output quite high caliber movies). The directors are clearly no Bay, and in fact a lot of the movie comes off as made-for-tv quality, with no scene really landing or immersing the viewer as it should. Not helped of course by a wafer thin plot, awful dialogue, and OTT acting throughout, especially by Lawrence (who simply wasn't funny here - overacting doesn't make unfunny material funny, so not totally his fault, he tried at least). It's all a classic case of style over substance, though even the style is woeful - in the same way that overacting doesn't make unfunny dialogue funnier, adding slow-mo to badly shot, over-CGI'd scenes also doesn't make them better scenes. The editing is frequently bad, confusing the action as well as jarring the viewing experience - I don't recall a film where the main components didn't gel quite as frequently as this one in several years. It's basically a string of 'comedic' scenes that don't land (at one point, a crocodile model lands next to Marcus during a shootout (not even with rednecks) and he yells 'Oh s**t, it's a Redneck Jurassic Park!' - like Jurassic Park was about crocodiles), and action scenes that so badly want to be stylish but fall flat (there was one particular shootout at an abandoned theme park that reminded me of the Waterworld show at Universal Studios, complete with exploding barrels on boats and bad guys collapsing through broken balconies when shot). I'd say don't waste your time, but I'm sure some people will still enjoy this movie as dumb summer fun. I can't help feel like they've wasted the potential of the concept. Another franchise that should have been left in the past, perhaps.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
92,6.0,18 June 2024,"I need first to express here how much I hated ""Bad Boys for Life"". I really thought that it was a terrible, cheap, tired, rehash of old plots. I say this here because, against all odds, I quite liked ""Ride or Die"".

At Mike Lowrey's (Will Smith) wedding, his long-term partner and best friend Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) suffers from a heart attack. During his recovery they learn that their mentor and former Captain, the late Conrad Howard (Joe Pantoliano) has been accused of bribery and corruption related to Cartel operations in Miami. Despite orders not to, unwilling to believe the evidence, they start to investigate, and this leads them back to Armando (Jacob Scipio) Mike's son, Howard's assassin, and former member of the cartel.

I'm not going to suggest for a moment that the film is great. Much of this again been done before and in better films. Martin Lawrence remains more tedious than funny and his ""I can't die"" schtick has been done elsewhere. Tiffany Haddish is surely being punished for something with this role, a one scene cameo that could not be more annoying. I hated the panic attack storyline, particularly as it's fixed with a ""man up"" moment. Also, if the villain twist in this movie comes as any form of surprise for you then. . . . would you like to buy these magic beans I have for sale?

I say all that, but again, I quite enjoyed the film. I liked most of the big action set piece at the end and the Reggie scene is great. I liked the return for Vanessa Hudgens and Alexander Ludwig and their interactions together. I just felt that, whilst not matching the ridiculous scale of ""Bad Boys 2"" this was a bigger and more interesting film than the last one. Do I need another one? I'd probably go, but equally the series has had a lot of repetition already, so I'm not bothered if not. Crossover with ""Fast and Furious"" though - yes please.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
93,1.0,8 June 2024,"I was a fan of the funny, frenetic energy seen in Bad Boys I and II, but the ""funny"" has been missing in the last 2 movies, especially this one. There are a lot of attempts at humor that are completely funny and fall flat.

The action and story are fairly undercooked as well. The story is as predictable as an buddy-cop action thriller, and the action scenes are mostly gunplay sequences which you've seen in every other movie.

Thankfully, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are good as usual and hold the movie together. It's very mindless and occasionally boring, but you may find some entertainment in the music and banter between the two leads.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
94,10.0,8 June 2024,"With so much of social media spoiling movies and us having access to the movie before there is even a trailer, then Bad Boys For Life being not as great as it could've been I didn't have my hopes up high for this one but it didn't disappoint.

I loved the chemistry between Martin and Will and it's a testament of time from the 90s from when it all started. When it comes to these movies both stars get to shine together and never seems like one has to the dim their light for the other to get their shine on.

The character development over the years has been great to watch from the supporting cast, even though the original wife of Marcus Burnett didn't return, it didn't take away the supporting cast roles in the small parts that they shared on screen together.

96,8.0,22 June 2024,"This is another instance of that old saying about Hollywood: It's a place where a thousand people run to the place where lightning struck hoping that it'll strike again.

Bad Boys: Ride or Die is a boring retread of a tired story that wasn't interesting the first time, but somehow the filmmakers thought, ""Let's try something completely new! We'll do the same thing we did all those other times but THIS time we'll have the characters make references to how they're really, really old. You know, cuz that's what all the young movie goers think is really funny.""

Acting-wise, you'd think by now Will Smith would try to change it up a little and not try to be the same character in a different role. Because I'm telling you that 1990s shtick he's been doing for the last 40 years is sooooo played out.

I couldn't make it all the way through, because it's just the same junk, different day.

You'll go watch it because nostalgia and you desperately want to give one of the stars a second chance at being relevant, and I kinda get that. When my uncle Colin got out of H Block my mom let him stay with us, but that didn't work out and neither did this film. It's just not worth the boredom.

Ignore all of the negative reviews. They came from individuals who haven't even seen the movie. All they are going by is the infamous crap that happened at the Oscars. None of that has anything to do with this movie.

McSteamy is still fine as ever and is getting finer with age. This movie was so action packed and insanely funny. I was yelling at the screen the whole time. I saw Bad Boys 2 in the movie theaters thirteen times and I think I will be going to see this one about the same many times because it was so good. Will Smith is fine and so is that darn son (in the movie). It wasn't really that predictable like some movies. Do yourself a favor and go see it.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
99,3.0,6 June 2024,"It's all in the family - someone took Fast & Furious notes. So no pun intended - if anything the Bad Boys have to apologize. But let's keep it ""real"" . This is a movie, this is insane, this does not make much sense. It will either be carried by the charm (or lack thereof) from our main characters or it won't.

Martin Lawrence is being annoying - always nagging away ... but is he? Because there is an inciting incident, that kind of changes his demeanor. Will Smith has his own issues of course - and we still are dealing with the backlash from the third movie (and I still feel they missed a great chance - naming the third part 4 life? I mean come ... they could have called it ride or die and held on to the 4 ... 4 here).

Good action sequences, even the ones with the Uwe Boll technique (as some are saying online - they may look weird as behind the scenes looks ... but they do work in the movie - very well edited and all that). The question is are you ready to shut off your brain and enjoy this for what it is ... many things do not make sense otherwise. Like not taking one individual who proved to be quite useful to the ... well last mission/ending of the movie.

Maybe in a different universe, there are better plotlines ... but we do live here ... so let's make do with what we get ... and not overthink it. Good soundtrack, almost makes you forget about the cliches.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
100,9.0,13 June 2024,"It's been a long time since I've been this distracted by directing/cinematography this try-hard and obnoxious. Every single frame of this movie reeks of desperation and insecurity in the written material. If you thought ""The Gray Man"" had the most distracting use of drone shots ever, be prepared for it to be blown out of the water by Bad Boys 4. Every shot was a new attempt at a different camera style or tracking shot. It was like watching a 2 hour music video. Good directors know when to let a scene breathe. We're not dealing with good directors here. Competent? Absolutely. Good? Nope.

All the performances are pretty bad except for Martin Lawrence, whose character is now relegated to just straight up being a clown, accentuated constantly by the directors' aggressively unpleasant use of extreme close ups. The dramatic bonding moments before the climactic action scene was shot like a comedy scene. But it was meant to be heartwarming. That being said, he plays a good clown, and Lawrence is the only actor who seems to actually be able to let go of his ego.

Will Smith isn't at all believable in this role anymore, he just isn't a good enough actor to convince you he's anything but a pampered movie star. It's funny how the writers have to make so many caveats and leaps to allow Joey Pants back into the franchise after his character's death in the last movie. The chief in the first movies was just a regular guy who was friends with the leads, but this movie retcons him to be this unflappable moral hero who is treated with so much reverence, Will Smith just HAS to have this large picture of a dead man at his wedding. Apparently Joey wasn't just some likeable schmuck, but he was actually an unrelenting super cop, that everyone saw as a messianic figure, who was killed because of his genius skills uncovering drug organisations. The Joey Pants from the first movies was the kind of guy who would throw his computer in a rage because he forgot how to log in, now he's a genius who knows how to send complex encrypted messages?

There are about a dozen moments of unrelenting cringe throughout. There are moments the filmmakers are thinking are either funny or dramatic but they just come off as phoney and pandering. All the ""bad ass"" moments are just embarrassing.

The whole plot and resolution is a foregone conclusion, you know exactly who the bad guy is gonna be revealed to be, and how the plot will resolve, within the first 20 minutes. They don't even have the guts to kill off useless side characters whose death could at least add a sense of consequence to the weightless action scenes.

In a staggering surprise, the musical score and needles drops were actually pretty good and often restrained. Most modern action flicks have dreadful and annoying music choices, but in this, it was the least egregious aspect of a pretty bad 2 hours.

The best part of this movie is the part where the villain is asked ""when did all this corruption start?"", and I swear to god his answer starts with ""well, after 9/11..."". They did an arrested development joke but totally sincerely. That's the most unaware thing I've seen a film do in years. Classic 10/10 moment, no notes.

One scene indicative of the lazy writing is when Vanessa Hudgens looks at an art piece, sees a QR code and says ""that's strange"" and lo and behold, the QR code is crucial to the plot and leads the to another message from the omniscient dead Captain . But QR codes are crazy-common in art exhibits, posters and adverts, just by some miracle she assumed the QR code had to do with the case? This is equivalent to a detective movie, where the lead cop sees a chewing gum wrapper on the street, says ""boy that's strange"", proceeds to pick it up, and sees it has crucial details of the murder suspect written on it. That's how contrived this writing is. Oh, and the first 10 minutes is just non-stop of the worst exposition dialogue you've heard in the last decade.

The forced ambiguous dialogue leading up to this point is excruciating too . Also, why is this huge art night club gig happening in the middle of the day? It's also funny that there are a tonne of returning characters from the previous film that no one cares about, but the directors think you do. I saw this movie with someone who loves the Bad Boys movies, and he didn't know who most of the returning characters were.

The worst parts of this movie are when it tried to be heartfelt and dramatic. I felt sick and angry that these filmmakers were trying to manipulate my emotions with the subtlety and nuance of a bad 13 Reasons Why episode.

Marcus FaceTimes with his wife in this movie, and it's a huge pet peeve of mine when a simple image of someone over FaceTime looks like it was shot with an 8k, million dollar camera. Just use the real phone to make the call! It'll take way less time and look so much better, and it won't take us out of the movie! Steven Soderbergh's 'Kimi' did this. Why spend more many to make your movie worse? But I guess that these directors in a nutshell.

Theres also a subplot where Marcus is enlightened after a near death experience, but it changes from scene to scene. Sometimes he won't care about anything, and the next, he's right back to his neurotic self, and he just swings back and forth. Also, amazing that in 2024, there's still a movie so dumb that someone having a panic attack is fixed by someone slapping you and telling you to man up. Legendary stuff right there.

So yeh, not a great movie, occasionally fun and wild, but mostly overlong and annoying. Martin Lawrence and the music was good, the direction could have been good if they had any restraint, and Will Smith and the plot are total flat lines. Oh yeh, and the product placement is crazy. Little hint, if the movie has a bunch of Skittle product placement (ala Shazam 2), then it's probably a bad film.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

I absolutely loved the nod backs to the original...especially the classic pose from when Julie was kidnapped. Also loved the fact that the original mark mancina score made its way back. Action was great with outstanding special effects.

While I expected some of Will's usual subtle humor, I was let down as it didn't appear to be as many of his ad libs as I usually see in a Will Smith film.

While I don't feel it was as great as the first two, it was still action packed and entertaining.

Wasn't happy with the casing of Theresa, she just couldn't fill the shoes of Theresa Randle. Eric Dane played a fantastic villain, but I found it hard to really get into his character because he is McSteamy afterall and ""saves lives""!

104,7.0,29 July 2024,"Overall, ""Bad Boys: Ride or Die"" was a disappointment. Watching old men's antics for trivial reasons felt ridiculous. Yes, Will Smith is still in good shape, but everyone knows how old he is, and he is certainly no Tom Cruise.

While there were moments where the jokes hit the mark, they weren't enough to salvage a shallow and boring storyline. The film seems to have forgotten that it's 2024, not 1995 like the original installment. The plot feels outdated and fails to resonate with today's audience.

On a positive note, I appreciated the absence of any forced agendas in the movie. However, this alone couldn't make up for the overall lackluster experience. ""Bad Boys: Ride or Die"" failed to live up to the legacy of its predecessors and left me longing for the charm and wit of the earlier films.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
105,10.0,23 July 2024,"Bad Boys franchise followed me from my teen years all the way to now, decades later. I've noticed something recentley, as I age myself, that actors, as they get older, lose a lot of that charisma or that ""ja nes sais quoi"" they had when they were young and fearless. Their acting skills deminish, their sense of self-evaluation, or at least evaluting their work, becomes blurred. Myopia, or loss of ability to be critical of oneself becomes an issue for us all one day... I think anyway. This movie, just as much as the 3rd one, shines a light on that fact. Acting has gotten pretty bad, and Martin Lawrence was hard to watch. What happened to his head, btw? Storyline, and movie action sequences, are all seen before and things turn from bad to worse in a hurry. All kinds of cliches are put on rinse and repeat, while the good ole racism jokes capture our attention once more. Overall, a B grade movie with a big budget and big expectations that falls flat on its tummy. Hope they stop the franchise now and stop embarassing themselves.

106,10.0,22 June 2024,"""Bad Boys Ride or Die"" is the latest installment in the long-running ""Bad Boys"" franchise, but unfortunately, it feels more like a cash grab than a genuine effort to entertain. The movie reunites Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, two actors who once brought a dynamic and humorous chemistry to the screen. However, this time around, their performances fall flat, and the comedic spark that once defined their partnership is noticeably absent.

The plot follows the usual formula of high-octane action sequences and over-the-top stunts, but it lacks the originality and charm that made the earlier films enjoyable. The storyline feels recycled, and the script is filled with clichéd dialogues and predictable twists. The humor, which was a cornerstone of the franchise, now feels forced and uninspired, failing to elicit more than a few chuckles.

The film's pacing is uneven, with action scenes that seem to drag on without purpose and dramatic moments that lack emotional depth. The supporting cast does little to elevate the material, often coming across as mere caricatures rather than fully fleshed-out characters. The direction and editing also leave much to be desired, with some scenes feeling disjointed and poorly executed.

In essence, ""Bad Boys Ride or Die"" struggles to capture the essence of what made the original films successful. It leans heavily on nostalgia but fails to deliver a fresh and engaging experience for both old fans and new viewers. The film serves as a reminder that sometimes, it's best to let beloved franchises rest rather than dragging them out for another round of mediocrity. While there are moments of action and spectacle, they are overshadowed by the lack of genuine humor and compelling storytelling. Overall, ""Bad Boys Ride or Die"" is a disappointing addition to the franchise that fails to live up to its predecessors.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

But at the same time, there are things that are, at least from my point of view, inferior to the previous installment, like the story and the screenplay. Regarding the story, compared to Bad Boys for Life, it was of a lower level because it didn't have many surprises and twists like the previous one. And regarding the screenplay, the previous movie had a better screenplay than this one because the scenario and the order of events and how they are presented was a lot better, and cought the attention of the person who is watching more.

But this does not mean that I didn't like Bad Boys: Ride or Die. I liked it, and I am looking forward to see what more the franchise will have in the future. That is why when it comes to the score, I give Bad Boys: Ride or Die 7 out of 10.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

110,3.0,9 June 2024,"Probably the most exciting movie out right now full of humor, stunts, decent fight scenes, and just pure action. Although both guys have been Bad Boys since 1995, it might be time to retire. I actually thought that's what Martin Lawrence's character did in 2020.

This time around there's a snake in the department involving the killing of their captain in the last movie. That fat waste of space DJ Khaled makes a cameo but it's safe to say he won't be back in the next movie. Thank goodness with his annoying self.

Still, the humor and action are why we come to these movies. There's plenty to keep you interested and I actually got to say I'd see this again in theaters. Summer cinema is alive with this one!","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

Moves At a Great Pace

Funny

Acting On Point

Decent Character Development

Movie Theater Elements

Kicking Sound Track

Action Scenes Return to Glory (mostly)

SUMMARY: Our Bad Boys have always been entertaining as the detectives dive into the heart of the Miami underworld. This film is stupid fun, with an exhilarating and fast pace like the cars they drive, holding little time to get into deep artistic dives. It pulls from previous stories, integrates fun references that many will remember, and helps push our characters down familiar avenues. The fourth installment offers some character development, nothing too deep or poetic, but enough to extend our characters to something more than bullet-launching bad boys. It fits into the themes well, helps pick up from the better qualities of Bad Boys Three, and keeps their fingers on the pulse of just a fun and engaging period. And much like the other films, they are just fun, with the same comedic splendor of the earlier films with the insults, slapstick humor, and the response to the stupid antics occurring. It's rated r for sure, but that attitude blends so well and makes this movie another nostalgic trip worth taking. One thing that has improved is the technology to bring the exciting elements to life, loading this film with plenty of theater-worthy qualities to shake up the theater. The action is fast, frantic, and has lots of the familiar elements, with little deviation from the edgy goodness that comes with it. In my showing, my seat quaked from the sound assaults, with visuals that were crazy busy, but so exciting and filled with that attitude you expect in this film franchise. Load in the kicking soundtrack this franchise has, including a few comedic songs to lighten the mood, and you get so much of the original formula to just have a fun time at the movies.

DISLIKES:

Some Story Elements Feeling Unfinished

Very Fast Wrap Up

The potential Setup up

Aggressive Language At Times

A Better Developed Villain

Not That Original

Summary: No movie is perfect though and this film still struggles with some elements that continued additions can struggle with. Despite a decent story, several elements felt unnecessary, unfinished, or perhaps very stupid and overdone that I had wished been left out and the time focused on another story. A few of these moments involved the captain's family which feels very bland and could have gone more, while others are set-ups for what feels like not only a fifth movie but the next duo to join forces in the cartel wars. These elements are okay and not the worst by far, but they didn't do any favors to strengthen the story. A better-developed villain could have gone a long way, one with more tricks and threats that weren't so familiar or done before. Several of his associates were also holding potential, but alas, fell to mediocre levels that pale to some of the other auxiliary characters from the past. More action would have been nice for me, especially at the end where things seemed to wrap up faster than anticipated, and could have done more. A small thing for me, but big for others, the movie's foul language gets a tad out of hand, but there are far worse games in this field, just be warned.

The VERDICT Perhaps not the most original movie sequel, Bad Boys' fourth installment is familiar, fun, and feels fresh that they took a step back into their wheelhouse. With a great buddy system in motion, Smith and Lawrence bring the magic of the decades back and keep things fun and engaging while always edgy. The story elements serve their purpose of developing their characters, while the action gets major upgrades worthy of a theater visit to take full advantage. I loved the comedy, the pacing, and just getting lost in another fun summer flick. Sure, the movie needs some more originality, trimming off some storylines reserved for whatever is to come, and could have put some more time into making a better villain. Yet, most aren't going to care and just enjoy the fun experience for what it's worth. Therefore, I give this movie:

112,1.0,15 August 2024,Been a hardcore fan of the first bad boys and also enjoyed the second but this one lacks depth and the way the camera moves around all the time makes it really uncomfortable to watch and takes away a lot how you experience the story. It's like they try to cover the lack of depth with some spectacular filming but they made it worse. Quite disappointing. Don't get me wrong it's still entertaining but it's just not bad boys anymore as it used to be. There just could have been worked more in depth around the characters and conversations instead of trying to focus only on the filming. It's like the directors want it just too much. Keep it simple and don't overdue it. Especially when you have good actors.,"June 7, 2024 (United States)"
113,4.0,6 August 2024,"Just can't since the Chris rock slap.. Tried my best but Will has completely killed his career...

Here's some more words to hit the 500 word criteria..

What happened next was surreal. Smith's smile vanished, replaced by a determined stride toward the stage. Barely 10 seconds after Rock's quip, Smith delivered an open-handed slap to the comedian's face. The audience collectively gasped-was this a scripted bit? But it wasn't. Rock, still recovering from the shock, exclaimed, ""Oh, wow! Wow. Will Smith just smacked the s-t out of me."" Smith walked away, not looking entirely furious, but rather with an expression that said, ""That's what happens when you mess with my woman.""","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
114,10.0,26 July 2024,"Let's start with the poor choice of movie title. Bad boys 4 life was more suitable for the forth movie, but that fact didn't harm this movie quality. The rest did. I had no expectations from this movie to do anything else different then it did at the other three movies, so it is not that big disappointment.

This movie is a good time for all viewers, that like an action humoristic movie. It felt like the longest of them all, but actually it was the shortest, it just didn't have so much convincing or compelling plot, when it comes to compering it to all other films, that came before it. The feeling is that now the fourth movie is the one that has to put a stop to the series.

I had the greatest times with both of first movies as a teenagers and then as young man, but now it feels too generic and too worn out. Martin Lawrence is the start of this feature, like in the meaning that he is taking all the burden on his shoulders. He is funny, he is in control and his taking command of this thing, while Smith is falling behind.

The plot doesn't matter, because though the tables are a little bit turned, for both main characters, the rhythm stays the same and everything is running in the same path, without any surprises or new interesting new characters. Its like a meeting with an old friend you exactly know what to expect from and not see him for several years later.

Probably it is better to watch it on the movie theater, to give all action sequences an added value and maybe let the movie feel more impressive, but nothing changes the fact that this movie is more of the same and probably will not be remembered by old or new fans to come, because his lack of any element that would divide it from other movies of the genre, that are running in parallel these days.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
115,10.0,25 July 2024,"1. I wish Michael Bay would've directed this movie, and they get different writers.

2. A lot of scenes they tried too hard to be funny, and they were terrible - such as Marcus in the middle of a shootout - trying to eat Jelly Beans, - then getting powers from drinking juice.

3. A moments this film is very predictable.

4. Marcus character is annoying, just stop trying to make him funny every scene.

5. There's a few things in here from the older films that is brought back, that's honestly getting played out.

6. This is a comedy first, then action second type movie, when it should be the other way around.

Conclusion it's completely trash.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
116,9.0,18 June 2024,"If you have a below average IQ you might enjoy it.

I left the theatre and heard a group in their 50s quoting the ""funny"" lines in the movie but it felt like they only enjoyed it because they were white and liked the way black people talk...

Why these filmmakers felt it to be organic to bring a witch; a long lost song, purgatory and soul mates into an already established brilliant series I will never know.

The directors need to be fired and sent to work on music videos! They quite clearly want to steal styles from iconic more talented people from the 2010's, but have no clue how to do it. The camera never stays still; you cannot process the action; neon lights reflecting off everything in every scene; lense flare used as a ""stylish"" way in every internal scene; not to mention they have zero clue how to create a cohesive story even with the most basic ChatGPT script.

The story is just two dumb to even comment on, and after 24 hours I genuinely cannot remember. This is a straight to DVD movie with an excellent lookalike cast. What happened to just having an exciting Detective story with a couple of side stories to keep things exciting, you know like lying to a witness about who you are; staying at your partners house with his wife, accidentally popping X whilst conducting a investigation....

The humour is just not there, I laughed at this monstrosity not with it. They've made Martin as dumb as Thor in Love & Thunder, far beyond a point where even Martin can't save it. They both felt like they didn't want to do it but were contracted and forced into it.

In an attempt to raise the stakes the film uses three characters that literally no one cares about. The wife, the son and the captains daughter. You'd have been smarter to bring back Marcus's sister or at least make us like anyone in this film.

I quite honestly don't even know how to review this 😅. From the chats in purgatory, to the unexplainable and unnecessary panic attacks and the constant stupid flashbacks to earlier on in the film!? I can rattle my brain to think of a comparable experience to this film. Truly the worst film I've seen in many years, probably since the third.

It's sad to say because I LOVE the first two and find myself and my friends quoting them on a regular basis. I wanted it to be so good and I was excited to see Will and Martin in ANYTHING let alone bad boys.

But terrible film, should have never have happened, I can only imagine all the money the studio is spending to make people think this is good.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

Martin Lawrence carried the comedy and great action sequences also.

Really enjoyed how they brought Reggie's character into it a little bit more also with his own scene that was probably the best scene in the movie to be honest.

Very fun movie to watch as they always are and if they were to do another one you always know that it's gonna be worth the watch no matter how old they are.

Like the little references from the first and second movie also, making sure they don't forget the roots of where it came from.

This felt like the old days and the movie was very funny and action packed. There was never a dull moment while watching this movie. I really enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. My husband don't really like any of the old Bad Boys movies and he said Bad Boys 4 was actually really good. Don't listen to the negative comments.

Will Smith and Martin Lawrence switched roles as Martin becomes the aggressive lead of the duo. Their chemistry is off the chain no matter who takes on the lead. The expectation of fugitive son taking on a role in this movie and Markus's son in law having a huge part was a pleasant surprise. It is apparent he was a fan favorite and as he has literally grown up throughout all of the Bad Boy installment. There were certainly a lot of ""F"" bombs throughout the movie, but it is still great entertainment.

I recommend everyone go seen it.

The camera angles on the other hand are very peculiar and make you feel slightly motion sick, this doesn't take away from the movie at all but it's something worth mentioning.

Seeing will smith back acting in some good old fashioned action movie was a delight, the film is slightly more bloody than the previous entries also.

A solid entry into what is a pretty great franchise. I highly recommend viewing this at the cinemas.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
122,10.0,7 June 2024,"I'd completely forgotten about ""Bad Boys for Life"" (2020) but luckily there are were few flashbacks to remind me that ""Mike"" (Will Smith) had been the target of a son he didn't know about - ""Armando"" (Jacob Scipio) - and that both he and partner ""Marcus"" (Martin Lawrence) risked life and limb to get him behind bars. Well now, a few years later, ""Mike"" has just got married; ""Marcus"" has had a revelatory out-of-body experience and their beloved ""Capt. Howard"" (Joe Pantoliano) has been killed. The authorities become increasingly convinced that he was on the take from the drugs cartels. $20m in your bank account can arouse some suspicions - though the Porsche and beautiful waterside home of ""Mike"" might have too! Anyway, our duo are having none of these scurrilous allegations and decide to investigate. ""Howard"" expected some sort of disaster, so has left the pair some breadcrumbs that lead them to suspect that there is someone close to them who is corrupt. With the body count piling up, they turn to the incarcerated ""Armando"" who thinks he may be able to identify the ringleader. That just makes him a target too - so pretty soon it's a nimble, deadly and quite grumpy triumvirate who are on the trail of the murderers. From now on we have a standard and predicable action adventure with loads of lively pyrotechnics, car stunts and an hungry albino crocodile to accompany some quite witty repartee between the two men who are clearly very much at ease in each other's company. There's a bit of eye candy from Alexander Ludwig and the underused Vanessa Hudgens and the pace of the drama builds to a denouement that works well enough whilst screaming sequel at us loudly. It's nothing at all new, but is an engaging exercise in on-screen charisma and I did quite enjoy it.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
123,4.0,3 August 2024,"Looks like we live in a world where a ""film"" like this can make profit. People would actually go and see this, and this is rated above 6 on IMDB? Great.

After the FF series finally intrdocued demigod powers of family and went into space, one would think that products like these wouldn't work any more. But they do.

I have to give the producers credit for doing enough research to ensure that this film contains tiktok memes, call of duty cutscenes action, RGB lighting and absolutely nothing that would insult the intelligence of the target audience.

If you view this as a film, and not a well-produced moderately budgeted content, there is nothing of value.

The story is nonsensical, full of cliches and there is no way you can buy anything that is going on. The ending is spoiled around the 13 minute mark, after that you're just curious how they will get there. Since the story wasn't a priority, the plot just forces the characters to do whatever is necessary to ensure the ending scene happens. Motivations are gound-level, and even these get shifted and switched whenever necessary.

Everybody talks in descriptions and exposition, which again isn't a problem since there is no story to follow, nothing to try to understand, no reason to explore the motivations, people just do stuff when the plot needs it.

The humor ranged between unfunny and obnoxious. I watched this at home so I was able to skip the long Marcus' ramblings mostly. I gave it a chance but quickly understood that I shouldn't have, it really felt like I was an audience member in a comedy club where the Joker from the 2019 film was performing.

The action was over the top, which is expected from the BB series, more so from the 2nd attempt after the exhumation of the franchise. The problem was in that it was way too unrealistic, not in terms of lethality, but literally in terms of excessive CGI. Nothing felt real, so if bright flashes and sound effects don't excite you, there is nothing of value action-wise. For example, I can appreciate over the top action in the Mission Impossible franchise, because I can see real things happening, supported by CGI. In this ""film"" nothing felt exciting, probably because I've played videogames and seen lots of FPS games trailers to get amazed.

The ""getting old for this"" and the ""one last time"" themes were done to death even before this film, so at first they try to do something like this, but quickly abandon it in favour of colorful videogame imagery and excruciating comedy.

So, overall, Bad Boys: Ride or Die was the worst film I have seen in years, if you even consider it one. But I can only congratulate the people responsible for slapping it together, since the numbers never lie. This product was successful despite it being absolutely void of any emotional value.

P. S. Since I live in Ukraine, the drone scenes left a mixed impression on me. I wouldn't say those hurt my feelings, but definitely sparked an emotion the producers probably didn't intend.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

But this is so shallow it protrudes a constant stream of clichéd one-liners, impossible situations, and emptiness. It's one of the worst films I've ever seen. It has no redeeming qualities. Everything seems to have been done on the cheap. It's basically a money-grab, cashing in on past success but offering nothing new.

The action scenes were stupid. The ""heroes"" were completely untouchable, but never missed. The story was one-dimensional and utterly banal.

126,10.0,18 July 2024,"Bad Boys is one of those franchises that brought a lot of money, yet is far away from being a cult property. This movie basically brings nothing new to the table, that previous three didn't have. The chemistry of the two leads saves the film from being totally forgettable. I won't say I hated the film or was bored with it, but I didn't have much fan as I had with previous three films.

Our duo here has to face with their own mortality and purpose of life all while looking to clear their late Capn Howard's name. The movie largely relies on previous movies, in terms of jokes and vibe, especially the first film. In fact, I don't know how much Lorne Balfe had to tinker with the score here, but all I hear are tunes I heard already by Mark Mancina for the original. The action scenes are your typical, loud, bang and flashy, but without your Michael Bayhem style; instead, all action scenes rely on some really clever and inventive camerawork.

Ofcourse, Mike and Marcus still carry this movie though their basically ""married"" relationship but all jokes seem washed up and aren't funny. As for the plot, it's by the book, and completely predictable. I wish that more attention is given to Eric Dane, who plays the antagonist and chews every scene he's in, but he had to do very little here and basically was another cardboard, one-dimensional villain. So there is that. At least Vanessa Hudgens and Paola Nunez are hot as before.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

I mean this is what it is.

A popcorn film with a plot designed to be done in an hour or two with just enough emotional beats. Its very standard but more so peppered with Daddy-er jokes. Now Will Smith (post ""Life Threatening"" Slap) is about to get married AND his illegitimate son is making his life difficult (Lol). Matthew Lawrence is old and weirdly stagy for no know reason. He especially looks very under the weather throughout the film. He feels like he actually had a debilitating stroke. They are already setting up some 'sequel' possibility with that 'Seal' son.

It just your fun average fair film you bring your family with (I did). And enjoy. No one really went up the pedestal here BUT hall of shame to Alexander Ludwig who is so uncomfortable in the film lol.

129,9.0,13 June 2024,"Will Smith will always be a Legendary Star.

I'm a big fan now of duo Belgium- Moroccan screen-writers & director team Adil El Arbi & Bilall Fallah, i love their gritty, frantic, violent & strikingly visual style, they gave Bad Boys For Life & Bad Boys Ride or Die that New cinema boost for todays movie world.

The first Bad Boys (1995) & Men in Black (1997) are two era defining movies to me from the beautiful 90's & both are in my all-time top 10 fave films list. Also i, Robot (2004) makes my top 10 list, so as you can see 3 Will Smith movies are in my top 10, so the guy means alot to me.

Not to mention Big Will is still my all-time favorite Rapper!!! I grew up in the 90's listening to Code Red, Big Willie Style & Willennium, & in the early 2000's Will dropped his best (slept on fire album) with LOST & FOUND (2005) my most listened to album ever.

I also loved Enemy of the State & Wild Wild West because in the 90's Will Smith was the biggest movie star in the world & everyone had his films on video & watched the hell outta them. No one was cooler than Will Smith in the 90's.

Bad Boys Ride or Die was an absolute blast of action-packed buddy-cop fun & a proper popcorn blockbuster. I had an absolute blast watching this in the cinema with my wife, we laughed out loud at many times & was blown away by the awesome action sequences & i loved the colourful cinematography that just popped on screen. Really Ride or Die is a spectacular action buddy-cop flick.

This time around our beloved Miami cops become fugitives whilst trying to unravel a mystery & high up corruption within the police department. They gotta clear their late Captain's name (some nicely put together & smart cameos from Joe Pantoliano as Captain Howard once again) & have to deal with a new sadistic Mercenary villain.

Will Smith delivers a fantastic performance once again as Mike Lowry, but this time he's not as sure of himself & suffers with panic attacks due to feeling guilt that his son murdered his beloved Captain Howard. Mike is in constant fear of losing the ones he loves & Will gives the performance a powerhouse dramatic touch along with his hilarious banter stuff with Martin Lawrence.

Oh & Martin Lawrence is absolutely brilliant here, probably the best he's been since the first film. Martin's family man cop Marcus is on a spiritual ride throughout this movie & believes he's indestructible & becomes a super cop kinda switching roles with his partner Mike. The chemistry between Will & Martin is pure genius & the funniest they've ever been. That fun banter & strong chemistry is what holds these movies together & what keeps us coming back to watch these Bad Boys.

From exciting new camera angles & first-person perspective action sequences to in-your-face kick-ass brutality & hilarious banter Ride or Die is a fresh feeling Bad Boys movie. Things are kept fresh in this entry so it still feels new & exciting & that's why it's the best Bad Boys movie after the original 90's Classic.

Ride or Die is a new action, instant CLASSIC in my opinion.

Ride or Die is full of characters from the Bad Boys franchise that add a nice connective cinematic tissue to the other films.

The movie looks fantastic with colourful neon-lit cinematography & the action is fast & furious with bloody kick-ass brutality. Some of the camera angles are excellent, especially the first person camera perspective of Lowry & Burnett in the big final showdown action sequence. Ride or Die is kept entertaining with fast & frantic kick-ass action scenes & laugh out loud gags & banter, so much lively energy zips throughout this buddy-cop action comedy you can't help but get swept along for the wild ride. I truly consider this 4th Bad Boys movie an instant CLASSIC, there for gets the ultimate 10/10 rating. Honestly this movie is a beautiful piece of Escapism from the real world & all it's harsh drama, a great movie.

There's so much jam packed into this fantastic sequel that i can't wait to watch it again.....& again as i have all the Bad Boys films.

Will Smith is still a LEGEND & Martin Lawrence is back better than EVER.

Greatest Buddy-cop duo ever. Definitely an Instant CLASSIC.

This movie takes original fans back on a thrill ride just like before, this was incredibly well done the 3rd installment sort of fell abit flat. But with a return to form from Martin Lawrence and him getting spotlighted again it has done him justice. A well pieced together trip of comedy action nostalgia and enjoyment in my opinion. I don't get any of the naysayer opinions. Due to the fact these movies are fun! It's all it's mean to be fun and exciting and drawing you In. Will done a great job of taking a backseat to an extent and letting Martin have his moments in this one! These 2 are the best comedic action due of the last 30 years.

Older fans want to be able to hold onto the basics of what's this show was about originally. It's been a long time since iv watched a film again and wanted to go straight back to the cinema within days and see it again!

I think this one should be it though, the characters are not young cops anymore so I don't know how believable it would be in another few years seeing Will and Martin almost reaching late 50's in another Bad Biy sequel but hey if it's a good script you never know those two might be able to pull it off.

The movie has a slow start, but when s**** gets real, the action and suspense ramp up to a satisfying final showdown. The supporting good guy characters and the antagonists in the film are strong and all have relevant roles to play in the story. The the direction and style of the film is more dynamic than the last. There is creative camerawork, vibrant visuals. Some of the editing early in the film is a little janky, but it improves throughout. As chaotic as some of the action gets in the film's biggest scenes, it's not hard to follow. It's a well made modern action film that shows that this franchise isn't ready to die anytime soon.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
134,10.0,10 August 2024,"Will Smith and Martin Lawrence continue to have great chemistry as the Bad Boys. This entry does put a new spin on the franchise by having Mike (Will Smith) be the scared one and Marcus (Martin Lawrence) be the chilled calm one which makes for some great comedy and tension. Mike finally has a family and that means something to lose. Martin continues to deliver on the humour and many moments with him got a chuckle out of me.

Unfortunately, the plot is incredibly predictable. The so-called ""twist"" is not even remotely surprising and every character arc is very generic. The action scenes are fine but lack the octane energy of the first 2 movies. There is one great action set piece but it is not from Will Smith or Martin's character.

Still, it is fun popcorn entertainment and I had a good time with it.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
135,9.0,29 July 2024,"I enjoyed this action comedy! It had a lot of laugh out loud moments and some good action scenes. What are people expecting from a light hearted action comedy. It's more meaningful than rush hour and less serious than lethal weapon.

The comedy mostly comes from Marcus in this movie due to his outer body experience from a near death experience from the beginning. It always delivers on action and it was good to see the reconnection of Mike and his son.

This movie takes off from the last in a good way as not to let the audience know that it makes them look old like it did in the last movie.

Enjoy the fun of it.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
136,7.0,24 July 2024,"Of course the film still feels huge and like a 200 Million Dollar movie, but the writing just missed the mark for me.

The franchise never really had great villains, but the ex military boogeyman dude this time just feels even more cliche than ever.

Sure, it's still very weird seeing Will Smith and trying to pretend he's the character and not the walking slap meme is practically impossible, but he still nails the cool guy role with ease.

So let's get to my biggest problem with the movie: Martin Lawrence. Up until now he's been the comic relief. The lovably weird guy, who can still deliver when things go down. This time he's just a bloated mess, that's annoying at best and a cringeworthy cross between Scooby-Doo and Peter Griffin at worst. He's not lovably weird in this movie, he is just insufferable and stupid bordering on braindead. He feels like a Mad TV character, that doesn't work, but is still stretched out over 2 hours.

The franchise was never overly sophisticated or clever, it was always dumb fun. This time it missed the crucial fun part.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
137,10.0,23 July 2024,I don't usually write reviews but I can't stop thinking about this movie. Without a doubt what I think is the absolute best of the Bad Boys movies. Martin is so good hilarious. I am glad to see a movie that rehabilitates Will Smith's career. This movie is I forgive him for that Oscar's debacle. It has a lot of action comedy and heart. The whole cast is a great ensemble. However Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are still very much the stars of the show. My Biggest advice is to go see this movie. I literally have not stopped thinking about this motion Picture ever since I saw it a couple of days ago. Go see hit.,"June 7, 2024 (United States)"

I love how they handled Marcus this time round, he got his mojo back and was definitely funnier of the two this time round.

Great plot to keep the Captain involved, some incredible action and the one liners hit their mark. I won't give too much away, but man we need to see more of Reggie next time, he almost stole the show.

Congrats 👏

The whole trama is not really great but i think it was the best way to be able to put all those funny moments in the movie, you can't have it all always, the solution to the problem as well is a bit meh... but it works with the whole friendship problematic thing they have.

142,7.0,11 June 2024,"This is the fourth instalment of Bad Boys & I think it's about time they make this the last. This sequel seemed a bit dragged and unnecessary. It's always great to watch Mike Lowrey & Marcus Burnett cleansing the streets of Miami from the bad boys, but after 30 years these guys too need to rest their batch.

As far as the plot is concerned, this movie is the immediate sequel to the Bad boys for life (2020) and involves the aftermath of Captain Howard's death, also with some connections to the second part in which the cartel was involved. Both Lawrence & Smith are yet again inseparable & indispensable. But this time they have a new kind of enemy, someone from the inside.

Right amount of comedy and action and thrill.

Went with absolutely no exceptions Being that this is the fourth movie and usually sequels get worse with time but I was really impressed.

I had not seen action and comedy done like this in a long time Would even say I would pay to re watch it on the big screen again.

144,6.0,8 June 2024,"Bad Boys For Life flirted with Fast & Furious territory but Bad Boys: Ride or Die fully commits to it. It's full of deep cut references, drastic revisions to the franchise history and even completely redeems the previous films villain. It all works because the film also doubles down on what made its predecessor a huge surprise whilst avoiding a bloated run time.

Will Smith and Martin Lawrence remain flawless together. Their opening scene makes it feel like it's been mere moments since last time as opposed to the 4 years it has been and none of the off screen events seep into this. Swapping their dynamics was a great idea cause Lawrence being the daredevil and Smith being more fearful ensures it stays fresh.

Paola Nuñez, Vanessa Hudgens, and Alexander Ludwig all return and prove why they deserve to stay plus Joe Pantoliano doesn't let his character's death stop him from bringing some welcome heart and humour. The villains are kinda naff though, especially with a surprise bad guy so obvious they shouldn't even have attempted to keep it a secret.

Adil El Arbi and Billal Fallah have only gotten more confident with their direction. The inventive staging from last time has gotten more ambitious with drone shots that would make Michael Bay proud and a first person shooter style shootout which single-handedly gets it another point. Their direction here is further proof that cancelling Batgirl was a huge mistake.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
145,8.0,8 June 2024,"The duo is back for the 4th time in this action buddycop franchise. Bad Boys: Ride or Die explores too many plotlines or bolt between too many characters, but brains-free enjoyment reigns supreme. These two actors, with nothing matching but their goatees, have a spiky bromantic chemistry. They don't just ping off one another's lines - they lock and load each other. The movie feels sccruffy and overstuffed at times, but contagiously good-natured. Although the franchise may not be at it's strongest, The Bad Boys are still providing innocent amusement to it's fans with it's bromance.

My Rating : 6.5/10.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
146,6.0,24 July 2024,"Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) is getting married. Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) has a heart-attack at the wedding and sees the late Captain Howard (Joe Pantoliano). The Captain tells him that it's not his time and he comes out believing that he's invincible. Meanwhile, McGrath (Eric Dane) is framing the Captain as a corrupt cop.

The boys are back and they are still pretty good. Their banter is still quick. The chemistry is still there. I don't remember the stories from the previous movies. I ended up accepting all the expositions and moving on. It's been so long ago that I forgot that Joey Pants was in this franchise. I do have an issue with the premise.

I get the need to raise tension by making everybody believing in the fake evidence. I'm fine with most of that except for Judy. That makes no sense. Are we supposed to believe that she's part of the conspiracy or she thinks that the boys are part of the conspiracy? Neither of which are that reasonable. It's really bad writing although that has never been this franchise's strength.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
147,9.0,23 July 2024,"Directors Adil & Bilall seem to have understood the assignment clearly, i.e. To come up with an entry carrying the storyline sensibilities of a 2000s throwback actioner but tailormade for audiences that enjoy buddy cop films in today's times. The plot is fairly basic, but well connected to the earlier instalment(s) - doing its job of making our lead duo move from point A to point B with instances of smartly staged action blended with Martin Lawrence's frequently nonsensical (yet hilarious) one-liners.

Not all emotional arcs leave a mark, though the film doesn't aim for the skies in that department. It shines in its execution of set pieces, which includes some Michael Bay signatures too (hello DRONES!). They're frenetically edited and woven together, not letting the pace dip even for a second. This actually works FOR and AGAINST the film - the stakes don't feel too high at any point; however, you won't find yourself reaching for your phone for a good couple of hours.

P. S. Loved the end-credit ""donkey bit"" and Marcus' whole story around it. Also, well done Reggie!","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
148,9.0,15 July 2024,"Honestly, I've always thought that the Bad Boys saga is very underrated because, after all, it's a comedy film, so you can't demand as much from it as you would from other films that are more about tension or fiction, like interstellar.

This movie is very good in my opinion because it revolutionized the history of the ways of telling stories on the big screen. Usually a normal movie has quiet shots where when the characters talk the camera is still focusing on them and that's how cinema has always been but this movie is different, we live in a world where applications like tik tok and instagram cause us high levels of topamine for everything that can be seen within them and the movie realized this because they know that at some point if they continue doing movies like this they are going to lose people's attention so in this movie something is always happening even in the smallest conversations the camera is moving which makes you not lose focus of attention already looking more at what the plot is very good and tells an understandable and entertaining story it is totally enjoyable even if you have not seen the other 3 so in my opinion it is a very good comeback that the saga could have.

Totally recommended.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
149,8.0,21 June 2024,"Bad Boys: Ride or Die delivered exactly what I expected of it: a couple of hours of brainless blockbuster fun, with Martin Lawrence and Will Smith doing their now very familiar schtick. If you're a fan of the franchise, the film will not disappoint.

I hadn't seen the previous Bad Boys film going into this one, and I had to a bit of connecting the dots to make sense of the plot, but Ride or Die isn't exactly taxing on the brain: Miami cops Mike (Smith) and Marcus (Lawrence) attempt to clear the name of the late Captain Howard (Joe Pantoliano), who has been framed for being in cahoots with a drugs cartel; in doing so, they themselves become suspected of foul play. Helping the guys to ensure that justice is served are Mike's son Armando (Jacob Scipio) and cops Kelly (Vanessa Hudgens), Rita (Paola Núñez) and Dorn (Alexander Ludwig).

The script is formulaic, but allows for plenty of buddy humour between the leads (some of which lands and some of which doesn't) and plenty of action. Much of the comedy is derived from the fact that, having survived a heart attack and had an out of body experience, Marcus now believes that he cannot be killed because 'it's not his time yet', which is amusing at first but becomes more laboured as the film progresses (I can't remember where, but I'm sure I have seen this done before). The action, however, is a lot of fun, with lots of shooting and explosions, with the best saved for last, as Mike, Marcus and pals launch an assault on the bad guys' lair, a disused alligator park (although no-one told the alligators, who are still in occupancy and very hungry).

6/10. It's instantly forgettable popcorn nonsense, but sometimes that's all I want.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
150,8.0,12 June 2024,"Directed by Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah. A runtime of one hour and fifty-five minutes. With an R rating.

The summer is here, and ""Mike Lowrey,"" played by Will Smith, and ""Marcus Burnett,"" played by Martin Lawrence, are hitting the Miami streets, guns blazing. These two long-standing detectives/friends are back at it in the fourth installment of the ""Bad Boys"" franchise.

The impossible has happened with ""Mike"" in a multitude of ways. ""Marcus"" is enlightened and letting loose for once. It's like a ""freaky Friday"" moment. With both of them swapping minds.

Regardless crime never stops.

""Kelly,"" played by Vanessa Hudgens, and ""Dorn,"" played by Alexander Ludwig, are back as well. ""Rita,"" played by ""Paola Núñez, is now taking the place of ""Captain Howard,"" played by Joe Pantoliano.

A man named ""McGrath,"" played by Eric Dane, has made it his mission to frame ""Captain Howard."" Which is tarnishing his legacy. ""Mike"" and ""Marcus"" set out to clear his name. Which only gets them in the thick of it.

A lot is going on, and this whole thing somehow also involves ""Mike's"" son, ""Armando,"" played by Jacob Scipio as well. ""Armando"" is not the most liked person right now. Especially by ""Captain Howard's"" daughter, ""Judy,"" played by Rhea Seehorn.

With tons of new and old faces. ""Mike"" and ""Marcus"" will have to do everything they can to clear the captain's name as well as keep them and their families alive in this action-packed comedy.

""Bad Boys: Ride or Die"" was so much fun. The action was great, but they focused on the comedy more. Martin was in rare form. He had my daughter and me cracking up the whole film.

I loved the creative decisions they made in this film. Switching certain things up while still giving us a film full of nostalgia. Paying homage to the previous films.

The ""Bad Boys"" franchise will always be dear to me. I saw the first one with my mom when I was nine. I remember the joy and excitement it made me feel. I was on a trillion jumping over the couch and shooting fake bad guys. I still had that same enjoyment feeling with this one; I just wasn't jumping over couches anymore.

It was the perfect blend of new and old. No spoilers, but ""Reggie,"" played by Dennis Greene, might have the best scene of the film. What a character ark. My daughter only saw the first film, so some of those key nostalgia scenes didn't hit her the same. BK still loved the film even without knowing certain contexts. It's great because it gives me another reason to watch the previous films.

I don't know where I rank this film. I know the second one was my favorite, but this one is up there with everything that conspired during the film. The directors said they will probably have one last film and maybe a spinoff, depending on how it does at the box office. Well, let me tell you, it killed it at the box office, pulling in one hundred and four million worldwide. They had the nerve to say Will Smith's career was over. Tuh.

Be prepared to laugh a lot and have a lot of fun. You get the full film experience. We ride together, we die together-bad boys for life. I give this film five more fires 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥.

After 30 years, it's amazing that Will Smith and Martin Lawrence still look the same whereas the captain looks much older than before. Bad Boys are good movie series. The story line is more consistent than 'Fast and Furious'. I like them a lot. I remembered I bought the VCD after I watched the 1st with my friends in 1995. Then DVD for the 2nd movie. I will definitely get the BD when it's released. I'm surprized to see Reggie. He is 'increditable' this time. If you're a fan of the other three, you'll like this one.

We finally get to see the smooth and cool yet fiery Mike Lowrey character that was present in the first and second movie. Will Smith delivered to perfection, a real career revival. Martin Lawrence humor is irreplaceable as always, the movie did well in adapting to his age and abilities. 8/10 due to some unnecessary cringy scenes in the chopper, appearance of a music celebrity that is... cringetesque. All in all I finally enjoyed a Bad Boys movie after movies 1 & 2. Shame that they killed off the captain, huge blow to the story that could have been.

153,1.0,8 June 2024,"Bad Boys: Ride or Die (2024) delivers an exhilarating sound experience, featuring excellent audio mixing, rich low-end sounds, and a fantastic blend of different music genres (hip-hop, pop, reggaeton), alongside a suspenseful action soundtrack. The first act's camera work is intentionally messy and shaky, creating a sense of chaos that aligns with the narrative, but it later alternates between clear and chaotic, adding a unique dynamic. The POV shots are a standout, providing a fresh perspective.

The film's summer locations are visually stunning, with impressive daylight and nighttime scenes. The writing is witty, obvious, straight-forward, and fast-paced, yet it keeps viewers engaged throughout. The VFX, while occasionally excessive, are well executed and contribute to the film's overall appeal.

Mike (Will Smith) and Marcus (Martin Lawrence) make a great duo, their chemistry driving much of the film's entertainment. The film is peppered with amusing Easter eggs and trivia, adding an extra layer of surprise. The action scenes, characterized by slow motion and tense OST, are both fun and funny and make you say, in a both surprising and aversive tone and facial expression, ""Damnnn,"" despite the chaotic cinematography. The aerial action scenes, combining strong cinematography and VFX, are particularly tense and well-done.

The film has a reasonable runtime, and the action scenes are thrilling enough to elicit genuine excitement. Although the film starts off bumpy, it gradually becomes more enjoyable, making for a solid watch.

Bad Boys: Ride or Die is a fast-paced, visually impressive film with witty writing and thrilling action scenes. Despite its chaotic start and exaggerated visual storytelling, it progressively improves, offering a solid and entertaining viewing experience.

For thirty minutes, I gave the ACT I a chance to impress and accepted all the slow ride but you get bigger ripples of loaded BS as the movie goes on... lots of throw backs that doesn't work too.. rather than bringing back memories, it changes those memories. I WISH IT WAS NEVER MADE! That's what happens when the industry wanna force a sequel! Prolly one of the only sequels that it's second is better than the first!

One of the standout features of this movie is its seamless integration with the previous films. The inclusion of scenes from the earlier movies adds a nostalgic touch and provides context, enhancing the overall experience for longtime fans. This clever use of flashbacks not only enriches the plot but also deepens the emotional connection to the characters. Speaking of characters, the chemistry between Mike and Marcus remains as electric as ever. Their dynamic is the heart of the film, driving both the action and the comedy. However, it's not just the leading duo that shines; the supporting cast also fits perfectly into the story, contributing to the film's overall charm and effectiveness.

From the opening scene to the final credits, the movie is packed with adrenaline-pumping action, witty banter, and moments of genuine emotion. It's a fun and enjoyable watch, showcasing the enduring appeal of its iconic characters.

Given all these strengths, it's surprising that the film holds a rating of only 6.8/10. After delving into some of the negative reviews, it becomes clear that some critics were overly focused on external factors. Complaints about the characters being ""narcissistic granddads"" or backlash related to Will Smith's personal controversies seem to have colored their opinions, detracting from an objective assessment of the film's merits.

While I did enjoy this, I think there are a bunch of reasons it doesn't reach the highs of Bad Boys for Life. Everything is a slight step down. The musical score is awesome but not as prominent. While there is one beastly action scene, the rest aren't nearly as memorable.

There are so many subplots with at least three of them being completely unnecessary. Certain story elements are predictable. The villain isn't nearly as good. There are a few dumb character decisions. I even noticed small things like continuity errors and bad ADR. And for the love of God, stop putting DJ Khaled in movies. He can't act.

Even with all those flaws, I still had a pretty good time with this movie and would love another sequel.

161,9.0,9 July 2024,"My expectation was really low because of the last movie and was surprised it was a really enjoyable movie.

The whole cast has a great chemistry and the banter between Lawrence and Smith is so entertaining. Also it is so refreshing to see a group of people working together to fight the bad guys instead of the lead being Over Power and doing everything.

I was a little concern with them casting Eric Dane as the main villain but wow he played a very good bad guy. In recent years Hollywood has been portraying villains as moral grey characters. Not in this movie he plays a very evil man and does it really well.

It is differently a movie to check out.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

I watched this in a movie theater and everyone was laughing the whole time. THIS is what comedy movies should be like. Get your movie tickets or watch it at home. It will 100% lift up your mood. This movie has the potential to be the new classic go-to film like Big Momma's House, Fast & Furious etc. I don't understand how it doesn't have 10/10 already. Everyone's raving about it!

We only went because the ""Critical Drinker"" said it was enjoyable, but I expected it to be formulaic and mildly amusing, just with lots of big explosions - you know, mindless fun. But it was, well, just that IN SPADES. It is funny, charming even, very well paced, almost all the jokes actually land, the soundtrack is good and some of the cinematography was really quite inspired. A blast from the past, not because it is a sequel, but because it was just the perfect summer blockbuster fun, like the good old days.

The characters just really reminded me more of themselves from the second film. Of course there's still jokes about them getting old, but it's not the scorned lover and secret child story that, in my opinion, fell kind of flat in the third movie. Even if you think the cartel drugs and money story is overdone, you'll still enjoy Will Smith and Martin Lawrence because their chemistry in these films is just perfect. It's also entirely worth it just for the Reggie scene. You'll know the one when you see it.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

There are moments where you feel like you've seen a joke before but they pull out the rug under you with an unexpected thing and it always turns out good.

The action scenes are somewhat serious with a mix of comedy and i liked every one of the set pieces, even if you're not a fan of comedy films this one should at least get a good chuckle out of you.

Audio is good, performances are great and the chemistry between will smith and martin lawrence is there, you won't get bored of them.

The things i didn't like; it takes a bit to get interesting - the mistery behind the plot isn't too intriguing, and the antagonist didn't get much of a spotlight.

Anyways it's worth the ticket and it's an enjoyable movie.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
166,8.0,8 June 2024,"Bad Boys: Ride or Die is an ideal summer film. The film includes humor, action, and chemistry necessary for a good buddy-cop film. Lawrence and Smith reprise their roles as Miami police partners Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowery. As with each previous entry, Will Smith is the more professional cop and Martin Lawrence is still the ""goofy"" partner. Their mission involves clearing Capt. Howard's name, who is posthumously accused of being a dirty cop. They can only trust a select few and their very small band must battle a much larger army of mercenaries, street gangs, and corrupt members of law enforcement and government. The plot is no less ridiculous than previous films and just as fun.

My quibbles are relatively small, but detract from the final product some for me.

1. The film makers are able to use the same guy (Dennis Greene) for Reggie in all four movies, but they can't get Theresa Randle back as Burnett's wife?

2. Both Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are obviously older, but Martin Lawrence appears unhealthy. Every close up he has blood shot eyes.

3. As with the three previous films, the finale is tedious because of all the ideas and resolutions crammed into the final act. So much must happen to finish the story that seems to take forever to reach the end.

Worth a look if you've enjoyed any of the previous entries, but don't expect more than a good summer film.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
167,8.0,19 August 2024,"I don't know what it is about Bad Boys but somehow they always deliver. I was hesitant about the third part when it came out in 2020 but when I left the theater I was pleased and as if teleported back in 2003 when I watched the second installment. This time I wasn't worried and it proved me right - Bad Boys: Ride or Die could just be the best sequel of them all.

It's a perfect balance between comedy and action where everything is at its place, jokes hit hard and at the right time and when the narrative needs to be serious they cling to it firmly. I also liked the camera work a lot, with tons of cool shots and camera angles never previously seen on Bad Boys; it means the franchise is changing, growing, making it better, probably not as big on explosive side from the Bay era but just as furious and highly octane as any other.

The movie doesn't forget about the family too. Although the plot doesn't show anything extraordinary or unheard of - it's a comedy action flick after all - and this is actually not what we came for looking in a Bad Boys movie. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence's fantastic duo is uncanny and so fun to watch, they really made their roles their own by now, even though sometimes you see their age written all over their faces as if saying that they are so tired and would rather lie down and rest than go through all that trouble shooting the movie - they can't be bad boys forever you know but as long as they are they might just have some fun with it as well.

Overall Ride or Die is just as great as the late sequel and is way better than any other worthless sequel that no one is asking for. I didn't ask for this one either but at least they made an effort and an excellent one too. If there ever would be a part five of Bad Boys I'll know it would be great because these boys cannot make it bad.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

Mike and Marcus have to clear their late Captain's name because they think he was framed as being connected to the cartel. They sort of need Mike's terrorist son Armando, who assassinated their Captain, to get out of jail in order to accomplish this.

The chemistry is fully back. The humour is back. The great script is back. Plenty of high action, gun chases and explosions as per to keep you happy.

By far, this is my favourite Bad Boys movie, yep even better than the first.

One thing that concerned me was Martin Lawrence, in some spots throughout, but particularly in the last scene at the barbecue. He looks as if he's not doing great, it's in his eyes, sometimes the speech is a bit slurred etc. Something ain't right is all, but still a great movie.

Martin and Will do an amazing job. The movie knows what it is and it stays true to that. Strong male as well as female characters. Great arch's that get completed. All the actors do a great job of filling in their roles. No subversion or anyone doing what they normally wouldn't. It completes the bad boys story in a great way.

Bad Boys: Ride or Die reunites the stellar duo, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence back on screen. After a very long time, these guys still have the same wit and energy. The same chaotic drive we got from the 1995 debut. It's amazing keeping up such a pace and standard.

There is enough laughter to go around for everyone because like always, Marcus (Martin Lawrence) brought much humour to the table with his death syndrome admidst the entire action scenes. That's one of the layers I enjoy about this franchise, outside of the crimes, top action sequences, human frailties, they still manage to throw in some comedy.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

One of the best aspects is the spiritual quotes, Martin Lawerence and Will Smith are treasures the last few decades they are magnificent even their cheesy films are great in my opinion. I think it's genius how Reggie's character has gotten better since Boy Boys II and interesting how this has a lot to do with what it's like being old.

174,10.0,20 June 2024,"In the latest installment of the ""Bad Boys"" franchise, ""Bad Boys 4,"" the dynamic duo of Will Smith and Martin Lawrence once again graces the screen with their undeniable chemistry. While the film leans more towards comedy than its predecessors, it manages to strike a balance between action-packed sequences and emotional depth.

The exploration of the relationship between Will Smith's character and his son adds a layer of complexity to the story. We witness heartfelt moments that resonate beyond the adrenaline-fueled car chases and explosive gunfights. It's refreshing to see these tough-as-nails detectives confront their vulnerabilities and navigate family dynamics.

However, the real scene-stealer is the enigmatic character Regie. With just a mere 2-3 minutes of screen time, Regie leaves an indelible mark on the audience. His mysterious aura and unexpected actions keep viewers guessing, and his impact reverberates throughout the entire movie.

""Bad Boys 4"" delivers the perfect blend of action, comedy, and genuine emotion, making it a must-watch for fans of the franchise and newcomers alike.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

Martin Lawrence is hilarious, and their chemistry is royal. Several cameos made the movie even more fun. The movie house was packed, and there were no empty seats, even for a matinee. I believe Martin did this movie for Will because they are close friends. I didn't want to say anything besides my sister, and I thought it was great. It is pretty suspenseful and thrilling. Some scenes have you clutching your armrest and rooting for Will and Martin. The situation that they got themselves in called for the Bad Boys..

The movie pace was excellent. The throwback/callback moments were beautiful. I laughed so hard so many times. I enjoyed the heartfelt moments. The plot was solid, true to all of the other films. The action sequences were incredible, interesting, and different. The directors did an amazing job bring a mew perspective to a shot out sequence. Because it's the fourth film, it's easy to say it's contrite. But it's because it's the fourth film, you enjoy the references to the other film.

I hope they continue to make a few more because we all know we need good laughs. Once again, the action and special effects are great.

181,7.0,10 June 2024,"Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are the box office magnets Hollywood forgot about. Time and Time again Will smith has proven how he can appeal to the masses when he presents his talents on the silver screen, but Hollywood has chosen to narrow its focus on trash that no one is interested in seeing. I could continue analyzing this failure to launch behavior, but why waste the time, energy and intelligence trying to convince Hollywood that when you release trash at the box office the films fail to produce a profit. Will Smith and many other talented actors and actresses are the ticket to re-energizing Hollywood. There are some extremely good writers and an equal amount of gifted directors and editors out there just waiting for Hollywood to wake up and smell the coffee. And that is the tip of the iceberg when it comes to producing a successful well acted movie it requires thousands of support staff and specialist to create the final product. I am talking about wardrobe specialist, special effects masters, carpenters, mechanics, camera specialist, etc. And never forget the stand-ins stunt doubles. So while Will Smith and Martin Lawrence and company count the money and receive all the glory, maybe some idiot in Hollywood will have an epiphany and realize the public like guns, justifiable violence, some anger, lots of good lines for the actors to recite and most importantly professional Actors and Actresses. Way to Go Smith and Lawrence!","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

I recently watched ""Bad Boys"" and absolutely loved the comedy aspect of the movie more than the action. The performances by Will Smith and Martin Lawrence were excellent, bringing a lot of energy and humor to their roles. Their chemistry on screen is undeniable, and they deliver countless laugh-out-loud moments that make the film a joy to watch. However, I felt the supporting cast didn't quite measure up to the main duo's level, which slightly detracted from the overall experience.

The plot, while somewhat predictable, is carried by the strong performances and witty banter between the two leads. The action scenes are well-executed, but it's the comedic moments that truly shine and set this movie apart. My favorite part was the hilarious interactions between the two leads, which kept me entertained from start to finish.

Overall, ""Bad Boys"" is a highly entertaining film, especially for those who enjoy a good laugh. It's a perfect blend of comedy and action, with a dynamic duo that makes the movie unforgettable. Definitely worth a watch if you're looking for a fun and engaging film!

Would have given it a higher score but I was expecting a better soundtrack. I feel like the generation balance the director managed to achieve with the new actors added to the cast didn't make it through to the soundtrack, it felt scarce with a slight disappointment every time a track is played.

Furthermore, there is enough action and a decent story line. The co actors around the duo were decent and gave the movie some extra dialoge.

However, i do think Will Smith is getting a little bit to old to act as the tough 'bad boy'. After the golden globes it seems he is trying to get some positive repution back. Thats maybe also why marcus is more in the lead character then Will. But if there is a 5th, give him a more supervisior rol with comedy or something.

This is a far cry from the first movie and has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I have watched over four thousand movies at least. I honestly can't even think of one good thing to say about this movie other than I hope they never make another one. I can't believe as of right now it's rated a 6.5.

From the bizzare LSD type dream death rubbish, to Lawrences acting actually getting worse, then the padding of the dialogue with the leads singing bad boys to each other, and stupid POV shooter camera angles; this film should never have been made or released.

The only thing it does is end the franchise for good. Will Smith is not on many call sheets after the slap, so you'd think he would have taken better care of his existing franchise that he could fall back on. Can only think he'll do another MIB movie now.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

As a movie it objectively deserves an 8.5, but this movie has to be one of the best of it's kind. The action was amazing (might even be in the level of movies like the man from Toronto and Central Intelligence which definitely are known for their amazing action) and it sometimes made you even forget that you are watching a kind of comedy. The humor was good and was not overused or underused. The script/plot was generic but honestly it might be the only characteristic of the movie that's a bit cliche (you know the whole kidnapping the protagonsist's wife and hunting them etc.) and we should also remember that the film's genre is a genre that focuses on the viewer having fun and only that. No one expects Daniel Day-acts nor Christopher Nolan-plots. It is a very nice movie that's worth the 2 hours and the 8-10 euros/dollars. Absolutely recommended for people that are comedy fans but also people that either haven't seen any Bad Boys movie (like me, although I will definitely watch the older movies of the frnachise sometime) or don't really like this type of action movies.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

Is for the family to watch together! Loved seeing the 4th movie in cinema, it is just a good experience.

I was hoping to see som pos credits to give us a glimpse of what comes next, but not this time; and that is ok. Great job!

As a fan favourite it would be great to see him have his own story told without his parent, to see him evolve and redeem himself. This would also send a big message to everyone that just because your story starts off bad doesn't mean you can't shift your future. It would be a story of self discovery and growth - could link him up with the upcoming young squad. Reggie has had the biggest character development in the most minimalist way, that was amazing.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

I don't get the negative reviews calling the film, ""lazy"" or ""cliche"", or that certain things are ""unbelievable"". I don't know about other people but when I watch a movie especially one that you know is going to be a bit of fun like Bad Boys then you suspend your disbelief for a while, Its a movie. You watch movies to get away from reality for a couple of hours, if you want reality go follow real cops around, don't watch a buddy cop movie and expect reality.

Lots of action, lots of laughs, great entertainment, if you want reality go follow some real cops around or watch Crime and Investigation channel.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
201,9.0,13 June 2024,"My wife and I watched Bad Boys: Ride or Die (2024) in theaters. The storyline picks up with Mike finally settling down and getting married, while Marcus is dealing with cardiovascular issues. Both are in for significant lifestyle changes. When their captain is framed for working with drug cartels, they set out to clear his name, making them targets of both the real criminals and those investigating the case.

This film is co-directed by Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, who also worked together on Bad Boys for Life, and stars Will Smith (Men in Black), Martin Lawrence (Martin), Vanessa Hudgens (Spring Breakers), Eric Dane (Euphoria), and Ioan Gruffudd (Fantastic Four).

This movie was way better than it should have been. This is my favorite Martin Lawrence performance in a long time. He really nailed his character, with his hijinks reflecting a more mature, grandfatherly age. I can't say enough how much he exceeded my expectations. The rooftop scene is legendary, as is the sugar rush shootout and anything involving a donkey. Martin was in his bag. Eric Dane was a ruthless villain with some great kill scenes. The film was gory at times and included well-done torture scenes. There were also the classic over-the-top Bad Boys action scenes, with elite helicopter and flaming car sequences as examples. The final shootout infused new cinematography, including some video game-style first-person shooting elements that were fun. There's some fun cameos and Reggie is great. There's a lot to like here.

In conclusion, Bad Boys: Ride or Die proved that Smith and Lawrence still have some gas in the tank. I would score this a 7/10 and strongly recommend it.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
202,8.0,11 June 2024,"Seemingly out of nowhere a fourth Bad Boys film was released last week.

Entitled Ride or Die Will Smith and Martin Lawrence return for more action filled police escapades.

Following on from the previous instalment (Bad Boys For Life) after Captain Howard's death a group of criminals seize the opportunity to bring his loyalty to the badge into question by wiring a large some of money into his bank account.

Whilst the rest of the department goes along with the line of inquiry that maybe Howard was corrupt Mike and Marcus (The Bad Boys) set out to clear his name.

The film adds nothing knew to the franchise, most of if not all of the characters from the previous film return and what follows is essentially a plot convenience filled narrative leading to a big action sequence at the end with a handful of hit or miss jokes in between.

There's no real need for this film to exist other than for studios to rinse every drop of money they can out of the Will Smith and Martin Lawrence partnership.

Their dynamic is by far the best thing about the franchise as whole. Smiths Mike as the levelheaded one who often finds himself trying to reason with the more irrational Marcus (Martin Lawrence). At times the film tries to switch the roles but like most things in this film it's hit or miss but for me was more of a miss. It does however give Martin Lawrence more time to shine and he alone is the best part of this instalment.

Much like its Individual parts Bad Boys: Ride or Die is fine and exactly what we've come to expect with this franchise. There are worse ways to spend two hours but if you're anything like me it won't be one that lives very long in your memory.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
203,8.0,11 June 2024,"Those of you who have watched Bad Boys for Life will know that the film shows how Marcus is starting to lose his enthusiasm for being a police officer because of his old age. On the other hand, Mike thinks that age is not an obstacle and forces Marcus to remain active as a police officer. Interestingly, in Ride or Die, the situation then reverses, where Marcus is now even more enthusiastic than Mike.

Yep, this film explores the characters of Mike and Marcus in a different way. In this film, we finally see how Mike can experience great fear and anxiety when facing a case. On the other hand, Marcus, who is usually a coward, has now become a brave figure but still maintains his silliness. With this different story approach, Ride or Die doesn't feel repetitive and allows us to get to know Mike and Marcus better.

Interestingly, Mike and Marcus are not the only characters who experience drastic character development in Ride or Die. Those of you who follow the Bad Boys film series definitely know Reggie McDonald who is now Marcus' son-in-law. His presence in previous Bad Boys films always made me laugh because of his flat face. Who would have thought, Reggie would finally be given an epic moment that is guaranteed to make the fans excited.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
204,2.0,9 June 2024,"This was an entertaining film and a refreshing pallet cleanser in the genre of action movies. Mike and Marcus don't just pick up as characters where the previous movies end and I love the off-screen growth as much as the on-screen growth. There is beautiful chemistry with all the primary actors and with Will and Martin, that comes with nearly 30 years of working together, but with the newer players introduced in the third installment, it's surprising how well they fit.

I want to see a fifth and final film in the series. No spinoffs. No prequels. It's rare when a series doesn't outlive it's welcome and if they want these films to be immortal, they need a sendoff before they get bad.

I would highly recommend this for anyone who's seen at least the third entry in the series as a lot of the plot leans on events that happened in that film.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

Hahahaha I think everybody wants more of these two guys. So you should go to cinema. One hundred dollar budget movie. Super acting super cgi super nostalgic music. Many wow effects and scenes.

206,2.0,8 June 2024,"For me, the quality of bad boys franchise was only increasing with each movie, and I am glad to say this film continues the tradition.

Lets start with the positive. And I don't like to be obvious, but I just can't not mention the chemistrybetween to leads. Smith and Lawrence go very well with each other, and I even would say that is is their best interaction in all 4 movies. This was cearly an advantage, that everybody was expecting. But what caught me surprised is humor. I just couldn't help myself laughing during the movie, and the sillyness is just at the right level to be funny. I even enjoyed some emotional stakes that this movie had, and the charachter journey that Mike has. It is a surprise mixup between Puss in boots 2 and Batman, but not at that level of quality. Moreover it has some John Wick 4 stuff to, but also don't get to exited. And lso the work with the camera is amasing.

However, even if the cameraman does an amazing job, I can't say that I really liked the action. It can be astonishing like the scene in the house, but smetimes it is too much, and you just can't understand anything, like the plain sequence. Also the villain is OK, but he could be better. And it has the most predictable twist ever.

And, although the movie has its flaws, I would still realy recommend it, just don't expect to much, it is nowhere near Dark knight or John Wick.

Good points first..Smith and Lawrence still have great chemistry together and the pacing of the film and the action scenes are all good. Supporting cast from previous films are back and you do need to have seen part 3 to follow the plot here. In truth there is not a dull moment in the film and it is very enjoyable. A slight nit pick would be that Ride or Die brings nothing new to the series. In some cases it is like a greatest hits revisit. For example the scene in the shop.

However, the film did stumble in a few areas, particularly with the acting from some of the supporting characters, which felt a bit off in places.

IMDb needs to change rating cause there is big difference between numbers. Bad Boys is not an 8. It does a lot of great things well. Its a good movie. But there are some details that leave it kinda meh too. But its not quite a 7 either. Maybe a 7.5? But then I'd I have to round up to 8 or something stupid like that.

Bad Boys has all the classic modern day action you'd expect. But that's the problem. You expect it from them. So definitely good if you want to see a classic action flick made for 2024. But its got some of that 'cartoon logic' that just makes no sense. Its got some good humor to it. Good jokes. Sure. But its not a dedicated comedy to justify the 'cartoon logic' in my opinion. Some of the jokes seem a little to forced too. Like the idea is there but the landing is what it is.

Regardless though, good movie, just nothing memorable. The 1st is still the best.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

He & Martin Lawrence are again the titular Miami cops, this time out to exonerate dead boss Joe Pantoliano from corruption allegations. Returning Adil El Arbi & Billall Fallah co-direct brightly, but the screenplay from returning co-writer Chris Bremner (this time with Will Beall) is uninspired & badly hole-filled...

Honestly I find too many of these movies where the director did not do much work. Making movie is an art. Not just where you go sit down.

Just imagine this same script without the good will brought from the leads! What would be the public's perception?

220,8.0,14 July 2024,"Ride or Die doesn't have the surprise, the emotional authenticity or the genuine relationships of the third one, but the franchise film no one was asking for, is an electric reprise of the dumb, fun buddy action comedy.

I don't want these movies to be so good, because it means I have to keep seeing them.

The action is zippy and fun, not great but never boring, the directing homages Bay but doesn't rely on his worse tendencies and the plot and story meanders and isn't incredible, but it is simple and fun.

It's a film that has two ageing badasses in it that isn't afraid to ride with real-world issues against them and a passing of the torch that feels very un-franchisey and more tongue-in-cheek and human.

The real genius at the heart of Ride or Die after the Will Smith heavy For Life, is that Martin Lawrence is the star again, he does so much in this movie, moves through so many hilarious modes in his journey and the movie isn't afraid of being abjectly silly and wasting a lot of money on simple visual gags and moments designed to make people laugh.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

224,7.0,23 June 2024,"Rating: 5.4 Overall, a movie that does not feel necessary as it does not really provide anything new in the franchise and feels goofy and stupid by trying new types of shots and editing techiques.

Direction: Pretty Bad The direction on a macroscale tries to be unique for an action comedy, but sounds better on paper than it does in practice as the movie just feels goofy and stupid; the direction on a microscale feels very stiff and forced; the storytelling is pretty generic to other action-comedies; they don't build tension well because the movie is pretty predictable

Story: Bad The concept is pretty forced and dumb; the plot structure is formulaic; the character writing is pretty bland and forced (this might be one of the worst interpretations of panic attacks/anxiety I have ever seen in a movie because it is so shallow)

Screenplay: Pretty Bad The dialogue is typical action-comedy dialogue; they try to be funny way too often, and the hit rate is only 1/4; the symbolism is so forced that it is laughable, especially about the concept of fatherhood, living, and anxiety; the foreshadowing is present, but it only makes the movie more predictable

Acting: Decent to Pretty Good Will Smith: Good (The real star of the show, as he uses his natural charisma and experience playing this character to take over all his scenes) Martin Lawrence: Pretty Good (Has good chemistry with Smith and plays the comedic relief character decently well, but is a bit too over-the-top at points) Vanessa Hudgens: Decent (Feels like a cameo) Alexander Ludwig: Decent (Feels like a cameo) Paola Núñez: Decent (Pretty toneless performance, but nothing overtly bad) Eric Dane: Pretty Good (Plays the villain role well and has good chemistry with Will Smith) Ioan Gruffudd: Decent (He barely has any screentime, but is fine with what he is given) Jacob Scipio: Decent Joe Pantoliano: Pretty Bad (Feels like he is acting to nothing and is more of a cameo than an actual character) Rest of the cast: Pretty Bad (Just a lot of typical action-comedy, over-the-top performances)

Score: Decent Helps establish the tone and the Miami vibe

Soundtrack: Decent Helps give the movie Miami vibes

Cinematography: Very Bad They try to be unique with all new shots, but these shots are so poorly executed that it makes the movie feel incredibly goofy and stupid

Editing: Very Bad They tried to make this movie look so cool and seamless with its transitions, but it ends up making the movie look tacky

Sound: Pretty Good

Visual Effects: Decent The practical effects are fine, but the CGI is very noticeable

Pacing Pacing is fine as there really isn't that much story

Climax The climax is executed decently well, as it is a typical shootout; it tries to do many new types of shots that are not executed well

Tone Tone is very similar to the other movies in the franchise.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
225,8.0,21 June 2024,"'Ride or Die' would rank as number 2 for me in the franchise, behind 'Bad Boys ll' which has the best villain by far. I like it slightly more than the last one, only because it has less of the young vs old attitude.

I think it's fair to say we can all move on from the ""slap"" and just appreciate entertaining movies. And Will Smith is generally in pretty entertaining movies, and I watch movies to be entertained.

The back and forth banter remains hilarious between Mike and Marcus. The heavy amount of action remains over the top and wildly entertaining. Michael Bay in the first Porsche was a nice cameo.

Most things cinematography is fine, music is fine, acting is fine, which is why this movie is not horrible. Some decently innovative camera movements is kinda fun, and we have all seen a lot worse movies.

Sadly that is where the positives end because the writing is atrocious, the story predictable, and the constant nagging and banter between the two main is boring. Nothing is believable and in every corner awaits a cliche. It is really time to let this string of movies die out once and for all.

I give this a 4/10 because it is almost watchable and most thing about this is ""fine"", but I was yawning the whole time and I could see every scene play out long before it had. Such predictable meaningless nonsense. If you liked the previous movies you will probably like this too, but I am so over this and if they ever come out with more instalments I am not even going to bother.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
227,8.0,13 June 2024,"I never thought I'd actually go and see a 'Bad Boys' movie in the cinema, but online buzz made it hard to resist watching 'Bad Boys: Ride or Die (2024)' on the big screen. It's not like I especially dislike the franchise as a whole, but the first and third entries are so easy to forget (because they're quite good but not good enough to be particularly noteworthy) that the only thing I think of when I reflect on the series is the total travesty that is 'Bad Boys II (2003)'. Of course, that's not particularly fair. With this new entry, the ratio of success to failure within the franchise is a totally respectable 3:1, which is actually better than a lot of similarly long-running series.

At any rate, this fourth film is exactly what you'd hope it is: a fun, energetic and enjoyable buddy cop action-comedy with two likeable leads (slap notwithstanding) and several vital set-pieces that elegantly capture all the chaos you'd expect from something first started by Michael Bay. Unfortunately, it's also just as forgettable as most of its predecessors. At the time of writing, it's only been four days since I saw this and it honestly could have been half a year. That doesn't inherently make it bad, though. After all, if you forget what you've had for lunch, it doesn't mean you didn't enjoy the meal.

The two things that really save the movie from falling into mediocrity (albeit the upper echelons of mediocrity) are its stars and its directors. Martin Lawrence and Will Smith have excellent chemistry, as always, and their dynamic keeps the uber-generic plot feeling light on its feet. There are plenty of genuinely funny moments peppered throughout the picture (most, if not all, of which belong solely to Lawrence) and the tone is fairly upbeat throughout. There is some dissonance that occurs due to the stark contrast between the movie's typically care-free vibe and some of its meaner moments, but the atmosphere is mostly consistent and the piece manages to balance its humour with its harsher elements fairly well. Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah's direction is really bold, and it elevates the action far beyond what you may expect. Often making use of sweeping long takes to dynamically frame its orchestrated mayhem, the film grips you by the collar and doesn't let go until the bullets have stopped flying and the baddies are all crumpled on the ground. Everything is achieved with a striking balance between visual clarity and visceral disarray, perfectly encapsulating the so-called ""Bayhem"" that kicked off this series without succumbing to the confusion it so often carries with it. The flick makes good use of practical and digital effects to bring its shootouts, chases and crashes to life, incorporating an appreciated sense of variety to stop things from ever feeling stale. There is more than one sequence that really makes you sit up in your seat, and that's more than can be said about any of its predecessors. In that sense, this is probably the best of its series. To be fair, that's a difficult claim to make considering how little I remember those movies. Still, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this picture. It's genuinely good, and it seems to have been made by people truly passionate about making the best version of it possible.

It's not perfect, of course. The story is one of the most generic things I think I've ever seen, failing to surprise at every turn and introduced characters who make you exclaim ""they're the baddie"" within seconds of their arrival. It's a little bit too long for its own good, lagging ever so slightly in its middle section as it struggles to breathe life into what's perhaps its most well-worn trope. The flick includes a few somewhat distracting cameos that feel totally random (although I can't say that this is a positive or a negative, really). Plus, it introduces a very of-the-moment theme but doesn't really know what to do with it, opting to resolve it in an odd scene that totally undercuts what must have been the reason it was included in the first place. What's worse is that this theme seems to overtake a more major, and more entertaining, one that's set up much earlier and feels much more natural to the story the filmmakers are trying to tell.

Despite its problems, though, this is a really fun time. It's everything it needs to be, and its clichéd nature is almost (though not totally) cancelled out by its vigorous and inventive action.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
228,7.0,12 June 2024,"Mike and Marcus have been partners and friends for decades, sharing each other's highs and lows. When their late Captain is accused of corruption, they make it their mission to prove his innocence, clear his name, and honor his legacy. To accomplish this, they must approach this case differently and rely on people they never expected.

This is the fourth installment of the Bad Boys franchise and a solid sequel. It is more enjoyable with prior knowledge of the first three but can still be enjoyed independently. The movie has some great comedy between the two legends, classic Bad Boys antics, and many references to the first three movies. There is not as much action as you would expect in a Bad Boys movie, but the action in the movie is phenomenal. This is a definite watch for fans of the franchise.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
229,6.0,11 June 2024,"Gone are the days of Ace Ventura, Beverly Hills Cop (I know a new one is coming) Lethal Weapon even Tango and Cash. Instead we now have CGI fests. In my opinion if a movie has to rely on CGI over good writing and relatable characters than do we give credit to the director and graphics artist or the main characters? Not what I signed up for

Enter Bad Boys 4. A Co-op film with typical Bruckheimer chaos that I miss in movies, CGI, but wait for it.... relatable characters. We have to admit there aren't many duos now or before besides Lethal Weapon that can stand the test of time in Hollyweird. Martin & Will prove otherwise.

Its a great summer flick, definitely worth watching again, funny, action packed with great acting.

Very rare is a part 4 almost better than previous sequels but I like this one better than part 3. Check this out in a movie theatre that makes the sound go boom!","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

Absolutely fantastic film to the franchise.

The action sequences are some of the best from all 4 films.

I've been a fan of bad boys since the very beginning so maybe I'll a little biast but if your a fan of the first 3 then your going to love this.

Get yourself to the cinema and watch it.

Pay no attention to the haters of will smith. What is done is done and should not be a reflection of what is a solid action movie.

There is a star of the movie who has the best action sequence in the film and you might be surprised by who it is.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
231,4.0,9 June 2024,"So, let's be honest here, did we get a Bad Boys four so fast because of what the Fresh Prince did at the Oscars? I'm gonna assume so and I'm almost happy he did (just kidding) Ride or Die is an excellent action film. The car chases, the gun fights the explosions it was pretty fantastic. The directors did some experimenting on some of the action sequences that did not fully get me excited but I'm not mad at the experiment.

Martian Lawrence and Will Smith still have the chemistry. These two known how to bounce the jokes off each other. They got Lowery and Burnett down. One of the best on screen duos ever.

As the Franchise goes, I think this movie is better because of the near back-to-back from their last outing Bad Boys for Life (back-to-back in comparison to 17-year gap between For Life and Bad Boys II). It continues the developing story between Lowery and his estranged son. Vanessa Hodges, Paola Nunez and Alexander Ludwig official join the family and then there is that interesting story arch between Burnett and his son in law that hit a peak in this movie after technically going on for three movies.

Look if you like Bad Boys, you're going to like Bad Boys: Ride or Die. The only buddy cop franchise better is Lethal Weapon. Can't wait to see if Lethal Weapon 5 is half as good as Bad Boys 4.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
232,8.0,9 June 2024,"Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett are back, and let's just say, age ain't nothin' but a number-for their ever-present immaturity, that is. Bad Boys: Ride or Die throws our favourite foul-mouthed cops back into the fire as they race to clear their late captain's name from a corruption scandal. Prepare for explosions, buddy-cop banter, and an abundance of slow-motion that would cause Michael Bay to blush.

Look, there's no denying this movie is pure popcorn fun. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence slip back into their iconic roles with ease-their comedic chemistry still crackles. There's a car chase through a glitzy Miami night market that's as thrillingly absurd as anything in the Fast & Furious franchise. The filmmakers clearly understand the heart of the series: mindless action punctuated by wisecracks.

But therein lies the rub. While the action sequences are undeniably impressive-think bullet ballets and physics-defying stunts-they start to feel repetitive after a while. The jokes, too, often fall flat. Remember that hilarious bit from the trailer about Marcus's medical woes? Yeah, that's about the peak of the comedy here. It feels like the writers strained a little too hard to recapture the magic of the previous films, and some gags land with all the grace of a hippo on roller skates.

The plot itself is serviceable but unsurprising. There's a new villain, a fresh mystery, but it never feels particularly inspired. We've seen this cops-on-the-run trope countless times before, and Ride or Die doesn't offer anything particularly new or thought-provoking.

The movie's saving grace is, once again, the central duo. Smith maintains his charisma as the ever-cool Mike Lowrey, while Lawrence brings the manic energy, particularly when his character goes undercover (think a high-pitched falsetto that would make a chipmunk blush). New additions to the cast, like Vanessa Hudgens as Mike's fiery captain's daughter, add some spark, but their roles feel underdeveloped.

Technically, the film is solid. The direction is slick, the editing keeps the pace brisk, and the Miami setting is as vibrant and sun-drenched as ever. The soundtrack, however, is a forgettable mix of generic hip-hop and forgettable score.

So, is Bad Boys: Ride or Die a worthy successor to the franchise? Hmm, not quite. It's a fun, albeit forgettable, summer action flick. Die-hard fans will likely find enough to enjoy, but for newcomers, there are better entries in the buddy-cop genre (think 21 Jump Street or Rush Hour). This one might make you chuckle, or wince, but ultimately, it won't leave a lasting impression. It's a perfectly serviceable three-star ride-enjoyable in the moment, but quickly fading from memory once it's over.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
233,6.0,9 June 2024,"This plot felt more organic and less forced than the last movie. It was an interesting concept to have their former captain framed for corruption and having them clear his name. While the story flowed much better than the last movie it was very predictable. Had it not been so predictable this would have been much better. But even so this was absolutely entertaining to watch. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence deliver once again. Their chemistry is undeniable, they just make for a great combo and it's no reason fans love these films. Martin was absolutely funny throughout the whole movie. Will had his moments but what I liked about him in this movie was the character development. There was a sense of growth to his character that is evidently different from the Mike Lowrey from the first two movies. There was a bit of that in the last movie but this movie opens up with him already at that level.

This film had so much more style than any of the other ""Bad Boys"" movies. Some chances were taken with the visuals and it worked out for the best. The cinematography made this movie so much fun to watch. There were so many different and unexpected angles. The pacing never lets up making the two hours of this film a breeze to sit through. The replacing of the actress that plays Martin's wife caught me off guard because I wasn't aware that a change had been made but it did not take away from the movie in anyway. There are a couple of fun cameos and Reggie has a very memorable moment. There were also moments that call back to the previous films which tied everything nicely. There was only one scene that stood out as being really unrealistic which involved the prevention of Armando from falling out of a falling plane. But even that wasn't enough to stop me from enjoying this movie.

If you are a fan of this franchise then it is likely you'll enjoy what this film has to offer.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

Didn't laugh once and Martin Lawrence did his usual over the top performance that I've always found irritating. You don't expect acting in these kind of films to be oscar worthy but the acting was shocking.

I expected more from Will as he is a great actor and even for an action like this, I hoped for more.

Even the action sequences were meh, they only two guys that did the film any justice were the bastard son and Reggie.

The first two bad boys films were great and lots of fun. Just leave it there and don't bother watching the last two films.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

I just remember being annoyed and could not wait for the movie to end.

The latest release shines with realistic scenery, great dialogue, a story full of twists and turns, a charismatic villain, two absolute acting icons in the leading roles, a magician behind the camera and a soundtrack that flatters the ears.

I can actually see him as the next Bad Boy if they decide to reboot the franchise with new leads.

It is hard to believe that the first movie was relapsed back in 1995. I never understood why they waits so long between the sequels, but i guess it took them that long to come up with a good enough script to make another one.

In general, the previous movie was more successful, but this one had a few convincing scenes that lifted this one up.

Khaby Lame's cameo was surprising. Now, while writing this, I am thinking, when it is said that his cameo is intended for young people, almost 40 years old myself, that.. At the same time, I like his videos a lot.

As for the various scenes.

The beginning is brilliantly about the fragile digital system and human aging and the problems it brings. About what might happen inside someone's head as a result of things.

The execution of the helicopter scene was a bit too messy and the cgi was lame, even though the camera work was flying and experimental.

In general, the action of the latter half was entertaining and perhaps suitably overshooting!

Don't forget to watch the post credits, even though it's a completely stupid joke!

Even though there were many good points, it is still not convincing enough. I was still able to give it a 7/10.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

243,8.0,27 June 2024,"For a fourth outing, 'Bad Boys: Ride or Die' still finds a way to produce the goods.

I enjoyed what I watched. The previous installment remains the clear standout of the series comparatively speaking, though I was pleased to see this one still deliver the nessacary entertainment; it's perhaps my second favourite from the franchise. It does have flaws of course, like I'd say it's more serious than humourous and the more sincere stuff doesn't always hit as intended; especially the bits about Howard.

Still, there's enough positive humour in there. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence continue to please in the lead roles, they are a great match. The rest of the cast are all decent enough, Ioan Gruffudd plays what feels like a typical Ioan Gruffudd character well. Jacob Scipio, meanwhile, is pretty solid.

I will say, though, that Rhea Seehorn is underused - she's way too good for these sorta bit part roles! There are also cameo-esque appearances from Tiffany Haddish and DJ Khaled, which sounds bad on paper but, actually, both of their scenes are actually quite amusing! Away from those onscreen, camera work and editing are both pluses.

Bad Boys 3 is a flop, a crazy story, supported by ""we got to bring attractive people in spandex"" to get more people in, since this is what audiences gravitate to recently. Where are those Spanish officers, Mike and Marcus were always yapping with smart, sharp jokes? The latest one didn't add anything good either, just a ripoff between John Wick, James Bond and all other action movies. Helicopters now..?

I was 15 at the time and didn't really expect all that much from it but after the opening scene where our heroes get car jacked, I was hooked. The second one came out some 8 years later and I thought it was good but no where near how I felt about the original. Then 17 years later the 3rd one came out and it felt more like the 1st because a lot of the humor was the same, the action scenes were invigorating and the original score was brought back which I think anyone can agree makes you feel like it's a Bad Boys movie.

Bad Boys: Ride or Die picks up almost right where the 3rd left off finding our heroes facing something they never have before. The action could be the best of the entire franchise, it's really funny and heartfelt at times. The only problem I had with it is that they recast one of the original cast members which kinda bugged me because I liked the continuity having everyone you know and love from the originals coming back but that's the only negative I can say about the movie.

Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are back as Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett, the wise-crackingMiami cops who cause just as much mayhem as they solve crimes. This time around, they're framed and on the run, which means even more high-octane car chases, gravity-defying stunts, and enough explosions to light up the night sky.

The plot? It's about as intricate as a folded napkin. There's a bad guy (a scenery-chewingly evil one, of course), a McGuffin to chase, and a whole lot of bullets flying. But that's not the point. Bad Boys: Ride or Die is all about the ride itself, and it's a gloriously ridiculous one.

The action sequences are top-notch, with in your face visuals that put you in the action. The jokes come thick and fast, some landing squarely, some hilariously awful. But hey, that's part of the Bad Boys charm, right?

If you like dark humor, physical comedy, puns, sarcasm, anecodotal comedy, sexual humor, cringe, deadpan, insult comedy, musical comedy, one line jokes, prop comedy, wit and wordplay, topical comedy or satire. Martin has a joke for that in this movie. I literally dare you to go throughout the entire movie and not laugh. His humor had me in stitches throughout the movie.

There also happens to be a high octane. Explosive secondary storyline about drug cartels, police, in a find who the crooked cop is storyline.

This movie was also a great comeback movie for Will Smith. I appreciated that Martin even took shots at will and they joked about Will wanting to slap him. I feel like that might be a consistent joke at Will's expense for the rest of his time as an actor.

From Alexander Ludwig's appearance on Vikings I have liked him as an actor and it was cool to see him stretch his acting prowess from bloodthirsty viking and broken child... to nerdy tech support guy in this film.

I loved Paolo's Nunez performance in this movie as well. She plays the badass female cop very well.

Finally there was another sweet storyline about family which I thought was exemplified beautifully by: Tasha Smith,Melanie Liburd, Rhea Seahorn, Joe Pantoliano, Quinn Hemphill, and the actor who plays the marine. They are the beautiful heart of this film and they made me cry one two occasions.

It's an enjoyable movie, just like the rest of them. It is a bit predictable now and then, but even so, the story is good for this type of movie.

254,5.0,6 September 2024,"The movie delivers an entertaining experience, striking a great balance between action and comedy. While the plot might be predictable, it doesn't detract much from the overall enjoyment. What really stands out are the well-timed comedic moments (not all) that keep the mood light and engaging, without taking away from the seriousness of the action scenes. This mix keeps you hooked and ensures that you're never bogged down by overly intense moments, making it a perfect casual watch.

One of the key strengths of the film lies in its cinematography. The visual design is unique and innovative, with several sequences that will make you sit up and think, ""Wow, that's cool."" The camera work is meticulously crafted, capturing action scenes with clarity and precision while maintaining a dynamic sense of movement that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. The cinematography team clearly put in a lot of effort to create a visually striking experience, adding an extra layer of appeal.

The action scenes were well choreographed, intense, and filled with creative stunts that go beyond the usual formula. The fight sequences feel raw and visceral, yet they're also punctuated with moments of humour that lighten the mood and make the film accessible to a wider audience. It's clear that a lot of attention was paid to crafting memorable action moments that can be both exciting and fun.

In conclusion, despite its predictable plot, the movie has enough going for it to be a highly enjoyable watch. The combination of solid action, great humor, and outstanding visuals makes it a well-rounded film that doesn't disappoint. It's a film that delivers on what it promises-entertainment. While it may not break new ground in terms of storytelling, its execution makes it more than worth the time.

256,5.0,7 August 2024,"Bad Boys are back! Honestly I could watch Will Smith and Martin Lawrence banter in these movies for infinity, I love their chemistry together and I hope they never stop making these, with or without Michael Bay. This fourth one is a big improvement on the slightly underwhelming third, capturing some of the berserkly irreverent shenanigans that made the second film the best. There's a scene in the second where Lawrence's Marcus accidentally takes ecstasy and spends a few scenes as a raving, unhinged joker. In this film he has a near death experience early on and wakes up from it an enlightened man, and then becomes extremely effervescent so he basically gets to more or less spend the entire film in joker mode and it's a genius move on the writers part because it lets Lawrence truly off the chain and Smith almost, *almost* struggles to catch up. They're out to clear their former captain's name against a frame up job of false corruption charges and while Joe Pantoliano's earthly presence is sorely missed here, he still gets a cameo from the great beyond to push the exposition ever onward. The villainy is perpetrated by an ex DEA agent (Eric Dane) gone spectacularly rogue and the film finds a strong, threatening antagonist in him, with added support from folks like Alexander Ludwig, Paola Núñez, Ioan Gruffudd and Vanessa Hudgens. Directors Adil & Bilal keep the camera work exceptionally dynamic in the spirit of Bay and even try some welcome experimental flourishes like a video game style first person shooter POV shot during action sequences. Smith and Lawrence have perfected these two characters and are endlessly watchable, hopefully in more sequels to come.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
257,4.0,2 August 2024,"I loved part one it was very funny and serious when it needed to be. Part 3 was disappointing but after watching 4 I think part 3 is good. The problem they have made is they turned these movies into a comedy with over action scenes. Not a fast paced action movie with some funny comedy. Another words they have made these movies into dumb comedy flicks.

Part. 3 Plot was stupid and overrated (Specifically the son part).

Part. 4 (Completely stupid over acting in almost every scene).

Part 2. Very funny action good pace but could have left it alone with the overrated comedy.

Part 1. Very serious movie with great comedy throughout the movie.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
258,5.0,31 July 2024,"""Bad Boys: Ride or Die"" delivers a nostalgic thrill ride for fans of the franchise, blending action, humor, and camaraderie in a way that feels both familiar and fresh. While it may not break new ground, the film thrives on the chemistry between Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, who effortlessly slip back into their iconic roles as Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett.

The movie embraces its over-the-top nature, featuring outrageous stunts, explosive action sequences, sleek camera work and a dose of heart that surprises amidst the chaos. Directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah maintain the franchise's signature style, incorporating a mix of humor and high-octane thrills that keep audiences engaged. The introduction of new characters, like Marcus's son-in-law Reggie, adds depth and sets the stage for future installments.

Ultimately, ""Bad Boys: Ride or Die"" is a fun escape that doesn't take itself too seriously, making it a perfect addition for those looking to enjoy a light-hearted action flick with plenty of laughs and excitement.

For such a serious movie the funny parts were too funny and serious times were not enough, there wasn't much of a story either. How could they have trusted the two young cops they just appeared out of no where, didn't fit. And the killings too gruesome did we really need to see the bullet going thru his head ? Why? And the gators really? That's gross. Way too much shooting way too much blood and you see the cuts and blood. Really gross. U are on edge the whole time cause the camera is running this way and that way from shot to shot nah not an easy watch like the other bad boys previously.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
260,8.0,25 July 2024,"A big yaaawn with this one. It's clear that this script was written by ChatGPT or some Gen Z writer because there was absolutely no depth to this story. The story was just bland and unintelligent at all. It had everything you'd expect from a big budget movie. Soundtrack. Special FX. Camera works. Cinematography. The whole shebang. But it heavily under-delivered.

First off, from the very beginning of the movie, what sucked and ultimately messed it up for me was the annoying, Martin Lawrence's performance. Dude can't act to save his own skin. His head looking like an inflated balloon ready to explode any second and they just kept shoving that face on the screen. Even Smith wasn't laughing at any of his dry jokes. Secondly, apart from it being extremely predictable, there was so much borrowing from past movies. Dirty Cops? Bounty Hunters? Being Setup? On the run from authorities? Fight on a plane?! Fight with a croc? Etc. Nothing new. I wonder what people saw in this that made them like it that much.

At the end of the day, it's another forgettable action movie starring Will Smith, who wouldn't watch? Even if it sucked, I think Will Smith is at a place in his career where he simply can get away with any action movie he does. And that's the case with this one. Unlike Eddie Murphy's Beverly Hills Cops that had us nostalgic and rolling on the floor, this one did absolutely nothing.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
261,8.0,25 July 2024,"A well put together film completely destroyed by Martin Lawrence. What an insufferable, pointless character. Flows well, characters and story line move well. Then Martin's character pops up every now and again to act stupid and say something stupid. Actually infuriating and would put me off any fuser films. He added nothing but took lots away. Cliche black man role needs leaving in the 90s.

Cinematically good, the other characters and storyline play out well. Felt similar yo recent mission impossible films. Loots of action and links to previous films (I haven't seen previous but I felt the connection)","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
262,10.0,24 July 2024,"I am going to go ahead and call this is really bad movie. The jokes fell flat, the action needed ten camera switches per scene to make them not look stupid, the story was dumb. But what really hurt is that the actors were either playing poorly or were completely underused. Will Smith phoned it in, Martin Lawrence was talking and moving slowly like he had dementia, Alexander Ludwig and Eric Dane were completely underused, even Ioan Gruffudd.

The same kind of people that thought a sequel to Beverly Hills Cop was a good idea made this movie. And it is worse! At first I saw some kind of character development, acknowledging the same two heroes cannot go through life behaving the same way at their age. They stopped doing that in about ten minutes and proceeded to make something that absolutely no one seemed to be having fun in. It was plain terrible.

Bottom line: avoid this film.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
263,8.0,29 June 2024,"When Bad Boys Ride Or Die started, I became nervous, because the editing seemed to go right back to using the usual Michael Bay tricks, even though he isn't directing. Thankfully, this problem extends only to the opening, as after the title appears, the film calms down and is shot and edited in a way that isn't headache inducing. There's actually some cool visuals used at one point (without spoiling anything) that may seem out of place in this series, but services the plot fairly well. And the action scenes are as fast paced and intense as ever, with the choreography, stakes, and scenarios evoking comparisons to a certain other action series, mainly in the second half. In fact, at one point, a character you wouldn't expect to goes full on John Wick on the baddies, and it is awesome. As to the plot, it's decent, with a good mystery, though there's a twist villain I predicted the second they were introduced. And the comedy is still strong, including a fantastic reference to the infamous Oscar Slap toward the end.

Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are still going strong and still have solid chemistry; and while the arc Lawrence goes through and his antics can get annoying, they thankfully get a laugh as often as they get a groan. There's a great, intimidating villain played by Eric Dane, though his motivation is a little muddled; but hey, who goes to a Bad Boys movie for that? And the supporting cast is solid as ever, both old and new. Even the members of AMMO, who were the worst part of the last movie, are a lot better here.

Overall, if I were to rank the Bad Boys films from best to worst, I would say: For Life, Ride or Die, the first, and the second. They're all dumb popcorn movies. Luckily, I enjoy dumb popcorn movies when they're done right. And these films are definitely done right.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
264,7.0,25 June 2024,"Prior to seeing this one, I've seen 1 and 2 like 10 years ago, just rewatching 1 and 2, currently 20 minutes into 2 as we speak. Never seen 3, which apparently was kind of crucial to get a lot of what's going on with this movie. Since as I remembered it, 1 and 2 were kind of stand alone movies, like a police procedural. Elements from 1 carry over in 2 but more as an easter egg rather than story crucial.

This was probably the biggest problem for me with this movie, they constantly reference events from 3, but there's enough new things, that more intelligent people can get enough of an idea of what is going on and the flashback to 3 are JUST THE RIGHT LENGTH, that they add needed context without feeling like ""We ran out of ideas by movie 4 so we'll ""Silent Night, Deadly Night 2"" it where we'll play half of the previous movie in this movie. MAYBE, and this is from memory, 10% is flashback which to me is perfectly fine.

This was more enjoyable than I was expecting and it was better thought out, maybe not BORNE levels of cleverness, but... more thought out and fleshed out than say a Transformer's movie. There's enough meat on this bone to feel like it was worth its ticket price.

Good jokes, decent villains that aren't white or russian, nice to see. And really good action. Yeah it gets goofy at times, to the point of cringe, but overall, probably will watch it again when it comes to streaming, but isn't going into regular rotation like Hot Fuzz does.

In conclusion; good jokes, good action, better than expected writing, good acting, fun characters, and weirdly a movie you can't fully turn your brain off to enjoy. Well worth seeing, glad I did. Now with that said, I can't remember for the life of me what the spanish bad guy was doing, just remember his hideout was an abandoned tourist trap. Seriously, I think it might have been drugs...I recall the majority of it was to clear their captain's name, but... I think there was a secondary heist and crime at play. Oh and obvious heel turn is obvious, as soon as that guy was on screen I knew he was a heel turn. SIGH... Though, they do try to subvert that and are kind of successful and almost had me second guessing myself.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

This movie was just mesmerising to watch with all of its unique and creative shots and angles. The film was packed with action and surprisingly it didn't feel repetitive or boring, it felt engaging and dynamic. Although I haven't watched anything from the Bad Boys before I can't really judge the plot but it does a good job of explaining what's happening to the newer audience. Comedy is another aspect that was done well, the movie had occasional jokes which were timed well and felt like they belonged in that moment.

Equals great movie night. Unfortunately the camera work is poorly done. There is way to much shaky cam and switches and unnecessary movements around the actors or scenes.

Someone was inspired by Michael Bay. And that isn't a good thing. It puts a dampener on an otherwise pretty amazing movie.

Without giving spoilers a few of the ideas implemented are great. At the same time, the movie does not try to subscribe to the ""bigger, better, more"" kind of sequel but keeps it simple, good, old school fun.

And that's great. Recommend to watch it wholeheartedly.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
268,5.0,18 June 2024,"STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * Awful

Smooth, stylish Mike Lowery (Will Smith) and comic sidekick Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) are each facing midlife obstacles, with Mike getting married, before Marcus suffers a health scare that forces him to reconsider his life choices. But both the guys are forced back into action, when renegade Agent McGraph (Eric Dane) sets a chain of events in motion where their late Captain Howard (Joe Pantoliano) is framed as a dirty cop. As the only man who can identify who ordered Howard's death, Mike's estranged, imprisoned son, and Howard's killer, Armando (Jacob Scipio) is released to assist Marcus and Mike, plunging them all into a deadly game of cat and mouse.

They say three is the magic number, but movies are a commercial business, and obviously the 'Bad Boys' franchise, despite incredibly stretching nearly thirty years despite only four films actually having been made, has a massive following, especially, I would wager, among the urban market . At least this latest offering from directors Adil El Asbi and Bilall Fallah, has arrived in comparatively recent succession from the last film, unlike the over decade long wait between the last film and the one before it, and certainly follows on accurately from the events last time around.

To be fair, there is a fairly coherent plot, and subplot, to match all the noise and explosions, of which there is much of. It's a capitalist product, designed to target a market it's fully aware of, and its main objective is to deliver the goods, but thankfully it doesn't treat its audience like complete morons. The odd thing is how the most comedic elements of the earlier films have become the source of the heaviest drama this time around, in the shape of Marcus's health concerns, and the spirit of Captain Howard visiting the boys to spur them on.

It is what it is, it knows its market perfectly well, and it's almost certainly going to make a lot of money. It's ultimately nothing more than that, but it delivers the goods, and should satisfy its target audience (like me.) I can see Bad Boys 5 round the corner. ***","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

270,7.0,15 June 2024,"Not a bad movie, but not great either.

Most of the ""comedy"" fell flat to me. My theater was relatively quiet most the time. Martin Lawrence acting too ridiculous too much. Even Bad Boys 3 was funnier than this movie, and 3 is not super funny, and at least Bad Boys 3 had a better plot and pacing to make up for it.

Ride or Die plot is super cliche and not very engaging, even for a Bad Boys movie. Bad Boys 3's plot was better, it's no masterpiece of course, but it's story almost played like a soap opera, but done surprisingly well for an action movie. But Bad Boy's 4 plot, I don't even know how to describe it, just incohesive and all over the place, feels like a bad Mission Impossible rip-off.

As for the action, it's just okay and nothing we haven't seen before. The action also sometimes tries to incorporate weird choppy camera tricks and gimmicks, and they flat out just don't work for me and took me out of the movie. I appreciate them trying to be more unique and experimental, but still wasn't good and not needed. Bad Boys 2 still has by far the best action of the whole series. Why won't Michael Bay come back to the series?

After the movie, I had this feeling that this movie was not needed at all. I'm surprised a lot of people are saying this is better than Bad Boys 3. I personally don't see it. Bad Boys 3 was much better, in both plot, pacing, action, and comedy. Bad Boys 3 has my favorite plot of the series, but Bad Boys 2 is just straight up the most fun to watch and never gets old, and it fits perfectly for what Bad Boys should be, an AWESOME AMAZING HARDCORE brainless action movie. So Bad Boys 2 is still the GOAT. Bad Boys 2 will still always be the best. It's hard to beat that classic high octane energy of classic Michael Bay, and Will Smith and Martin Lawrence were funnier than ever back then.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

I love all the bad boys movies but this one just made me dizzy from the camera angles. I also very much missed the original Teresa. The plot was excellent.

272,8.0,10 June 2024,"""Bad Boys: Ride or Die"" is a wild ride from start to finish, but not without its flaws. The fourth installment in the franchise, directed by Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, brings back the beloved duo of Will Smith and Martin Lawrence as Miami detectives Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett. Their chemistry is still the highlight, carrying the movie through its more contrived and chaotic moments.

The plot is admittedly a bit all over the place, with Mike and Marcus framed and on the run after the late Captain Howard is implicated in drug-related crimes. They face off against a mysterious mercenary and deal with various personal dramas along the way. While the storyline often feels convoluted and overly stuffed, the action sequences are undeniably fun and engaging, featuring impressive drone shots and explosive set-pieces.

Smith and Lawrence's banter remains sharp, though some jokes fall flat, and the character development sometimes feels shallow. The movie leans heavily on nostalgia and the established dynamic between its leads, which can be both a strength and a limitation.

Overall, ""Bad Boys: Ride or Die"" is an entertaining summer blockbuster that delivers on action and humor, even if its plot is a bit messy. It's worth watching for fans of the series, especially to see Smith and Lawrence in action again. I'd rate it a 6/10 for its fun factor and the undeniable charm of its leading duo.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
273,5.0,10 June 2024,"A couple of weeks ago the industry and moviegoers were on the verge of collapse and maximum uncertainty as they saw how the box office was moving away from the big blockbusters and hundreds of theories were beginning to be commented on, however, there was a fireproof couple. That would come to everyone's rescue to show that movie theaters are not dying, they are simply waiting for their ideal candidate to visit.

So the bad guys have brought people back to the movie theaters and they do it with their own merits, why again in their fourth installment they do it again with a fun, entertaining, epic, exciting and meaningless show that catapults Smith and Lawrence as the eternal Bad Boys who simply continue to do their best to provide us with fun in the purest style of a couple with whom we have grown up over time.

With an undisputed chemistry and scriptwriters who know how to take advantage of that relationship where they once again get it right in the comic dialogues of an unmatched Martin Lawrence and a Will Smith as the faithful squire that lead us to have two characters that continue to give the best funny moments within of an action film like the Bad Boys saga, they may be 20 years older and will continue to generate the same empathy with the viewer thanks to the fact that characters and actors strengthen each other. We also find a cast that is establishing itself within the universe and that contributes its degree of freshness, I think of you Jacob Scipio.

An interesting villain like Eric Dane, an Ioan Gruffudd who brings his simple touch and secondary characters who are full of sympathy like Hudgens, Ludwig and Nuñez.

The trick behind the saga is also knowing how to choose the heirs of Michael Bay where the Belgian directors are the perfect replacement to give freshness to the saga where they do not try to match Bay, but rather make their own version of a direction that in This fourth installment works perfectly and where they once again demonstrate that they are directors who know how to take advantage of their available budget, especially if we take into account that they only get 100 million to make a delivery with much more action than in their previous work. . They are 10 million more than in the previous one, but they make it perform as if they were double, great for the directors.

We have a script that is not complicated to a greater extent, it once again gives us somewhat clichéd aspects to link stories and characters, but it is not that they are a total disaster, taking into account that it tries to include new generations and an audience that is looking for something more that the bad is bad and the good is good. New generations that also prefer to have the context of certain things, whether we like it or not, these are the times and the script allows itself to please everyone and ultimately it doesn't look bad.

A strange, but satisfying soundtrack by Lorne Balfe and a photography loaded with what Bay accustomed us to by Robrecht Heyvaert, join a direction by a duo of directors that manages to provide sequences and moments that one can remember and enjoy with complete satisfaction.

Bad Boys: Ride or Die makes us have a fun and at times exciting show to continue consolidating a saga that never clashes that perhaps its two new installments do not come close to matching its two previous classics, but without a doubt they are tremendous films to provide entertainment and moments to enjoy with a couple of police officers who were born to ride together, die together and be rebels forever.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
274,6.0,23 August 2024,"A movie that delivers as much as its predecessor whilst still managing to create great setups for humour and action, if not too many.

The action is astoundingly innovative, with many unique pov and drone shots used in shoot-out set pieces. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence continue to deliver in their unmatched chemistry, selling the chaotic moments they find themselves in. The real highlights though ended up being Dennis Greene and Jacob Scipio as Reggie and Armando, respectively. They were able to independently entertain more than I thought, and got some of the best sequences of the movie.

However, the antagonists of this movie are very uninteresting, feeling more like relics of a generic 80s cop movie rather than being on par with the eccentric craziness of the franchise's previous villains. Joe Pantoliano, although in the film, is noticeably absent also, giving the movie a Captain-Howard-sized hole that's unable to be filled. Some minor nit-picks include a few comedic moments that border on parody, Mike's character arc in this feels too briefly touched upon and resolved too quickly, and the concept of the bad boys on the run feels somewhat like wasted potential with so many comedic possibilities left unexplored.

In conclusion, a decent follow-up and really good action movie overall that delivers on enough to keep you entertained, but misses enough to make you question whether it could have been better.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

Reggie was the main fella in this one though. Him single-handedly seeing off 15 bad guys. Proper boss move and great that we've literally seen him grow up and become the man he is in this film.

Although I had a few chuckles for the comic timing of Martin Lawrence. Some jokes were bad but some worked for me.

Somehow the side characters overshadowed the cops. Maybe it is done intentionally to drag the franchise further in future. I honestly don't think I'd want to watch another slice of it.

The comedy was fine and non PC which is refreshing in 2024 some jokes landed better than others still.

I had some issues with the directing specially the action scenes while the long takes look interesting they also look fake and I hated the fpc shooter during the big action scenes making a movie look like a game and a game cut scene is not the flex the director thought it was.

While some may perceive this comparison as a criticism, I intend it as a sincere compliment. The escapades of Mike and Marcus continue to entertain audiences, although Marcus's character (portrayed by Martin Lawrence) occasionally exhibits repetitive tendencies. Similar to Detective Lowery (played by Will Smith), I believe the writers could dedicate more effort to developing Marcus's backstory and providing him with more substantial screen time beyond his family dynamics. Nevertheless, it is commendable that the film consistently emphasizes Marcus's primary role as a devoted husband and father. The writers also introduce a new element to Mike's character, albeit somewhat predictably and at a relatively late stage in the franchise considering his past experiences. Despite this, I found it to be a welcome addition. Overall, my companion and I thoroughly enjoyed the film, experiencing both laughter and emotional moments.

Will Smith is a great actor and bad boys wouldn't be the same without him. This movie made over 100 million on its opening week, which is good.

The scenes were so dramatic and life-threatening that I could neither look away nor blink.

It shows that the writing was done in accordance with current pop culture, it doesn't feel outdated or anything like that. It was action-packed, of course!

283,7.0,19 June 2024,"""Bad Boys: Ride or Die,"" directed by Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, is a thrilling continuation of the beloved action-comedy franchise that once again pairs Will Smith and Martin Lawrence as the iconic duo, Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett.

285,6.0,17 June 2024,"I thoroughly enjoyed it, it doesn't do anything novel or unusual but what it does do it does extremely well.

Don't go into it expecting anything deep and meaningful and you will have fun.

Very good cinematography, well choreographed fight sequences. The acting is accomplished with flair as the main characters know their roles and stepped back into them with no flaws that I could see. Good accompanying characters. The wisecracks and humour is still there and isn't dated. The people around me in the cinema were laughing and obviously enjoying it.

If you liked previous films in the series you will enjoy this one and if you don't know them - why not?

286,7.0,15 June 2024,"I think this film is a classic Action Film, yes theres some over the top ""action moments"" but the core of the film is structured, and it works, its funny, good fight scenes, Will Smith is clearly doing everything he can to put the ""Chris Rock incident"" behind him, and i think with this film he does that, its time to move forward and let the film be the focus for what Will Smith is good at ""acting"" and not be one ""Moment of madness""... Will Smith has done enough films that dont live ""up"" to expectations, but i think this film he is back to his best.

Martin Lawrence is ""Classic Martin Lawrence"" and their partnership stands up to the film... great to see on the big screen in the theatre too!

In all fairness this is alot bettter then the 3rd film...","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
287,7.0,10 June 2024,"The Bad Boys franchise is one that I have always found enjoyment in, but only mildly with the first two movies. I just found them to be style over substance, but their chemistry always worked for me. It wasn't until 2020 when Bad Boys for Life came out, that the franchise found its true footing, in my opinion. The characters, story, and action all felt more real and believable to me, while also being ridiculous as always. For that, I was looking forward to Bad Boys: Ride or Die, and I must say I am a much bigger fan of these two new modern movies than the older movies. Here are my thoughts on the latest Bad Boys flick.

Picking up after the events of the third movie, Bad Boys: Ride or Die follows an aging Mike (Will Smith) and Marcus (Martin Lawrence) as they find out that their former captain (who is now deceased), has been framed. News gets out that he has been tied to drug cartels for years and with the help of Captain Rita Secada (Paola Núñez) and a mayoral candidate, Adam Lockwood (Ioan Gruffudd), they do everything they can to prove his innocence and protect the legacy of his name. There are a couple of very obvious subplot twists that come and go, so it's far from perfect, but the beating heart of why I liked the previous instalment so much, is very much present here as well.

The surprising revelation in the last movie that Mike has a son honestly added to the story in my opinion, and I'm very happy he wasn't forgotten about. He is just as prominent in this instalment and Jacob Scipio's portrayal steals the movie multiple times. I will also say that Marcus' son-in-law Reggie (Dennis Greene). Has a couple of great moments as well. This is a movie that gives the fans what they want in terms of characters, story, and action, even though it's all just ridiculous and not meant to be taken overly seriously. Directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah once again direct and their sensibilities are felt once again. They have a knack for making a good buddy cop movie and I would love to see an original one made by them.

Overall, Bad Boys: Ride or Die isn't quite as good as its predecessor, but that's okay because I still had a good time with it and the open ending hooked me for sure. Where I will say this movie suffers the most is in the editing. There were numerous times when it felt either too choppy, too slow, or just off. From a lot of fades to action scenes cutting between way too many different angles, it did feel jumbled at times. The action could've used a bit more time to breathe and the dramatic moments hit a little too hard for the type of film that it is, and it really does linger on those moments. Still, aside from how the film was assembled, I had a great time and I believe many others will too.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
288,4.0,10 June 2024,"Is 'Bad Boys: Ride Or Die' a good movie? Not really. Okay, is it entertaining? It has its enjoyable moments, definitely!

Admittedly, I have a soft spot for the first two of these buddy-cop movies. They're big, loud, oversaturated, switch-your-brain-off, fun. Quality entertainment.

Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah's third movie was something of a misfire, lacking in the fast-paced wit, humour and carnage that we saw in Michael Bay's 'Bad Boys 2'. However, Adil & Bilall's fourth installment is somewhat back on track, focusing on the great comedy pairing of Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. The chemistry between them when they bro-out and then bust each other's balls like an old married couple can be hilarious at times. And the high-octane action sequences (complete with a first person-style shootout and a giant alligator) are absolutely ridiculous. There's plenty of nostalgic nods along with a few cameos and some heartfelt (or shall we say cringeworthy?) moments too. Can't have it all, I guess...

What's missing from most entries in this franchise is a decent antagonist. These movies are quite high on body count and graphic violence, so if there's a Bad Boys 5, how about a sadistic villain who can rival the likes of Clarence Boddicker*?

290,5.0,6 September 2024,"""Bad Boys: Ride or Die"" is an entertaining, high-octane sequel that delivers on its promise of non-stop action and humor. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are back as Mike and Marcus, and their banter and chemistry are as strong as ever. The film's pacing is relentless, with breathtaking set pieces and intense hand-to-hand combat.

_Strengths:_

The action sequences are top-notch, with impressive stunts and choreography.


The humor is on point, with many laugh-out-loud moments courtesy of Mike and Marcus' banter.






_Weaknesses:_







_Verdict:_

Overall, ""Bad Boys: Ride or Die"" is a fun, action-packed ride that's sure to entertain fans of the franchise. While it may not break new ground in terms of storytelling, the chemistry between the leads and the impressive action sequences make up for it. With a few tweaks to the plot and tone, this could have been a truly great film. As it stands, it's a solid addition to the franchise.

_Rating:_ 7/10.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
291,5.0,6 September 2024,"I loved Bad Boys 1 & 2. Bad Boys 3 was mediocre. This, however, signals the end of the Bad Boys franchise. The plot was paper thin, predictable and not worth investing two hours of your time to watch.

For me, the Bad Boys franchise has died and horrible death and it is time to draw a line in the sand and call it quits. Like so many Hollywood sequels, they rely on the success of previous movies to get audiences to part with their money, with nothing given in return. I truly hope that this franchise is laid to rest and the movie studios do not try to resurrect this in the future.

RIP Bad Boys.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
292,7.0,30 August 2024,"Bad Boys: Ride or Die (essentially Bad Boys 4) is the latest in the franchise, of course starring Martin Laurence and Will Smith.

I came into this movie with fond distant memories of the first movie, not recalling at all what happening the second movie and not having even seen the third movie. So essentially I had pretty low expectations.

The chemistry between the two leads is still great and is the foundation of the film, though Lawrence will be as annoying to some as ever (if you don't like his routine from before, nothing has changed now).

Yes, there is a lot of the same formula from the first movie, but I found some of the unusual camera shots and perspectives of the action quite innovative and fun, and the action is will lit with a strong sense of orientation (which too many action films overlook, confusing the viewer). It's hard not to like the cinematography of a movie shot in and around Miami.

Yeah the plot is pretty thin but there are strong support characters giving a good relief from the main cast. There is an element of needing to have seen the other films to understand some context, but it is not a deal breaker.

Overall I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed this action movie for what it is.

7/10.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
293,7.0,25 July 2024,"The storyline is the same as before with no innovation. The jokes were not that good as they want you to laugh at anything. The punch lines from the main characters were so bad and they were over acting in every scene. From the first scene you would guess it's a bit boring. I hope they don't come up with more sequels and end it here.

Some action scenes are nice and innovative. The hilicopter part was the worst. Second worst scene when they met the artist and the fight started. Martin was really trying his best to make funny lines but they are mostly bad and repetitive..

People who rate this based on wills slap should not watch movies anymore as we all know it was staged :)","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
294,7.0,25 July 2024,"The fourth entry to the franchise has the bad boys all riled up after their favorite police Captain's legacy is tarnished over corruption charges. They know it's a conspiracy and vow to catch the culprits, who are responsible for framing the dead Captain. However, Marcus has fought back dead and is now believing himself to be invincible while Mike has married his physical therapist. They find out that Mike's son Armando is the sole witness who can identify the man responsible for not just framing the captain but also ordering the hit. As the duo are cornered with moles everywhere, they end up getting declared as fugitives after an attack makes them look like breaking out Armando. With the cops and media against them, what are the Bad Boys gonna do to serve justice, forms rest of the story.

I have always been lenient to this franchise and have found Martin Lawrence and Will Smith to be equally contributing. That changed with the fourth film as for some reason, the writers thought it is okay to make Will Smith's Mike Lowrey all gloomy and serious while Martin Lawrence's Marcus gets all the funny lines till the end. Honestly I wished for the Marcus slapping Mike to happen much earlier considering it really felt odd to watch Mike lose it in the third act. The writing it pretty much basic and definitely serviceable. The problem is the imbalance of humor and drama this time. The film is still a decent one time watch but it is meant to be an all out entertainer and it falls way short of that.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
295,7.0,25 July 2024,"Boys: Ride or Die.

This Summer, the world's favorite Bad Boys are back with their iconic mix of edge-of-your seat action and outrageous comedy but this time with a twist: Miami's finest are now on the run.

The Bad Boys are back again in Bad Boys: Ride or Die, I must admit at first that this is my favourite of the franchise so far and I really don't need more of this, four is enough.

This movie has so much style, the action sequences were well-done and directors here have surpassed my expectations, what a beautiful job and I hope they'll get a shot to work on some more big upcoming movies.

As I said, the style is here and the chemistry is still there, those two crazy guys are a joy to watch, I didn't care much about the plot because it's definitely the weakest part of this film and it's just going to get worse if they'll make another one... So please let this movie be the last of the franchise, it's a really good one as a closure.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
296,7.0,24 July 2024,"Not worth the watch. I was very disappointed. You can spot the villain in like 15 minutes and from there on no fun whatsoever. I feel like they need to stop making every 2000s movie into a sequel. It was nice till they did 3, and with this they just screwed my childhood.

It felt like they tried to bring Will Smith's fame back with it after his ""incident"" with Chris Rock.

The movie feels a bit forced to be honest. The only great part was approximately 5 minutes long where Reggie was shown in the house. The only worthy action. People are in a surprise with that one. I would suggest to skip the movie and just google Reggie scene.

I don't want to mean any disrespect for the people working behind the camera but movie didn't meet with the expectation.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
297,7.0,4 July 2024,"I just got out of Bad Boys 4

There are tons of jokes, loads of action (two brilliant set pieces) and overall, I enjoyed it.

Will Smith and Martin Lawrence have amazing chemistry, they are so good together!! But it's Martin Lawrence who steals this movie, he gets almost all the laughs. There is a switch in the dynamic of their relationship. Not sure how I feel about it. It was great to have Joe Pantoliano back and it a decent sized role.

Reggie, who is normally the butt of the joke, actually has a really good moment, that was one of my favourite parts of the movie.

Interestingly, I think the best two action scenes, did not involve Will Smith or Martin Lawrence.

It's not perfect as some of the jokes don't land, the bad guys were dull, I didn't feel any menace from them!! Some of the action was meh, the plots twists were predictable (I knew who the villain of the movie was, after their first scene) you never fall for any the red herrings, Venessa Hudgens isn't given much to do, after the third movie. Speaking of the third movie, I should have rewatched it, as I didn't know who a certain character was🙈

I was disappointed Theresa Randell isn't back!! Boycott it EvanB

If you didn't like part 3, you probably won't like this one. I'm sure lots will enjoy the heck out of it, too!!","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

The plot was good rehashing previous movies that lead to a more palpable outcome, Marcus overweight and eating junk... Mike still driving the Porsche with his small lens sunglasses with usual vest and fly away shirt, but now in fast lane both put their comedy chops to good use and the pace picks up more than the previous entry with more guns blazing and action that feels like a playback to the action movies of the 90s.

The cast is good, having characters of different races, all working together and without prejudice. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are great as this comical police couple, even to the point of black humor in some scenes, with Lawrence being the one who brings the film afloat, in addition to an explosive performance by the Mexican Paola Núñez and an outstanding performance by the British Jacob Scipio. The cinematography is typical, it is not bad but it is not excellent either.

It is great to see Martin and Will still at it, though you do notice the age a bit on the big screen. The cameo with the viral social media star is hilarious as well. There one other cameo by a famous music personality I won't spoil. Worth the watch, however would wait for it to be released to watch at home.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

What's dope is how they blend the classic Bad Boys vibe with fresh, modern elements. It's a perfect mix of nostalgia and new school. The supporting cast is lit too, adding flavor and depth to the whole flick.

In a nutshell, Bad Boys: Ride or Die is a thrill ride from start to finish. It's a must-see for fans of the franchise and action lovers alike. Props to the whole crew for delivering another banger!","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
302,8.0,26 June 2024,"Bad Boys: Ride or Die is pure popcorn entertainment- Adil & Bilall really come into their own with this one not as imitators of Michael Bay, but as successors. This is 90s Bayhem, without the Bay! Acrobatic drones, wild kinetics, and maximalist glee in their own flavor. The visuals are wild and creative, the action is ridiculous, and the comedy hits. It's a perfect summer tonic. Martin Lawrence and Will Smith still have it; they are such dynamically fun double acts! Their comedic timing and chemistry set this franchise apart from others (though it feels like it's becoming more Fast & Furious-esque). The film starts off rough, but Adil & Bilall's exhilarating direction and some top-notch action sequences ensure that it quickly gets better as it goes. At the end of the day, it's a popcorn movie; a real audience pleaser. It is an entertaining movie with a solid cast that doesn't do anything special but is still super fun.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
303,8.0,24 June 2024,"As with so many movies that have came out lately, common complaints are they are too long and too much cgi. Bad Boys: Ride or Die has a good running time and is very practical. Beyond that, it has its fun and knows what the audience wants out of it. It's not without its problems, but these can be mostly ignored since you'll spend most of the time laughing and enjoying these characters yet again.

I don't think any movie needs to prove why it's the fourth in a series that has spanned 29 years. At the minimum, it should be simply good. If it jumps the shark, then it could teeter towards being not good if it doesn't have anything to strongly counter balance some wackiness. Bad Boys 4 does have some wackiness, but it falls in line with the three previous movies really well. While some of the first act shenanigans might be on the brink of being over the top for some, the movie does settle down to become a well done action film. As previously mentioned. It's the comedy that stands toe to toe with the action. A great example of this is a scene where our two main actors are trying to get out of a situation where they are stealing a vehicle and clothes from some characters that might be a little racist. Instead of stopping to preach to the audience, we get a very funny scene that reverses the comedic expectations.

The movie is never boring. The tight script keeps things moving along and interesting throughout, so any negatives are quickly forgotten while you watch it. Sure, they'll weigh appropriately on my review, but they don't take away from the positive experience. Rather than trying to appeal to everyone. I'm so glad Bad Boys 4 appealed to fans of action movies with a healthy dose of laugh out loud comedy.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
304,6.0,22 June 2024,"So, Bad Boys Ride or Die came out this week. I have some mixed feelings about this entry into the series, so let's break it down.

Let's start out with the good. The movie is exactly what you would expect coming from a Bad Boys movie. There's plenty of action, comedy, and the chemistry between Will Smith's ""Mike"" and Martin Lawrence's ""Marcus"" is still there. The story is enough to keep you engaged for the 1 hr and 55 minute runtime. The writers once again add the family elements and emotional tones carry over from ""Bad Boys For Life."" There are some big changes going on in Mike's life as well as Marcus', but just like the characters themselves, Mike takes it seriously while Marcus makes fun with it. Some of the action sequences are outstanding with great camera work, specifically the helicopter sequence. One area of ""Bad Boys For Life"" I felt fell flat was the end CGI FX. Luckily, this movie may have learned from that for the better. One action highlight that was completely unexpected comes from Reggie. Also, keep an eye out for the Michael Bay cameo.

Let's move on to the aspects of the movie I really didn't care for. The single aspect of the movie's story I didn't care for revolves around Marcus. His character is and always will be the comedic element to keep the movie light, but there are some instances in this movie that seem to go too stupid. There is one action sequence taking place in a club, and Marcus makes a point to drink punch and attempt to eat jelly beans during the shootout. It just didn't fit the mood of the scene and breaks the flow of this otherwise great action sequence. The other issue with the movie I had was with the overused up the barrel of the gun, first person view. It was great in the final fight, but the sporadic use of it elsewhere in the film didn't have a great impact on those scenes.

Overall, the movie continues to keep you engaged with the characters we've loved for almost 30 years now. There is plenty of action and fun. Sony has put out a behind the scenes video of how some of the camera work was done and it shows how much went into it to deliver an action sequence I don't recall ever seeing before.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
305,5.0,18 June 2024,"Action sequences are well made. Cops trying to shoulder a cop is nice to see. The special thing about the action sequence is that it is funny too. Marcus is really funny. He does guide Mike, though Mike is smarter. There is a thin line of righteousness seen all along the movie. The plot that the mayor is the culprit can't be guessed easily. The final action sequence where Mike handles the Villain is a classy one. The movie ends with a comedy which brings smiles to the people, when they leave the cinema hall. Overall, the movie is a good cop movie to watch. Bad Bays did ride and will ride in the box office too.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
306,7.0,17 June 2024,"After getting married, Mike Lowrey's celebration is cut short when he learns that the late Captain Howard is being framed for making deals with the cartel. He and Marcus Burnett go on the case to prove his innocence, but soon, they are framed. With the help of Mike's son Armando, the two detectives have to go on the run as fugitives while proving their innocence and their late captain's innocence.

Bad Boys: Ride or Die is the biggest surprise of the year so far. I already thought it looked good, but it is now my favorite movie from the Bad Boys series as it lets loose from the last film. Despite being a comedy, Bad Boys: Ride or Die has a very engaging story. The movie has the two detectives on the run alongside Armando which creates some spicy stakes for several reasons.

One: They have to go out of their way to prove that Captain Conrad Howard did nothing wrong to people in power. They are dead set on Howard being guilty so that makes it difficult to even build a case to prove his innocence.

Two: Nearly every character has a vulnerable moment. Not only are Mike and Marcus involved, but so is Armando, Howard's family, their allies from the last film, Marcus' family and Mike's wife. This is a movie that puts everyone in danger at least once making it important for everyone to stay on their toes.

Three: Mike and Marcus have very few people who they can trust. With a bounty on them, they have to watch their own backs. The only person they can trust while on the run is a convicted murderer who has the details on who set Howard up.

Ride or Die shows that just because a movie is a comedy, it does not have to be without tension or intrigue. The tone does a great job balancing out the humor and the dramatic scenes. Speaking of which, this movie is just as funny as the other films, if not funnier. This is the first time in a while that I have been laughing hard in an auditorium. The comedic timing with gags is gold especially the banter between Mike and Marcus. There is one moment in the climax that cracked me up hard. The script is really strong here with a tone that allows the stars to revel in comedic moments more than the last film, but still keep their dramatic chops.

The performances are great too. Will Smith is a great straight man who keeps Martin Lawrence in check. He handles most of the dramatic moments beautifully which also makes his comedic lines more impeccably timed. Martin Lawrence on the other hand is a riot here. The last movie had him take a more dramatic turn with his character Marcus as a concerned partner to Mike. In this movie, he goes fully comedic and he is glorious to watch. His banter with Mike and reactions to everything are a joy. Lawrence has the best lines and delivery. He and Smith are the perfect duo as their chemistry is at a high with this film. Their dynamic never gets old.

The supporting cast is pretty good too. The standout is Jacob Scipio as Armando who is very authentic and committed. He brings a level of heart and sincerity to a film full of comedy especially during his scenes with Mike. Scipio has chops to be a great action star, especially with how handles the prison scene. Dennis Greene as Reggie is great in this movie as he gets his time to shine big time here which made me happy. Mike and Marcus' allies from the last film return and while they are not deep characters, they are very likable and they contribute to the story and action. Paola Nunez as Rita has a moment here that made me cheer on the inside because it subverts a really annoying trope about love. Eric Dane as the villain James McGrath could have been given a little more to do, but his presence and line delivery help make him an effective villain. Also, there are some twists with this character that tie him with the conflicts of the last two films.

The one disappointing part in this cast is how they wasted Rhea Seehorn as Judy Howard. Judy is a character that had potential to be a big part of the story having a vendetta against Armando and being the daughter of Howard, but she gets very few scenes and leaves hardly impact on the story. Honestly, if you take her out, not much changes in the story. That is my only major flaw with the movie as the rest of the cast is great.

Production-wise, this movie sticks with the colorful style of the last film, but turns it up a notch. There are several scenes filled to the brim with colorful lights and objects making the cinematography and lighting quite eye-catching. However, it is the action scenes that truly make this movie standout visually. The sequences here are amazing! They are beautifully shot and choreographed with inventive camerawork, fights that get violent and intense and creative settings for the set pieces. Just a couple of highlights include Armando taking down a gang of prisoners in a prison yard, Reggie's whole action scene at the Burnett house and most importantly, the first-person sequence in the climax. That has to be one of the coolest action scenes I have seen on the big screen beating a lot of flashier films. Adil El Arbi and Billah Fallah cranked up the craziness in this movie with their direction and they did a great job on making a film more comedic, but keeping the dramatic scenes and ramping up the action. The soundtrack is pretty good and it I really enjoyed listening to the Bad Boys score in theaters.

I enjoyed Bad Boys: Ride or Die a lot more than I thought I would. I was already looking forward to it, but this is one of the most entertaining and intense movies of the year. There is not a single dull moment in this film. The fact that Adil El Arbi and Billah Fallah directed a film with such energy, creativity and hilarity makes me believe that their Batgirl film would have been great too. I cannot wait to see what they do next after this action-packed joyride.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
307,7.0,15 June 2024,"I watched Bad Boys 4 and I can say that it was fresh and OK for the most part. They did much better compared to last time, although they had overdone it with Marcus's jokes. The first half in particular got me worked up, especially with the weird camerawork and *close-ups* of the puffy face of the no-longer-prime-young Martin Lawrence, making him look too cartoonish at times. Otherwise, I admit, the movie has hits, especially how the iconic Reggie is developed. I also really liked Marcus' whole arc and how it changes the course of the movie. Smith and Lawrence still have chemistry, although I don't know if it's because of age, at times it was already noticeable that Will was struggling a bit with the role. Somehow it didn't come as naturally as it used to, while Lawrence just covered up his age and speaking difficulty with grimaces and cartoonish overacting. I liked that they don't take themselves too seriously, although that's also largely a minus.

The movie is quite predictable, with standard classic tropes for such an action-comedy, in the spirit of the 90s and early 2000s. In fact, it looked like a TV show at times. And honestly, the strongest part are the final 30 minutes. Contrary to the previous film, where the still new directors Bilal and Adil tried to end with some kind of epic shootout (but it was kind of a sham), here the ending is the strongest part. It looks like they have developed a lot. But it's still obvious at times that they're trying to emulate Bay, and even though they've thrown in a lot more original camera movements and filming ideas this time around, there are issues with both editing and pacing. The music was also quite disappointing and with a lot of repetitive elements.

In general, a commendable experience, a fresh film in the spirit of old-school action comedies, hit or miss humor, but a little more effort is evident in the action. Despite the problems, much better than the previous one, which was just some amateurish attempt at a copy of Michael Bay.

308,1.0,15 June 2024,"I realised while watching ""Bad boys - ride or die"" that i don't actually remember the other movies all that well. So maybe i'm missing something. But as a casual viewer it still made for an ok movie.

These movies are action comedies, and the action here is old school and has some cool moments. Which i do remember all the previous movies having. But you might be waiting a while for them. As majority of the film is a comedy, and this is more of a mixed bag.

Some of the banter between Will Smith and Martin Lawrence works, but just as much of it doesn't. The whole film feels like all those related Michael Bay movies. Which i always thought had alot of ups and downs. Turns out they still do.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
309,1.0,13 June 2024,"What are you going to do when the bad boys come for you? This question has been asked since 1995, and there still seems to be no answer. Luckily for you, I'm here to tell you that you don't need to worry about it, because the bad boys aren't coming for you, yet. In BAD BOYS: RIDE OR DIE, Mike (Will Smith) and Marcus (Martin Lawrence) are back, with Mike getting married and Marcus having a near-death experience, making him believe he can't die. WARNING! Upcoming spoilers from the previously released BAD BOYS FOR LIFE! The deceased Captain Howard is being framed for corruption, and the Bad Boys are the only ones trying to clear his name and preserve his posthumous legacy. This installment is just as good as the last one. I like how they brought the elements that made the last one a hit into this new one. After all this time, Smith and Lawrence's on-screen chemistry is still amazing and is still the heart of this franchise. The humor is still silly, but it mostly hits. The plot is simple, the antagonist very ""villain-of-the-week"". Also there are a few cameos that were a bit strange. I didn't really care about that though. You don't see a BAD BOYS movie for the compelling story. You go for the fun, over-the-top action scenes, of which there are plenty. I especially enjoyed some unique camera movements that look like drone shots, also a first-person shooter angle that made the gamer in me happy. If you enjoyed BAD BOYS FOR LIFE, I believe you will definitely enjoy RIDE OR DIE.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
310,8.0,13 June 2024,"Keep it brief review:

""Bad Boys: Ride or Die"" Once again marks the return of dynamic duo Will Smith and Martin Lawerence. This time the bad boys set out to clear their deceased captains name and their own as they dive head first into a conspiracy involving the Miami police department and the cartel. The end result is a very fun and funny summer blockbuster reminiscent of the early 00's. Shut your brain off and you'll have a very fun ride.

Positives: + Martin Lawrence is clearly having a blast and steals the spotlight + Great action scenes + Consistent humour throughout the film, not afraid to poke fun at itself or it's actors

Negatives:

311,7.0,10 October 2024,After the last horrific movie we decided not to see this in a theatre. Extremely wise choice. This is the worst movie I've seen in years. Probably since the last one. It's starts off with a cop racing unsafely through the streets because he's late for something and goes downhill from there. I knew immediately who the betrayer was and how most scenes would go down because that's just how unimaginative the filmmakers were. Terribly directed and acted and I didn't even a crack a smile once. The action scenes might have been halfway decent if it didn't look like the cameraman was having seizures while filming it. I'm a huge Smith fan but my patience was sorely tested here. Martin as always continues to be one of the most unlikabke actors of all time and here he takes it to another level ( we were pulling for the gator to eat him ). The two saving graces were my city ( Miami ) looked stunning and Dane made a good villain. The utter pits of moviemaking. Let's hope this is the last one.,"June 7, 2024 (United States)"

I for one will not watch this movie or any other movie that Will Smith is in. He's arrogant and thinks he can get away with asault and battery. I guess he did, but that doesn't mean I have to reward him.

If you watch this movie, it means you approve of Will Smith's actions when he slept comedian, Chris Rock hard across the face at the Academy Awards in front of the entire world watching.

This review is supposed to be at least 600 words, but I think I've said it all... I'm only feeling space now so I can submit this review.

314,5.0,25 September 2024,"I honestly didn't expect to have a good time with this movie, considering the disaster that was Bad Boys For Life in 2020 and its well-deserved 4/10.

But this film is indeed entertaining, fast-paced, dizzying and always favoring the overall spectacle. Adil & Bilall bring out their best skills in their action sequences, because the best facet of Ride or Die is simply the action. They manage to entertain and amaze the audience with drone shots, fast camera movements and angles that help idealize the protagonists, despite their bad makeup and bad hair. The performances are decent for an action comedy. The story is not exactly original, but it works to continue the plot thread of the previous film.

The comedy part unfortunately remains lacking. It's still absurd in the bad sense of the word. Boring jokes, situations with a weak punchline and dialogues too cliché to be funny.

Recommended for those looking for action and comedy, bullets and blood, crocodiles and donkeys in a movie.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
315,6.0,19 September 2024,"Greetings from Lithuania.

""Bad Boys: Ride or Die"" (2024) is 4-th film in the series and it does what all previous films did - it entertains for one evening and then you forget it and never rewatch it. ""Ride or Die"" isn't a great action movie, but it is a pretty good one. I liked most of the film, pacing was good, acting is solid for this type of film. Action scenes were descent, with particularly one in the house that clearly took inspiration from John Wick movies - and i will leave it at that. At its running time 1 h 50 min it does its job for one evening - it entertains.

Overall, ""Bad Boys: Ride or Die"" is a pretty good movie to recommend it to see if you have seen previous ones and at least mildly enjoyed them. Its well paced and has funny moments, action scenes are descent and its entertaining.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
316,6.0,5 September 2024,"Alright, Bad Boys in 2024 is like dusting off your old Nokia 3310: you know it's going to work, but you're not entirely sure if you need this nostalgia fix. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are back-older, but still ready to cause chaos. These two are like the ""Tanguy"" of action movies, refusing to retire. And honestly, it's for our enjoyment. Miami better watch out, because the old-timers are back with jokes as sharp as a kitchen knife from Lidl.

Looking for that classic Michael Bay style? You got it. Explosions everywhere, cars flying, and Will Smith cracking one-liners mid-gunfight. It's pure Bad Boys-nothing revolutionary, but there's that comforting feeling of a tried-and-true formula. Like grabbing a Big Mac at 3 a.m., you know it's not gourmet, but it hits the spot.

There's a fun little nod to the original Bad Boys too: the Porsche, and guess who's behind the wheel? None other than Michael Bay. The guy's not directing this time, but they give him one last lap, like saying, ""Hey, we haven't forgotten who started this."" The plot, though? Straightforward and effective, but nothing mind-blowing. It's a popcorn flick: you're here for the eye candy, not to overthink things.

Will and Martin-let's be honest-they've aged. But do they still bring it? Absolutely. The punchlines are flying, their chemistry is still on point, and even though Martin Lawrence now gives off ""uncle telling jokes at the barbecue"" vibes, it works. It's just fun to watch these two bounce off each other. The whole ""we're old but still got it"" angle is well played, and you can't help but smile.

The soundtrack gives you a subtle callback to the original theme, like a little wink for the die-hard fans. It's not Hans Zimmer, but it takes you right back to the late '90s, and it feels good. That old-school vibe is there, and it makes you miss the kind of movies where you could just switch off your brain and enjoy the ride.

Bad Boys Ride or Die is pure entertainment. You're not getting any groundbreaking innovation here, but you're going to have a blast watching these gunslinging cops who refuse to grow old. It's fun, it sticks to the formula, and it gets the job done. But seriously, guys, you've given us everything-maybe it's time to hang it up before you end up like the Rolling Stones, stuck on an eternal farewell tour.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

So can any one make him be quiet just for a one minutt.

So what what the movie like. The reason I watched it was.

Poster design (Miami) and Rehea Seahorn and thats was the only reason.

But it was nice to watch a action movie these days thats how bad the movies is these days when this was something to enjoy something I cannot say about many others films these days so it was nice to have some action to watch. But do I wanna watch it again, no.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
318,6.0,13 August 2024,"Unacquainted with the Bad Boys franchise prior to Bad Boys:Ride or Die, my primary motivation for viewing the film was the presence of Will Smith. While the film undoubtedly caters to established fans, its overtly dramatic inclinations detracted from my overall enjoyment. A conventional action spectacle featuring a singular antagonist, the film follows the established formula of the series.

The narrative revolves around the exoneration of the late Captain Conrad, a plot device that serves as a catalyst for the central dynamic between Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett. The introduction of Mike's incarcerated son, Armando, adds a familial layer to the established partnership, providing a tangential exploration of paternal responsibilities and familial bonds. The triumvirate ultimately confronts the primary antagonist, McGrath, in a climactic showdown.

The film's exploration of Mike's complex personal life, balancing his current familial obligations with the demands of his past, offers a fleeting glimpse into the character's depth. Moreover, the dynamic between the two protagonists, characterized by a blend of camaraderie and comedic interplay, remains a cornerstone of the series. While certain comedic moments were effective, others felt contrived and predictable.

Overall, Bad Boys Ride or Die is a competent entry in the franchise, delivering the expected blend of action and humor. However, its adherence to familiar tropes limits its capacity to innovate or surprise.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
319,6.0,11 August 2024,"Though enjoyable, Bad Boys: Ride or Die does very little to offer anything fresh.

The movie does boast some decent action set pieces and some great stunt work, but the comedy just fails to hit that sweet spot and feels a little forced.

Will Smith's performance shines through as he drags Martin Lawrence through this retread of tired storytelling. I love Martin but he just feels off in this movie.

They need to stop riding this franchise and let it go before it descends into just another over the top CGI fest that the Fast and Furious has become.

As much as I like Will and Martin I think its time to let the Bad Boys retire.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
320,6.0,30 July 2024,"A noteworthy addition to the franchise. This film seamlessly blends modern filmmaking techniques with classic cinematography. The directors strike a perfect balance - the movie feels fresh while retaining the franchise's nostalgic charm. The transitions, shifting perspectives (POVs), and the hazy, gradient yellow skies perfectly capture the essence of Miami and its finest.

Will Smith and Martin Lawrence's on-screen bromance and comedic timing remain a delight. Their chemistry is the heart of the film, even amidst explosive action sequences with plane crashes and alligators. While the side characters were effective, a little more screen time for them could have further enriched the story. Overall, the film maintains a steady pace that keeps you engaged.

Dennis Greene's Reggie was a force to be reckoned with. He grabbed the opportunity with open arms and left the audience speechless with his action sequence. Jacob Scipio also impressed as Armando Armas, bringing a crispness to his character

Sum up - The film's success lies in its masterful blend of hilarious humor and cutting-edge filmmaking techniques.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
321,5.0,24 July 2024,"This franchise has gone ONLY SLOWLY downhill from the first one, but this attempt is still pretty good. Martin Lawrence has bounced back from his stoke like a champ and is still one of the funniest guys in the business. It was good to see him and also good to see these two together again.

The pair seemed more intense than in past films, even during the comedic parts, and that kind of distracted from the humor, bujt it still came through enough for the audience to get a laugh.

Too bad a lot of folks are still holding ""the slap"" against Will Smith. Yes, the dude's had (and still has) problems, but he's an actor--forget it and enjoy the ride. I wouldn't have anything to do with him in real life, but movies aren't real life.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
322,1.0,15 July 2024,"One of the Summer's biggest unknown blockbuster's, the fourth instalment of the Bad Boys franchise Ride or Die has become one of the surprise success stories of the up and down movie season, with it also becoming one of the rare examples of where not messing with the formula has once more served this newest entry, to become another highly entertaining and throwaway addition to the series.

Directed again by duo Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, who back up their solid work from 2020's Bad Boys for Life, Ride or Die gives audiences more of what they will want from the exploits of BFF's and Miami detectives Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett with an adrenaline filled, Red Bull infused version of an action comedy that at the same time marks the return of Will Smith following ""Slapgate"", which based off the critical/audience reception and box off return of this feature suggest all has been forgiven for the shamed A-lister.

A remarkable story of resilience and staying power and now a bastion of old Hollywood franchises that have somehow managed to stay relevant and wanted in today's pop culture scene, Ride or Die continues to harbour the same amount of energy, chemistry and spectacle as past entries in the franchise, with the kicker this time around being that Smith's Lowrey and Lawrence's Burnett find themselves wanted men in a to be expected type of narrative that sees back and forth banter, snappy action kicks and pretty locales/stars remain front and centre throughout the films close to two hour running time.

Make no doubt about it, there's little in the way of subtilty, restraint or care of making an ounce of sense on display here but that's entirely to be expected with Ride or Die a film for the fans and a film best left avoided by anyone who has never enjoyed the one time Michael Bay lead property with there being little reason to expect this frenetic offering is going to change anyone's opinion of the Bad Boys property.

Key to the films perfectly adequate middle ground success is once more the comradery of Smith and Lawrence who ensure their having a blast together first and foremost while the sun-soaked locales of Miami and it's nearby surrounds goes hand in hand with Arbi and Fallah's directional sensibilities with the two directors paying homage to Bay's style over substance approach while at the same time infusing this latest addition with their own flavour that further showcases the directors as new kingpins of the Hollywood action event.

A pleasantly appeasing offering in a Summer season that has started to showcase glimmers of hope in what was initially a period of dark clouds and much talk of despair, Ride or Die may not break any new ground but it gives us all a perfectly good piece of popcorn entertainment as well as further evidence that this duo has more to still give.

Final Say -

For anyone that's ever enjoyed the Bad Boys series, Bad Boys: Ride or Die is going to be another winner making it one to avoid for haters and one to savour for the fans.

323,8.0,26 June 2024,"""Bad Boys: Ride or Die,"" the 2024 addition to the iconic franchise, delivers the expected blend of high-octane action and humor, though it doesn't quite reach the heights of its predecessors. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence reprise their roles as Detectives Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett, bringing their signature chemistry and banter to the screen once again.

The plot centers around a new threat that tests their partnership and pushes them to their limits. The film is packed with explosive sequences, car chases, and shootouts, maintaining a breakneck pace that keeps viewers entertained. The visual effects and stunts are impressive, showcasing the franchise's commitment to delivering thrilling action.

However, ""Ride or Die"" falls short in terms of originality. The storyline feels predictable, relying heavily on established tropes and lacking the fresh twists that could have elevated it. The humor, while effective at times, occasionally feels forced and repetitive.

Overall, ""Bad Boys: Ride or Die"" is an enjoyable ride for fans of the series, but it doesn't bring much new to the table. It's a solid action movie with familiar faces and explosive fun, making it a decent, though not exceptional, addition to the franchise.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
324,8.0,9 October 2024,"""Bad Boys: Ride or Die"" is about what I expected. It has some pretty good action sequences, and the chemistry between Lawrence and Smith is still there. I just never really understood what the movie was about all that much. I didn't get into the plot, and none of the other characters registered all that much. Especially the villain. I'm not even sure who the villain was. There was another character who kind of looked like him and it was hard to tell them apart.

There is a weird plot point where Martin Lawrence's character has a near death experience and wanders through the movie like a seer. Will Smith's character is sceptical.

This new agey stuff made Lawrence's character a little annoying, though maybe that's the point? Will Smith seemed curiously muted. You can't help but view his performance here as connected to his infamous Oscar slap. He seems like he's not too sure what he's doing, so he's just going to put his head down and do what he's told. The charisma and humour isn't there so much.

The movie tries a few gimmicks that seem to be typical for Netflix. It's like they know you're probably watching their movie in one tab with a bunch of different tabs open, so they're trying to make you stay on theirs. For example, in one scene the angle changes to behind the gun like in a first person shooter video game. Then Will Smith tosses the gun to Martin Lawrence and the camera follows it as though mounted on it.

The movie really needed more of this. It needed more attention grabbing tricks in general. The script, particularly, barely has any.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

328,7.0,29 September 2024,"*Bad Boys: Ride or Die* is an action-packed, high-energy film that delivers exactly what fans of the franchise are looking for-comedy, explosions, and fantastic chemistry between the leads. For me, the movie was an enjoyable experience from start to finish. It successfully combines humor and intense action, creating a thrilling rollercoaster that kept me entertained throughout.

The comedic elements are one of the film's strongest points. The banter between the two leads, which has been a staple of the *Bad Boys* franchise, is in top form here. Their chemistry is effortless, and the witty back-and-forth exchanges never feel forced. If you've enjoyed the humor in previous *Bad Boys* films, you'll definitely appreciate what this one has to offer. The jokes land well, and the comedic timing is sharp, making sure there's always something to laugh at in between the intense action sequences.

Speaking of action, *Bad Boys: Ride or Die* doesn't hold back. The film is full of well-choreographed action scenes, including explosive car chases, intense shootouts, and adrenaline-pumping fight scenes. The filmmakers clearly put a lot of effort into making the action sequences both exciting and visually impressive. What I appreciated most was that the action was thrilling without going too over the top. It's easy to get lost in endless explosions or exaggerated stunts in action movies, but this film struck a good balance, making the action feel impactful without being overly ridiculous.

One of the standout aspects of this movie is the cast. The acting is solid, and the performances are strong across the board. The leads have an undeniable chemistry that has been a defining feature of the franchise, and it's on full display in this installment. Their dynamic brings both humor and heart to the story, which helps ground the film, especially during the more serious or emotional moments. The supporting cast also does a great job, adding depth to the story without overshadowing the leads. It's clear that everyone involved had a great time making the movie, and that energy translates to the screen.

The production quality of *Bad Boys: Ride or Die* is another aspect worth noting. The film is visually stunning, with great cinematography that highlights the fast-paced action. The cityscapes, chase sequences, and vibrant settings are all beautifully shot, making the movie feel like a visual spectacle. The production team did an excellent job in making sure the film looks polished, sleek, and exciting, enhancing the overall experience. Additionally, the sound design complements the action well, adding tension and excitement to the scenes without overwhelming the audience.

Without giving away any spoilers, I can say that the story is engaging and straightforward. It's not a particularly deep or complex narrative, but that's not what I was expecting going into this movie. *Bad Boys: Ride or Die* focuses on delivering a fun, action-packed plot that serves as the perfect vehicle for the comedy and action to shine. The pacing is just right, with the story moving along at a good clip, ensuring that there's never a dull moment. The twists and turns are enough to keep you engaged, but they don't distract from what the movie does best: entertaining its audience.

Overall, I would give *Bad Boys: Ride or Die* a solid 8/10. It's the kind of movie that knows exactly what it is and delivers on that promise. It doesn't try to be something more profound or groundbreaking, and that's perfectly fine. If you're looking for an enjoyable action-comedy that offers plenty of laughs and adrenaline-pumping moments, this movie won't disappoint.

In conclusion, *Bad Boys: Ride or Die* is a fun, entertaining film that stays true to the spirit of the *Bad Boys* franchise. The chemistry between the leads, the top-notch production, and the well-executed action scenes make it a great watch for fans of the series or anyone who enjoys a good action-comedy. While it might not break new ground in the genre, it's an undeniably enjoyable film that delivers exactly what it promises.

I dislike that so much. ""Jokes"" for no reason. Stupid jokes. The first two movies told a much better story - the jokes felt legit. This time, it's like they're trying to redo stuff already done, and it made me feel stupid for watching it.

Anyway, the rest of it was OKAY. Below average though, so gave it 4 stars which wasn't unkind to it. I DO NOT understand any ratings higher than that though - must be teens giving it higher than that. Sorry, I don't want to sound like a lame old dude, really...I'm actually not that. I just hate it when the studios clearly don't even try. We should never settle for mediocre or we'll lull them into thinking we're okay with that. We're not, nor should we be.

The comedic timing is off, and the actors seem more interested in hamming it up for the camera than delivering anything remotely believable.

The original Bad Boys set a high bar with its mix of action, humor, and chemistry between the leads, but this latest installment is just a reminder that the franchise has been on a steady decline ever since. What used to be edgy and exciting is now reduced to predictable gags and over-the-top antics. By the time the credits roll, you're left wondering why you wasted your time.

I thought I would hang on just a little longer and give it a try. The story line started to pick up and so did the action although running around meant 'driving around'. I actually found myself enjoying it as it drew on. It is worth the watch in my opinion but don't expect the same amount of whooohoo as the previous Bad Boy movies, these guy have aged and not in the shape they used to be but the humor is still good and the story line was not that bad.

332,7.0,13 September 2024,"Truthfully, I feel bad for the poor souls that were duped into watching this in the theater. The real bad boys here are Sony and Columbia pictures who are giving us a shameful example of how to milk a franchise to the bone. On top of that there are several product placements that becomes annoying and silly and make the character of Marcus look like a sugar-hyped drunken addict.

The first 2 minutes of the movie are promising. We get a taste of the good old ""Bad Boys"" series, where Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) is the cool dangerous cop and Marcus (Martin Lawrence) is the soft, comic relief, but the following ~2 hours are a complete mess, where our heroes trying to clear the name of their beloved late captain Howard after he's being framed by the cartel. Having to go through their own name smearing, several mediocre CGI scenes and multiple 'F' bombs. Plus, you will never guess who is behind all this (unless you are over the age of 9, in which case you will guess it within 10 minutes)

Any saving grace for this movie? In general acting is not bad and the audience gets a super dose of gunfights and explosions, also fight choreography is decent. So if you're in for a ""brain-dead"" forgettable movie this could make 2 hours go by quickly.

Overall this movie is a real disappointment for the fans of the franchise. Those who remember how good Bad Boys I and II were. Not because they carry a huge amount of body-count, or have crazy CGI camera spins, but rather those who truly make you connect with the characters, laugh at their jokes and feel their misery.

Some of the scenes are so bad here, I'm pretty sure they were improvised on the spot (like the grill scene and the wedding scene as an example). Some movies have great improvisation and comedic excellence, but not here, as the entire script is just miserable, and lacking any sense of good humor.

Oooh, btw- there is a hidden scene way deep into the credits. I'm sure not many people stayed around for that long, but don't worry if you missed it, that scene is, unsurprisingly, another dud. Exact score: 54 / 100.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

The film effectively taps into the chemistry between Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, offering fans a much-anticipated reunion of the iconic duo. Their banter and camaraderie remain the heart of the film.

The action is undeniably thrilling, with well-choreographed sequences and impressive stunt work. The film doesn't shy away from over-the-top violence, catering to the franchise's signature style.

Supporting actors like Jacob Scipio, Ioan Gruffudd, and Rhea Seehorn add depth and energy to the film, contributing to the overall entertainment value.

The plot follows a familiar formula, lacking the freshness and surprises of earlier installments. The narrative is straightforward and predictable, offering little in terms of plot twists or unexpected developments.

The film struggles with pacing, with some scenes feeling overly extended while others rush through important plot points. This unevenness disrupts the overall flow of the story.

The film boasts impressive cinematography and editing, especially during the action sequences. The visual style is sleek and modern, complementing the fast-paced nature of the story. However, the sound design could have been more impactful, particularly during some of the louder action scenes.

Will Smith and Martin Lawrence deliver their signature performances, bringing their characters to life with effortless charm and comedic timing. The supporting cast provides solid performances, contributing to the overall energy of the film.

Bad Boys: Ride or Die is a fun, action-packed film that will satisfy fans of the franchise. While it lacks the originality of its predecessors, the film's strong performances, impressive action sequences, and nostalgic appeal make it a worthwhile watch. However, those expecting a groundbreaking entry in the series might be left wanting more.

Overall, the film is a solid addition to the franchise but falls short of reaching the heights of its predecessors.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
334,7.0,11 October 2024,"First off I'm a big Will Smith fan, and I wanted to like this one, but I made it about 3/4th of the way and bailed. The only time the movie had real soul was when Smith was standing up against the FBI insulting his former captain.

I thought it was really going to get its legs after that, but sadly it just returned to a collection of ordered scenes that were primarily rehash eye/stunt candy, but did nothing to pull you more deeply into the characters or the story.

It's average when compared to stuff out there today, but i think the bar is naturally higher for a Smith movie and a classic like Bad Boys. The story needed to engage more in a way that more honestly reflects where those characters might find themselves years down the line while still giving the flavor of a Bad Boys movie.

Its tricky with an aged followup but not impossible and they should have really held out for a script that gave something new while maintaing the Bad Boys feel.

Lastly the story should have demanded a bit more updated and experienced comedy from the legends Smith and Martin, instead of once again rehashing same old stuff like they are still in their 20's 30's. They needed to reach a little deeper considering the age of the this franchise, their own ages and the fans that have come along and aged with them. It just seemed they phoned it in by hitting replay on their normal schtick... I know that's not the case but what can i say, i expected more.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
335,7.0,9 October 2024,"Love them or hate them. Bad Boys was a one hit wonder. The sequel was super angry (not surprising considering the politics behind it at the time). Bad Boys For Life was a weird forgettable LAAAATE installment and unnecessary sequel that killed legacy characters. This one is kind of a mix between them all making it sort of a ""legacy"" sequel. 1995-2024. Nearly a 30 year span of a buddy cop film that is definately unconventional. Almost 10 years between the first two, and then another 15 years to get 2 back to back ones. It's weird, no denying that.

My rambling aside? This is actually a fun and funny installment to the franchise. I haven't laughed as hard since the first one; yet rolled my eyes at plenty of scenes. If you enjoy the Bad Boys saga, this one is fun PAF. Pointless Action Film/Flick. 7/10.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
336,6.0,9 October 2024,"Actually quite surprised by this movie. I was thinking it was going to be overrated and a drawn out movie. Boy, was I wrong. It is probably my favorite movie in this franchise. I would have loved to see Gabriel Union reprise her role in this. But I loved how they intertwined all of the other 3 movies into this one. It was great acting and a enjoyable plot.

Marcus's character was a little over the top but still funny. I wish they would have kept the wife the same but she's a great actress.

Overall this was a surprisingly great movie and gave appropriate nods to previous characters in the franchise.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
337,6.72,9 October 2024,"I had zero expectations for this. The last one was so bad I am surprised I even chanced it; however, I was pleasantly surprised. It is not as good as the first two installments but it has its moments. Martin Lawrence continues to amuse in the his role as the sidekick cop. Will Smith still has box office draw as an action star-he is aging well. The story is ok. There is a formula here. The action and cinematography are ok. The cast is good. The foundation of the film, like all buddy films, is the relationship between the leads. This one still has some miles left on it, despite the aging nature of its stars.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"

Maybe since the franchise already has a history, the plot of the characters is more consistent than in the first, I don't know if it is better than the first movie, but it's better than the second and the third, that's for sure.

A little predictable, yes, because it is actually a comedy, and the plot, as well as the fantastic and not very credible scenes, take a backseat.

If you have already seen the previous three, then my congratulations for holding on, ha ha, especially the third one was quite stinky and smelly, in this they vindicated themselves a bit, and I think it likes it on the same level as the first movie, only to understand it all you have to see the previous three.

Personal opinion: Funny, it's not bad as 2nd and 3rd so it doesn't hurt to take a look at it 7.86.","June 7, 2024 (United States)"
